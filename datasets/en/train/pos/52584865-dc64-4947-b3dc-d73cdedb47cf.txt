If you like any kind of seafood, this is the place for you! The trio-appetizer is amazing. Crawfish and shrimp fondeux, fried alligator (better than I had in NOLA!) and calamari. Next course was lobster bisque, which is easiest the best I've ever had!! I had the stuffed shrimp for dinner and it was perfect. My boyfriend had the Mardi Gras pasta and the sausage in it was the best thing on the table.

I had the sweet potato pecan pie for dessert and I could eat a whole pie of that! The creme brûlée looked awesome, but no one at the table ordered it. That will be for next time. 

I HIGHLY recommend this place if you're craving creole or seafood...or both!! It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it!
