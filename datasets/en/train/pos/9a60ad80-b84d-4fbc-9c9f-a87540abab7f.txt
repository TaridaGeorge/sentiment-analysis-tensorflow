I love this place.  The best Pizza on the north end PERIOD!  They have a great meatball sandwich, and the seafood is so good and fresh.  My wife always orders the muscles in red sauce.  Even the breakfast menue is great.  I hate writting a review about this place because I fear more people will start going there, but it is to good to keep to myself. The location is a little off putting but once you walk through the doors, it is all family.  The service is always warm and friendly.
