We had about 48 hours to plan an event for 500 people. In a pinch, we turned to the Hyatt Regency, and Lori and her team helped streamline all details from catering to AV to working with the City of Phoenix to secure extra parking. 

The venue is perfect for an event/conference - as the lobby is beautiful, the hotel bar/restaurant Networks provides guests with great food, and the layout allows for great conversation and event traffic. 

5 stars!

Thanks,
