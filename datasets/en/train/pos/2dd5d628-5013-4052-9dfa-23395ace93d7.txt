I had a great time here.  I think all the cougar talk is ridiculous. I think if the 40+ crowd like to get out and have fun more power to them. I loved sitting outside and people watching here. The drinks were great, no stingy pours here. The staff was nice, nothing like the uptight uppity Barcelona bouncer group. Good music, good times. I will be back.
