I was looking to get a mani/pedi before a friend's wedding and after reading a few reviews on Yelp decided to check out Laveen Nail. 

What a great choice! The massage chairs during the pedicures are fantastic and very relaxing. I ended up getting the gel nail polish for the manicure which lasted perfectly until the wedding (and about a week after)

The satff was very helpful and efficient. It smelled wonderful in the shop, not at all like the nail salons you find at the mall. The overall ambience was relaxing.
