I went out to eat at Nobuo at the Teeter House a couple days ago, and I'm still thinking about the food. At first, I was a little intimidated by the menu, being that I could barely pronounce anything on it, or recognize half of what anything was. But after just randomly pointing to things on the menu and going with whatever I got, I was amazed. Every dish that came out was better than the last. I like that everything is tapas style, as I didn't leave in a complete food coma. 

I talked to the owner for a few minutes, and he was very kind and interesting. He was talking to us about the different types of vegetables he uses and how they are locally grown. 

This is a perfect date place. I loved it and I would go back over and over again.
