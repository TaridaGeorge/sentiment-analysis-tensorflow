oh contraire stevey p.
FEZ burgers are out of this world!!
chibatta bread
organic mixed greens 
grilled to perfection.
i strongly recommend the bleu cheese burger. yumm
unlike most places, fez burgers come with a salad,
not greasy french fries.
but their garlic fries are to die for.
WARNING: 
breath from garlic fries may kill small animals and children
martinis are ohh so good.
i've never had to wait for service here.
staff is friendly.
i love you fez.
