Best burger in town without a doubt. Flavorful - super beefy, juicy, and delicious! 

You see a lot of gourmet burger places opening up all over town, but, none of them hold a candle to this place. The prices are on the upper end but, reasonable (e.g. about $16/plate) 

The grounds are beautiful and great to walk after dinner. Possibly up the the ice cream shop in the main building?? (their strawberry iced cream is home made and beyond delicious!)
