I was down in Arizona for a dental seminar. After a long day,, My friends and I decided to hit the mall(Mekong Plaza), Luckily, We ran into a newly opened Filipino/Hawaiian Resto. This place is a "MUST" try.  The food was EXCELLENT, YUMMY and the servings were HUGE!!!!  But most of all "GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE"  I can only wish we have something like this kind of "Mom and Pop" resto in northern cali.  We had a great experience and I "HIGHLY" recommend it.  I promise you will keep coming back for more.  :-)
