The most TV's under one roof anywhere.  This by far is the best sports bar in Phoenix.  Not only do they have a tone of tv's but the food is amazing.  I would go to this place if it had a black and white 19 inch TV just to get the food.  The owners did this place the right way, with the customer in mind!!  I will be a long time customer here till the day i die.
