Phoestivus is a super-fun local holiday market, designed to promote small, locally-owned businesses.  It's held at the Wednesday night downtown Farmer's Market, and this year, expanded to two weeks.  The beer garden was a brilliant addition, and 100% of the profits from it go to support Community Food Connections, the wonderful organization that keeps downtown Phoenix from being a true food desert.  Local brews, local food trucks, local farmers and artists assure that the money you spend will stay here in our community.
