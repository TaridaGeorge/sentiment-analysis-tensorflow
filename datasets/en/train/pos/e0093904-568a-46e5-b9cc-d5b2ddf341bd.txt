Screaming Ant - We played at the Warrior Dash Last year and we are on the bill again this year which is awesome! I love the fact that you can do the obstacles and then when you come out of the mud you go smack dab right into a party.!! I remember this girl that was dancing in front of us and she gave the whole event a feel of Woodstock, and then it all changed because three guys in business suite with brief case covered in mud came by and then it became this surreal event! This year you will be able to camp out at "Dashlands" and from what I hear it will be a weekend to remember!
