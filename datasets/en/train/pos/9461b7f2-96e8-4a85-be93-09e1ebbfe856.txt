As another reviewer said,  the staff here is extremely attentive (not in an annoying way) and friendly,   happy to answer any question with a knowledgeable answer.  

The foods are offered in a straightforward fashion,  "this is what it is",  no XTREEME DIET NACHOPUFF MAYHEM PLUS!!! nonsense,  and the prepared foods don't have any surprise ingredients.   

Any time you can get a 3.5lb can of powdered banana pudding, an auto-siphon, 
a first aid kit and a tortilla press in the same place is a good time in my book.
