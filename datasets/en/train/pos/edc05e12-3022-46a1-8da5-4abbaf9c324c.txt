My favorite Phoenix restaurant. Vincent understands customer loyalty and his hospitality and food will bring you back again and again. Often when we travel, my husband and I will remark that Vincent has spoiled us because we compare everything to eating with him. 
If you like goose or duck, he makes it the best. My son loves the short ribs, my daughter loves the ravioli. We all love his pastries and desserts. 
The salmon quesedilla and duck tamales are just a couple of the magnificent French/southwestern fusion foods to knock your socks off. 
GREAT wine selection.
