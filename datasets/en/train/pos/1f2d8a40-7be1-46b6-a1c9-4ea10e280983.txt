This place is great. There's always some interesting new beer on tap. And if youre not in the mood for something new, there's always the cases of bottles w/ your new or old fave. Ive been here when its packed to the gills and when we were the only people there- its always a good time. Plus, they let you bring food in from both Thai Basil and Tessios.

Cant go wrong here.
