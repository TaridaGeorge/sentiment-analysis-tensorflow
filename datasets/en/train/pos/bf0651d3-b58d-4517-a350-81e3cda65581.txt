This location has great service , good food. 'Nuff said. The staff is very friendly , I'm on a first name basis with 5 of the employees.

and also , 

Tabitha R and Renee H are lying sacks of dog ****. I was there when "Tabitha" and her friends were kicked out for breaking the air dryer in the womens bathroom. Renee H threw a drink at one of the employees after having a what seemed Bipolar rant at them , and then took off when someone called the police. I flagged your reviews you c**ks*****g w****s. And if you ever want a piece of me bring it on....
