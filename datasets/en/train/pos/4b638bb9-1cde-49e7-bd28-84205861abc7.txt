When you walk into the restaurant the ambiance is like you have never seen before. Floor to ceiling mirrors and intimate lighting to set the mood. From start to finish your meal is delectable along with quality service. My favorite part of the meal is the Caesar Salad. Its the best Caesar Salad I have ever had and I have had some outstanding salads from coast to coast!
