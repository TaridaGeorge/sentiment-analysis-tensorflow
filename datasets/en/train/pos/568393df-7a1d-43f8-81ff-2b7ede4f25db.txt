I can't speak highly enough of the folks over at Carlife.  They are all very helpful, ethical and professional to work with.    They take the time to explain the problems and show you what the issues are.  They were then able to work with me presenting all the options available to repair the problems and working with me to choose the most affordable solution.  They certainly went above and beyond to accommodate me during the repair process.  I received the highest level of personal attention (including a free shuttle to my office) from them compared to any repair shop I have worked with past.  I would highly recommend them.
