I actually ate at the one that is located in Chandler Fashion Square. It's a bright, friendly atmosphere. The prices are reasonable, and the food is delicious! You can get the full dinners if you are hungry enough, but they even have pita sandwiches alone for reasonable prices. The Gyro meat is excellent. Be sure to also have the flaming saganaki for an appetizer!  OPA!!!!
