I love pizza, and I've tried pizza all over the valley (including the famed Pizzaria Bianco), but I am yet to find a place I like better than La Grande Orange.  The crust is flavorful and crispy and the toppings are exotic and delicious.

The roasted corn is my topping of choice.  Their specialty salads are phenomenally good as well.  With Gelato and a grocery next door, it makes for a complete evening.

Spend the evening eating pizza, then come back for breakfast the next morning.
