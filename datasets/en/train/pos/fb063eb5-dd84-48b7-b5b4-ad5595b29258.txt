There is really nothing I can add that hasn't already been said. This is the only place we go to for our smoothie fix.  We have been coming here since they opened and my 6 year old asks for it by name.  They really are better than those other places.   All the drinks have always tasted awesome and with fresh tasting ingredients.  The owners are super nice and always try to engage in conversation with everyone.  We love you, Inta Juice!  :)
