Beautiful venue. Quaint, casual and intimate. The food was served buffet stye and was great. Pork tenderloin with apple chutney, chicken, two types of salads and bread were served. Very simple menu but it worked well. The staff was polite and extremely courteous. Great place for a semi-small wedding.
