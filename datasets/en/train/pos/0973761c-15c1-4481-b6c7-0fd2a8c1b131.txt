Ok, by far the BEST yoga studio in Arizona! I am an avid cardio lover and was a spinning instructor so I know a good workout. Sumit's Yoga is a great complement to any type of cardio or also a great workout on its own. Sumit is great and really makes the studio. I will be doing yoga with Sumit for many, many years.
