I visited the restaurant on November 14, 2010, while leading a group for the Arizona Bicycle Club Sunday morning breakfast ride.

My food was very good, but wasn't exactly as I ordered it. When I spoke to the manager, he went far above and beyond what was expected to ensure satisfaction for the visit.
