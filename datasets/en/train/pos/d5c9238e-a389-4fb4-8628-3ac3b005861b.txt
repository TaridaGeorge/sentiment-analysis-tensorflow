I am addicted to Anthropologie. I love absolutely everything about this place. I also love that I don't have to drive to Scottsdale to shop there. 

The staff is always very accommodating. I shop a lot online and have to return things occasionally. When I bring it into the store, they don't require the receipt or even tags to return! They are very helpful and give great styling tips! 

I suppose the only downfall would be the price but I think it's totally worth it. Their clothing is so unique and you know there won't be a ton of girls with the same top or dress as you. 

Anthropologie has a fan for life!
