Wow, this place is breathtaking.  From the waterfall on the inside to the great view on the outside, I felt as though everything was well kept.  Parking was easy and plentiful.  While I didn't eat at any of the restaurants, the food look very appetizing and I would like to dine at one during my next visit.  The shops were fun, too.
