I found my dog when she was a stray, and she had major issues with people she didn't know.  I started taking her to Fido's and now Bella has become a well-adjusted, fairy friendly dog.  I give Fido's all the credit.  Not only does she get to play with dogs all day, she gets to cuddle with the employees and work on her social skills!  When she comes home, she's practically in a coma for a day because she's so tired.  
I trust the employees and owners with her all day, and when I'm going out of town.  You just can't find any place like it.
