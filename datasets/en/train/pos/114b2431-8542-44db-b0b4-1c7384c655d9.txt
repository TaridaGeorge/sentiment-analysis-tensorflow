I've had a massage at a Massage Envy before, went to Park West location because I had Yelp Vouchers that I wanted to use before they expired. I attended Yelp PleyDate in April, that's where I received these massage vouchers.

It was an easy appointment set-up, I was greeted kindly & quickly. I was given a cold cup of water & went over paperwork so they could get to know what I needed for my massage. My massage therapist Alberto took care of the knots in my neck & shoulders that were killing me all week. I highly recommend the Park West Massage Envy!

I plan to join the membership & try it out for a 6 month, it seems well worth it considering I usually get a massage every other month.
