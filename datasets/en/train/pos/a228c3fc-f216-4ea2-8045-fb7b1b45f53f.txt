My sister introduced us to Joe's Farm Grill, it's right by her house.  We've been here for breakfast and dinner and the food is delish!  What makes it so great is that everything they make is fresh from their farm, the restaurant sits on the actual farm.  Everything on the menu is good, my favorite is the Fontina Burger and when I order it with the beet salad instead of fries.  I also love their sweet potato fries and their breakfast is also great.  The prices and serving sizes are reasonable you never leave this place feeling stuffed and heavy.  I highly recommend it!!
