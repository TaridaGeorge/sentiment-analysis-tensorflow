This is one of the newer life style Safeways! Very upscale feel with out the high cost! Store has organic products, cheese bar, pharmacy, full deli, full bakery, full meat and seafood counters, gelato bar, sandwich station, pizza Station, nut bar, very large wine department! This place has it all! 

I shop here all the time and this store has some of the most friendly employees! Always willing to sample products and they give great advise! 

If you get a chance, try the Pizza, Sandwiches or Gelato bar! The food is really great and much better then a fast food restaurant!
