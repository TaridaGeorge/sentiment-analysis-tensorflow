I came across this business while browsing through yelp and I'm damn near convinced they make heaven in a cup :)

I bought some of the vanilla creme brulee for a family dinner and every single person who ate it had one word: "W O W!"

The owner of the company was very easy to work with and I was able to place my order through email. We can't wait to try the other flavors!
