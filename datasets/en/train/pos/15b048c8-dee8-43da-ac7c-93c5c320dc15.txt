If you are looking for a way to help out your fellow man this year, Andre House is a great place to start. I have volunteered here on average once a month over the past year and I hope to continue. It is hard work. Like 4-5 hours of straight hustle and bustle; but it is so rewarding! Call down there or sign up online, they are always in need of a few extra hands but you cannot just drop in. Good luck! And Happy New Year!
