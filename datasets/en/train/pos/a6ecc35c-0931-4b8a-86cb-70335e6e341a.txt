We had a wonderful meal at Tum Nak Thai. The service was very friendly and very fast! We enjoyed the wonton soup, pineapple fried rice, an amazing dish with peanut sauce and finished with homemade coconut ice cream. We also tried the thai tea and loved it. All of the food was terrific and I'd highly recommend this authentic, family-run place to anyone.  Seating is limited, so make sure to get there early, before the crowds.
