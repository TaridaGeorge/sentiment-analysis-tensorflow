Just moved near by and had to check this place out.

We were sad to leave the area near Tokyo Lobby in Glendale which had great sushi but Yellowtail will be the new spot for us.

Service -
          We felt like we were friends at the restaurant not just customers.  Service was great!

Food was as good as it gets -
         We had the Teppan Chicken and it was just as good if not better than the many teppanyaki places around town.  You don't get the fun show but the food is VERY tasty!  We also tried the White Tuna sushi and OMG roll.  Both were gone in minuets.

Atmosphere -  
          The atmosphere was the perfect blend between Fancy Sit Down and Family Friendly.

We will be back very soon to our new local sushi sopt!
