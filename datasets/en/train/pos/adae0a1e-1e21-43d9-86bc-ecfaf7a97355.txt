Had I only known how good the all-you-can-eat salad would be, I'd have made that my meal. It was sooo delicious, and I am used to eating high-end meals (I work in a 5 star place). I ordered the Chicken Marsala, which was better than average/ok, but my friend ordered the Chicken Piccata which I have to say was the best I have ever had. Extremely flavorful. 

True, it is a boisterous place, so if you are looking for quiet ambience you should go elsewhere. But if you are out to have fun with your friends...RigaTony's is a great spot! Great food, lots of fun!
