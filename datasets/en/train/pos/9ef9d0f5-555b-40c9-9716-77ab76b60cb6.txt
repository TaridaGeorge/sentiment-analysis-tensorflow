This place has great food and even better prices! I have had everything from breakfast to sandwiches to salads and soups - all the items I have had are very tasty. And you definitely cannot beat the prices. 

Although the order line can get long at times, the service is very good and the manager is always rushing to get customers their food. 

This is one of my go to places for lunch!
