Last night was our first time at New India. I came in with four other friends. One of us is gluten-intolerant, and the rest are vegetarians. This is a WONDERLAND for anyone with vegetarian tendencies, though they also have a meat menu for the carnivores.

I had the palak paneer. The dinner ($12) comes with rice, curried vegetables, salad, raiti (yogurt), naan and a pickled side and a dessert. It's enough to have 2-3x leftovers. 

The food is delicious. If you love Indian food, but only can afford the buffet during lunch at most places... you'll love it here. It's affordable, genuine, and ridiculously good. I'm coming back!
