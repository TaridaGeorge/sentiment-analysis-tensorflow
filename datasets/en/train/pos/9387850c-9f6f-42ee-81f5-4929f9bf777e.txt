The Simple Farm has been a blessing to our neighborhood and to the local farm movement.  It simply doesn't get any fresher or any better. Thank you to Lylah and Michael and to farm manager Anita and to our beautiful wonderful goats - Lavender, Miss Storm, Sweet Marie and Baby Ani for enriching our lives and help us in our quest to  improve our health.  I love watching The Simple Garden grow.
