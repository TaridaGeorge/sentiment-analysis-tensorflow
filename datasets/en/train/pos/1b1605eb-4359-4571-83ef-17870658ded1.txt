This place rocks! I go to a lot of boba places around the valley and this one is one of my favorites! What gets my 5 stars is the CHEAP PRICE and the MANY FLAVOR SELECTIONS TO CHOOSE FROM! A nice little area to wait while your drinks are being made. Flat screen TV, music and friendly staff. Also, this place doesn't just sell you boba drinks... but they offer small plated food as well and it's pretty good for the price too! A must stop after grocery shopping at Lee Lee Market in that same plaza. My usual flavor of boba tea: taro with boba & lychee bits, or just the honeydew with boba too, of course!
