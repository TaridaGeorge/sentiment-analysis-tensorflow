I have so many wonderful things to say about this place and not enough time. I am from the wonderful city of Chicago and let me tell you, I've had my fair share of AMAZING Italian food and this place fits right in.
The Casella family is welcoming and insanely friendly. I had great conversation while waiting for my beef. This very adorable family owned restaurant not only offers fabulous customer service but there Italian Beef was outstanding. The best I've had in the valley. I have been searching all over Phoenix for a Italian joint like this and I've finally found it. I have not yet tried other items on the menu but if they are as great as the Italian Beef, I'll be spending a lot of my time and money here. 



Kudos to the Casella family for a fabulous run restaurant with great food!
