This foodie thinks it's well worth the drive from North Scottsdale to Downtown Chandler for a refreshing paletas.  All their flavors are unique but my favorites would have to be the Key Lime Pie, Mexican Hot Chocolate and Strawberry Cream.  My dog was also in frozen treat heaven, he ate the chicken flavored puppy paleta so fast I was afraid he'd get brain freeze!  A local business definitely worth checking out!
