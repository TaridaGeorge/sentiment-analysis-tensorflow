We walked into this store with my friend's dog in order to give her a bath and I must say the place is wonderful!  The store has everything you could possibly find for your pup.  
The staff is fabulous and they were very friendly, going out of their way to help.  
The self service dog washing tub is great and we actually enjoyed giving "Mooshie Face" a bath. She's so cute!
