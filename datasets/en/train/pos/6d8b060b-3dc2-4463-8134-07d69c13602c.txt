This is, hands down, the best place in town to get a Chicago dog. I've been going there for nearly 10 years now. I always order the hot dog because it reminds me of being at home in Illinois. They're just perfect. 
Every Friday the owner of the company I work for springs for lunch for all 30 employees and today I had the pleasure of picking our order up from Bob, Chicago's owner. He's a real sweetie. We just had the best sliders, fries and onion rings for the office. 5 stars. Anyone looking for good food on the cheap, great service and the Cubbies or Bears on the TV..this is where you need to be.
