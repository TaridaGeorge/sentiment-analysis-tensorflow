What an Amazing Ballpark!!.....any park that has both a Salty Senoirita and a Cold Stone Creamery is Aces in my book!  Lots of extras...like the free suntan lotion dispensers, plenty of seats in the shade or  on the amazingly soft grass in the outfield seating lawn.......1 Note, Park in the centerfield parking lot as the front lot is not yet paved if you want to keep your car clean......
