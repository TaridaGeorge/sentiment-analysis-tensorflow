Bashir is the master of my hair. He never fails to make me feel confident about my hair cuts and gives me the warm and fuzzies when I emerge a new person.

Ming Tam rocks my eyebrows like nothing I've ever experienced. Seriously, what she managed to sculpt out of my brows deserves a medal.

I seriously love this place!
