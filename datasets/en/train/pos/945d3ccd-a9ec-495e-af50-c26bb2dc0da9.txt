So good!

We stopped in last night, joking that we'd kill two birds with one stone, getting tipsy off our food (gotta be efficient with all the holiday bustle!)

The ice cream was SO GOOD. We had the Black Russian Kahlua, Jack Daniels Zebra and Salted Caramel Cognac.It was all delicious. They even give you little waffle cone slices that are so light and sugary and crunchy.. mmm.
This is the real deal, btw - they ID you and everything, and a pregnant lady was warned away from the booze-infused flavors.

To top it off, the girl at the counter was soooooo nice. She explained how it's made, let us try 2 or 3 flavors each, gave us punch cards, joked around, etc etc. It was so refreshing to have friendly help in a store like this (usually staffed by gum-snapping, bored teenagers).
