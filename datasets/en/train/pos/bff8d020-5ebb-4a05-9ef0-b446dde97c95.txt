ZAP~! 

I had a serious electrical problem caused by my stove.  I was seeing sparks when I plugged my stove in at the outlet and the main power box.

They sent out a guy promptly.  The guy was PROFESSIONAL, THOROUGH, HONEST, and FRIENDLY.

He explained everything he did, and showed me what caused the problem and how to prevent it in the future.  He checked my outlet, main house wiring, and cleaned up/tightened up wherever he checked.

Turned out the previous stove owner had made repairs to some wires inside the stove, and left it in a state of extreme fire hazard.  Hadn't even bother to tighten the screws all the way holding the wires.  House fires have been caused from the same problem.  

He offered me a few options, and the final cost was reasonable.
