i love this Yogurtland due to its proximity to home and school as well as the price. Yes, I know Mojo's is closer to ASU, given it's on Mill, but this place is cheaper than Mojo's and I do love the flavors they offer and their toppings. I always have to be on the look out for my favorite, pomegranate raspberry tart, which I usually mix in with some other flavor I feel like. And then I top it off with my strawberries, almonds, yogurt chips and sprinkles. All of which costs me like $4! I love it! I love this place. And I've tried different places, but this is still my fave.
