I heart 'Summer Rain' only if we can get some here in the valley.
Summer Rain (white wine) is the prefect sitting by the pool sat. afternoon on a hot July day in AZ.
It's fruity, but not too sweet.  I fell in love at the first taste.
They also have a nice light refreshing red name Ruby.  She is like the twin sister of Summer Rain, but a red head.


Thanks Cory Whalin for letting me bug you all day at Devoured.
