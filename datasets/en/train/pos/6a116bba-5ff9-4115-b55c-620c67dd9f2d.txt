This place has a modern look and feel to it.  LCD screen shows each flavor of yogurt right above the dispenser.  Cool!  The place is clean with all flavors offered against wall and flavors and toppings in the middle of the store.  The flavors including bubble gum, velvet cake and simply scrumptious.  I like to mix and match the flavors and come up with a variety of tastes.  The toppings include caramel, sprinkles, fruits, etc.
There is plenty of room to sit and enjoy your yogurt.  In addition, the seating is far enough away from the yogurt dispensers and topping to allow a comfortable experience.
I cannot wait to try the new store near Tatum and Shea - closer to my house.
At $0.39 per ounce, an inexpensive and tasty delight!
