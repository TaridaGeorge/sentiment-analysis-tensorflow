Mesa Arts Center is a treasure.  Consistently the best performing arts center in the Phoenix Metro area.  As a member the last 4 or 5 years, I've seen 30+ shows, and I always enjoy the facilities.  The Ikeda theater is one of the most beautiful I've ever been in and is in a completely different class than, say, Scottsdale or Chandler's centers for the arts.  (note:  I haven't yet been to the Tempe Center for the Performing Arts).
