WOW!  What a great little sandwich shop!  Tried for days to get my wife there for lunch. Finally she consented. Well, she wasn't disappointed.  We usually split a sandwich, which was plenty for each, plus a side of quite good pasta salad. You get a side with your sandwich, so the cost was quite reasonable for 2. We saw Apple Crisp in the pastry cabinet, so split one of those as well.
Bread was fresh, oversize slices. Wonderful 'house spread' on the sandwich (delicious, the wife says) lettuce, tomato, red onion, pickle on the side. Really good.  Sorry we didn't try it sooner, will make a point of going back before we leave town for the next winter destination.
