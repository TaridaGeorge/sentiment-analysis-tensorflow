Seriously? I can't believe how good this place is. The atmosphere is great, although very dressy. The food will blow you away and is pretty high end. A little on the expensive side, but you get what you pay for with this place. The way it is designed is really sweet and makes it easy to spend a lot of time in there. The bar is pretty cool and kinda curves around the center of the place. This is one of the top places to eat in Scotsdale, or Arizona for that matter
