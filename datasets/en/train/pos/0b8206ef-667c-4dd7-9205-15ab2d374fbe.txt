We have been taking our dogs here for 3+ years now.  We have seen both vets and they are both wonderful with our dogs.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  They are reasonably priced as well.  I even had to bring one of my dogs here in an emergency situation and they could not have handled it any better.
