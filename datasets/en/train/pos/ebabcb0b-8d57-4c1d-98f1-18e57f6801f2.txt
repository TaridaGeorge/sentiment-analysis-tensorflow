i dream about this place...in fact my stomach is growling just thinking about it. been here a few times, always down to try something new each time. however, my heart belongs to the eddie lopez burger. i've yet to get down on the cheese curds, the fries are tasty as well as the onion rings. the kids and i spend at least a good 15 minutes perusing the soda selection. this place makes me happy, so very very happy. i just wish i didn't live so bloody far...
