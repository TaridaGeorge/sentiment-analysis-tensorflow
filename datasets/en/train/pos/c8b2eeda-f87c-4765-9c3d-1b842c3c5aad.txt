Why 5 stars?

Price to quality of the food ratio is excellent: Don't expect to die of food joy, but you will come away happy and your wallet will still have some money in it.

Service is uniformly both friendly and accurate, without being overly attentive and hovering.

The "YEAH TEXAS" theme is a bit much, but what can you expect with the name?

The only thing that I totally HATE about the restaurant is the country music. I've been told that it's corporate policy to pipe that stuff in. If you ask, however, they will turn it down to a more ignore-able level.
