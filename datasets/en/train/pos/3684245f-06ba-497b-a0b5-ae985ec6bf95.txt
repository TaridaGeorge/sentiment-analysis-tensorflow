Before heading to Scottsdale, the boy asked if there was any restaurant I really wanted to try and Petite Maison was my request. He made reservations for 8:30 on a weekend night and we sat outside on the patio. The decor is very quaint, charming and romantic. Our waiter was very friendly and accommodating. 

I had a delicious cucumber martini that was refreshing on the warm night. We started with steak tartare which was one of the best steak tartares I've had. He had the salmon which he thoroughly enjoyed and I had the steak frites which were amazing. The frites were addictive and the steak was cooked just the way I like it-bleeding. We ended our meal with a yummy chocolate creme brulee which did not disappoint. And creme brulee is my favorite dessert. so I'm a pretty tough critic on that.
