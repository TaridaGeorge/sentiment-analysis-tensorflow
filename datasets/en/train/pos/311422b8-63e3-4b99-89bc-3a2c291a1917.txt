Nicest track in the area. Older than Yavapai but better kept, and not a dump like Rillito. The clubhouse area is clean and comfortable. Lots of food and drink selections. The in-field is beautifully landscaped, and it has a turf track in addition to the dirt track. This is a great place to spend a few hours.
