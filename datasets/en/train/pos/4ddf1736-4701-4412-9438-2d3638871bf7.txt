I've lived in Phoenix for 16 years and just visited the Phoenix Art Museum for the first time last week.  What a huge mistake (my haste, not the museum)!  This place is amazing; beautiful building, gorgeous grounds and massive in size.  The modern/contemporary section was my favorite by a mile, with a collection easily on par with other museums I've been to worldwide.  I can't wait to go back and see what I missed! A+++
