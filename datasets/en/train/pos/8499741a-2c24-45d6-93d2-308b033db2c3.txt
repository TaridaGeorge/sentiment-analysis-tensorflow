This review is for the step classes on Wed nights and Sat mornings only. 

Jody is a great step instructor. The class is not your basic, boring step class. She uses the same moves, but in different orders each time, and also adds new moves to the mix each time, as well. Her class kind of reminds me of dance drills or marching band--it's not a bunch of boring "8 on this side--8 on the other side--now 4--now other side, 4--now 2---now 2 on other side--now alternate---" etc.  If you used to like step but think it's sooo out now, give this class a try. It's much different than step of yesteryear, and you may be pleasantly surprised. She even mixed it up one week and gave us a sort-of step bootcamp, where we did step things for our cardio, and used weights in between for a dual workout.
