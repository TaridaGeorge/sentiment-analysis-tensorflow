When you go: try the black bean fritters with avocado dipping sauce---SOOOO GOOD...i could've eaten those for my whole lunch!

Then, my friend and I shared two different dishes: 
the Cuban sandwich (like a panini), which came with the black bean soup and a pork dish that was marinated in lime juice and spices.

Both dishes were really good! i would definitely go back, because EVERYTHING on the menu looked tasty. i wanted to try it all, but alas, my stomach and wallet are only so big.
