Holy crap, this place is fantastic! We went for the first time last night, after friends have been raving about it for weeks. Delicious!

You get to pick as many flavors as you want, with all the toppings you want! Tasty yogurt (current seasonal flavors include eggnog, peppermint, and pumpkin pie) with fresh fruit, mini nutter butters, and sprinkles to your hearts content! 

At 30 cents per oz, it's a total bargain! Add to that, the staff is super nice and answer any questions you have about the random flavors and random toppings. 

Hard not to go back for a repeat experience today...but we'll definitely be going back!
