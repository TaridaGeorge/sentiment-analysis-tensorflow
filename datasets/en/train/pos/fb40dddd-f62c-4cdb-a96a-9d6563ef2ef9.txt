Bertha's is great ! 
Whenever I have a yen for something delicious and healthy this is where I go.  
My current favorite item on their menu is the grilled vegetable Panini - with a delightful mix of grilled asparagus, arugula, zesty dressing and Havarti. It is consistently delicious. 

The other day, I ran into my neighbor at Bertha's, turns out the grilled vegetable panini is her favorite too ! 

(Forgot to mention the staff is wonderful :)
