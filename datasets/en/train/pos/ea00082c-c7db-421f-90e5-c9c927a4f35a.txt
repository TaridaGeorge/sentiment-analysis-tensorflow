Love this place. I first discovered it when it was off Scottsdale Road and had to track them down at their new location off McDowell and 74th Street. We love specialty root beer and this place is great for any kind of specialty sodas. We bought a small keg of Sonoran Brew Root Beer for the kids for a party and they loved it. I haven't been back in some time and I'll have to take the kids and let them go wild in this soda and candy heaven.
