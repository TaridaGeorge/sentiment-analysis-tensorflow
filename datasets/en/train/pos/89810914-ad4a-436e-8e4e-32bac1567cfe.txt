A really great Greek restaurant. There is good variety with the food and everything is so flavorful. The service is really good, they are good about giving you good portions without charging you for each and every sauce you ask for, like some places.
I recommend the gyro, or the chicken shawarma. When I am not so hungry I just order a bunch of pita (which comes fresh and warm) with tzatziki. Their tzatziki is the best around, many places in the valley don't do as good a job. I also really enjoy the salads, with all the feta and such. So delicious.
