5 reasons to go to the vig:

1. it's outdoors w/heating lamps...which is PERFECT for AZ weather in the fall & winter...LOVE IT! 

2. it has a bocce ball court...drinking while chucking heavy balls on grass...LOVE IT! 

3. it has this (heavenly) chocolate brownie dessert...sharing is difficult...LOVE IT! 

4. it's really close to postino's...makes a great night...LOVE IT! 

5. it has the vig rig...which will shuttle your intoxicated self home (running on tips only!)...LOVE IT! 

with those 5 reasons need I say any more?
