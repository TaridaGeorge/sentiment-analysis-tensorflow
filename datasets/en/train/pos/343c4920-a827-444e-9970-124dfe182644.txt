AHHHH-MAZING

Love the sticky buns! Went for brunch last sunday, service was great and food was even better. I had the breakfast burrito and loved every bite of it! Did I mention the cinnamon Sticky BUNS?!?! Sooooo good!

My sister had a delicious mimosa and some steak and eggs benedict dish and cleared her plate as well! She has been before for dinner and said it was great. They serve cinnamon buns at dinner too folks!

Its a fancy country club feeling kind of place but staff was very friendly. I will definitely come back.
