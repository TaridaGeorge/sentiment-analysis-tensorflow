Don't let the zero other customers at 530p or abandonned donut shop looking building deter you from Tasty Thai.  More customers are on their way and the food is awesome.  Their red curry is full of great veggies.  The larb salad-really excellent (altho id like it with more veggies).  The pad thai--a litle sweeter than you might expect, but in the best possible way.  Go.  Eat.  Be happy.
