First off let me start by saying I went to a different Fuddruckers about 5 years ago in Ohio and it was awful... but this one was AMAZING! The burger I got (1/2 pound beef mushroom swiss), and my boyfriend got the Buffalo burger with mushrooms, we also got a side of onion rings and we got it all to go. It was so tasty, flavorful and juicy. Seriously one of the best burgers I've had in a LONG time! The expeditor that was there that evening (Saturday night 10/20/12) I think his name was Eric, was so helpful, friendly and genuine. Thank's for the great service!
