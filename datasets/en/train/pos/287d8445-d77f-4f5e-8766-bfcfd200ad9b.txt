I love this place and order from them regularly. They have never messed up my order and their food is always hot and delicious upon arrival. They give you tons of food for your money too. A combo will feed me twice. I really recommend this place to everyone. The people who work there are super nice too. They offer me water while I wait for my food. And they are always very fast at preparing my food too. Really this is one of my favorite places to go and I always have a positive experience whether I walk in or order by phone. (Must try for vegetarians too!! Try substituting the crab puff for an extra egg roll when ordering a combo. Such good stuff!)
