Love this place! I've been coming here for 2 years. For $39, you get. Mani/pedi combo that includes a hot tea soak, a super long hot stone massage, callus removal, and warm towels afterward. The place is super clean, and the staff is friendly and they are reasonably priced. Can't beat it! Love coming here :)
