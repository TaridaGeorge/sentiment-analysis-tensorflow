What a neat place. We had a lovely girl who was our server, sorry to say i don't remember her name. But, she was great!                                         The menu here is very extensive.   It was hard to know what to choose there was so much. I got the seared Ahi salad and my date got the schewan beef with rice. Both items were really good.   Restaurant was very clean as well as the bathrooms. The place had a great decor as well!  I thought it was a lot of fun and well done. We even sat outside for a little bit after dinner on the front patio. It was really clean (a good thing  since we have had all the dust storms).  Music was playing lighting ,not overwhelming. I will definitely come back here.
