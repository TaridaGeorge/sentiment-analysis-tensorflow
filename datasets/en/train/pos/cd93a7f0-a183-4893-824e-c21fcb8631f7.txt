The food is so fresh and full of flavor.  The fresh steamed vegetables are crisp and bright and offered with most dishes.  The food preparation is a bit slow compared to other small places, but they really seem to put care into preparing a quality dish.  The owner is very friendly and sometimes talks to the customers.  I wish they had a few more kid-friendly dishes that would make it easy for my kids to enjoy the food.  Like a dish with noodles and a sweet sauce and some fresh tofu and veggies on top.
