This is one of my wife's favorite Italian restaurant and that is saying a lot considering we both have been to Italy.  They make a mean burrata that's not on the menu but most of the time you can order it as an appetizer. An entree that you can't miss is the tortellini aurora or as my wife calls them little pillows from heaven in an equally heavenly pink sauce. This isn't the OG so don't expect a never ending pasta or bread sticks. Expect authentic homemade food and a superb wine list in a comfortable atmosphere. Paulo the Chef/Owner is always there and knows the devil is in the details.
