This place is just an all-around great experience.  Friendly and welcoming with a fun atmosphere and terrific food.  Went with my husband and sat at the bar as there were no tables left.  But this turned out to be a good thing as it allowed us to chat with the owners.  We ended up staying all evening (no wonder there's never an empty table) talking to the family and listening to the accordion player.  I had the rouladen (special) and it was fantastic, as was the apple strudel dessert.
