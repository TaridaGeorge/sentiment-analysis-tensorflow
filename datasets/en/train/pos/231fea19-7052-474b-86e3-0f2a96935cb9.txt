T. Cook's is a gem in the Royal Palms Hotel. We recently stayed at the Royal Palms, (which deserves its own review) for a week and dined at T. Cook's 4 times! Once for lunch, three times for dinner, including Christmas which was excellent despite the busy the dining room.

The setting, both indoors and out is charming. The food was great and we had the best paella since visiting Spain.  Chef Lee treated us royally. We can't wait to get back to Phoenix to return to T. Cook's.
