Best place in town...my family's favorite. From the peanut shells on the floor to the country music blaring, we love it. And don't forget the yummy fresh bread, bowl full of peanuts and great looking waiters! If you want good food for an affordable price, you can't go wrong at Texas, unless of course you're allergic to nuts. Then, I'm sorry my friend, you're just pure out of luck.
