Best Pita joint I have been to!! They don't use frozen pre-seasoned pita meat, their chicken shawerma is outstanding and the staff is always so friendly and willing to let you try something before you decided to order it. Even the owner works the counter just to make sure all of the customers are happy. I will continue to eat here for years to come!! They really hit a homerun at this store!!
