Udupi is by far the best Indian food in town. It is all vegetarian and has many vegan options that are scrumptious. My favorite night out involves Chili Gobi (breaded cauliflower in spicy red sauce) and Chana Batura (saucy chick peas with GIANT puffy bread). So so good. Their buffet is good too but I prefer going for dinner.
