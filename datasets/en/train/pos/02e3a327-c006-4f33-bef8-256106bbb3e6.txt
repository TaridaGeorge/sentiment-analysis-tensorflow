We've been using this Valvoline location for quite some time now. I think the main reason is that they are so quick. I don't think they are the cheapest, but they always mail a reminder postcard for $5-$7 off, which is nice. The lobby is small, but they offer complimentary coffee from their Keurig machine and bottled water. The magazine selection is decent, too. The employees are friendly and helpful. The first time we brought my husband's 4Runner in, they made sure to tell us that the skid plate was missing a couple bolts that must not have been put back on wherever we previously had work done. We purchased the necessary bolts at a Toyota dealer and the next time we were in, they were glad to install them. It's the little things that make me a repeat customer.
