I can probably just give 5 stars just for the Stetson Chopped Salad. And the Wild Boar Meatballs with the delicious cream sauce. And the fabulously fatty Berkshire Pork Belly.

We also ordered the Cheeky Porky, but I found the pork cheek meat to be a little bit on the dry side. But, the accompanying pancakes were good, along with the sauce that topped it.

Our waiter was attentive. We had a table along the windows which provided a great view for people watching.

Great place to dine, if you're ever in the downtown Scottsdale area.
