We had just bought a house and I wanted to celebrate. i wanted something slick, hip, cool and crazy tasty. I picked NOCA. I picked well, they did not disappoint. It was hip, cool and better than crazy tasty. I thought about abandoning the new home and moving in..Yes, the wine, the appetizers and the food was simply that good. 

We sat at the bar and watched the sous chefs cook away and loved it. I found myself telling my espousa - OMG, can you get over how good this is and eating with a stupid smile between bites. Go, eat, smile and do not think about moving my cot, I will be back.
