They have the best cat fish I have ever had (in phoenix area)! 
The Crawfish etoffe was not as amazing but wasn't bad either. 
My friend ordered the special of the day, "Smothered Pork Chop," and couldn't be happier with his dinner! The portion was really good, and the fruit salad slightly warmed/sauteed with Bourbon gave fruit salad a new sensation. 
I can't wait to visit this place again soon!
