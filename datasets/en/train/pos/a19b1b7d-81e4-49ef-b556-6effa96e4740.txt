This place is Great! The Portions are large to say the least. I ordered the Gyro platter and was very happy with the quality of the food that came out. It even came with a side salad that was a nice appetizer. The staff was very friendly and told me what i need to order for my first time there. I was very satisfied and had leftovers to satisfy my hunger again :)
