A Friday night must!  Awesome beverages and lovin' the open mic night!  The owner really makes a big effort to welcome and get to know every patron.  The mocha was perfect and the pastries look fantastic, should have taken one to go.  I think they said the coffee beans they use are all organic (not sure).  I The place has a very comfortable feel about it, big plush sofas accommodate larger groups.  Come by next Friday night you won't be disappointed.
