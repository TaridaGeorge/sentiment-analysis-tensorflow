Oh, man, this place is the best and gives me a cream and richness induced stomach ache afterward every time.  But it's so worth it.  Bread is the best around.  Sandwiches are packed with deliciousness.  Soups are fantastic.  Salads are  super tasty.  I could eat here everyday if it wasn't for the all the diarrhea.
