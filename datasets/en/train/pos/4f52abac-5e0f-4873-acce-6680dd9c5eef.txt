We've been want to go for breakfast for some time.  Sat outside with my wife and chihuahua at this dog friendly restaurant.   Staff brought a dog bowl with water.   Service was very friendly and timely.   I had the Baja omelet with egg white - yummy.  Wife enjoyed the Perk Scramble.  Very pleasant experience.  We may become regulars : )
