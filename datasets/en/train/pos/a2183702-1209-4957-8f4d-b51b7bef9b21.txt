In a city full of chain coffee shops it's nice to find this gem tucked away inside a dull strip mall. 

It's a small place but laid out in such a way that allows for a good numbers of tables and a couch area. The atmosphere is laid-back and comfortable and the people working behind the counter are friendly.

I can't speak to the coffee section but they have a decent loose-leaf tea selection and they will make it iced or hot.

The only thing I found lacking was a selection of snacks. Sometimes it's nice to grab a muffin or a cookie when you're hanging out.

If you're looking for a good alternative to Starbucks or just want a place to hang out and read or study, Solo Cafe is an excellent option.
