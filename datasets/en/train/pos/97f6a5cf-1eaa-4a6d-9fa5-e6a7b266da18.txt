This place is great. In the midst of Mill's junk food, they have some really tasty options that they change each day. I had half a chipotle wrap and a bean salad with sweet potato that were both delicious. They're newly opened, welcoming and nice. Also, the outside patio is within that little courtyard and is a nice place to sit outside when its cool enough.
