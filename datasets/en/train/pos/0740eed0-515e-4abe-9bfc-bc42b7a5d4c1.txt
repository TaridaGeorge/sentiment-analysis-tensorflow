I don't play golf. I know the furthest thing about golf (I learned while here!)...

But I came here for a charity event (representing the charity) and had a blast. Everyone here is so kind, friendly and welcoming. I cannot say enough good things about them! 

There is a sheriffs office really close as well so there were signs to watch speeding, it was cute :-)

If I ever take up golf, I will definitely come. In the meantime, I will just recommend this wonderful place solely on account of their staff and the fact they support various charities which makes me think their work ethic is on par as well :-)
