food is always good! im a fan of their wings, and happy hour!  they have sleepy dog red rover on tap and the servers are always ready to help with anything!  burgers are huge, so when i order one i expect to have leftovers, i was unsure at first because of the price, but soon realized that the portions, service, and quality all made it a smokin deal! not to mention, they always have deals on here and groupon that make it even more affordable!
