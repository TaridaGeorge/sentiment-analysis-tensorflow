What sets Hava Java apart from the rest of the coffee shops in town is the amazing service you'll get there.  I recently returned to Phoenix after spending a few years in Oregon and when I stopped into Hava Java, not only did I recognize the barista behind the counter, but she recognized me, too.  That is pretty impressive after a couple years.  After talking with her for a while, it turns out that the owner takes really good care of his employees (full benefits, etc.) and they have very little turnover there.  She said that they have only lost one person since I have been away.  That is impressive for a coffee shop.  

Their espresso is pretty good and according to my wife, their tea is the best she's had in town.  It is the best place for coffee that I know of in the area.
