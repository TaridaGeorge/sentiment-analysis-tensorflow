so Friday night was the first time i have ever tasted the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco..while they only had two types of pizza out for samples...a Margarita type pizza and a sausage and carmelized onion pizza..the lady said it had a name..i thought she was joking..and quickly forgot what it was... the sausage was full of fennel flavor and i thought it was awesome. 

i was totally stoked to see that pizzeria bianco was open during the NBA All Star game Tip Off Party at Heritage Square.


now i gotta find time to actually have a sit down dinner here. i totally believe the hype.

i also heard that the Pizza oven at the AJ's on Camelback and Central was built by Bianco...true?
