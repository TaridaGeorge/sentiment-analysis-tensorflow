I love Sens. So. So. Much. 

One of the wait staff offered to stalk me. I told her I live two blocks away.  Surprise me. 

The Hot and Dirty is Arizona's best cocktail. Hands fucking down. 

The tofu is simply amazing. Wasabi. Make sure you get the first bite. 

I like the blue lighting under the bar. Reminds me of the florescent lights I want to put under my Prius. 

I'm a wham bam thank you ma'am kinda guy but that bathroom ALMOST makes me want to make sweet sweet love. 

Mr. Chu is the man. I love that he loves his creation so much.
