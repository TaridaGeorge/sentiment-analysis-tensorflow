It took us an hour-and-a-half to get into Scottsdale's Buca di Beppo.  And this was right after a Giants game in spring training (March).

I think one of the problems was that there are very few tables for two.  There are tables for four, tables for six or eight aplenty.  This is a family restaurant.

You know something?  It was worth it.  Absolutely incredible meal, and very friendly service.  Just a wonderful experience.  Except for the waiting part.
