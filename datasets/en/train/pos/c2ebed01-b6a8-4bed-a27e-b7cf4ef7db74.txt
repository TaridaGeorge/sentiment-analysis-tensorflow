Anytime I feel like some good Italian food our family heads to RigaTony's. The antipasto salad to start off your meal is amazing and the warm fresh baked ciabatta bread, we just cant get enough. The Capellini Checca is my favorite dish by far, especially when you are looking for something different then the basic Italian food. On my last visit I was even told the story of how the drink the Eleanor had come to be, and it was definitely worth putting on the menu, We have never gotten anything but outstanding service, and whenever friends and family come to town RigaTony's is always my recommendation.
