Sometimes you pick coffee shops because of their menu, sometimes because of their location, and sometimes it's for atmosphere. Solo has the appeal of great atmosphere is significantly farther along that category than other shops. Cozy church pews, older looking upholstered chairs and couches (reminding you of something from alice 'n wonderland), and even swedish furniture are all part of an odd mix that comes together comfortably well. They cycle in local art on the walls and do an excellent job with lighting such that you feel very cozy inside the shop. It's spacious and there's plenty of seating inside and on the patio, and towering bookshelves filled with a wide range of books and odd knick-knacks. The menu is outstanding for coffee and tea lovers alike and the workers there are very friendly and willing to make recommendations for you too.
