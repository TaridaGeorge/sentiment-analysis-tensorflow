I visited The Grind on a Thursday a little before noon. We had no problem getting a table right away. The service was great, we were in and out on our own timeline, not theirs. 

I ordered the "Grilled portobello sandwich / fried zucchini, ricotta salata, wild arugula / $10" and "Half and half fries / $5" (half sweet potato/hald herbed fries), and water. I was disappointed that fries do not come with the burgers, but I know that their product is supposed to be supreme, so it comes at an extra cost.

The burger was amazing! I have never had a better mushroom burger-it was somehow juicy! I would order it again in a heartbeat. The fries were good, the sweet potato fries were my favorite.

The servers were really nice and checked on us several times. 

I will definitely return here in the future!
