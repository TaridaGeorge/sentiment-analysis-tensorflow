Umm...YUM! Short Leash is, so far, my favorite food truck and my favorite hot dog in Phoenix!

My favorite is the lady, but I do often try their weekly specials. The owner is always super nice, the food is great and affordable. I suggest that you follow them on twitter and find them at a location near you!
