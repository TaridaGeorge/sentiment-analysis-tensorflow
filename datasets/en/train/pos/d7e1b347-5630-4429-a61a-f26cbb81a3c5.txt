I haven't had better pho anywhere in az. the large pho is enormous for the price. i usually go with my family and order a regular sized pho for myself and a number 45 (beef/rice plate) to share with another person. the one down side of this place is that it's located in a little more run down area and the restaurant's cleanliness isn't that great. nonetheless, their food makes up for it. i would definitely recommend this place.
