Great range of pasty choices on the menu. Cool, friendly staff. Make sure you don't sit in the back as service there is a bit slower. Guinness on tap (amongst others). 

I have to come back a few more times to try a few other pasties. The oggie is tasty. Id like to try the royale with cheese.

Pasties are "Cornish", not "Finnish". Subtley different than what I'm used to but delicious nonetheless.
