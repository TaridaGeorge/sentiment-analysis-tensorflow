I have never had a bad time at Bliss/reBAR. There is always upbeat fun music playing and great specials for brunch. 

I have visited only 3 times which is not cool because I live fairly close. This is a place that I have definitely neglected. I have been for brunch and my favorite part was getting a little jar of jam for my toast. Also... awesome mimosa deals. I have also been with a big group and the staff seemed to handle it well. There was not a glitch in the service whatsoever. 

I also love the atmosphere in the bar. The decor is very cool and interesting to look at. 

I will definitely be planning an upcoming Friday happy hour at this location.
