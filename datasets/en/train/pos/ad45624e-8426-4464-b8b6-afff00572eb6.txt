Strongbow! Strongbow! Strongbow! Enough said...

Well not really. I would like to thank the Managers at The Vig Uptown for allowing the Phoenix Social Club to ram pack the Sunday Funday last month. The wait staff was more then welcoming. When some of the tables were moved by the attendies the wait staff worked around it to make the event peaceful.

The specials that were offered the day of the Social Club event were appreciated.
