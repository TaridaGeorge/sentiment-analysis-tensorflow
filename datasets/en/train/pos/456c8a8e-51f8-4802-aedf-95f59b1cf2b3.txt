Love this place - have been a couple of times now.  Staff are super friendly.  They have a great happy hour (3-6).  It is the best grilled cheese I have ever tasted.  Their buffalo slider is good too (I normally get 2 sliders), but they have a variety of sizes to choose from to suit everyone.  Their sweet potato tater tots are a really pleasant surprise too.
