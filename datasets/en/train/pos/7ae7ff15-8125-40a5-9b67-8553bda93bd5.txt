We went for Thanksgiving Dinner! It was really good! Great customer service as well! We had a lobster and shrimp bisque soup that was wonderful to start and an all you can eat turkey dinner with all the traditional sides for our main course with pumpkin pie to follow, all for 29.00 a person. I ate so much I thought I'd burst! They had it set up very nicely for the holiday! There regular menu looks great as well so we will definitely return to try it again! We also were able to take a nice walk around the lake afterward, a very nice way to end the meal!
