Finally a good Indian restaurant!  It is in a fast food setting, order at the counter and pick up your trays.  The food is awesome, tasty, spicy and you can make it spicier at the condiment bar.  We didn't miss not eating meat or poultry and felt extremely satisfied with our vegetarian dishes!

It is clean and bright.  All utensils and dishes are disposable.  We enjoyed the fresh drinks available and Woodland' staff was friendly.  We'll be back!
