Not impressed.  Service was slow, food was bland, and the annoying manager kept coming over to our table to tell us lame stories.

But really - thanks again Thomas for the wonderful evening.  The Patron shots were great, the wine was great, the food was great.  Coincidentally, if you have a hard time reading one of the comment cards, it was probably my drunken chicken scratch.
