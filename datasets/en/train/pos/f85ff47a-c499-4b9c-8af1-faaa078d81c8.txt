Oh, L&L. Heaven in a styrofoam box. The happiest place on earth? For me, when kicking back on a Friday night with my man and a few episodes of Mad Men, it sure is. The staff are friendly and aren't at all shy--if you're new to the joint or just haven't tried many things on the menu, they'll guide you (and give darn good advice). 

A few of my faves: Mixed BBQ plate, Mixed Curry BBQ plate. And I'm a two scoops macaroni, one scoop rice gal. 

Drop by if you're in the neighborhood (or if you're on another planet)--you'll be a regular in no time.
