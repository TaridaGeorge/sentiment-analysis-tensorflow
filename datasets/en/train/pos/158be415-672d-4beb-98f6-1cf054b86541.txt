OMG!! This place is amazing! The boy and I came here for dinner on a whim one Monday night and the place was poppin! We grabbed a seat at a little table near the bar (the game was on). We started off with a bottle of riesling and a pepperoni pizza. The pizza was perfectly cooked and not too greasy and a crunchy crust. They have homemade lemon chello also amazing. I had the gnocchi for my entree. One of the best dishes I've ever had! It was perfect! Flavorful marinara and a sprig of basil. The boy had lasagna and I was a little concerned he was going to leave me for that dish! The entire experience was amazing. My new favorite restaurant!
