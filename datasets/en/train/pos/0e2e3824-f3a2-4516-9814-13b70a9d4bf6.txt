I have visited August Karaoke Box several times since they opened. I chose to write a review today because I just had a chance to check out the new karaoke system. Much to my surprise, it is much easier to use, considering that the interface is also in English, it is easy for everyone.  I had a party of four people when we visited on 26 December, and everyone found the new system very easy to use and "user friendly" for my English speaking friends. 

As before, I found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. Visiting a KTV is a new experience for many Americans, if you are looking for great new way to spend a few hours with friends, visit this little gem of a business. Like me, you will continue looking for excuses to visit August Karaoke Box to sing along to the latest hits.
