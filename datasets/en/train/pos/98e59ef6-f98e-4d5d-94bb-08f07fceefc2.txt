I just returned from my first visit to North Kenilworth and I've already told my husband that we've found our new "family vet."  Excellent service (they were able to get me in for a same-day appointment), great staff (everyone had a friendly smile for me and my dog), knowledgeable doctor (Dr. Holmes diagnosed the issue and took the time to explain all the options to me), and located in a funky renovated mid-century modern building (kudos to investing in Phoenix heritage!)  

I would definitely recommend this vet!
