You cannot be in the Phoenix area and not go to Leelee's. I always get something yummy here. From so many international places. It's like going on an international tour where you sample foods from Cuba. Or India. Or Vietnam and the Philippines. So many others. Plan on spending at least a couple of hours here. You will have fun!
