NOTHING beats the view. Sit on the patio with your honey and sip a cantelope martini and watch the sun set over PV. Ah-mazing. Also, this is the only place where I have asked for extra blue cheese stuffed olives with my dirty martini and they gave me a bowl of them. A BOWL! I've come here for lunches too, but I prefer the adjoiing Jade Bar for a pre- or post-dinner drink.
