The coy wafts of Alligator Juniper wood burning all around is olfactory romance.  The ambiance is simply unparalleled.  The food is very good, but is truly trumped by the ambiance which is romantic in a adobe wrapped authentic way.  Even though there are many patrons dining, and even close by, you still feel very intimate with your date, friend, or small party.  

The grounds outdoors by the water fountain are idyllic.  The bar staff inside was very friendly and a pleasure to be around.  The wine cellar downstairs, which I believe can be booked for private dinners, was magnificent.  My friend and I snuck down there to check it out after dinner, and it was an amazing discovery.  

So far, this has been the best ambiance for dining I've found in Scottsdale.  Anything you get there will taste better because of the aura of the establishment.
