Another local coffee shop (rhymes with Mucks) was my place until recent events left me with a bad taste in my mouth... literally and figuratively.

Lola's is more than an adequate replacement: it is now my choice in Phoenix for coffee.  The iced coffee woke me up and washed the bad taste of other local bitter brews from my mouth.  The atmosphere is mod but unpretentious and, like someone else mentioned, there's enough room so you don't feel like someone is breathing on your neck and reading your emails.

If you stick around, the people watching is superb.  If you take your drink to go, your coffee has the same recharging effect as the balanced breakfast your mother is always nagging you to eat.
