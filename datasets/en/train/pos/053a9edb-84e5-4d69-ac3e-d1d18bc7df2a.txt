I've visited a friend in the Phoenix area twice and both times we went to Ted's. The first visit was at his suggestion but the second time around, I pretty much demanded it. The line was pretty long each time, but for good reason...great food. REALLY like the charbroil aspect; I had a hot dog the first visit and a brat the second - both were worth writing home about. I remember the fries being pretty standard - not bad but nothing overly exciting. The staff were upbeat both times and I'm looking forward to my next visit. Excited to see they take debit/credit now!
