Hotel architect must have played the original Prince of Persia as a kid.

Spacious, modern, well-appointed, clean suites; comfortable beds. Separate living room has sofa bed, flatscreen TV, office desk, mini fridge/bar.

Excellent pools.

Great value.

Very close to major intersection (7th St and Thunderbird Rd) which has four corner strip malls: Safeway, Fresh and Easy, AJ's Fine Foods, McDonald's, Starbucks, Walgreens, Pickup Stix, two gas stations, etc.

Equidistant to Interstate 17 (Black Canyon Fwy) and Highway 51 (Piestewa Frwy).

Pleasant staff.

Only negative is slow wired Internet access (paid).
