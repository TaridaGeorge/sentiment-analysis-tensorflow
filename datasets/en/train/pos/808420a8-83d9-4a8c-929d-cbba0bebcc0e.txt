The pizza is amazing (Grandma G's and pesto are my faves)!   However, if you are one of those that must get something other than pizza at the pizza parlor the Pesto Penne Bake is delicious.  

If you really want a bang for your buck, the Bollo Pasta is endless from 11 to 3 during the week.

Make sure you save room for dessert, a delicious pizza cookie.  Partially baked dough with ice cream, what could be better?

Oh yeah, better parking.
