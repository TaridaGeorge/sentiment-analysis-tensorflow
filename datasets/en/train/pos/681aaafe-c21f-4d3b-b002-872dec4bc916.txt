I am in love with Bookman's.  When I was in college in Flagstaff I spent many a day poking around trying to find a new book to read.  When I moved back to the valley I was sad, no longer was there a Bookman's within walking distance of my home, but that has all changed since I moved.  I now live around the block from the biggest and best used bookstore.  I understand that as an English teacher I may be unusually obsessed with books, but nothing brings me as much joy as a good trip to Bookman's.  I also love that I can tell them I don't need a bag and they don't look at me like I am some sort of crazy hippie.  Love it!
