This is absolutely the best Italian restaurant in Phoenix. You will think you are in Italy! 
Every time I was here the owner-chef came out to say hello. Very friendly. My only warning is to say it's a bit pricey, but really not much more than other local places. We usually eat here for a special occasion. If you are on a budget, save up your money for a special birthday dinner here!
