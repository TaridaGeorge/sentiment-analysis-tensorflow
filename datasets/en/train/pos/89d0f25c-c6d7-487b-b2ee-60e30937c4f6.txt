ok.here we go.im a 4 peaks man.so that being said....i like good food and beer,hence thats why im on here,duh.there ipa was good but to bitter for my taste,there devils ale was good.not sold on there whole selection yet.i had 4 othere firends with me.and we all got burgers.and i was quiet impressed,i got the black bean burger.they put a southwest twist on it with quacamole that over poered the overall taste.it had a bit to much garlic and pepper in it.the patty it self was mooshier than i like and not sweet/bold like normal.the others had stuffed burgers.and man they were huge and all cooked just as requested.i had a side of slaw,crap.dont get it,to much mayo.no flavor.i.m going back to venture further in the menu,so stayed tuned yelpers.stay classy
