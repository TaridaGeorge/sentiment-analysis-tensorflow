I have been training here for a little under a year. This has been the best workout and fighting system I have trained in. I wish I would have found it when I was younger. Besides learning practical ways to defend yourself it teaches you to push through to levels you did not know. Manny and the other trainers are great. No egos just people looking to train hard and learn real world scenarios.
