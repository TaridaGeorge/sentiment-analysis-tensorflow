I really like this store!  It's filled with so many great finds if you like antiques and retro stuff.  I can spend hours here getting out of the AZ heat.  I found some great western items for decorating my house.  There were some fun 50's gadgets for my kitchen too.  It's a consigment type place, so each booth is owned by a different dealer, so you get variety at each one.
