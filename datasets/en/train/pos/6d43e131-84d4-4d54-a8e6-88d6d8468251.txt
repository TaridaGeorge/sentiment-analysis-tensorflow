love this store.  i thought one of the reviews below was way harsh.  given, SOME of the food might be old, you usually find that in the 50% off section.  when living in midtown, i switched from safeway to F&E on 7th ave and indian school and never looked back.  every meat or fish i've ever purchased from there was great.  produce is always fresh and crisp.  jalapenos are really hot which i love!  good wine and beer selection at affordable pricing.  wish there was one in laveen, where i now reside.  19th ave and baseline is a bit far of a travel from 51st ave so i've gone back to safeway shopping.  cant wait til they open one a little further west in south phx!
