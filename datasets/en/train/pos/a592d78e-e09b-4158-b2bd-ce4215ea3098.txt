I love this place.  But then again I like standing in lines.  The longer the line, the more reassured I am the the food is likely to be good.  So I was estactic to be told that it would be a 2 hour wait till we get seated.  Not that waiting was any hardship with Bar Bianco so close at hand.  I was half-way gone before I can start on the pizza, so I don't remember too many specifics, but I do remember that it was good.
