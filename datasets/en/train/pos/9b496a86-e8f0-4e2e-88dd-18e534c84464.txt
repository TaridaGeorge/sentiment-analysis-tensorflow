In September 2008 I went to a pastry cooking class here.

It was at nighttime.  55$ a person.  from 6-9pm.

We show up, and the pastry chef was the pastry chef from Cowboy Ciao!!

OMG!!! I.was.so.excited.

I'm such a huge fan of the pastries at Cowboy Ciao since they're unique and weird and awesome.

Ok, so the class was super fun.  We had like... five or six different recipes.  We broke off into groups and each picked the recipe we wanted to make.

We made them, with the help of the chef.

It was fun, we were all talking.  They provide wine, and iced tea and water to drink.

Then OF COURSE.  Once they're all done, YOU EAT AND EAT AND EAT until you can eat no more.

Awesomeness.

I really had a great time.  Really.
