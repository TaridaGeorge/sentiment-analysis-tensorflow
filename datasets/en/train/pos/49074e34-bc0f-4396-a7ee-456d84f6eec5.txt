I love Uncle Sal's! My Fiance and I found it through a friend, and we were instantly hooked! 

First, the Service is OUTSTANDING! The people that work there are fun, outgoing, and make sure you are 100% satisfied with your order. After going there 3 times in 5 months, when we walk in we are greeted as friends! They remember our names, tease us for not coming in more often, and they'll even 'buy' us a glass of wine every now and then. They are great! 

The FOOD is even better! I go there for lunch (Chiken marsala is DEVINE) and for dinner, I haven't had anything on the menu I didn't like. I couldn't recommend this more highly!
