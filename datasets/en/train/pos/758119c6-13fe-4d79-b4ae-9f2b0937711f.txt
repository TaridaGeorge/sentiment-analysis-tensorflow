I have driven by this place for years and knew I needed to stop in.  How can a place that doesn't have a sign stay in business if it's not good?

It was just good, it was fantastic!  We had a breakfast burrito with chorizo and green chile as well as the carne adovada.  Both were spicy, flavorful and delicious in every bite.  In addition to great tasting food, they also give you plenty of it.  We even took a to go box home and hubby had that for lunch!
