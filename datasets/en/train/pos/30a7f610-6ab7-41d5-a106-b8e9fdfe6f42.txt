I just joined this gym and I'm literally in love with this gym. I've been to others in the valley (24 hour fitness, LA fitness and The Village) but this gym is the best one.  The classes are amazing (that's the most important thing to me), there's one instructor, James that really knows what he's doing. I highly recommend any class he teaches, (I hate to over use this word but) he's amazing! The facilities are great and the locker room is well kept and always clean. They offer a one day pass and have frequent open houses, I suggest giving it a try!
