We've been going since day 1, when it was The Counter.  (liked it better interior-wise then, they had cool retail products).  Food has not changed.   Hot roast beef grilled snadwhich & tomato soup is the best.  Luv the chineese salad.  
Tip: grap a bottle of (cheap) wine & they will crack it for you - no charge. (no one seems to know this?)
Perfect Lunch spot, but the open for breakfast (oatmeal, eggs). 
Coffee is 25 cents, btw.
