The Spa Bontanica was wonderful. Nina was great, she was a spa attendant and helped me with anything I needed. I  asked her for a mimosa and next thing you know there is one waiting for me on a table in the relaxation rooms with a nice note from her. I can honestly say the service is better than the spa at the Biltmore and the facilities are very comparable. The Spa Bontanica is a great place to have a treatment done if you live in the west Valley.
