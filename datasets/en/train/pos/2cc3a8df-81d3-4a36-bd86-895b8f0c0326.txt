Oh Trader Joe's, you make me feel like a better person than I actually am.  Thanks for the big organic selection.  Thanks for making those chopped salads and hummus flavors in the refrigerated section taste so damn good.  And for carrying delicious swiss dark chocolate with 30% whole hazelnuts.  And for carrying weird crap like Mochi and real cornichons and tangerine juice.  
You're the best.  :)
