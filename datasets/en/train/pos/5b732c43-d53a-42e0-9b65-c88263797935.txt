Great food and excellent customer service. Wine selection is very diverse. Great place to hang out and meet people or go out in a date with.  One word to describe the bread sauce: unique. You simply will not find this complex taste anywhere else. Finally, the chef is super personable; I simply have yet to hold such a good conversation with a restaurant chef/owner.
