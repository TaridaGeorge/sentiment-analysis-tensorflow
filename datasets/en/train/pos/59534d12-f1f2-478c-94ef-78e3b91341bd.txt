Marcellino's was an amazing romantic dinner experience.  I had their fresh pasta w/mushroom truffles and lobster.  The combination was amazing.  I also had the white wine that's made by a friend in Italy.  It was tantalizing and really lingered on my pallet.  The homemade tiramisu was a blissful ending to dinner.  The staff is attentive and very helpful.
