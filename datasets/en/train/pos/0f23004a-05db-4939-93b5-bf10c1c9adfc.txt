i loved your review dick h. i too am a fan of zorbas since 1975. i used to stop there after losin my ass at the dog track. it was the only place i could afford after the pups removed a piece of my lung each and every friday / sat nite. for a few thin quarters i could relieve my tension and give the guy with the mop and squeegie something to do. what i wouldn't give to turn the clock back 36 years and re-live those moments. thank u zorbas for the memories that will never fade and for reminding me of the specialty that was my youth.
