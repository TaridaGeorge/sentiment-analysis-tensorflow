Wow! I was introduced to sushi in the bay area (San Fransico) some 20 years back so my standards are pretty high. After having checked out a dozen or so highly recommended sushi spots I had pretty much givin up on the idea of good sushi in the dessert. Sushi Eye on the other hand! I feel their California rolls are the best rolls here and in ALL of Phoenix 4 that matter. I live in the west valley so Sushi Eye is really out of the way but whenever I'm out east I will stop at Sushi Eye! Sushi Eye RULES!
