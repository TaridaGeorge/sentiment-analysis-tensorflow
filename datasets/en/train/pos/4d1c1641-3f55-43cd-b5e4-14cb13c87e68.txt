I love this place and my 2yr old daughter loves it evem more~ I've tried the slushy drinks to the teas and really like them all. Their boba is always cooked well and atmosphere is great, although it is sometimes a little warm in there (feel bad for the girls that work there!). The snacks are quite good too. If it's on the way to where we're going, we never pass it by!
