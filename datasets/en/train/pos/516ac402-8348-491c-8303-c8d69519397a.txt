Ah-friggin'-mazing yogurt!

My fro-yo pet peeve is when the yogurt tastes sickly sweet.  The Pink Grapefruit Tart flavor was actually tart, with the perfect amount of pink grapefruity sweetness.  They have an incredible topping selection too.  White chocolate Kit Kats, baklava, dark chocolate raspberry cups...whaaaa?  The fruit toppings are fresh, too.  45 cents/ounce.

Bring this chain to New York!
