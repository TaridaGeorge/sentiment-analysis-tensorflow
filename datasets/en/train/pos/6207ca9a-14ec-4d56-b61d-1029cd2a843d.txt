I went here after I saw a friend post this on facebook after it was on Triple D!

I went there around 8:30pm on a Saturday night right before they were closing and it was still packed, waiting a good 15 mins just to order.

What I got
Fontina Burger with onion rings- Excellent
Grilled BBQ Chicken Pizza - Somewhat tasty but I was full from my burger
Vanilla Shake - The blue cherry hit the spot

Also had a bite of the Peanut Butter and Banana sandwich which is somewhat great but I couldn't eat it as a meal.

If I went to Phx, I would highly recommend this place
