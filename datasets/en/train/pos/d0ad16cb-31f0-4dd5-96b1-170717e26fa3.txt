Spent some time in Scottsdale on business and found this place via yelp..... Definitely deserves the great reviews previously posted. The fish and chips, burgers and fries were very tasty and the service was excellent. Best meal I had while visiting Arizona, wish we had one of these in orange county.  Oh and the oatmeal stout was awesome as well..... They sell beer to go here, great idea!
