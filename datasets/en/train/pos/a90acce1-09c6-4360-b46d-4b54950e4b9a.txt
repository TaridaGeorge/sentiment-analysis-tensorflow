Cibo serves up some top notch pizza.  They're open late enough that I was able to grab dinner there after my flight in. We had the Margherita and La Noce (ricotta, arugula, and walnuts).  Pies are of the thin crust, gourmet variety, and both were fantastic.

The restaurant is tucked away on a residential street, but the outdoor lighting and patio seating give it away.  Misting devices are sprinkled throughout for dining out on those hot summer nights.  The decor inside is quaint and cozy.  The staff were friendly and the food came out promptly. 

I wouldn't hesitate to return.
