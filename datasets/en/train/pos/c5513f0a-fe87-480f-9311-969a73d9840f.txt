I shared the sampler platter with my boyfriend. We chowed down on jalapeno poppers, onion rings, fried zucchini, mozzarella sticks, and wings. I never knew bar food could taste this good! I loved the down to earth atmosphere, great food, and reasonable prices. I can't wait to come back and try the Philly sandwiches!
