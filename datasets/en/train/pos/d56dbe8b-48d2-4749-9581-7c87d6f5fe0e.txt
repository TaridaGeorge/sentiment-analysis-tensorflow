Imagine my horror when I dined at Tottie's recently and she quoted from my last update..."I'd like to roll her up in one of those lettuce leaves, garnish with mint and cilantro and dip her right into that amazing fish sauce.

Yep. That's what I said. It was preceded however by how delightful she is. And believe me, she is. Such a good sport. We had a good laugh.

We ate here Sunday afternoon after attending the ridiculous Warehouse Sale at Mojave Middle School in Scottsdale (think Ed Hardy vomiting in a gymnasium). So we were hungry and ready for Tottie's Rolls. We consumed THREE orders! Fabulous as always. Potstickers were perfection as was the Hot n Sour soup. Serve was spot on, friendly and playful even!

So Tottie. You rock my dim and my sum! Can't wait to go back!
