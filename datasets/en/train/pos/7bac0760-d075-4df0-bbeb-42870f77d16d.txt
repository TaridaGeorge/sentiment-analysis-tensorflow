Great coffee and a great ambience, Cartel is home to many a hipster who probably fancies him/herself as in-the-know because they found this place in spite of its tiny/non-existent sign. 

Non-hipsters (like yours truly), you will stick out like a sore thumb, but when the coffee is this good, who cares about fitting in?

I would come here to work or to hang out--it's a versatile and friendly atmosphere.
