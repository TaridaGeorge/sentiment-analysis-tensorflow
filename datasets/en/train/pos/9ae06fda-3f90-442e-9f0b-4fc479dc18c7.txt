I love the food & the value is great. Service is good, family friendly, nice ambience. It's my favorite place. We usually head out there on Friday's before 7pm to enjoy the happy hour with half off appetizers and alcoholic beverages. 

Our usual order includes any one of the curry's, cashew chicken, basil chicken, yakisoba. The chicken on skewers are a great appetizer. They're pretty much always full house, but I've never had trouble being seated within about 5 mins. 

Yaaay to Flo's!
