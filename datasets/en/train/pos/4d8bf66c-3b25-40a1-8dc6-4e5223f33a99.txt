My new favorite. Hands down. I don't care that it's a half-hour drive away. They have collard wraps!

And these are fanTAStic - all sorts of veggies and a delicious almond pate nestled in the aforementioned leafy green (and these were not at all bitter)...then dunked in a garlic cashew cream sauce....wow.

If we weren't stuffed, we would have made room for dessert, as it certainly beckoned our eyes, if not our stomachs. Will plan better next time.
