I really love this place. The food is really good and priced very well. I know its cool to like Panda but when you try this place you will completely forget about eating somewhere else just cause its cool. I have gone to Chop Chop many many times and have never left unhappy. Also anyone I have brought to this place has loved it. Give it a try and you will be a Chop Chop fan.
