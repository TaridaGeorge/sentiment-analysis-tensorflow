Great wash fair price. Best part? They have never once stolen money out of my change cup. I count it and if a car wash employee steals it that's their tip. If fact they often find more loose change and the cup has more when they finish than when they start. They always get a good tip from me. 

Now whats with the guys standing around pointing at this spot or that one, or grabbing a rag and walking around after they are done wiping at nonexistent spots? And then giving them little to nothing as a tip. For christsakes go home and wash it yourself. They are working hard in the sun, and are honest. You know who you are, hang your head in shame or maybe walk in their shoes for a day.
