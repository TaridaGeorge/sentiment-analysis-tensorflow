Two of us went on a Friday night, so no surprise - there was a 45 minute wait...

But MAN - it was WELL worth it!!!

We started out with the Bruschetta, which was good (I especially loved the tomato bruschetta).  Then we split a pizza - also delish - I'm looking forward to returning and trying a different pizza every time...because all of them sounded SO GOOD.  But the real game winner was the CREPE at the end - with Nutella and Mascarpone - O.M.G. SO GOOD.

The atmosphere is fantastic, the wait staff is busy - but good, and the food is WELL worth any wait on a Friday night.  I will definitely be a "frequent" at this cute little pizzeria!!! :)
