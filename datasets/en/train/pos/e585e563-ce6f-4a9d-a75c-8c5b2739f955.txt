This QT is located right next to the Candystore "Gentlemen's" club.  This corner was screaming for some other business to move in for years.  This QT is awesome!  Brightly lit, numerous and large filling stations, and super clean.  The gas here is a good 10 cents cheaper than the one a few miles north and south.  Which is huge for me since my car costs about $60-$70 to fill up.  I am the anti-Prius.  I also ran in and found they had Xyience Cran Razz.  My new addiction thanks to Richard Z.  I bought 3 in about 3 seconds.  Checkout time there is super fast and the employees are always really nice no matter time of day.
