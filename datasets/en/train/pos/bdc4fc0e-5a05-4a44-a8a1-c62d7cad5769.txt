One of the best BBQ restaurants I've been too. The place looks a little run down, but it only adds character. Open late (til 9:30pm I believe) this is a quick, easy lunch or dinner for us.

My favorites are the BBQ beef sandwich, potato salad and the cobbler is great too. A definite must! And there are multiple locations throughout the Valley.
