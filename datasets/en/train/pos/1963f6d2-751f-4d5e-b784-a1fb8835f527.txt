GREAT GREAT GREAT.  I love the food!  Soooo good.  I had the giant burrito.  The chips and salsa were tasty, the frozen margaritas came in a bunch of flavors, and my meal and service were perfect.  It has a great atmosphere despite playing Bob Marley 10 songs straight.  This is one of my new favorite restuarants.  Did I mention that the average meal is 10 bucks!!!?
