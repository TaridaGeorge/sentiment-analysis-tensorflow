The coolest coffee shop in phoenix! This cozy little spot is a 1920's bungalow completely transformed into a coffee drinkers down home paradise. They serve up some darn good coffee here, I had some tasty treats (I suggest the banana nut bread or the tarts) and the most unique part the place....they have an in house psychic! I'm thinking a psychic reading should make for some pretty good convo over a cup of joe.. I'll definitely be coming back with some friends in the near future;)
