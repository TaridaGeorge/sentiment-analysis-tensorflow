A few months ago, I was headed towards another restaurant to use my gift card, but wandered into Firebirds by mistake -- and what a happy "mistake" it was!  This has turned into one of our favorate places to go.  The food is consistently good.  By signing up to receive emails, we've gotten coupons for appetizers, desserts, and discounts. 

Someone else mentioned s/he wasn't a fan of open kitchens.  However, we do like that arrangement.  It's far enough away to not be intrusive.  The bar has a fireplace that's nice to sit by on chilly days.  

The fresh-baked sourdough bread is among the best served by any restaurant. The coconut shrimp appetizer was big enough for a meal, and the grilled tenderloin salad enough for a male friend of ours.  For dessert, I'm not usually a fan of brownies, but the salted caramel sauce added just the right touch.
