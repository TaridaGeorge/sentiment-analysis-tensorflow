My favorite breakfast location in the valley.  I've been going for decades...the breakfasts taste the same as it did at their prior location - Delicious.  My friends and I had a reunion breakfast there (one from CA, one from WA, the other from Gilbert).  We felt like we stepped back 10+ years when we would meet there regularly for breakfast.  My husband who typically waits for nothing will suggest breakfast here, drive 30 minutes and willingly wait another 30 mnutes for a table and their chicken fried steak.
