This is the finest china feast you will get in Phoenix.

When Fortune Cookie Buffet on 5th ave and camelback burned down back in the 90's, it took my heart and appetite with the flames.

Just like the legendary bird in which our city was named for, from the ashes of my belly, a new hunger has been born.

For those of you wanting some legit american style chinese food, 
I strongly recommend the Sweet and Sour Beef dinner combo.  This combo comes with very generous portions of all of these below listed items: 
 S&S Beef, Fried Rice, Chicken Lo Mein, 1 egg roll, 2 crab puffs.

Yes, I said beef. No, I am not sharing.

You won't be disappointed, I leave this restaurant with a full belly and smile of contentment every visit.
