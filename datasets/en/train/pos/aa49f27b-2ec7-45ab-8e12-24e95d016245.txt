Copper Star Coffee -  A lucky stumble off of Seventh Ave. The coffee is excellent and the ambiance inviting. The menu offers a variety of beverage and food options, yet is not overwhelming. Either a scone, cupcake or sandwich (which are all homemade by the way) compliment a latte wonderfully. The combo of the coffee, food, comfy couches, stacks of magazines and free WiFi, makes Copper Star better than my own living room!
