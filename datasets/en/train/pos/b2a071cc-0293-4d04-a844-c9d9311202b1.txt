Tonight I had the pleasure of trying out JoBot Coffee. This trendy coffee house totally lives up to the hype for their crepes. I had the Nutella and Banana Crepe. What's not to love? It was perfect. It had just enough Nutella to give it that great hazelnut and chocolate taste. I worried that it was be caked with Nutella making it too rich to eat, but that was not the case. The bananas were great too. This was my first time at JoBot and the barista was very helpful in recommending the sweet peach tea, and the crepe. 

This place is very cool. It is an old house that was converted first into a bicycle shop and then the coffee house. One room has a living room type atmosphere, and there was ample seating outside. I will definitely go back to try the savory crepes and coffee.
