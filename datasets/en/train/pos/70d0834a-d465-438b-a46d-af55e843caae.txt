This is going to be short and sweet.... The bruschetta is one of the best around. I luv the idea of 4 different flavors on one plate. A couple of my favorites are the proscuitto and fig and the goat cheese and tomato jam. So so so...so good. The paninis are just as scrumptious. I am partial to salty and sweet flavors mixed so I go with the proscuitto and fig jam one and it always hits the spot. But, with all that said... my favorite thing at Postinos...the one thing I can not leave without eating even if I have just stuffed myself into an uncomfortable food coma... is the salted caramel sundae. OMG... ice cream with think, rich, buttery, and a hint of saltyness caramel...the little bites of chocolate covered pretzels. Holy cow... it might be on the list of possibilitys for my last meal.
