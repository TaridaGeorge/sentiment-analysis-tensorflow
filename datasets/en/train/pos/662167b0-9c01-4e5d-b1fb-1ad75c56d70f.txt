I love this place!
If you are looking for your typical sweet and sour chicken you are not going to find it here. This is AUTHENTIC food. In fact, they have a "whitey" menu and a Chinese menu. Ask for the Chinese menu - the food is much better.

I always order the black pepper steak/beef and the spicy fish fillet (black bean sauce) and often the garclic bok choy. 

Their soup is also wonderful!

Do not go in looking for top-notch service. The wait staff is very stand offish and it took me a while to get use to that. But, their food is worth it!
