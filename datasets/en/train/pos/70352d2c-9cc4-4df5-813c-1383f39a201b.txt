Broasted Chicken is AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING!!!  

If you have never had it go get some stat.  It is the juiciest fried chicken I have ever had and the scary thing is that this place is like 2 miles from my work.  

5/5 stars and a breast, thigh, and potato wedges with a soda for $5.55 great deal as well.
