i consider this the best buffet in town compared to old country & hometown. there is a large selection of all types of food. there is no skimping when it comes to food selection. they have a large dessert bar also with sugar free desserts. the desserts are awesome, not just the standard boring kinds like hometown. all the food has been really good. the lunch price is about $8. this does not include your drink. drinks are another $1.80.  dinner is about $10, not including your drink. service has always been good. the food is always great.
