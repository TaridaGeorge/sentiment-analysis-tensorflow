I've only tried their Ecuadorian Tamales and La Bandeja Paisa, but if the rest of their food is half as good as those two things, this place is still 5 stars. The Ecuadorian Tamale was especially good.

How people can walk into the Taco Bell when this place is right behind it, is beyond me. 

First time trying plantains as well. I'm a fan.
