Tortilla soup is delicious, spicy and reasonably priced.  Not cheesy like max and ermas and not like a vegetable broth like at many Mexican restaurants, thick and stewy.  Potato Bacon corm chowder was good but bot as chunky as I had hoped.  But is you don't want spicy this tasty.  The creme brulee has coconut milk in it and is AMAZING.
