This restaurant is fantastic! My husband and I have been here several times and it has always been a very positive experience. The owner, David, is attentive, knowledgeable, and very thoughtful. We love Thai food and have pretty high standards when it comes to Asian cuisine, and this restaurant definitely exceeded our expectations. The Musaman Short Rib is out of this world! I've never had anything like it! They also have a great wine selection, appetizers, and it's definitely the best Pad Thai that I've had in Arizona. If you like top-notch Thai food, a great ambiance, and excellent service, then this is the restaurant for you!
