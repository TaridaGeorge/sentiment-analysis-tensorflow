Definitely good for the outdoorsy type. Last time I walked in, I saw a golden retriever being fitted for a doggie backpack by a staff member. It was cute! I was looking for bike gear and someone offered some knowledge about bike lights and reflective gear. I almost bought the wrong color reflectors for the back of my bike. I was going to buy yellow stickers for the back, when red is to signal the rear of a cyclist. Thanks for saving me on that one! They do seem to get busy, but every time I have been there someone has tried to help me. Prices are kinda high, though. I have been tempted to sign up for the rewards plan.
