The Original Chopped Salad is stupid good.  Seriously.

I almost laughed when I saw the salad has it's own Facebook page.  After I ate it, I knew why.  And I "liked" the page, lol.

My friends and I loved everything we had, and be warned - the cocktails are potent!  I had the salad as my meal (and shared two desserts with my 4 friends), and was comfortable (not too full, but not hungry still).  If you're a big eater, you might want to order something else along with the salad.

But order the damn salad.
