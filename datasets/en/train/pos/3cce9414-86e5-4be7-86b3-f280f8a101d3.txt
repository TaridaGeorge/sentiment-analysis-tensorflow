Ok so I don't usually give out 5 stars but DAMN!!! I love love love this place the sandwiches are seriously amazing. My friend Josh asked if I had ever been to it sadly no! Man was I missing out! Had a nugg size sandwich and it was the perfect size yummy next time I'm at his house I will be there:) 
Not gonna lie totally love the theme and feel of the place reminds me of the coffee/breakfast place by my house in tahoe love it all so felt at home here and that means the most to me!
