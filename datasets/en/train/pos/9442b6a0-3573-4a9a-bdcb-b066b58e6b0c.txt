Pricey but fabulous a great special occasion restaurant. I adore the short ribs. The strawberry sorbet for dessert was like eating fresh from the field berries but frozen just the thing after a beefy meal. All of the staff were wonderful. I highly recommend Lon's especially for a special celebration.
