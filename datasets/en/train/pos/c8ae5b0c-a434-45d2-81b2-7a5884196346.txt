What can I say... we eat here once a week for lunch cuz we can walk here. We come here for happy hour twice a week cuz we can walk here. 

So, yeah it's pretty convenient... but we STAY here after hours to play poker because the servers know us by name and the food is priced right and the poker crowd is really cool and it's a great place to eat-n-learn.

And we LOVE Tony because that guy says hello to EVERY CUSTOMER EVERY TIME. 

Trust me on this one... jump off the freeway for happy hour... you'll know what I mean when Tony says hello to you, too.

PS get the three meat calzone. You look great and can afford the calories...
