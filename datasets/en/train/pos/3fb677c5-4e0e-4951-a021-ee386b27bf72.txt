This is where my husband and I go when neither of us want to cook and we want good food.  I love their la italliana pizza and my husband loves the meaty ones.  Their antipasto salad is also delish.  I love the service here too - a small town local kind of place tucked in a little shopping center.  We mostly get takeout here but we've eaten in a few times and the dining atmosphere is great.  Always very pleasant people here in great moods because the food is incredible.  I don't know what they put in their sauce but there must be some sort of crack in it because it's super addicting.  We always come back for more!
