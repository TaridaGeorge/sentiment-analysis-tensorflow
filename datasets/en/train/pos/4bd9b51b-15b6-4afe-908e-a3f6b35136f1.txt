This pace is amazing.  They do threading which is so hard to find in Scottsdale - they also do makeup for weddings!  I love this place as it is so reasonable and I loved the people so much I have become friends with them!  I will be taking my hubby next week - I know he will prefer threading over me tweazing him!
