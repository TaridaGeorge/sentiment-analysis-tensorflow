Woohoo is right!  This place is awesome.  If you are interested in great Vietnamese food try it out.

I will not lie, you will not be wowed by the level of service or the ambiance.  The food speaks for itself.  My wife and I have left each time with the cheapest lunch/dinner we have ever had and still were completely satisfied.  Everything on the menu is worth trying and comes to you fast and fresh.

The only draw back is no beer but hey plenty of that elsewhere.  To sum it up, no frills, great food, easy on the wallet.
