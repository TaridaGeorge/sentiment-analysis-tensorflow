I rate 5 Stars based on service alone. All associates in this store have been a pleasure to do business with.  I am so grateful to the store manager, Jen, as she has turned a not so pleasant experience into a truly outstanding service experience. Unfortunately, I've had a number of issues with my ring, but she has gone 100 times over and above any expectations my husband and I had to help out and resolve the trouble with our purchase. I tell you sincerely if you are looking for a jewelry store, don't go to any other Kay location. Thank you Jen for the outstanding service you have provided. I look forward to the next opportunity to do business with you.
