This review is for the E.R.  

When it comes to emergency rooms, I generally don't expect too much.  They are often chaotic and the wait times can be incredible.  I came to the E.R. with a serious sinus infection, after my treatment at a local urgent care facility was not working.  I expected to be seen last, because of my lack of medical urgency.  To my surprise, I was seen by the triage nurse in only a few minutes and then admitted within an hour.  The doctors and nurses were extremely nice and answered all of my concerns and questions; I felt like an active party in my care, and it put me at ease.    

Oh yea, I've never been in an ER with private rooms with televisions; I thought it was kind of cool, and it made the downtime between tests and results fly by.
