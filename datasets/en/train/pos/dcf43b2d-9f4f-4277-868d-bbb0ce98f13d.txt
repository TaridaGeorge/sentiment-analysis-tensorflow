The food is amazing, the service is great, and the atmosphere is clean and inviting.   The owner is usually there too personally greeting patrons. Its a small privately owned diner with a few outdoor tables.  It's fairly unassuming but a real gem if you're looking for good Chinese food.  I can't really give much commentary on the menu because I always get the shrimp with walnut sauce but that is pretty tasty!  The prices are incredibly reasonable, comparable to most Chinese take out but minus all the grease and MSG.  Highly recommended!
