This has been my primary care office for about 5 years now. They have an MD (Dr. Allen) and several physician assitants. I have over the years seen almost everyone in the office and have never had a complaint. There is almost always an appointment available quickly if you are willing to see anyone in an emergency. They always are very friendly and take more than 30 seconds with you. They listen and refer when necessary and have always interacted well with the insurance companies to get referals done. 

The offices are always clean and bright. Great support staff as well.
