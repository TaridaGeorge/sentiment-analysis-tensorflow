Back again...on a busy Saturday night and no one missed a beat and they made all of use smile...start to finish.  

Where did you find all those great young ladies?!!!!   

Rum Raisin and the new Amaretto...so I guess it was an alcoholic gelato night.....excellent!

Thanks Kristin!  Thanks girls!  Another great evening.

See ya soon.
