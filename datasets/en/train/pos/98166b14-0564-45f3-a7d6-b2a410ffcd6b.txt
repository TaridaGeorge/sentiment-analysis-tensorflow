This place used to be a Chili's, then one day, it was Spinato's.  I'd never been to a Spinato's before, but I've been there numerous times since my first visit.

The pizzas are delicious, there is just something about them--I think it's the sweet tomato sauce that they use.  This is probably the best pizza in the valley, IMO.  My favorite is the Spicy Italian w/ Banana Peppers.

Calzones and sandwiches are also very delicious, I like the meatball and Italian sausage sandwiches.

Prices are reasonable for dinner, and for lunch if you are splitting a pizza with a friend or two.  Haven't been in for happy hour but the specials look good.
