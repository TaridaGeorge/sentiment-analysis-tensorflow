We have been going to Sakana for YEARS!  We have tried other sushi restaurants, but SAKANA is the absolute best!  Their service is spectacular and Nana is the sweetest one there!  She is almost like family to us, and if my husband and I go in alone, she asks where the kids are!  Great food, great prices, great atmosphere!  BTW, the Salmon Bomber is out of this world!!!
