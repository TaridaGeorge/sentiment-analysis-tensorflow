Love this place! The food always great! The lunch buffet is my favorite, and the lunch time service is excellent...rarely do I ever have to ask for water or more naan. One side of the buffet is all vegetarian so I never have to worry or ask if something has meat. The naan is so always soft and hot! 

Highly recommend!!
