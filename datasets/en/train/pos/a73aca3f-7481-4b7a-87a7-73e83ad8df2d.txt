This is my absolute new favorite restaurant! Everyone needs to try this place at least once. I love the outside patio. The service is always good. The wine deals are great. And the food... oh man... definitely the best part! Portions are big so be prepared to share. 

Be prepared with cash to tip the valet though. Not a lot of other parking. Awesome place.
