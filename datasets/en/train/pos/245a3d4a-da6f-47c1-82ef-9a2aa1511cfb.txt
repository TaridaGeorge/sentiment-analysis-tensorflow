They serve cantonese style Chinese food. I'd say you really have to know how to order to really enjoy good Chinese food because there are so many dishes you can choose from. I think they have a buffet here, but I wouldn't try it if I were you. Good food doesn't come in all-you-can-eat. Pay a little extra and really enjoy your food. Quality over quantity.

The service here is not so great but the food makes up for it.
