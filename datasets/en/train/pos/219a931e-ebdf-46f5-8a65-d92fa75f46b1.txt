This place a fantastic.  I was in Scottsdale for 2 nights and we went to RnR both nights.  It come recommend by the server at another local place and it was the most fun that we had in town.  The staff is amazing-  super friendly, fun, and helpful.  
The food was great- DO NOT miss out on the Ahi Tacos,  happy hour 1/2 off food deals and 1/2 off  wine nights make it a great value.  

I'm looking forward to my next trip to Scottsdale to bo back and try  their breakfast.
