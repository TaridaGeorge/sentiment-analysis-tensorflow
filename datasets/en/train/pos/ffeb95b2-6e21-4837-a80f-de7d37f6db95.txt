Local, Fresh and Friendly. More like walking into your own dining room. Except no pots and pans to clean up afterwards.  Locally sourced foods and prepared with with loving care. The waitress is always friendly and helpful in what to order. Small menu but enough variety to come back every week and not be bored by the selections. Owner is around and checking on the food. SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL MOM AND POP RESTAURANT ! Go and have a good Breakfast or Lunch. You will not be disappointed !
