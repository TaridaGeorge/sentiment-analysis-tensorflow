Wow! I was in town on a week long business trip and the one thing I look forward to most when I travel are the meals. Cafe Monarch was a highlight of my trip. As soon as I walked through the door I felt cozy and right at home. Chef Chris asked me what I preferred out of a few selections and I went with the lamb chops and spinach.  Usually I'm pretty picky about lamb and always inquire about prep but I left myself in his hands.  Chef Chris served me a perfectly cooked thyme rubbed lamb with a wonderful citrus sauce.  Spinach was prepared with garlic and a hint of mint which complemented the lamb perfectly.  Simple, fresh, delicious...
