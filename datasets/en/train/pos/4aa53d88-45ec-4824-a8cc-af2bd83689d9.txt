So our second visit to Bella Luna was as good or better than the first. My wife's Lasagna was heavenly. So much better than my own attempt to make it at home. Likewise, my veal piccata was so tender I could cut it with a fork. My kids got the pizza bread and the chicken parmigiana. When they cleaned their plates they finished my pasta and then Napolitan ice cream. Verdict: 4 exquisite meals, excellent wait staff, and we got out of their for $50. This place really is a gem!
