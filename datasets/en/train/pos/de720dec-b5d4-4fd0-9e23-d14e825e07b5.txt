THE BEST BBQ PLACE I'VE FOUND IN PHOENIX!! OMG! I can't wait till the next time we have another family outting. Everyone in my family was happy with their food. From the prime ribs to the baby back ribs to the kid's mac and cheese to the shoe string fries and to the pineapple martini... EVERYTHING WAS A TEN TEN TEN TEN! On top of everything else, yelp gave me a 10% discount for checking in! WINNING!!! I'm super excited we gave this place a try!! LOVE IT!!
