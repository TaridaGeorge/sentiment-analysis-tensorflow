The best patio in all of Tempe.  On the weekends, arrive early to ensure prime real estate, because you'll want to watch this crowd.  

Ride your bike and park it out front with all the others.  Order the oysters or fried mushrooms.  Drink anything because it's all affordable.  Be patient because the wait staff isn't in a hurry.
