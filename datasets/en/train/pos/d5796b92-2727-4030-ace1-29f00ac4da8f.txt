After a lot of begging and convincing, me and my boyfriend decided to get pedicures together. I searched for places close to home and after reviewing Fancy Nails decided to give it a shot. We got there and all the techs and who seemed to be the owner or manager made us feel very welcomed. The place was clean and inviting. We got to the chairs which were probably the nicest chairs I've seen in a while and I loved that the spa pedi bowls had one use plastic liners that are disposed of after every single use. My massage was AMAZING!!! and the polish and selection was good!!! I was very happy and even my boyfriend said when we were finished "that was awesome, we need to do that a lot more" SCORE ;)
