Okay so I haven't been to the doctor in forever, but I remember having to wait ridiculous lengths of time in the waiting room the last time I went and then at least another 20 minutes before the doctor came in to see me. 

But when I was here the other day, I think it only took about 10 minutes to be called back and perhaps another 10 before the doctor (Dr. Cohen) came in.  Not bad, huh?

I thought he was really nice and friendly, and would come back again if the need arises.  The front desk staff was pleasant too, and that just isn't always the case in doctor's offices!
