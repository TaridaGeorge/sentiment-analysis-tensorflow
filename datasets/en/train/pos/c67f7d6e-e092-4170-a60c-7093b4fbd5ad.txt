I have been a fan of Matt's for the last 3 years. I go there at least once a week to meet with my circle of friends. Ernie the owner has become a great friend and is an awesome example of someone who has connected with the culture of urban Phoenix. The only drawback which is also Matt's strength is that it is a small place good for only groups of 4 or so. I have had Matt's all to myself with bigger groups of 20 but it requires planning ahead. I suggest going with either the Hog and Chick or try the waffles.
