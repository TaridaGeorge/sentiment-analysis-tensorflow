Found this place when I yelped brunch places around the area I was driving in. We were driving around looking at furniture places. The reviews were good so my husband, daughter, mother-in-law, nephew, and I decided to try it out. 

The restaurant is a cute little place that is hidden in what appears to be a sort of industrial area. We felt like we struck gold. I ordered the daybreak which consisted of cinnamon French toast, eggs, and bacon. DELISH!! Everyone else said they really enjoyed their food as well. Our waiter was really nice and attentive. He even offered my 4 year old nephew a cookie as we left. 

I would definitely make the trip out to the area again for some yummy food!
