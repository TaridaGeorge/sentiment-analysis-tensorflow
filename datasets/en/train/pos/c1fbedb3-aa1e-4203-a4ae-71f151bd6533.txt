After being told by the "dealership" that 2nd gear synchros were gone in my cars transmission I've been driving from 1st gear to 3rd gear for over a year. I casually mentioned this to Dave this morning when I brought the car in for an oil change. He said he would look into it and maybe put a little "Lucas Oil" additive in it. I'm very pleased to report that this transmission which hadn't functioned correctly in over a year is shifting flawlessly now and I was only charged $4 dollars for some "Lucas Oil" you are a good man Dave Calvert, thank you for your honesty, your professional service, and your outstanding Buckeye Crew!
