I am so lucky to live close to Frost. Everything I've ordered there is delicious. My son loves the sea salt caramel, which is their most popular flavor. I get a different flavor every time I go in. This is so far beyond a typical ice cream scoop shop. I like getting an affogato (espresso poured over gelato) or sorbettini (fruit sorbet blended with Pellegrino).
