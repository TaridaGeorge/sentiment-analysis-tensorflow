I am completely floored by how amazing Paul's service is. I have never met anyone so giving of his time, his knowledge and his kindness.  He showed us how to take care of our water filtration system all by ourselves, spending more than 30 minutes explaining how to fix the problem we were having, how to troubleshoot another problem we may have in the future and what to do for regular maintenance of our system.  He didn't recommend we replace ANYTHING to fix our system, and he didn't charge us anything?  It was crazy.  He said he didn't have to repair anything, so he wasn't going to charge us.  I am never going to call another company.
