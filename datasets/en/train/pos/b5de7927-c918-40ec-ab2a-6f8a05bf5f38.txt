Ok...So I know its a sports bar/Restaurant...but really the food is always good, the service is always friendly (and good looking). They have one of the best happy hours in town. This place is a great local spot in the Arcadia neighborhood, so easy walking any where. Parking is a little tight, but they have valet and its free..Overall, a great place to hang with the family or just watch a game and grab a beer. 

highly recommend this to any one...
