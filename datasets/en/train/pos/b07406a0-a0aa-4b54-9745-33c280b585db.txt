Absolutely terrific!  A HUGE menu makes it difficult to decide, so let your knowledgeable server help you.  Then again, in my experience, anything you order here will make you very, very happy.  The Hong Kong style dishes are super authentic, and they hit their spicier items at the perfect spice & heat levels with the "heat" never superseding the flavors.  The Mongolian beef, for example, leaves a little tingle on your lips, but it never feels hot.  You will love the values here; if you order an entree for each of you, you will be going home with a second meal to savor all over again.  Plus, we usually are the only non-Chinese people there.  Now that is perfection!
