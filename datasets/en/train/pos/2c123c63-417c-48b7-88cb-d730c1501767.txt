Fig and marscapone bruschetta is to die for. I crave it all the time! Vintage 95 in Chandler has attempted to copy Postino's recipe for success, but it doesn't compare to the service, atmosphere and quality that Postino is known for. Prices are completely fair, wine and beer selection is great. The Mixed Green salad was totally amazing. I drive 30 minutes from Gilbert to get there, and it is worth every minute. I can't wait for the Gilbert location to open! One of the best places in Phoenix, hands down.
