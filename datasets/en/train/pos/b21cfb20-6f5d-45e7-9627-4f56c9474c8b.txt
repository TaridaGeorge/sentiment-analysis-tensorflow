When my wife and I had a chance to move to the Phoenix area in 2004 I was immediately thrilled to know we could see NHL hockey on a regular basis.  The Coyotes have improved in the last couple years but even when they didn't make the playoffs you're still watching great hockey.  So many People are fans of "winning" and not of a sport.  Sure we'd love to see the Yotes get by the Red Wings in the first round but it's hockey and we hope the NHL can find an owner to keep the team here.
