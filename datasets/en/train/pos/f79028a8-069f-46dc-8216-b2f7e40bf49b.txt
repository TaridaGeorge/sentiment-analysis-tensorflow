I am have been looking for a local, clean and friendly aquarium shop and I found it :) The owner is so nice and passionate about customer service and her fish which is awesome! She was very helpful about some of the problems I have been having with my betta friends and offered several solutions. In addition, she showed me around and helped me pick out another tank that I will be starting with her help and expertise. I would definitely recommend this store to any of my friends and everything  was very clean and well organized etc. with lots of varieties of products!
