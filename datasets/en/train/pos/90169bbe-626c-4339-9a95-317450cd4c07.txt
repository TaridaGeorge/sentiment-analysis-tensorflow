Stopped back in here for lunch today, joined by Mike C.  The price has increased a dollar from three months ago, but everything was tip top with the restaurant & the food.  There was lots of great Sushi, many salad choices, tasty cottage cheese, just-right Kim Chee, great fried chicken, delicious Stuffed Scallops, Corn Souffl'e, Mongolian BBQ, & so on.

It's still a big "Yum!" & 5 Stars for Yummy Buffet!     :-))

Weekday Lunch Buffet $6.99/$6.29 Sr.
