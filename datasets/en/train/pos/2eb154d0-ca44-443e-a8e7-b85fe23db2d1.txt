My five-star rating is just for the deep dish pizza and its croissant-like crust.  It is delectable!  As a former Chicagoan, I claim some expertise in deep dish pizza (eating, not making), and I've got to say that B.J.'s makes the best.  I've never had any crust like that.  Ever.  

I haven't had much else at B.J.'s  The multicolored chips and salsa was very good.  Didn't care much for the thin crust pizza appetizer.  

The Pazooki (huge hot cookie served in a pie plate with ice cream on top) is yummy, but the last one I had, it was uncooked in the center.  However, you get a free one if you tell them it's your birthday!

THE best BJ's is in Laguna Beach.  Order one in the restaurant, and go sit on the boardwalk at Main Beach.  Just something about that sand blowing on there!
