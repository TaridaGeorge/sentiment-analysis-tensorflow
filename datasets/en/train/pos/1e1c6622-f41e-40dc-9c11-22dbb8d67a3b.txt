People seem to have fallen in love with this controversial park. It's another addition to downtown, as Phoenix works to improve the central city and revitalize the area. The most prominent feature is the massive sculpture that hangs over the park. Supposedly a "cactus flower" I've heard it likened to everything from jellyfish to tornado to vagina. It's interesting to see in the day, albeit a bit of an eyesore, but the park's real potential comes out at night when the LED pillars and sculpture are lit. Darkness hides the support system and the sculpture appears to float over the city. You will notice the various colors on it by day, but the night lights make them glow and contrast each other. It is definitely a unique addition to downtown Phoenix.
