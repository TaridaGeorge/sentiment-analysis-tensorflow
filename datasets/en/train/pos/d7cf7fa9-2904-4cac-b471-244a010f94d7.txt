Big fan of this store - the owner tries very hard to create an inviting atmosphere for all levels of gamers. Further, the store provides for a host of niches, including euro-games, Ameritrash, role playing, and miniature wargaming. Good amount of supplies (both GW and P3, among others). Lots of tables for miniature gaming, board games, CCGs, and painting in the back (and a fridge with soda). They've started carrying MTG over the last few months, and that collection has grown. Always something going on here, but nothing intimidating. 

The owner is very, very helpful: willing to answer questions about painting, games, and to make special orders (even trips over to Gilbert at Battlefoam when necessary). Yep, big fan.
