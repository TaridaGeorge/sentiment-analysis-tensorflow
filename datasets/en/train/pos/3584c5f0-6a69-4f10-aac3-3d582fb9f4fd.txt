I drove compeltely out of my way for an In-N-Out burger last night.  I freakin love that place.  I have to say, I have been eating at In-N-Out since I was a teen in LA.  It will always be my favorite.  I want to tell you that the 20 years ( God I am getting old) that I have been eating at In-N-Out I have never tried animal style.  I never wanted to screw up what I thought was the best.  I ordered animal style for the first time.  I seriously am in love.  I kind of feel like I wasted the last 20 years of In-N-Out eating on plain old cheeseburgers, when I could of had ANIMAL style! What was I thinking LOL.  If you have never tried Animal style, jump out the box and do it!  it is worth it!
