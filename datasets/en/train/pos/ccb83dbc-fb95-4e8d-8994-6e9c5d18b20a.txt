Delicious, fresh!

The thin crust on the pizza was great, the caprese appetizer very good, and the antipasto salad entree very large and good. 

Service was good, friendly, helpful and not neglectful. Went on a very busy night and they still had room for us, waited only a couple of minutes. 

Will go back if we ever go back to Phoenix
