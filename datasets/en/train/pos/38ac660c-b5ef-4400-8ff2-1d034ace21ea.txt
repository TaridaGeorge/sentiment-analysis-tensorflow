I was visiting a friend in Scottsdale and was yelping my way around tryin' to figure out where to eat. Somehow I found this place. At the last minute they were able to give us a reservation for dinner... We ended up being seated in the owner's section. He started off the evening by letting us know that he didn't recognize us... when we explained it was because we were New Yorkers... and it was our first time, he aimed to impress! Local wine, a carefully plotted menu, and a free dessert... even after we were stuffed... For a couple of New Yorkers who moved west, the staff at FnB definitely did the East Coast proud in a dainty little bistro in the wild, wild west. After hours, by the way, on the weekends, they turn on some different music... and have an alternate menu. Very awesome spot.
