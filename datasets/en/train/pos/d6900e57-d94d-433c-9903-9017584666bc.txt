This is one of those places I crave. They serve all of my favorite thai food dishes! The basil fried rice is good and refreshing, and the egg bomb is amazing! The food is very spicy but they give you the standard 1-5 scale. I am a wimp so I usually opt for a "2."
The Phoenix location is a little place in a little strip mall with a few booths. The decor is fun and festive and I've never had a problem being seated. Staff is always friendly and I always leave stuffed!
