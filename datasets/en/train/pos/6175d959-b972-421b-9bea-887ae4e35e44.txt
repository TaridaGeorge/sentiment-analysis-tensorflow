My uncle (who is old school Arizona) recommended last year. Loved their selection and preparation of a diverse menu. The big ass Burger is still perfectly prepared,  as well as it was a year ago. We tried other the grilled shrimp and grits, grilled half chicken, green chili bowl, and well, all of their happy hour selections. Their HH drink menu hits the spot with well prepared cocktails (perfect martinis and margaritas ) with a balancedbalanced wine and beer list. Thank you Roaring Fork, for not letting us down. Great service,  food and drink, thank you Uncle Bob for this gift!!
