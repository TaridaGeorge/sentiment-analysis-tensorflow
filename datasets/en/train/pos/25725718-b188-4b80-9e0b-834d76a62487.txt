Taggia can put on an awesome spread of gourmet appetizers!  Wow!

I attended a Yelp event at Firesky recently and I was very impressed with the food and service of Taggia.

Oh the olives!  Just the spread of olives was wonderful by itself.  Great variety.  Then the proscuitto, the artichokes, the sun dried tomatoes, the cheeses...all delicious.

We'll be back for dinner soon!
