I have gone here a lot since high school and have always loved this place. It's cheeky and nerdy, and it's a local place to pay for cheaper ($3) movies and concessions. I love going here, and getting out of the sticky, mainstream theaters.

Just be advised, cash only. But that's okay because that's what I learned in San Francisco.
