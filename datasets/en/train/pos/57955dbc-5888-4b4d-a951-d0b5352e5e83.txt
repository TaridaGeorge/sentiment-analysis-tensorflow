Great shop for tea lovers. The really nice guy working was very patient while we smelled about 10 different teas. He explained what was in each one and even started recommending some once he realized what we liked. They had some ice tea out to sample as well. Reasonably priced for loose tea, especially after the sticker shock I received a few weeks ago at another similar store. This will now be my go-to place for tea. We bought two different teas and I can't wait to make them!
