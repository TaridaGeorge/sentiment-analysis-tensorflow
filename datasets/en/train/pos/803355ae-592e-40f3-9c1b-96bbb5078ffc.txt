I am a huge fan of this place. I haven't ventured outside of the teppen tables, so my viewpoint may be limited. The atmosphere is quite loud and lively, but definitely fun. It is great for a nice dinner with a group. The food is simply outstanding. The soup, salad, and chicken are all excellent, but the fried rice is the absolute best. I have never had better fried rice anywhere. After you have enjoyed the main course, get the green tea ice cream. I hate green tea, but for some reason, this ice cream is amazing. 

If you like teppen yaki and don't want to deal with the bland food they serve at Benihana, definitely give this place a shot. You won't be disappointed.
