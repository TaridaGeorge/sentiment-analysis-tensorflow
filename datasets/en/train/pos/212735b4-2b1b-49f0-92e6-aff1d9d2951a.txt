You'll read in many of these reviews that people are excited about this location being close to home, and that probably sways the rating considerably. Normally I would have an issue with that, but in the case of this Humble, it's merited. It's a relief to have a decent pizza and non-sports bar so close, without having to negotiate the traffic of a kierland commons or scottsdale quarter. Look, the pizza is nice, it's humble pie not Bianco or Pomo, it's consistent though. The rest of the menu is also good, I really like the burgers and the salads are awesome.

In my opinion, one of the best happy hours around, especially on Monday when they offer half price on bottles of wine!
