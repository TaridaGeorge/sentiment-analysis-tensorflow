My wife and I have been to Mark's at least a dozen times in the last 6 months. Fantastic breakfast spot. I've had a few of the different eggs benedict, but my all time favorite is the French Eggs Benedict - it's served on a wonderful croissant instead of an english muffin. Absolutely perfect.

We stopped by one time for their Friday night dinner, and truthfully were disappointed. After loving their breakfast so much we had high hopes for the dinner. While it was delicious, it wasn't quite up to my expectations; perhaps the breakfast set them too high. However, we will continue going back for breakfast as we can!

The staff is always friendly, and is quick to recognize you as a regular.
