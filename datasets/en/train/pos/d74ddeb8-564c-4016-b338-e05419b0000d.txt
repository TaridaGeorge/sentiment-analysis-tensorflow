The Sun is setting, what a sweet view!!
My most favorite hiking mountain, thus far!!! 
This mountain holds many great memories and times, it's also a challenge every time to hike up, then a smooth jog back down!! 
Oh soo GREAT feeling when I'm done, that it energies me for more and more!!!
 I simply love this mountain, and its greatness!!! :)
