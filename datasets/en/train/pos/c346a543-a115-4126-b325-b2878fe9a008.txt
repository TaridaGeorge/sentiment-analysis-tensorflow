Rarely do I have to go to a restaurant 3 times in one week just to make sure I wasn't dreaming about how delicious the food was. Carly's is a home run every single time. Chef Gabriel is doing magic in that kitchen: try the turkey-proscuitto-avacado sandwich for lunch or the unrealistically good meatball bowl. It's a bowl of meatballs - on special every reverse happy hour (10pm-12am)

Oh, that's the other thing. Their regular happy hour (4-7) has made me a believer in Happy Hour again! INCREDIBLE 1/2 price menu items - like the hummus sampler which includes the best freshly made olive tapenade I've ever tasted. Carly's is the real deal!
