Stayed her for a night while in town. Walking access to downtown Scottsdale. Suites are great and the prices were extremely reasonable. The room is separated (sitting area/bedroom)....Wet bar, work desk, coach, fee for internet, separate bathtub/shower and vanity, accessible balcony. Underground parking with valet available. 2 flat screen LCDs. Starbucks coffee with pastries available from their breakfast station (fee). Had some pluming issues but the staff was extremely responsive and solved issues to our satisfaction. Will stay here again!!
