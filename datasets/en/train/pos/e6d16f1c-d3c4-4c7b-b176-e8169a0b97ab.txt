Agreed with other reviews - small sushi place but just fantastic! Great staff with great attitude throughout. The ingredients are so fresh and tasty. We have dined at many other sushi places throughout the states ...and this one is definitely on top of our list! Some of the food we sampled: seafood salad (great sauce/dressing), sake steamed clams, grilled squid (huge!), yasu roll (cucumber wrapped), spider roll ...Oh yes, and both the chocolate souffle & green tea tiramisu are to die for ...I can't wait to come back for more of this. Recommended!
