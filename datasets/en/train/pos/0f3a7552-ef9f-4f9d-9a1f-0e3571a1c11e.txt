After having a stressful morning with the serpentine belt snapping on my Jeep, going to Inman & Sons made everything better! They were very friendly and honest. The belt was $120 installed which Power Jeep quoted me $210. I chose to go here after reading reviews on Yelp and am sure glad I did. I will be going to Inman from here on out!
