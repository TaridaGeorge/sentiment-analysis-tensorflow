One of my favorite places to eat! Authentic middle eastern food! The iced tea is addicting, i get cravings for just that sometimes! Every time I go in i just cant help myself and order the Vegetarian plate, you get so many choices of delicious food and its all so amazing! I wish it were closer to my house or had delivery, it would be a weekly meal then! I also had them cater baklava for my wedding party and I kid you not the two huge trays we ordered went faster than the alcohol!!! much love for this place... and to add to all the ++++'s they have a store built in so you  can buy alot of the food to make at home as well!!
