I have been here numerous times now and must say  I have never been disappointed.  I love all their dinner specials so far...especially the boneless ribs dinner... YUMMY!  I always seem to get their sangria for a cocktail... it never disappoints.  They seem to have a special every day whether it is half price bottles of wine or $5 burger night.  I have only had desert once... we had ordered that half baked chocolate chip cookie but she accidentally got the sweet potato pie instead.  It was very yummy and on the house for the mistake:).  The service is always spectacular and very friendly.  I suggest you give it a try!  Just not too often because I want to make sure I can still get a seat:)
