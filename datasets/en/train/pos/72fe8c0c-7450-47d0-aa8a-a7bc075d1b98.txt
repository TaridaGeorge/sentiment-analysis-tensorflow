have been here many many times. this is a beautiful place with delicious, delectable food and fabulous service!! even though the name of this restaurant leads you to believe that its only sea food, that is incorrect. this place has top of the line fillets and other such meats, the best side dished i have ever had and perfect sized potions. the best thing to get there is the lobster mashed potatoes. they have large chunks or lobster meat mixed into a delicious batched of creamy mashed potatoes. makes for a fabulous meal! enjoy!!
