Great, low priced services. I recently moved to the Bay Area California and everytime I come back to AZ I make it a priority to come to K Desert Nails. The eyebrow waxing is GREAT...I have many friends that get their brows done here and all are happy. I also LOVE the pedicures because they rub on your legs for like a half hour...totally worth it! As for the other ladies that wrote reviews....for such a low priced place you are being way too picky, and if you are not happy with something you can always tell them and they will fix it. The place is clean and the service is great!
