I was truly impressed by the quality of service and the knowledge of the employees. I have had my ears pierced at Claire's when I was 4 (way to go, Dad!) and an industrial piercing performed at Club Tattoo. I went in to adjust my bar bell for my industrial piercing and they explained a lot of things I had no clue about, like the difference in threading. The place is clean and every one is friendly. I will ONLY ever go to HTC when I need to handle my current piercings or want to get another. Thank you!
