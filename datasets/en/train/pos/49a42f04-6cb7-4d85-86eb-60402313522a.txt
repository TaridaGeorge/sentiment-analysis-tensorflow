We did a gift wrap for the Venture Crew 2147 for black Friday 2011 weekend & we had fun. The customers were AWESOME & the staff very helpful & supportive checking on us. I've done these gift wrapping events on an occasion or two over the years & this was the best experience hands down. Thank you REI for supporting local teen venture crews & being wonderful hosts with generous customers.
