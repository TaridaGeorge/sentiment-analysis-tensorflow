I've been coming here since I was a little girl with my parents.  They have the best hamburgers here that you dress up the way you want.  You can choose from a little one (regular size) and big one (big) and a great big one (HUGE).  Of course whatever condiments you want too.  They have seating outside and the whole place has an old west feel to it.  They only accept cash, but it is totally worth taking a trip to the ATM. Oh yeah, get the zuchini, soooo GOOD!
