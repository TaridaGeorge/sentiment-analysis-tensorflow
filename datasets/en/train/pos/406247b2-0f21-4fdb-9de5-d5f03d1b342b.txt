If I had reviewed Radio Milano last year, it would not have been a fiver.  Seriously though, this place is my new neighborhood favorite.  The staff is exceptional (even when in a long business meeting and ended up not ordering anything), the owners take care of everything, they have a great eye for seeing the flow of the operation.  They added the bar literally overnight, the carpet and booths are a new addition from last year.  Gina is a goddess of a bartender, never missing a beat. And on top of it all - I can walk there!
