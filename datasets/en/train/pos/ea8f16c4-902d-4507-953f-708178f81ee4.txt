I have been going to Arizona Auto Care since about 2002 when I worked in the same complex. I have since worked all around the valley and moved out of state and back and I have always only taken my vehicles there for service! They are honest and professional and always take excellent care of my vehicles. Jeff is one of the owners and a Subaru master tech and has worked on countless Subaru's for me, friends and family! Jeff and team will give you honest and sound advice when fixing your car and not try to oversell you just to make up sales and quotas like the stealerships. Thanks again Jeff, Chris & guys at AZ Auto Care for years of great service and to many more!
