When I lived in AZ, this was my favorite hangout spot.  I really loved the outdoor patio area, except during the middle of the summer.  The food here was pretty decent as well and I found that women here tended to be less snotty than other locations in Scottsdale.  I guess that this wasn't really the spot for all the $35,000 millionaires, but I personally liked it that way.
