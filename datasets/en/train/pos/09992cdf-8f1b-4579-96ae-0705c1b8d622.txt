On our second visit to Soi Four, we ordered the mustard leaf wraps for our appetizer. They are a mixture of shrimp, soy sauce, coconut milk, spices and fruit wrapped in mustard leaves. To die for! Very complex, savory, yet light at the same time.  For our second courses we selected Pad-Thai and a rack of lamb with a ginger rub. The Pad-Thai was the best my friend and I have ever had and we have sampled many between both coasts. My rack of lamb was done to perfection with just the right amount of kick. If you enjoy Thai food at it's best, go to Soi Four.
