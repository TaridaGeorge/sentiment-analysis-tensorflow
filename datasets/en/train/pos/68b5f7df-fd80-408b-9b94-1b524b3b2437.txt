Let me first say, I have never had anything here but wings and curly fries with cheese so I can't comment on anything else. The service is usually friendly, The fries and wings are the best bar food I have found. There is a large variety of sauces for the wings, and always lots of cheese on the fries! great bar food! the televisions always have the games on also which is a plus and you can always see several tv's from wherever you sit.
