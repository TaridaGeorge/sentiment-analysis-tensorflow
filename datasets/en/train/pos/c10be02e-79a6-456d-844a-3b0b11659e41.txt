Awesome hotel. The facilities are nice and the rooms are clean. These guys are really into giving things out for free - free breakfast, free dinner and, oh yea... 3 free cocktails/drinks for each night you stay! They also have discounted rates for MWU students and a free shuttle that takes you to/from campus.  Will definitely stay here again if I'm in the Phoenix area.
