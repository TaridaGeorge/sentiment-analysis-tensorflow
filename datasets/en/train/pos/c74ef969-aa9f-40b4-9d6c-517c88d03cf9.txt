i know the real secret to Matt's Wu-tang Style. 

some people may think Matt's is over rated. but i know that to be false. Matt's is THE BEST BREAKFAST...period. there has not been a single time i was unhappy with the service, price, or wait. 
i would wait an hour, heck two hours if need be. 

the 5-spot is by far my favorite breakfast item. its like a full on taste cell orgy. with over 50 taste cells per taste bud and a human tongue containing several million taste buds you have to figure that is alot of ecstasy in your mouth. 

if i could justify the time spent waiting as a business expense i would be there every morning. 

Matt and Erenia have a great thing going here.
