I take my Honda here all the time and I love it. They are always speedy and honest, they never make unnecessary charges or repairs. I don't know if this is really testimony but my Honda is a 96 Accord, still runs perfectly, and has gone to Hon-Amotive all 15 years of its life!

Frank (the main dude) is also pretty hilarious. He's really old, and very nice. There is a sign behind his desk that says "PLEASE SPEAK UP FRANK IS HARD OF HEARING." Cracks me up.
