I usually go to this DD on the way to a friend's, work, etc. It's definitely my favorite location. There's one guy that works there, I think he's the manager or something, named Woody. He's way too awesome. All of the crew there at this location are super nice! A few times they asked for the wrong amount or forgot to give me my other drink, etc. But I forgive them, out of the (perhaps) 100 times I've been there this has happened sparingly and I haven't seen those forgetful employees more than a few times. Whenever I hand them one of my (many) punch cards, they'll give me an extra credit or two. I'll always be a return customer as long as they're this nice!
