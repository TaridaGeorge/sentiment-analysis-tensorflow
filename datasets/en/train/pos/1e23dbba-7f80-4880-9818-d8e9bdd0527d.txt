Elie's is the best in town! I love the feta gyro and the mixed meat salad. The pita bread is light and fluffy and the hummus is excellent! All are FANTASTIC! Portions are big. Customer service is wonderful! It is a little high in cost, but well worth it. You will wait a while for your food too, but what do you expect from a 2 person establishment? So call ahead if you're in a hurry, and don't forget to bring cash!
