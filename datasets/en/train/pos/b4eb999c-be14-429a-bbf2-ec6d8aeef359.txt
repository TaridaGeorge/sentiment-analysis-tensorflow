Gourmet sandwiches? done and done. this place does not skimp on the toppings.  The Bobby is my fav, with turkey and stuffing and cranberry sauce.  Thanksgiving every time.  Great every time.  Really good, really good service, really high quality product.  I belong to the text club and get free drinks and chips, so its and even better deal.  Love this place for a fast meal.
