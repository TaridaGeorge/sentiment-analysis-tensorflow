For the time being this place gets a rare 5 stars, because they're doing pretty well with what they got to work with, and they're bringing in sick musicians.  I gotta say I've really enjoyed the music there as of late, and hope they keep it up.  

That being said they don't seem to be up to snuff on their boast of over a 100 beers etc, hope to see that remedied.
