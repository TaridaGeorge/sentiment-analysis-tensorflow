This place looks like an Old Taco Bell and the inside is clean but, unremarkable.
However, we had several different dishes and I have to say all were A+.
The Pho veggie soup was hearty and divine.  My friend had the soup with all the meat (tripe) ugh.. but, she devoured it and said it was the best she has had.   I had the Mongollon beef..  wow.. was unexpectedly yummy..  The service was fast and the price was fair...
