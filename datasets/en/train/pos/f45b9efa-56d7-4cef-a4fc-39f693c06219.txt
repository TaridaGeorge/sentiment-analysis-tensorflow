Great authentic Hong Kong food.  I don't like all of the food they serve, but the stuff I order is the exceptional.  This is one of those "hole in the wall" places with great food. I highly recommend the Chow Fun, the Hunan Beef, ginger and green onion snapper (fried)...

This is one of my favorite spots.

We have been visiting this place once or twice a week and we are still loving it.  I just added sesame chicken to the rotation and it is also amazing.  We love this place.
