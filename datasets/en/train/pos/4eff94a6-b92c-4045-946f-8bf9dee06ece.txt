this place is a mob scene and the waitresses are ALL so indifferent and wierd. I always hate ordering from a waitress here. But I love the atmosphere and they have such great beer that who cares. Im actually so used to lousy customer service in Phx that it just seems normal to me now when I go out. Last time I was here I got to park right in front of the door!
