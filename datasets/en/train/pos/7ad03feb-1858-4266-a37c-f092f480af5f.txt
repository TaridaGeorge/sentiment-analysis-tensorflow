Stopped in here a few weeks back and it was great! The owners were very nice and friendly, seemed very knowledgeable about the food. I was excited seeing a huge smoker on a trailer in the parking lot. We ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwiches and the mac n cheese. Both were great! The meat was very soft and tender and the sauce was great! Very flavorful, spicy and had a nice kick to it. I'd definitely go back the next time I'm in the area.
