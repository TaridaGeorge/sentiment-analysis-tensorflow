I love this place! When you walk in the door, you feel as though you're in a 1960s film. It's old school, not like "fusion" places that are rampant as all get out. The service is always wonderful; the chicken curry is wonderful. My husband loved the mayo shrimp. The portions are large too. I loved the mango sorbet--delectable. And my daughter had the coconut sorbet, which is handmade on premises, and it was superb. Very clean, very friendly, and it's geographically desirable.

I'd like to add that I'm from the Detroit area. Really good Chinese there. When I moved here 16 years ago, the Chinese food disappointed me---THEY USED CELERY! Yuck. So now I judge places by that. Sesame Inn does not use celery, as far as I know.
