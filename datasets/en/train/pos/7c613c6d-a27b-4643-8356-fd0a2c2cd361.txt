I love Boba Juice. I haven't had the food yet, but the boba tea and smoothies are excellent. They have several smoothie/tea options at a fair price, and the service is excellent. 

I have to agree with the masses and recommend the taro coconut smoothie. The mango and strawberry banana smoothies are also great.

Check it out - you won't be disappointed.
