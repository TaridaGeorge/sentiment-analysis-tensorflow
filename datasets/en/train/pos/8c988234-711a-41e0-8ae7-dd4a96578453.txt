You know what you're getting when you go to a Subway. This location is fast, clean, and gives good service for the 5 minutes you talk to them while ordering. I love Subway in general if you're in a pinch and want something healthy. They're everywhere so it shouldn't be a problem to find one, and the food is the same at all of them.
