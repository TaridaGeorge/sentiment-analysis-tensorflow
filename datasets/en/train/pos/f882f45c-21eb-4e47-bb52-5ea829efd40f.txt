I got so excited when Torched Goodness started coming to the Ahwatukee Farmers Market!! I would love to go to the Downtown market 
( I'm also dying to try  a Shortleash Hotdog!) but unfortunately I can't for now.

I tried several samples and they were all delicious. My absolute favorite is cappucino. It's amazing! My favorite ice cream flavor is Haagen Dazs coffee and this tastes like that but a million times better. Very creamy, not overtly sweet, just perfect. The size is right as well and I love that Chef Eric devised a clever way to get your creme brulee to go.

So if you run into the Torched Goodness truck, do yourself a favor and get some creme brulee!!
