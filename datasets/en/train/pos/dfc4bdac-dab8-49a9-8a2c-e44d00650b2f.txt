My only wish would be that there was one of these in Huntington Beach, Ca. We were tired, hot and hungry after the Cubs/Angels spring training game, and searched on yelp for the best Pizza place nearby, we drove by a few, and being a little picky..we thank goodness waited til we saw Oregano's. I am so glad we did. The service was awesome, Meagan from Colorado, a senior at ASU was our waitress, and was so great!
2 managers walked by at different times asking how we were doing, as i said great service.
The food was excellent! the thin crust Pizza was the best i have had.
Just wish there was one closer so we could try more of the menu.
