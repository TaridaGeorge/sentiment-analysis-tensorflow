i needed my BBQ fix so.. to the Frog it was. The drinks continue to be made well, the service great and the BBQ (OK, and a bite of my friend's sandwich) was the best. I love the sauce, the beans are always great as was the taters and gravy. I do love going back to this place as it's not a chain, owners that care, a staff that's into serving people and with enough TVs to watch any game and relax in a smaller setting. Could become a regular.  :-)
