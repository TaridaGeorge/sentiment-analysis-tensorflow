Breakfast. Go for Breakfast! -choose one of the innocuous seeming egg and potatoes breakfasts, w/ biscuits and a side order of gravy.  It's $6.75, and you may think it will all fit on one plate. However, you'll quickly note that there's twice as many hash-browns as anywhere else, and the food is incredibly fresh. Everything home-style. There's no way you'll finish it or find a place that tops.

...service and coffee is great too.
