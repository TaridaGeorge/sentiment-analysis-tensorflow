I so don't usually do places like this but I have to say it's pretty damn good. The service is great, the prices are very reasonable and the food is awesome.

I have a friend who always wants to meet here and I went for my second time today. I had the ham and cheese sandwich with the tomato bread salad- kicked ass.... and it was like $7!

The service has been really good both times I've been, the people that bring the food to you have a real smile, and when they ask if there is anything else they can get you- they actually stand still long enough to listen to your answer. 

I am so sick of going to places that are so busy being really cool and overpriced that they forget to give you good food so this place is refreshing- Score Wildflower Bread Company!
