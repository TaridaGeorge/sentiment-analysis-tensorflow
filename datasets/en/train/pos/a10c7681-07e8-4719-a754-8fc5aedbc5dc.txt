Went here for sisters birthday last Wednesday and we all had a great time! We had about 15 guests and we all shared 3-4 different entree's as a group. Excellent service by Ricky, he was very patient and anything we wanted he was sure to help us with and did it in a prompt manner. The food was amazing like always and we left very full and happy!
