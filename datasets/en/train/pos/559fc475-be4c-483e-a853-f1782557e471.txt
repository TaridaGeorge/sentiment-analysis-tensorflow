I've been here three to four times now and have gotten the Italian Bomber, Sparky, and Phoenix.  Haven't had a chance to try any hot sandwiches yet, but these cold sandwiches were great!  Service was friendly and very quick.  The sandwich - loaded with lots of deli meat, the bread (wheat and white) is nice and soft, and the house dressing they put on them is the perfect touch to top it off.  A "shorty" sub (half footer) is more than enough food for most people and comes in at around $5-$6.  Great price for a sandwich with much more substance and character than a $5 footlong.  Go try one now!
