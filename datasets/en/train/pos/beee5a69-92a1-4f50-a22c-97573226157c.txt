i've eaten here all 3 times i've visited scottsdale. my most recent visit to scottsdale was 50% motivated by wanting to eat here (i had free plane tix). my faves (must try's) are the stetson chopped (which i often make at home cuz i crave it so much), the mushroom pan fry and the pig 'n puddin'. i also *loved* the bacon brittle i bought because they were out of the bacon chocolate chip cookies. i've also tried the duck of the sea and buffalo carpaccio, but they were "just" good. the cuppa' red hot chocolate had a wonderful flavor, but i couldn't quite finish it cuz it was very rich. love the fun atmosphere here too.
