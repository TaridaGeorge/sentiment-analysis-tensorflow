Love Bookman's! Forget spending $5 for a magazine, they usually have current issues for $1.50. I go here for all my daughter's english books and usually save about 75%. She especially likes that since they're used some times there's already annotations in the books that help in class. Bookman's also carries a large selection of musical instruments, video games, and random items. They sponser the occasional event and allow pets in the building.
