5 Stars - Probably one of the best BBQ in the valley...yes even better than Joe's BBQ...the cornbread and butter makes my mouth salivate...nowhere else does cornbread taste so good.  The spicy BBQ sauce is the best in the valley.  The meat quality is good, the BBQ sauce is what makes this place 5 stars.

0 Stars - Problem is it is CLOSED forever.  spot is available for lease.
