we went here our last night in Scottsdale and the other reviews are right, this place rocks.  Everything we ordered was perfect and delicious and the service was awesome.  Our waiter even bought us dessert.  Coming from Chicago we had high expectations as we have a ton of good steakhouses here, however this was really a fantastic meal!!  The best part is they are opening in Chicago this summer...woo hoo!!
