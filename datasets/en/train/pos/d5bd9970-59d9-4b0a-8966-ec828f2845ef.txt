A walk around the Riparian Preserve had given us an appetite, so we stopped in here for dinner. As soon as I saw the Yelp sticker on the door, I knew we were in for a good meal. 

Above the ordering counter are TV screens featuring the episode of DD&D they were on. It was because of these (and my general level of starvation at the time) that I was willing to cough up the funds for an $8 burger.

While it wasn't as mouth-wateringly delicious as a BluBurger, it was certainly tasty, as were the sweet potato fries. My friend ordered the ribs, which she loved, and which have fed her for several meals since. Also, the regular fries are deelish.

One oddity is that all the drinks and condiments are outside. I wonder how the mayo holds up in 115Â° weather?
