I  came in the other day and had the BEST experience.   Everyone was genuine, friendly and nice and my (plaid!) toes are too cute!  This salon is out of my way, but I will be coming back and bringing others anyhow!   Love the artistry of the designs and I have had many pedicures, but not once have I felt like so much time and attention was paid.   Thanks!
