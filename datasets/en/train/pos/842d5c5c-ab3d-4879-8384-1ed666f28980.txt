Tasted their food at Yelps pleydate.  They were sampling some awesome meatballs and raviolis.  They also handed out a coupon for a free pizza.  Their location is across town, but decided to give it a try hoping that their pizza would be as good as their samples from the event.  

Excellent pie.  If you like Girmaldis style pizza, you have to check this place out.  There is a Girmaldis closer to my house, but I would rather drive here for pizza.  Great crust and the mozzarella is outstanding.  This is our new favorite pizza place in town.
