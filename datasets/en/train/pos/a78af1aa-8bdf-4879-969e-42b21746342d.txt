I've now been to Noca a few times and it is hands down without a doubt my new favorite restaurant.  I can't even describe how phenomenal their food is, but it is expensive and to do it correctly, you are going to spend over $60 per person (especially if you consume any alcohol).  The menu is constantly evolving although they have a lobster special on Wednesday's and their version of a cheese steak on Thursday's, both of which are simply sublime.  On top of having the most sensational and creative food, the service is top notch and you can't beat the hip atmosphere, although the crowd is usually a little older than myself.  But who cares!??!!  If I had $100 left to my name, I'd spend it here.  Seriously.
