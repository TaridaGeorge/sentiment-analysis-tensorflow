We are visiting from Minnesota and staying in Scottsdale.  There aren't many places that deliver, but thank goodness we found Joe's!

The pizza came promptly and it was very tasty.  For a huge pizza and salad, it cost $28.   

Laurie, the girl on the phone was courteous and friendly.  She even threw in a piece of the thick crust pizza for us to try.  She also asked if we were sure we wanted the thick crust b/c it is really thick.  I'm glad she included the piece because it was thick, like pound cake and we were pleased she warned us.  The thin crust was perfect.

If you're in Scottsdale, go to Joe's website and you won't be disappointed.
