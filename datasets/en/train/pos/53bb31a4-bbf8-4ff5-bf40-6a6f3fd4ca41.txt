I thought I had a find, but look at all the prior reviews!   I just don't understand why they aren't all fives.   Maybe because this is a family style place and not a yelpie-yuppie date night joint.

I live too far away to visit regularly and have only been the once.  The wife, kids and grandkids all loved our varied orders and the pizza is outstanding with a just-right hint of yeast.

If gas prices ever come down again I will be making special trips to this place.
