LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!! I had never eaten Ethiopian food before and this place has me hooked. Since I've eaten here I've been a bit more adventurous but I keep going back because there is no taste like their food. Their Rose Water Lemonade just adds to the unique-ness of this place. You have your option to sit at a regular dining table or sit at a tradition Ethopian table. 

At times the service can be a bit and off but the food makes up for that. I don't eat meat so the fact that they have such a large variety of veggie choices makes it all the worth while for me. They give good size portions of everything and if you let them know that there is something wrong they set out to fix for you right away. 

I absolutely recommend Blue Nile!
