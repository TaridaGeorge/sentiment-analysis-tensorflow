It is always crowded yet I have never felt rushed. This is the only place where I have gotten a pedicure and they actually cut my toenails super short as requested, yet my nails don't ache later or cut into my skin as they grow. My last pedicure was November 27th and it still looks good! My daughter is visiting and will attempt to get in there today.
