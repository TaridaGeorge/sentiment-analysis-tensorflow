We had a truly five-star dining experience on New Year's Eve at this restaurant!  We arrived early during what is normally Happy Hour, but our server, Steve, and the chef accommodated our request for dinner entrees.  The service was impeccable and the food was phenomenal.  My husband had the short ribs and said they were the best he had ever experienced and I had the chicken/chorizo penne pasta, which was out of this world!  If you like spicy, I guarantee you will love this entree.  Everything about our dining experience was perfect, right down to the deep-fried chocolate banana dessert!  Arrive with an appetite and high expectations . . . you will NOT be disappointed!
