One of my favorites, eat here all the time. Locals restaurant. Great service, friendly and efficient servers. Food is exceptional from the steak tacos to the burgers and daily specials. The owner Sheldon is always there which is why it is so successful. Ask for Amy, Jose,Becca or Natalie. Sunday brunch is great too. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. The best of the best!!!!!!!
