I love Villa Deli! Always clean, always fresh and always friendly. A bit on the spendy side for a sandwich shop, but they use very high quality ingredients so ya gets whats ya pays for, capiche? 

Get the chicken parm or the Italian, both are great but really anything would be good on their bread. Just wish they were open on Sunday. Oh, grab some meatballs to go too, they will supe-up any of your homemade dishes quite nicely.
