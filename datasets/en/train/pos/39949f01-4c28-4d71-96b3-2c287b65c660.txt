Great hidden treasure.  Go there now, it wont be long before the entire valley finds out about this place.  

I LOVE the essence of this place.  This is exactly what we need as a developing restaurant city.  Charming, high quality products and OWNER occupied (Refreshing).  From the moment you walk through the door, you know this place is different.  Rustic Charm.....  This owner backs it up with great personal service and a high quality pie.  NOTE TO OWNER - RAISE YOUR PRICES!!!  Yes, $12 was the most expensive on menu....  I thought it would 7 inches....  Great value but I felt guilty.  

Try this spot out.  I hear they are opening for lunch in October!!!
