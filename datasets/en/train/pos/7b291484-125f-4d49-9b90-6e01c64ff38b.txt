This place is quickly becoming a favorite.  Tried it with a co-worker on a Wednesday then took the wife back for breakfast on the next Sunday.  both breakfast and lunch were outstanding.  I have had a club sandwitch before but something about the flavors in Hers that just put it way better than any other I have had.  can't wait to try more things.
