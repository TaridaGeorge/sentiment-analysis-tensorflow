My first time here, and I loved it. My family came with me, including my husband, 2 young sons and my mother in law. The kids played with the puzzle and coloring books making it nice for the adults to talk. The best part of our experience was being about to go outside and enjoy the garden area. Overgrown trees shade the cobblestone walk. They have cages outside filled with birds for everyone to enjoy. It was a great way to spend sunday morning. The food was huge portions, and I will be back next weekend for sure.
