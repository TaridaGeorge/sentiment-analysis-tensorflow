Excellent food and well worth the wait when they're crowded. Probably the 'hidden jewel' of Italian in all metro Phoenix and offers a wonderful atmosphere of fine dining with a very friendly, down-home staff. I'm 100% Italian from the East Coast and still have a hard time finding good Italian food in Phoenix....but this restaurant certainly can challenge!
