Run don't walk to the Scottsdale BevMo...Don't go here for wine..there are too many great places for that go here for the Liquor and beer selection..This is the ultimate shop for both at least at Scottsdale and Shea.  Looking for that rum from Haiti(yup they have it!)  Want that hard to find Bourbon they have it...My liver alternately hurts and leaps for joy when I walk in here!.  Service stinks generally but hey so what they have everything and then some..Want your beer or wine cold they have it in the cooler in the back.  Need some cigars and cheese..got it.  Really everytime I go I discover something new to like here. Cheers!
