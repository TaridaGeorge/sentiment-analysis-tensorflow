I used to frequent Stinkweeds in Tempe, almost on a weekly basis. I don't listen to mainstream music so when I found the store years back, I was overjoyed and almost in tears. The staff here are extremely knowledgeable in finding you the most obscure, interesting music. If you're into experimental music, this would be a great place to shop for.

Some of the CD's I got here:
Deer Hoof
Sunny Day Real Estate
The Flaming Lips
Modest Mouse (before they went mainstream)
Queens of the Stone Age
Pixies (Anything Frank Black)
And 80 more....

Two thumbs - way up!
