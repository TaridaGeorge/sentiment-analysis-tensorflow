Great service, great vets with great personalities...brought my 2 dogs there for senior checkups. I have been going to another practice and I was not happy with the service. Foothills service is excellent and I will be going there for now on. They do not push anything on you there and do not do any un-needed tests. They cleaned my dogs teeth really good. I wish they were open 24 hours for emergency services.
