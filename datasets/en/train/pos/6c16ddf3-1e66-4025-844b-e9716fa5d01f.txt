The service was great and the food was even better!!! I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!
Coming from out of town to visit family they took us to My Big Fat Greek Restaurant, one of their favorite local restaurants. I ordered the Greek Salad and the Grilled Chicken. The portions were HUGE, and everything on my plate was amazing!!!! Our server was extremely friendly and took great care of us.
