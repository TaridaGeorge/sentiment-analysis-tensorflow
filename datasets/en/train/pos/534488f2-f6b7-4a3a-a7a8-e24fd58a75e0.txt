OMG!  I have to say this is hands down the best resort I've ever stayed!!!  I felt very relaxed when I left.  

10+different pools, volleyball in the pools, the spa was very relaxing, the resort was very scenic and gorgeous, the staff was friendly, nightly entertainment was alot of fun, work out facilities was clean, the had bike rentals, golf course, meals was excellent... must I go on??  

We stayed here twice and a great experience EVERY time!!!
