I am one of those that fears the dentist and as a result haven't gone for years.  I went in and everyone was so easy going and helpful.  They were friendly and didn't make me feel like scum for not having gone to the dentist for such a long time.  WHEW!  Now that the initial visit is over I can relax knowing I'm in good hands!
