We have been going to Gold Medal Swim School for 3 1/2 years now with both of my children and they have been wonderful!  They have worked with both of my children and took a special interest in their individual needs.  The instructors are warm and helpful as well as keep you up to date on your child's progress.  They focus on safety as well as feeling comfortable in the water without causing fear and anxiety.  Everyone is warm and friendly.  The facility is beautiful, clean and inviting.  It is worth every penny!
