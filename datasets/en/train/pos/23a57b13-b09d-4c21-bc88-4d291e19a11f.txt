Hot dang diggity dawg, this is as good as it gets!

In all seriousness, throw any of your plans for tonight out the window and go to Nick's. Their pizza is superb, their bread is binge-worthy, and the wait is short. Even their plain cheese pizza has a similar taste to my various fantasies of feasts in the heavenly afterlife.

They also have a variety of pasta dishes and other fancy Italian things. Whatever. I just love the pizza.
