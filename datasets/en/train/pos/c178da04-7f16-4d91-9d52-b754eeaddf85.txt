Well Fox Concepts has done it again! I went for my second time with my husband for lunch . I had yesterdays soup , Minestrone soup with Italian sausage and he had the Cheeseburger.  The Cheeseburger was the best i ever had , it topped Flemming's cheeseburger, if you could imagine. The fries are thin cut and perfectly seasoned , not too salty. The soup , oh man, had roasted veggies and the perfect amount of fresh northern beans and lil Italian sausage meatballs. I am for sure going to figure out how to master the recipe.
