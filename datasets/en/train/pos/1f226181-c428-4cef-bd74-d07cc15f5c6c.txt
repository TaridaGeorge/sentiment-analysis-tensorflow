I LOVE this venue! I had been dying to see something here for years, and finally we saw Regina Spektor last fall. The tickets were a little pricey but they were more than worth it. 

All I can honestly say is that her performance changed my life. I don't know if it was the beautiful venue, her powerful voice, or the perfect ambiance, but something left an impression on me. You know, like the feeling you get after watching a really deep movie. 

I highly recommend seeing anything here.
