Yep, solid 5 stars again.  Two for two visits-- does that mean 10 stars???

I struggled to not order the Rosa.  This time I went with the Sonny Boy and was not disappointed.  Just the right amount of (wonderful) salami.

Don't dink around with the choices.  As per my previous review I will say again: "trust the artistry".  

Seldom will you find a crust this good, and almost never will you find it this well prepared.  Notice the indifferently blackened crust in the  photo, and on YOUR pie.  Just GO there!
