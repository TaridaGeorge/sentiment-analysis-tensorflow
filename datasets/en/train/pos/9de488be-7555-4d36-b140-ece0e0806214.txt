I have been to St. Francis about 5 times now and every time I am completely satisfied with everything from the ambiance, to the service, to the amazing food.  I want to touch on just one menu item, the Eggs Benedict.  I haven't been able to eat said food for about 5 years now after a horrible food poisoning experience in Mexico brought on by bad hollandaise.  It is my fiance's favorite breakfast food and every time he orders it I try it and every time I can barely choke it down.  Not the case here!  I tried it, I loved it, I wish I ordered it myself!  I ate not only a bite or two of his, but our dining companion as well.  Just thinking about it right now makes my mouth water.  In a good way.
