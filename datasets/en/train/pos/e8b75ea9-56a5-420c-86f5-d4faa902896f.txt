Thanks again Yelp.  While staying in the area for a few days I tried the Liberty Market, based on the Yelp reviews, and they were right on.  Had a delicious wood fired oven pizza featuring Schreiner's Italian sausage, which I assume to be a local company.  It was fantastic, even the ricotta cheese, which I had been a bit leery of.  The rice pudding I had for dessert was spot-on also.  I also poached a couple of meatballs from someone's pasta plate and they were juicy, delicious and tender.  And I couldn't help but notice the pleasant and helpful staff.  Looking forward to a return trip to the Phoenix area.
