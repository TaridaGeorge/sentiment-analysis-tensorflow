My husband and I have both visited Italy and tasted their world renowned gelato.  Walking into Cool Gelato Italiano was like a step back into our time in Rome.  Seriously, from the kind owners, the authentic gelato and general good vibe we wanted to move to Scottsdale!  Alas, we are living in the lovely state of Washington...but we highly recommend anyone visiting the Scottsdale are to seek out Cool Gelato Italiano!
