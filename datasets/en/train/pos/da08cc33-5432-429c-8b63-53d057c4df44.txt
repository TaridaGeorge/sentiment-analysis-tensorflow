Two for one drinks on Halloween for dressing up like Lisa "left eye" Lopes (the "L" of TLC). I was happy, but it was dead. Fez is awesome for Happy Hour, as others have mentioned, I never really bother with the food... maybe I ought to. 

The margaritas and a lot of other drinks come with interesting and tasty accents, like wedges of grapefruit and sour gummy worms. I am the type to always eat the salad on the plate, so the high-quality garnishes are appreciated. 

I met yelper Kristin S. here last night, who took a photo of my friend (Sara B.) and I in our costumes. Hope it wasn't for sinister purposes! Ha!
