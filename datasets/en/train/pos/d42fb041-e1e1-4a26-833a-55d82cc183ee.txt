5 stars, without hesitation.  

I got exactly the cut I wanted, the ladies there were friendly and the shop was clean, well-lit, open and airy.  The price was reasonable.  All in all, a top-line operation.  I'm not from around here, but if I'm in the area again and need a haircut, this is where I will come.

One thing to know is that the shop can't be seen from Dysart.  They are actually on the north side of Van Buren, a couple of hundred feet west of Dysart.  Look for the "BARBER" sign.
