We come here a LOT. The wait is never too long (though if it was it'd still be worth it). The food is great. The service is fast. And the beer is GOOD.

I love the Peach Ale. Kilt Lifter is obviously a staple. 

Being a vegetarian often relegates you to the fried, unhealthy food, but not here! SOOO many vegetarian options! These are my favorites so far: Nacho plate (HUGE portion, and mighty tasty), the Mediterranean pizza sub sundried tomatoes for the chicken, AND drum roll please...beer fries (we get these EVERY time, and yes ok they are fried...)!!! 

The salads are good, the vegetarian burger was ok (a little soggy). I have yet to try the desserts but oh do they tempt me! I see you tiramisu with oatmeal stout!
