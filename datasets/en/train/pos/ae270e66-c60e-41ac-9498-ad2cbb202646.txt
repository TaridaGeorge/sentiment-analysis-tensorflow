I think this is one of the best Chinese Food restaurants I have ever eaten at. The staff is always friendly, the food is always excellent tasting and the speed of service is outstanding. I have eaten here over the past 3 years and I still drive back to this restaurant even though I don't live in the neighborhood anymore.
