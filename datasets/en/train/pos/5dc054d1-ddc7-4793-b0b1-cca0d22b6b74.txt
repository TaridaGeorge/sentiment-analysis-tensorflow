I love this place so much. Yes, it smells like Indian spices when you walk in...but hey it is an Indian restaurant and it is the way it should smell!

The owners are often working the dining room and are SO nice. Their service is attentive without being overbearing. At one point, my husband and I went so often they knew us by name!

What here is good? let me tell ya...

Spinach Saag
Bhegan Bartha
Chicken Masala 
Tandoori Chicken
Appetizers (esp. the little chickpea fried fritters)
Garlic Naan
the rice bryani dishes

These are my favs, though I have never had anything bad here. I personally prefer the dinner to the buffet, which is very good. I think the dinner food is just a smidge tastier though.  Will always be my go to place when I need an Indian food fix!!
