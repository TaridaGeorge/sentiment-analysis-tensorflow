If you haven't been here for the 4th of July, you are missing out.  Very cool fireworks shot over the resort lagoon on each of three nights before the 4th, playing "Born in the USA" and "America" to match the fireworks.  Fireworks that look and sway like palm trees!  All sandwiched between two sets of a different band style each night.--Beatles, Bowie, etc.  Fantastic food and service at Bourbon Steak, not to mention the very best dessert ever.

Thank you Fairmont Princess for a classy, family friendly celebration.  You really went all out and we appreciate it!  Everyone should come here.  Great Willow Stream Spa, with Yoga. Huge, gorgeous grounds unmatched in the Scottsdale area.

Don't miss it.
