This is a very odd, disgusting, wonderful, enchanting, engaging, and dark neighborhood bar experience.  It's a hole, and a hole I love.  I go there a lot, with my firends and family - and now my son (since the smoke is no longer inside).

The food is remarkable. I don't know how they do it, they have the BEST food - with roast beef cut right off the roast and the GREEK salad is awesome.  It's great food at a great price, with the neighborhood clientele, a juke box, darts and pool - that my son can hang out and play with us.

I am not exactly hot and I get great service - tableside even!  I think it helps if you are nice...so be nice to the people who work there, and they will be nice back to you.  Funny how that works!
