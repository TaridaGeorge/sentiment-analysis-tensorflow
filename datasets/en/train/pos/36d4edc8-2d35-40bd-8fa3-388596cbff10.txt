Scrumptious!

How to dine at HOT:

+The food is delicious and fantastic so order everything on the menu once and then repeat

+The service is lackluster and leaves much to be desired.  Make sure you have some leisurely time or let the staff know from the beginning you are on a time crunch

+Go to lunch to sample a few things for a great deal

+Go to dinner to splurge for a special occasion

+Bring quarters for the meters in the daytime

+Order the Chicken Schwarma Salad - you won't regret it and you'll think about it often

+Check out the daily quiche offering - it's all the rave

+Enjoy
