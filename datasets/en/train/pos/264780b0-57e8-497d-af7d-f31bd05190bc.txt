La Promesa is a great bakery.  The empanadas here and at La Purisima are the best around, perfect flakey crust combined with delectable fillings.  Strawberry, lemon, apple, cherry, pineapple, all scrumptious and free of preservatives.  This place is great if your in the east side and can't get to La Purisima in Glendale, both shops are family owned and are of equal quality.
