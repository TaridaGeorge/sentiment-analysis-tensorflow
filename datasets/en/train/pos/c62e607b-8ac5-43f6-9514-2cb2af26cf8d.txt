I've been to Carly's a few times now. I really like coming here before Diamondback baseball games since it's so close to chase field and filing up on great food. I usually get the same thing, Southwest Chicken Sandwich (It's too good to try something else!) The panini bread is made fresh, locally and if I remember correctly it's organic. Some of the best bread I have ever had. The chicken is full of flavor and the toppings are always fresh. I also LOVE hummus and can be pretty critical with it. The hummus here is pretty tasty too!
