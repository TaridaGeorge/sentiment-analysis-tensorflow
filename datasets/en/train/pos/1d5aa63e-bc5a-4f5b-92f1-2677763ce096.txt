This is exactly the sort of place that was missing when I moved here. There is a lack of good, inexpensive, casual dining in the west valley.

The pizza is excellent, thin crust with just the right chew and crispness from the oven. Toppings are delicious, I especially like the meatballs on the pizza.

The Subs and Sandwiches are very reasonably priced and extremely good. I have had the B.M.T and cheese steak, both were delicious. Subs come with "The Works" which really puts them over the top.
