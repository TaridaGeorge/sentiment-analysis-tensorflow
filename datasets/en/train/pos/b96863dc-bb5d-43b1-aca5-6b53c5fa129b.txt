Finally! An amazing place to get fantastic BBQ sandwiches in Phoenix! I went here for the first time a few weeks back (totally blanked out on the Yelp reviewing).  Some co-workers suggested we go there, saying it was one of the best places in The Valley for pork BBQ. They were right!

It's a tiny restaurant, and chances are you've driven by it a couple times but just have never noticed it. It's nothing fancy inside, just great service, great food and happy customers. I had one of the massive pork BBQ sandwiches on the menu and had flashbacks of the days when I lived in the Carolinas. MmmMmm deee-licious!

I could go on all day writing about how good Honey Bear's is, but I'll just let you go try it for yourself. Go on! Go!
