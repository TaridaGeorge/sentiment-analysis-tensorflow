Let me just start by saying a YUM! The burger is flame broiled juicy and seasoned just right. I like mine with crispy bacon and cheese. The cheese is gooey and melted by the delicious greasyness of it all! The fries are fat and go great with the greasy, juicy yummyness!

If you want a tasty fat juicy burger go see Lenny! They also have a drive through at this location. Perfect on my way home.
