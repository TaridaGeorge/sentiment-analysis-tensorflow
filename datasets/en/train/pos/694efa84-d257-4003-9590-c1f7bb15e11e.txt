What more would you want in a spa? Spa Avania has everything a girl could ever want and more...

During my stay at the hotel, we were able to visit the spa three times. Two amazing massages later, spending time in the relaxing mineral pool, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and using all the amenities, including the workout room, I was definitely pleased. They even had fireplaces near the pool for those cooler afternoon/evenings.

I was quite relaxed after this experience, had a big smile on my face and never wanted to leave.
