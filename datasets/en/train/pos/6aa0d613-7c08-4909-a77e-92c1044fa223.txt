3rd Thursday....WOOHOO!  what a concept!! I really love it, I just wish I know more local streets to figure out and plan better for the game, but it's tough for out of towner like me. 

Still, I had awesome time running, boozing, and chillin with likeminded folks in Tempe. 

I agree with other Yelpers, BEST to buy the shirt & beer mug kit before the race.  

Oh and store workers were great, very knowledgeable and had good selection of shoes & items to empty out my wallet before my flight home, thx. 

Get some!!
