This is the BEST mall I have ever been too!!!  And I've been to plenty - whoo!  I was in HEAVEN!  They have everything!  Holy moly.  I couldn't even get through the whole thing in two days - well.....I wasn't there ALL day, but still.  I would have gone broke.  I felt like I was in Vegas - eyes all wide and mouth hung open with credit card in hand.  Dangerous.

This seriously tops as my fav mall, beating out San Diego favs.  I will return to Scottsdale just to come here....and hopefully with better self control. lol.
