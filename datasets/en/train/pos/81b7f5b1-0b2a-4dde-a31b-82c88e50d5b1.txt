It no longer carries Crave ice cream  :(
[[update: actually it does now! woohooo!]]

BUT!  I went to the wine bar this past weekend, and it surprised my socks off.  They then asked me to put my socks back on, which I did reluctantly, and poured me a $10 flight of 4 choose-your-own wines.  That's a good price!  The artisan cheese plate for just under $7 was also a steal!  All this just surprised me because the grocery prices are quite high, and then I discover these bargain basement prices in the wine bar.  Awesome.

To top it off was a flaky cinnamon baklava.  Just sayin'.
