No frills diner with great breakfast. The biscuits and gravy are the best in town. The green chile shredded beef omelet is often one of the specials and is my husband's favorite. Lines can be long on Sunday morning, but they work to get you in fast. Try the counter for a shorter wait. The cinnamon rolls are huge and delicious. I've been here over twenty times and never had a bad meal.
