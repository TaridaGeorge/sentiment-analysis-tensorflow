Often I don't write a review for a place that has so many reviews. What's mine matter right? But, I went here a couple months ago and this place left a lasting impression. 

You see I love salad and all, but typically refuse to order it at a restaurant, unless it's a side, but the Mixed Greens salad is so delicious. It's perfectly balanced. In fact, it's so good I duplicated it at home, because I loved it so much. 

The bartenders were really sweet and really cute, and the service in general was awesomeness starting with the hostess on down. I also tried a sandwich and had a nice piece of cheese with some honey for dessert.

Everything was great and it made it worth the wait, because you will have to wait for a seat most likely.
