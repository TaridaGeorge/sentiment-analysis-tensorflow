I've come here for breakfast after a few late nights. For days after my visit, I often find myself dreaming about the chocolate chip pancakes. Fantasizing. VISIONS.

In all reality, the breakfast here is pretty damn good. I order the chocolate chip pancake stack with a side of scrambled eggs and sausage links. This order brings me into a state of euphoria that often lasts for an hour after the meal.

If you wanna get your breakfast euphoria on, visit this place, but don't take any of my chocolate chip pancakes.
