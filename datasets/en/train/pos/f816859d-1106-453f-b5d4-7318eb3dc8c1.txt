Another shout out to how much I LOVE this place...it gives me hope for the Phoenix metro area. But most importantly the bruschetta is awesome. I was here with a larger group this past time - 7 or 8 of us on a Friday night. It was loud on a Friday and all, but the service was prompt and they had a table ready for us since we called ahead. As always the food and wine were stellar. 

Whenever I am in PHX this place is on my must-do list. Next time I am determined to make it for brunch! Oh, and I hear that on Monday and Tuesday nights after 7 (I think) you can get a bruschetta board and bottle of house wine for $20! That is a DEAL.
