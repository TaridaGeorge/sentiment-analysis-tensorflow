My wife and I have been cooking more for ourselves.  As we do many restaurants aren't worth it.  Pitta always delivers.  Great specials, and great regular menu items.  The staff is awesome and always makes us feel at home.  They have a great beer selection too.  The only thing I will say negative about the place is that most people that order the platters will probably want the potatoes cooked to a crispness on the outside.  Just ask they will do it.  The way they usually do it is under-cooked in my opinion.   I also wish they brewed the plain tea.

For dessert I recommend the pourekia.  It is great.  The description doesn't do it justice.  The cheese is more like cream.  The cheese cakes are also excellent.
