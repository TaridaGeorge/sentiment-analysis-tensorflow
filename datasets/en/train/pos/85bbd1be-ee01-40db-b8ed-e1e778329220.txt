My husband and I went  to Roma Garden for dinner two weeks ago.We love the food,the wines,the service and the ambiance.
It was our first time,but I'm sure we will go back soon.
We love italian food and this is a good option for a nice dinner ,portions are great and prices are very reasonable.
I highly recommend it!
