By now we're all perfectly aware that food trucks are a thing, and a wonderful thing at that.  I've sampled wares from every truck I see, and I can honestly say that Torched Goodness is a favorite of mine.

I'm no expert when it comes to sweets since I rarely have a sweet tooth.  And yet...

I simply can't say no to Torched Goodness!  The idea and execution are simple and it works very well.

My personal favorite is Chocolate with a hint of chili pepper.  It hits all the right notes.

If you see Torched Goodness around town, do yourself a favor and indulge.  You won't be disappointed.
