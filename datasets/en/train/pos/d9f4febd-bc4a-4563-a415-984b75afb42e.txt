We had a great experience there with Suzanne.  We ended up getting the Grano glider/recliner, Vola ottoman and Ninna Nanna bassinet.  It wasn't cheap but the workmanship looks amazing and we'e willing to pay more for quality.  We are definitely expecting the furniture to last and can't wait until it comes in.  If there is one thing you want to splurge on, here is the place to get it.

I would definitely buy from the Biltmore location again.  We visited the one on High Street, too, and the sales person there wasn't as personable.  Had we got there first, we probably would not have been as impressed.  Maybe it was just one of those days but I will say, having someone there who can provide great service is really an added bonus and gets people to want to spend at your establishment.
