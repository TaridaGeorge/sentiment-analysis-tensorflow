I wanted to take my family to a place that they had never been.  My partner just got here from Michigan and has never been hiking.  I took all of them up there and they enjoyed it so much.  I enjoyed it because it was my first time back out hiking after my knee surgery in Feb 2012.  I had it reconstructed and I was able to do it.  It made me feel so good.

So to those of you out there that feel they can't do it.  YOU CAN.  It is a very nice walk up hill.  Enjoy it as much as I did.
