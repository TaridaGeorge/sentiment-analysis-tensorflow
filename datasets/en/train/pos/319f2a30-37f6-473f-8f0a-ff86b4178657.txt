Got some extra cash (alot?) and wanna spoil yourself on a long spa weekend? This could be your place. The remodel of the original mid-century motel is really cool. It blends perfectly and seamlessly with the new residential tower, spa, restaurant and gym. 

The poolside service was absolutely top notch. They bring you a plastic tumbler of iced water almost immediately, I guess they know you will want this in the dry desert climate? Nice. They have a full bar poolside and full menu service. Again the service was awesome and the food/drinks were very good. 

Lots of cool shops and restaurants within walking distance.
