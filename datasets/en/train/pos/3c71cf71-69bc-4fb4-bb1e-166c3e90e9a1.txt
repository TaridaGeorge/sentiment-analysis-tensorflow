Blue Wasabi has become my new favorite sushi joint in town! A very hip, trendy, sushi bar with young, fun servers. I was never a sushi fan, but always loved the idea of "going out to sushi". With that said, it's very important to me that a sushi restaurant offers a variety of non-seafood menu items. I had The Clucker and The Bada Bing both wrapped in soy paper and they were both amazing! We heard that Sundays were 1/2 alcoholic beverages if you wore a blue shirt, so after church we actually drove home and changed our shirts before going but when we got there, we heard the server offer the special to our neighboring table who weren't wearing blue? It was a great experience and we will definitely be going back!
