I know Kerrie through my networking and we benefit from her presence.

I have not needed her service's and most of us don't plan on needing an attorney. But I am always reminded by a tagline that Kerrie often mentions. 

"People in crisis need company, Droban & Company". 

How very true. When that time comes, and in these troubled days, it WILL. You will need good company. I would look for Kerrie to help and so should you.
