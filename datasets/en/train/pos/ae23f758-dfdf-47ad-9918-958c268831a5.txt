Every time I fly to or from the Phoenix Airport I stop in their free Museum!  I love the exhibitions that are constantly changing.  last week I saw the Robert T McCall paintings.  I  enjoy how the time passes so much faster when waiting for your flight.  Just in case you forgot your camera they provide free postcards of the artwork in the exhibit!
