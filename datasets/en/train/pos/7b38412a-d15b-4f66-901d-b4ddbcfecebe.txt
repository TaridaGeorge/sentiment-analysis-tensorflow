I have been a patient on and off at American Chiropractic for about 9 years. I only go now when or if I feel that I need to be adjusted. This is the first Chiropractor that I feel actually cares about their patients. This office is more concerned with helping actually fix the problem as opposed to masking it so they continue getting your money. 
   I recommend this place to everyone who needs a Chiropractor, massage specialist, physical therapy or even acupunture, they do it all. 
   My boyfriend has a history of back issues and they are ready and willing to help him more than anyone has in the past. 
   They constantly have new patient deals and deals for current patients, it's always worth asking since they generally have a monthly deal.
