I love this place!! Their breakfast is amazing! The location is a little hard to find, but it's worth the search. The interior design is very neat, they have faux finished on their wall, it makes it seem like you're in Tuscany. hahaha or maybe not. I would suggest everyone at least try this place once. It's just a good place to enjoy a great morning breakfast.
