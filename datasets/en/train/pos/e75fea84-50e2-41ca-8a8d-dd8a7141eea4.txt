Great Italian restuarant, upscale location, nicely appointed, helpful service and wonderful menu.  Pricier but not unexpected for such a nice place.  Staff was gracious and kind, excellent recommendations (house balsamic salad dressing!) and the pasta special was wonderful.  Spacious parking, great view of the park and Fountain.  

Although the restaurant was filled it was not too noisey or loud to carry on a conversation.  Really enjoyed our experience there last night.

NOTE: I submitted an update to Yelp business, they have the address listed incorrectly.  It should be:
13014 N. Saguaro Blvd
Fountain Hills, AZ
85268
