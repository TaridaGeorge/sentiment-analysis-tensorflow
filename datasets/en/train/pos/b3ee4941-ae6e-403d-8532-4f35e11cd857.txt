So I roll into Scottsdale and my daughter picks me up from the airport and takes me straight to Sprinkles for (Dinner) I love eating desert for dinner first. 

I ate them in the car because I couldn't wait, they looked so beautiful. I loved all of them. I sampeled the Red Velvet, Banana, and the Suger and Cinnamon. All had their own seperate greatness. Never made it to the resturaunt for dinner.
