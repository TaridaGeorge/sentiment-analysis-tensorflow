Tried this spot yesterday for Friday drinks with my coworkers.  We got there a little after 4p.  The happy hour specials are amazing.  I loved the margarita sunrise.  it's a great drink for $3.  The appetizers were served family style and there were plenty for our table of six to share.  The service was also great.  Although some of the specials didn't start until 5p, our waitress gave us the happy hour price for our orders as soon as we got there! I'll definitely be back!
