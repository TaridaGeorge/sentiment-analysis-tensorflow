This place is soo neat and cozy! 
I love coming here before I go to work or during my lunch break. I usually get their Caramel Latt√© and their Chocolate Homemade Scones. Their scones are delicious and moist, I seriously could eat them all day long! 

The people there are really nice, very helpful, and polite. They know how to treat their customers. 

I would definitely come back here again!

I like how they keep you in their database so that the 10th drink you order is FREE. Most places make you carry a stamp-card, but this place is a little more techy coz it's all computerized. NEATO!
