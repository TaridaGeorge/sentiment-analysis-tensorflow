Wow! Lamb Vindaloo pasty!! 

Shh... Don't tell some of the Indian restaurants in Tempe, but this was the best vindaloo I've had so far in the area. It's that good! Top that off with the mint sauce they served with it and you have one hell of a meal. I also got to try the carne adovada pasty, and it was amazing as well. Imagine the contents of an amazing burrito inside a flaky pastry crust, and there ya go! Needless to say that I will be back here. I really can't believe it took me years to go here, but I'm glad I at least got around to it.
