I have very very curly hair, so it is difficult for me to find a hairstylist who knows how to deal with my hair.  I got a traumatically bad haircut in which I lost 10 inches of my hair against my best wishes and came out with a totally disorganized, asymetrical mess.  I have a fairly conservative look and needed to have it fixed.

Donna Rikje saved my life.  She took her time with me and asked me a lot of questions to figure out my style and help me figure out my style as well!  She taught me a lot of things about how to make my hair work given the complete mess that was made of it and the best ways for me to use the bad situation and make a good one of it.  Thank you Donna!
