SUper knowledgeable and friendly staff will make you feel at home. Teaching a 6 month old to swim can be a bit daunting at times because you don't want to hurt them or scare them, but they are there to support you through it. 

Watching all the older kids that have been going there for years reinforces the strong bond that the staff have with the kids. The kids all love going there and they love the instructors. It's a fun and safe environment!
