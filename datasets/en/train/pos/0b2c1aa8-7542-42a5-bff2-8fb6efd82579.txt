Subway is not a five star restaurant obviously, but this Subway is probably the best Subway anywhere. They've had the same staff forever, and they are very friendly, but in a real way, not the robotic Safeway friendly. It's always clean, the ingredients are always fresh, and even when it's slammed you get in and out quick.
