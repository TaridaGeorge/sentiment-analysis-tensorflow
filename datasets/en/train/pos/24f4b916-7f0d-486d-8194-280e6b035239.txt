Tried this spot a few months ago with two friends, and we made the mistake of "sharing" the orange fennel salad...we were literally fighting over it! Wish I lived closer because I'd probably head over once a week just for that amazing salad. Also ordered the green chili burger on the GIGANTIC English Muffin, which was tasty with a little kick. Ended the meal with a decadent salty n' sweet chocolate chip cookie from the adjacent bakery...and by then I was in a delightful food coma.
