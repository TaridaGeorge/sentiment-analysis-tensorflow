Excellent Indian chats! I would recommend the Samosa ragda. The prices are reasonable for the food.
The ambiance isn't anything special but they have all the bare minimums to let one sit and eat. Given the low prices and good quality of the food, it is reasonable not to expect a great ambiance.
The grocery store that is part of this is pretty good too except that they don't sell fresh Indian vegetables. They do have frozen Indian vegetables though.
Oh, and I almost forgot. They have excellent Samosas that they sell for only $1 each and they come with mint and tamarind chutneys. The closest competitor I can think of is India Plaza, they sell the same sized Samosas that taste okay for $1.29 but don't offer the mint and tamarind chutneys.
