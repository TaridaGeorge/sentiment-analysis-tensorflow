I thoroughly enjoyed my first Primp and Blow experience. Linda was very nice and friendly and gave me one of the best facials I have ever had. She has a lot of experience and knowledge which I liked. She customized my facial to what my face needed not just what my appointment was for. You could tell she cares about the clients needs and took her time to do a great job which is not always the case when getting a facial or spa service. I would definitely recommend Linda to anyone who wants an amazing facial. I will definitely go see her again. :)
