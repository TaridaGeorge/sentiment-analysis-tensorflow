Topher Lewis is arguably  the best stylist in Phoenix. Currently, he rents his space at Salon 7. Topher works on prominent sets in the Hollywood, CA market, but visits the Valley of the Sun, monthly, to keep his local clients in good shape. As a local Phoenix actor, I have to be in top shape at the drop of a hat. When it comes to my hair, I trust only Topher with the task.
