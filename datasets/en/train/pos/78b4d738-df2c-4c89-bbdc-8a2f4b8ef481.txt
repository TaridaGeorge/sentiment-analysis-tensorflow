Fantastic scenery, phenomenal service no matter when you go, a very pleasant decor/smell/ambience, and decent drink and food specials. Some of the food there is the best I've ever had from that category.  I don't drink much outside of wine, but the wine list isn't half bad.  No matter how I feel, I can't not be in a great mood sitting at the Thirsty Camel.  It's the best of the best in the city as far as I'm concerned, and I have recommended in multiple times for numerous situations.
