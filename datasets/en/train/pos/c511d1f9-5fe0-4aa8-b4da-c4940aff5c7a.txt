Fresh, generous portions, good flavor and all at a really great value.  The spinach salad is particularly fresh and delicious.  Everyones very nice.  We did takeout and brought it home - the AZ Desert Ridge was a little too diner feel for us, but nice for what it was.  The chicken tortilla soup is a bit salty.  Overall, well done.
