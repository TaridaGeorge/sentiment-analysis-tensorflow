This is a great, non-chain sushi bar.  Their happy hour is hard to beat and they only make their sushi to order.  The atmosphere and ambiance is that of what I expect from a sushi bar.  My absolute favorite roll is the Vegas Roll with sweet eel sauce and this is one of the rolls that is half off during happy hour.  I believe they are still doing the all day happy hour on Saturday.  I'm craving their sushi and it's only 8:30am.
