I spent this afternoon at the wonderful Willow Stream Spa at the Scottsdale Fairmont and couldn't wait to take the opportunity to rave about it!  My trip was a gift from my business partner and I chose a "sports" massage -- I can honestly say I have never had a more wonderful experience.  From the moment I entered the door I was greeted by a hostess and given a fabulous tour of the facility.  I was ready for the whole experience so I did a steam, followed by quiet time in the eucalyptus therapy room.  After my wonderful massage, I had a wonderful wrap sandwich and a glass of sangria sitting in the outdoor area.  Then back for more water therapy and home.  Highly recommend this particular spa. I live in Scottsdale ahd have tried others - no comparison!
