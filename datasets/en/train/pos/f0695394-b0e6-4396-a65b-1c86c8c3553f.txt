This place is absolutely awesome.  Everything you read in the other reviews is true.  Pastys are hot pockets of pastry filled with love.  I had the peppered steak pasty with the peppercorn brandy sauce and it was amazing.  My server Justin was awesome, very friendly and understanding that this was my first visit.  The location in Tempe is small but full of character.  Sit at the bar and watch the food being made.  Even the cooks were friendly and willing to talk about what they were doing.

Absolutely have an Irish Car bomb (Guinness with a shot of Jameson whiskey and Bailey's Irish Cream).  They are only $3 a day, every day!!!

The place is a bit hard to find but it's totally worth the work.  Your efforts will be rewarded.
