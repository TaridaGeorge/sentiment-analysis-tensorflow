Michael is a patio door guru.  Our door was so heavy and slow that we dreaded going outside, or inside, Stuck between the icy cold interior and the surface-of-the-sun exterior, we called on All patio Doors.  Within 15-20 minutes Michael changed the door's ball bearings, did some other voodoo magic, and voila, we have a door as smooth as butta.  No new door was required - take that all of you competitors!  Kudos to Michael.
