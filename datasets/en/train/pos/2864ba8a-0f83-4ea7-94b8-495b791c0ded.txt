Dr Brad and the girls are amazing. A wonderful staff... I recently had my wisdom teeth pulled and while it was awful.... Dr Brad and his staff made it not so bad. They even called to check on how I was doing. Will I be going back? Absolutely. Will I take my son there... Absolutely... and I will refer my friends, family and coworkers as well.... Good doctors are hard to come by, great doctors are even harder.. Doctor Brad is definitely one of the best by far! Gotta love Dallas and Liz and the rest of the girls too.. Love, love, LOVE this office!!!!!!!
