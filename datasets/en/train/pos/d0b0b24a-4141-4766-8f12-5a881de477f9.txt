Following up on the recent review by another Yelper:

This is not a "fast food sit-down" experience.  Food is cooked when you order, by a small but caring staff, and the dishes come out when they are ready.  

Nothing is going to sit for a while under a heat lamp until every dish for that table is ready.

It's more of a "sit down and stay a while" experience, especially if there are several groups in the place at the time.

So, adapt accordingly, and you will love the food here and the people who run the place just like all the other 5-star reviewers before you.
