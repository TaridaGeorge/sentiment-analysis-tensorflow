Food and service so good.  Everyone trying and sharing each others food as it was all memorably delicious.   I was expecting steakhouse based on the name alone, but this isn't correct. It is upscale American. Fun, relaxed but still classy atmosphere.

Pretzel bread fondue is crazy good. White beans and scallops was the favorite entree at the table, but Green Chile and Tortellini were mouth watering too.

Only downside was hostesses who didn't handle heavy rush well. We will be back frequently.
