Finally a first rate coffee and sandwich shop at this location.  After years of mediocre coffee shops at this stand alone location a real stand out!  The entire place has been redecorated and updated in a contemporary urban 21st century design.

The indoor seating is limited, but there is plenty of outdoor seating available.

The shop is promoting evening wine and beer and a dog friendly patio - not sure of the concept?

The coffee prices are reasonable between $2.50 and $4.00.  Breakfast fare and sandwiches are available for well under $10.00.

The place looks great.  I live nearby and am happy to see this new establishment brighten up the hood!
