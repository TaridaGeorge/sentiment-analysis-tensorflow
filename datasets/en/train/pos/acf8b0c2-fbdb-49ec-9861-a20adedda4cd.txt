This place have the best food I've ever tasted I am so addicted to this place that I am willing to drive from San Diego to Phoenix just to have some. The orange chicken is a must. It's a small place but the service is great and the pricing is just right. The portion size is amazing. I visit Phoenix quite a bit and I always have to eat here. I only wish they were in San Diego.
