I would have been absolutely devastated about Sabbudy's in Tempe closing if they hadn't opened a new location.  But they did.  Phew.  I cannot get enough of their potato salad.  It is seriously the best I have ever had.  Even better than Mom's (good thing Mom isn't very adept at surfing the Internet)!  And the falafel.  I always get the falafel.  Do you know what falafel is?  It's fried chickpea paste.  I have no idea how they get fried chickpea paste to taste so good.  And the lentil soup.  And the hummus.  And the wraps.  Okay.  I like it all.  But especially the potato salad.  Make sure you try the potato salad.
