This place knows how to rock my face off. Maybe I am just easy in giving them 5 stars, but they impressed when I didn't know what to expect. The brushetta is off the chain. I tried several different slices of pizza and not one disappointed. 

The only knock I can give is that, given that it is a small place, it does take a long time to get seated if there is a crowd. They do say patience is a virtue. Believe me this place is worth the wait. By far my favorite pizza place thus far. I am eagerly anticipating my next travel there. Not soon enough...
