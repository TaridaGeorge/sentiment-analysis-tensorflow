Breakfast was awesome!  Some really unique items on the menu.  I had the pork carnitas breakfast skillet.

Every part of the skillet was executed perfectly - from the fresh potatoes on bottom to the super tender, moist pork and green sauce all the way to the eggs on top.

I'm only in town for a few days but plan to hit Crackers up again before I leave town for sure!
