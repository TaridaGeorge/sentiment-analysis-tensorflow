This restaurant nails it.  Technically speaking, the steak cuts get a b+, seasoning b+, cooking a- .  The service was b+ 

However when you factor in the reasonable price (~27 per full steak entree including salad and fixins) and great atmosphere, it rounds a complete and excellent experience.  Even though the service was imperfect, it was mainly because our waiter was overzealous to do a good job.  Hard to hold that against him.  Fantastic value - highly recommended, do not hesitate to come here.
