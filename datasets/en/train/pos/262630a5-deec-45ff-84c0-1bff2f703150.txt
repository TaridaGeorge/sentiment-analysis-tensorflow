Working on Mill Ave definitely has its ups and downs, La Bocca being on the upside. After a long day of work it is nice to be so close to so much food but La Bocca has definitely stood out as one of my favorites. They have an awesome happy hour that goes on til 630. The food is spectacular. They have great pasta and even better pizza. The combinations are unique but the the taste is just right. If your in the area and want great food La Bocca is just right for you. To add to the greatness of the food, the atmosphere is great and so is the service. The place is great thanks for a pleasurable experience La Bocca.
