The best neighborhood liquor store i have ever been too. Yup, the staff is friendly in a liquor store here, not creepy or intimidating like everywhere else!!!.

They have huge collection of beers and wines and other liquors. Whats better, they even let you mix-n-match your 6 pack or 12 pack of beer. They even make suggestions unlike other places. They have some kegs too. 

They have these small informative tags and notes on their wine collection with great suggestions. 

They also have a decent collection of cigars just in case you were wondering about smoking.  

All these reasons require me to become the dutch of this place :)
