This was my 1st time here for Sunday brunch with 4 gf's and as you know when girls get together for brunch there are 2 staples talking and pagne. Both were flowing for 2 hours and never once did we feel rushed.   Our drinks were never empty, we got 2nds of the delectable mini croissants and I didn't want to leave.   I ordered the egg in a whole while my friend next to be had the panini.  Both tasted light, fresh and not too large on the portion size.

I will be coming back!!!
