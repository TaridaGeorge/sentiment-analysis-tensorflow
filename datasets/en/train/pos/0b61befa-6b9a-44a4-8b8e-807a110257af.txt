This is a great company. I saw some reviews and decided to go with this company for sunshades. Kevin is very friendly and will get your needs covered no problem. They are very helpful from providing advice and to professional installation. They are however pretty busy most of the time and sometimea schedules might conflict, didnt matter that much to me since i was not in a rush. great rebate from rsp on the sunshnshades since they are srp certified. Im a very satisfied customer and i would highly recommend them.
