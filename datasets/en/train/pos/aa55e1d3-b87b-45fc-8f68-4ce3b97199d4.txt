Just had four fillings done by Dr. Erik Pease at his practice in East Mesa. I haven't been to the dentist in 12 years so I was a bit hesitant. His staff was way awesome - very friendly and smiling all the time - they really put me at ease right away. I really recommend this dentist and I am offering his services to my 16 employees of my moving company because he offered them a group discount.
