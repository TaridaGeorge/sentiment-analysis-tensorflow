The staff here is awesome. They talk to you when you walk through the door unlike other shops in Tempe. The staff spent a lot of time with me explaining various models and their pros and cons. I didn't end up buying a bike from them only because my budget didn't line up with their inventory. My desired bike was very specific and Dominic's has a ton of options. Great shop.
