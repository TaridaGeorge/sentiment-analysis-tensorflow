The Tempe comedy club, which has been featured on NBC's "Last Comic Standing" twice, draws some of the biggest comedy headliners from around the U.S. Jerry Seinfeld, David Spade, Jay Mohr and Kathy Griffin have all taken the stage at this hot comedy room. Former "Saturday Night Live" comedian sold out all of his performances at the club last weekend! And the Improv recently debuted the Cabaret, an intimate 95-person showroom attached to the club. The room will serve as a stage for up-and-coming comedians, local comedians and one-man shows. Todd Glass from the second season of  "Last Comic Standing" sold out the room a few weeks ago.
