Jewel's Cupcake Shop made my wife's birthday this year!  Due to a food allergy with our infant son my wife is on a no dairy, egg, or soy diet.  Julie was able to make my wife's favorite, carrot cake cupcakes, without using any of the allergens mentioned above and they were awesome!  I would highly recommend this business to anyone looking for a great dessert for any occasion.
