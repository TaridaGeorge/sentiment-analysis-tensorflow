Yum!  This place was delicious!  A completely unassuming little Thai restaurant.  We walked in at 2:30 in the afternoon and the place was empty.  I was worried at first, but it turned out to be a really good spot.  I had tried Thai Basil and wasn't impressed.

The portion size was good, leaving me with filling meal there and enough for a light dinner at home later.  The soup was delicious!  And the medium spicy was plenty spicy for me, although I'm kinda wimpy with spiciness.

Also, the prices here are great!  I got lunch, a Thai ice coffee and split a dessert, and the total came to about $12.  Not bad for all that stuff!

Delish!
