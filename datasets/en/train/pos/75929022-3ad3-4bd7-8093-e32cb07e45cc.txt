How lucky us Phoenicians are to have a beautiful preserve so near civilization.  We went in late March and it was a great, leisurely hike.  As soon as you turn the first bend you really lose the city behind you and are in the desert.  Arizona's deserts are really something special, so alive.

One note:  The little barbed suckers on the trail, they're all white and fall off of the cacti which line the path, are not good for humans or dogs.  Don't use your hand to pull them out.  We used an extra shirt and it took some time get them dislodged from the curious pup.
