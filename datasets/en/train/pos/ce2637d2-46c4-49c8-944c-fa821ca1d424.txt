Bistro Classic pizza, followed by a pizzookie (ahem.. pizza cookie).   The food is great (It's not down town chicago, but so what?) but the service is UNBELIEVABLY GOOD.  I've been to the other locations and it seems I've had the best service here.  They were SO nice to my 5 year old, and that always goes a long way for a parent who's afraid his child will get bored and turn into a three headed dragon at that table.  I's a comming back that is a fact!
