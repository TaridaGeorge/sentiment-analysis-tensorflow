These guys are awesome!!! Best Vet we've ever had. We have a Golden Retriever with thyroid issues and severe allergies. The doctors and staff are always very caring with our pets and our wallet. You truly get the sense that these guys love what they do and that they care for your pet. If you are anywhere in the East Valley, its worth the drive. Ask for Dr. Oliver.
