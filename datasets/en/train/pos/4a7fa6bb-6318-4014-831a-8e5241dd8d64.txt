Funky and fun a Hot happy kaleidoscope of color.......you cannot help but feel chipper here.The lively decor is absolutely great and the bar upstairs ...WOW!

Lunch was excellently prepared ; 
The Gauc with Crab(a nice addition) was really great! 
Chicken Enchilada was very tasty and coupled with beans and rice ( beyond filling).

Went back for HH ....Pulled pork tacos with pineapple salsa ( yum) 
Chips and salsa were standard ,Mojitos were Fabu and bartenders were enjoyable to be around.

The atmosphere and food = good times AND 5 stars !
