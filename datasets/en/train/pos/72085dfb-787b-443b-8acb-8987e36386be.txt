I have only good things to say about the service dept. at Acura of Tempe. 

First of all, you can schedule your appointment online through their website. (They even email you back to confirm/remind you.) When you arrive for your appointment they greet you at your car, go over everything with you, then direct you to the comfortable waiting room which has coffee, snacks, a TV and ample seating. I especially love that they wash & vacuum your car when they're done.

Their staff is both friendly & professional. I have gone there with my Integra a few times for repairs and oil changes and am always impressed! I like being able to trust that the work is going to get done right the first time.
