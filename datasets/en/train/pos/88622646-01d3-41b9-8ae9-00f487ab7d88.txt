I LOVE this place. I have tried a few things here and everything has been top notch. The cupcakes are what drew me to this place at first, they are homemade with pretty decorations and cute sugar flowers on top. The macaroons are to DIE for. seriously, amazing. The petit fours are also great. The cakes look sooo good. in fact, just writing this review. im going to have to go there right now!

its also nice that they are open until 7 because most bakeries close by 5, who has time to go to a bakery before 5? most people arent even off work yet! good job shelley!!
