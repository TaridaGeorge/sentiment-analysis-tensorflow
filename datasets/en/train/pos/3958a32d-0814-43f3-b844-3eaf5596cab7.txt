I live out in East Mesa and try to make the drive at least once a week, which is about 55 miles roundtrip...what does that tell you?! I absolutely LOVE Lola Coffee-I get the iced white mochas, and though I normally try to veer away from whipped cream, I HAVE to have it here, it is simply the best. I'm pretty sure they put something in there...it looks homemade, and has the appearance of brown sugar in it-I swear, you have to try it. You'll be addicted. Atmosphere is great, only downfall is I feel as though if I was going to meet a friend for coffee, I couldn't go here-it's a pretty quiet place where people like to work on projects/homework/cruise the internet in silence.  It is now my new favorite spot to work on my writing!
