This is my absolute favorite breakfast place... ever!! The biggest and most amazing chorizo burrito I have ever had! Eggs, chorizo, cheese and hash brown in a huge tortilla. I have never been disappointed with this burrito. I live in Laveen and we drive over on saturday mornings to get this! I also love the burgers as well. I usually order the bacon cheeseburger... I love crispy bacon and that is exactly what you get! They are not cheap with the cheese either! Large portions, I suggest ordering the smaller fries...the small is huge! I love this place! 

They do have a huge menu! Something for everyone.....
