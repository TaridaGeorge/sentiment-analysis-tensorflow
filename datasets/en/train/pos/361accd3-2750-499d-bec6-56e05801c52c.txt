I had only been to Flemings once for their fabulous happy hour.  I decided to go for my birthday.  I ordered the "wrong" thing and they quickly turned what could have been a disappointing situation into a reason to come back.  Nice atmosphere, great service, excellent food.  Yes - a little pricey - but quality costs.  Will be returning!
