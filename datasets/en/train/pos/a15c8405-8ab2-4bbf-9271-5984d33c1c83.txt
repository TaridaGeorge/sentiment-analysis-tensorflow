Layla (my puppy) and I love Dr. Hunt and the whole crew at Homestead.  They are all very kind and loving and Dr. Hunt really takes his time with us when we come in.  Dr. Hunt has never tried to over sell me on anything and this is a huge relief as Layla is my first puppy.  I cannot imagine going to another Vet!  Thank you Dr. Hunt and the whole Homestead crew!  If you are looking for a Vet, look no further.
