We were lucky to find this fantastic spot within days of relocating back to Phoenix.  This fish is always top-notch, as is the service and the presentation.  Seasonal variety is great, too.  The lunchtime bento selection is second to none.  The menu is great but always (ALWAYS!) ask about items on the board.  The octopus salad and  asazuke are always great cool sides to beat the heat.  And ask if they have the grilled squid as it is always done perfectly.  If you are looking for fusion sushi, this is not your place.  Solid, perfectly done Japan-style food and preparation is what you will find here.  We come at least twice a month.  Our favorite restaurant in Phoenix!
