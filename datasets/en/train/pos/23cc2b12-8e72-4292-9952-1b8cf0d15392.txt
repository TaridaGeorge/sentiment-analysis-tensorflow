Over the years, I've had REALLY bad experiences with large air conditioning companies in the Valley. They put in damaged parts, tried to install cheaper parts than the ones I paid for, took smoke breaks on my roof and the list goes on; so I was desperately seeking a smaller company with a knowledgeable staff,;I think I found that with Absolute Air Technologies.

Mike Tucker came to my house today and after a brief discussion about my AC, he went right to work. He combed out all the dents in my unit that I'd been living with since last fall's hailstorm and then did an annual service.

The cost was reasonable and Mike has 27 years experience fixing & installing systems, so for once I feel like things were done right.

I'm very satisfied I finally found a good, honest air conditioning company.
YAH!
