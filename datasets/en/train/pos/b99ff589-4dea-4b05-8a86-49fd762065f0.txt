The food in this place is indescribably awesome! Granted, the place could be nicer, but if you're in the mood for great food without the frills of a great looking place: this is it. The service is fast, friendly, and the prices are great- especially knowing that their portions are typically huge. I can't finish my plate most of the time, so I always end up taking leftovers home. 
I love their Jade Red Chicken, as well as their emerald chicken. Their black beans are to die! Order a combo plate, if this is your first time here. You'll get a good mix of everything and you'll leave without regrets!
