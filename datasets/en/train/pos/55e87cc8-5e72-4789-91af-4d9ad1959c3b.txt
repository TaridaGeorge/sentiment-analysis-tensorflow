Love love love love love!!! $23.00 for 3 drinks and 2 of their awesome "bowls" at the bar! We ordered the FEZ fondue and the Gyro bowl. I was overwhelmed by all of the flavors of the Gyro bowl. That is probably one of the best things I've eaten in 2011! The drink of the evening was the G-Spot...some fruity red grapefruit concoction that was just spectacular. It was only $3 so we went for it. It was so so good!

The restaurant itself is ultra-modern, in what seemed to be a somewhat odd location but I don't know Phoenix that well, so I can't confirm that. 

The service was spectacular and people watching was equally impressive. Great great restaurant. I highly recommend it!!!
