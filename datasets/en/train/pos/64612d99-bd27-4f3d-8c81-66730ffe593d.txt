This is a great local coffee shop in Downtown Phoenix. When I walk in, I immediately feel like I've walked into someone's welcoming home. There's seating at the counter and filled with friendly faces of local business people and eclectic folks sitting and conversing with each other, there are folks sitting on the patio enjoying the fresh air and there are individuals sitting and working in the open environment. It's a perfect place to sit, relax and do some work if you really must. The coffee's good, the food is delicious and offers a wide variety of items from breakfast and sandwiches to crepes and salads. I haven't tried the crepes yet but it's on my list and I promise to update my review when I do! I just wish I lived in this area so I could visit Jobot every morning!
