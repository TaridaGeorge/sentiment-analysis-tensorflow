I found this place from yelp and decided to give it a try.This place is very clean and well decorated.  My hair came out great! I love it so much. I had stylist Holly cut my hair. She is very professional and friendly. I would highly recommend this place, especially Holly. The price is so affordable too. I will probably come back for my next cut :)
