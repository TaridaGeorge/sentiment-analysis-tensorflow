Vegan food exists in Scottsdale Arizona although you may have to search for it between the PF Chang's and Cheesecake factories, it's still there. Mint Leaf has excellent food options and great service and the owner dishes out an occasional trivia question while you're waiting for your food.  I had the tofu rolls, soooo YUM!!!
