I love Core Balance Studio so much. I really love the trainers. They are highly motivational, and genuine as well. I have only attended the Real Ryder classes, but I'm going to try some of the others. This is truly what I would call a boutique gym. If you are interested in trying this place out at all, I would highly encourage you to give it a shot. You will feel welcome the first time you go, and they will challenge you physically every minute you are there. Thanks Grant!
