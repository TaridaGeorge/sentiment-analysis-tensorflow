yup.  nothing i would change at aiello's.  easy to find with the large lit sign out front.  the parking lot was large and plent of empty spaces.  i made a reservation so right when we walked in they sat us.  i can't eat spicy so the oil and peppers were too much for me but i did try the oil and bread.  we ordered the calamari app and loved it.  light and fluffy!  i had the salmon with capers, beans and potato thingy.  yummm!  to top it off we had the tirimisu.  service was great.  would go back.
