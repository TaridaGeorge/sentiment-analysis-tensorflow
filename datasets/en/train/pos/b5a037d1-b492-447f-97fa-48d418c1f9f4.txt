I took my cousins from Canada here for dinner, and it was a risk as I had never eaten here myself.  But the reviews on yelp are spot and on and this place really deserves it's star rating.  The service and the food were both fantastic.  They had a good wine selection.  And there were real plants for center pieces!  Also, my cousins had a two year old with them and the place was very accommodating to her needs.  I would come back here in an instant.
