I thought I already reviewed Cowboy Ciao, but apparently not. Actually, I'm really surprised I haven't gushed for pages about this place already because it's frickin' awesome.

I hate to sound like a foodie asshat, but the menu at Cowboy Ciao is truly inventive. Peanut Butter Chocolate Bacon Brittle (for Dessert)and Blue Cheese Bread Pudding Pork Chops (main course) are just two of the insanely good things I ate the Cowboy tonight. 

The best things on the menu are the Stetson Chopped Salad (hands down the #1 chopped salad of all time) and the Mushroom Panfry. (I can't explain it, just order it). I have to have both every time I eat here. 

Some people might be freaked out by the menu, but those people suck. So please do not suck and go to this restaurant immediately.

Giddy Up.
