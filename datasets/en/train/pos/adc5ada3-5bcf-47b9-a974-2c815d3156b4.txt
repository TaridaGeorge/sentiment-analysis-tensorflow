JoJo is a fantastic Aesthetician.  She has been waxing my eyebrows and tinting my eyelashes for almost 5 years.  She is flexible with her scheduling and makes you feel like you are the most important person in the world.  My daughter's referred me to her and I am hooked.  I highly recommend taking the time to relax and be pampered with JoJo and her fantastic techniques.
