This place does not disappoint.  I've been here quite a few times with coworkers and it's always a good choice.

Cute place - I especially like sitting on their cozy, covered patio.  

I hate mushrooms but somehow LOVE their fungi pizza.  I think it's the truffle oil that makes it amazing.  I've had a few of their other pizzas too, which are quite good as well. All of their salads are delish - you can't go wrong with any of them.

If there's just one other person with you, you can't go wrong sharing a pizza and a salad.

This place is WAY better than Pizzeria Bianco.

Will continue to come back here!
