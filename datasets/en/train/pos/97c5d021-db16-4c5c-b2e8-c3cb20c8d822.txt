Jodi is fantastic!  Extraordinary!  After too many expensive yet less-than-average salon expereinces, my hair has been less beautiful than its potential.  Jodi gave me a very thorough consultation after I did some research to find the best colorist for me.  During my appointment, Jodi was professional, efficient and friendly.  I left the salon with soft, gorgeous hair... lovely color, care of the INOA line, and I felt beautiful again.  She did what at least half a dozen other highly recommended colorists did not accomplish.  I'm ecstatic and relieved and I have finally found my colorist.  What more can a girl ask?  Thanks so much, Jodi.
