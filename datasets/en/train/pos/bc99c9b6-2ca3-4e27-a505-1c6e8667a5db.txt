As usual Apple has taken care of me without a hassle. Two macs, years of happiness.

The power module for my MacBook Pro went out 55 days after my AppleCare expired, but they replaced it at no charge.  

When I went to the store I did not have a "Genius" appointment, but they did help me out after I told them I didn't live near an Apple store and I was on my lunch break.  Thank you!

Once again Apple has proven itself to be an excellent company with great customer service.
