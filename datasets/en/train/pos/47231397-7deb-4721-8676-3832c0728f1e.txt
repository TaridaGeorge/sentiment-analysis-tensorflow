I love this place, whether it's to meet friends for happy hour or to grab a quick dinner and some wine. The bruscetta is to die for and I have now seen many restaurants trying to replicate. The wine list is reasonable with great values!

I find the crowd to be pleasant and generally professionals. However, if you are generally offended by well-dressed adults, then perhaps you might want to stay away.  This is a great place!
