I love this store because of all the awesome things I get here. I found natural and crazy colored hair here to make synthetic dreads, I bought wigs here for only $30 (one of the best prices in town for natural looking wigs!) and I have received some great advice from the owner on the options I have regarding coloring my own hair. 

Very knowledgeable, very friendly and very affordable. 

There is even a beauticians station in the back, so call if you need to get your hair done. 

Oh yeah, and you don't need a beautician's license to purchase here... but if you do have one, you'll be getting a discount!
