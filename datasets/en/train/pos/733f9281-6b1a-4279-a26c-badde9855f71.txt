Yeah, its that good! This place has a complete relaxed atmosphere. There were several customers sitting outside with their dogs enjoying their favorite fro-yo. If I am craving frozen yogurt next time or any type of dessert for that matter, I will be stopping by this place. 

I tried the Dulche Leche and Chocolate flavors and they were delicious!
