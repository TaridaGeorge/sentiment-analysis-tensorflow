How do I begin?

Superior service, superior food, superior ambiance--altogether a gracious dining experience !!!

Have never tasted better linguine with clams and the calimari still resonates as tender, NOT overly breaded which was a relief, served with a magnificent red sauce.   

Hot bread offered with dipping oil was special.  and no one wrinkled their nose when I ordered hot tea instead of wine.

Will be headed there for my birthday to treat a total foodie from the east coast, knowing he will be impressed.

Witnessed a tiramisu dessert that looked spectacular too.

This is what dining out is all about !!!
