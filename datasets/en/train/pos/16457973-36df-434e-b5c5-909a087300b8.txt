Forgive me Starbucks for I have cheated on you...and liked it.  A LOT.  Lola is so cozy it reminds me of a true coffee shoppe! Everything is a 'for here' kind of attitude.  I had a soy chai...it was amazing! Sat down with Brooke and Mizz Rada to talk Bizzznazzz. Loved it! I might ditch the afternoon time at stuffy starbucks and take some time to doze away in a laid back place...might even ask for an application. Sorry Starbuck's...
