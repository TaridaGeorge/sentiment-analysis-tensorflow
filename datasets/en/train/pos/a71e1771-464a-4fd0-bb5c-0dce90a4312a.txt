This is one of the few places in Tempe that knows how to make cocktails. I ordered the moscow mule (vodka, ginger beer, and lime juice) the other night and it was delicious! The cocktails are comparable to anywhere in Arcadia and are cheaper in price. They also have a wide variety of beers on tap.

I went last night to check it out with a couple of friends and we had to go back this afternoon to watch the Euro Final. Great Happy Hour on Sunday!! $1 dollar PBRs, $4 domestic/local pitchers, half off of appetizers.

The people that work there are super friendly and down to earth. Mad Gs is definitely my new place to go grab a drink.
