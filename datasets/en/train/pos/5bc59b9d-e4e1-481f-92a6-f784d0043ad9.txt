What more can I say about Ted's that has not been said by everyone ?
If you like violence and prefer your food to be poked, prodded & charred, then this is the right place for you.  After the hot dog master took your order, your victim is then put into the grilling line.  You will get the satisfaction of seeing your hot dog being tortured into a grotesque but tasty form.  When it is done, you can ask the hot dog prep master to camouflage it with multitude of tasty condiments.  I highly suggest the home made chili or hot sauce.  Once you are done, go back to the line and go order some more doggy goodness.
