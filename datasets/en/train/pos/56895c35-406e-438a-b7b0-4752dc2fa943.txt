One of our breakfast staples.  Love the biscuits and gravy and the waffles are to die for.  Never leave hungry.  At times there may be a wait, but it never takes much time to get seated.  It won't take long for the waitresses to recognize you and become familiar with your preferences.  Be sure to ask for your country potatoes to have onions and peppers added.  Coffee is always flowing and it isn't uncommon to begin a conversation with someone at another table.  Everyone is friendly and you can tell that they enjoy working there.  I'd say my only issue is that they have Purdue stuff displayed -- I'm an Indiana grad!
