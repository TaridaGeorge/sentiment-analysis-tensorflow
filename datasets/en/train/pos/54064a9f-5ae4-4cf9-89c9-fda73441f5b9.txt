Love this neighborhood! Although kind of scary at night. Jo Bots was awesome, the worker (possibly owner?) is pretty awesome and our drinks came out quite fast and delicious. The barista made us some hot chocolates out of ghardelli (I'm pretty sure I spelled that wrong) chocolate and steamed it up. This is nice place just to hang out and enjoy the company of one's friends :)
