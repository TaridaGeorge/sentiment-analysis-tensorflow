Nice bar restaurant with some very interesting cocktails.  The Citi-zen was especially good with its rock candy stir stick (and you can make your drink as sweet as you want).  

Their famous chopped salad deserves its fame - really good.  The pork belly pastrami was different and oh so good.  And oh last but not least the scallops with grits - who knew grits could be that tasty!

I definitely need to go back here.
