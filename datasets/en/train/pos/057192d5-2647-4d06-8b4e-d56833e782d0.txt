I'd never been to a Chick-Fil-A before, but I expected it to be like any other fast food place. Boy, was I in for a surprise! We were greeted coming in the door and the people that helped us were quick and very nice. They even brought our food out to us. My son had a blast playing in their little toddler area, too. With service and an atmosphere like that (not to mention the food was really good), how could you not go back?
