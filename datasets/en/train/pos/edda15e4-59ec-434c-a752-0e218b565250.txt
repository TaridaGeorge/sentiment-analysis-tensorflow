Great place! My husband and I live in FAR West Valley so whenever we find ourselves even remotely on this side of town we make the drive to Cornish Pasty. This place is simple. Good quality tasty food. We each try a new pasty everytime we go (been 5 or 6 times now) and we have never not LOVED our pasty. The servers are so friendly. I wish we lived on this side of town because we would be here all the time.
