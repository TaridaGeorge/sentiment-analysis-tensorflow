This place is fantastic! Thanks to a coworker who suggested I get my Honeymoon departure dress professionally washed and pressed, I now have a new Cleaners! 

Took in 9 items on Monday evening. The Dry Cleaning was ready to pick up Tuesday. The wash, yesterday. 
Dry Clean - 3 silk sweaters and 1 shirt 
Launder - 4 dress shirts and my honeymoon departure dress 

Total cost - $18.71! 

Cant beat that!! I will definitely be returning for any wash/dry cleaning needs! :)
