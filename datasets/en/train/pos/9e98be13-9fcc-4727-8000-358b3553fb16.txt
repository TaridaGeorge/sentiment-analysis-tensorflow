Sad to say a victim of the economy this week.  My favorite breakfast spot in AZ for over ten years is no longer in business.  

No more Mini-Veggie with fruit and rye toast... No more Slick Chick with fruit or fries.  No more get one meal free with six punches...

The staff over the years was extremely friendly and always pleasant.  It just won't be the same with so few choices left in my area.
