As a former drummer in a band, this was my favorite place to play.  As a spectator, I am just as smitten.  This place is run by old school professionals who treat musicians well.  They are up front about what they want from you but they are also accommodating.  

The vibe is that of a classy dive bar.  If that makes any sense.  Anyway, the sound is great and the beer selection is decent.  I also respect that while you can see some great indie rock there, they are still dedicated to blues and jazz on the weekends.  It would contend for my favorite place ever if that rib shack in the parking lot ever seemed open on the occasions I've gone to shows.
