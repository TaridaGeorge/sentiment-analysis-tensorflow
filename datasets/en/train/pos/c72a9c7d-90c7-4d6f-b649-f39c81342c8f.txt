This is definitely one of my favorite Thai restaurants. It is not too far from Phoenix College, and they have a great lunch deal. It's about $8 for a delicious house salad, and entree. I always get the delicious yellow curry which is served with rice, an egg roll and a slice of watermelon. The food here is so delicious, I come here at LEAST once a week when I'm in school.
