I didn't expect to find a place with some old style BBQ surroundings in Scottsdale. I had the half slab baby backs $16.99, comes with 2 sides, and comes with cornbread. The cornbread, well is a little different, darker, and denser than most, tasted ok. I had cole slaw which was slightly sweet and very good, and the spicy fries which were not very spicy but cooked very well and taste near perfect. The Ribs, moist, smoky, and a nice rub. It all comes with a fry pan of BBQ sauce. The sauce is slightly sweet, hot and very good.
I saw someone else get a sandwich, and it had almost 2 inches of meat on it. Maybe that's next.
Fast subdued friendly service and odd, funny signs on the walls, sure this is Scottsdale? I highly recommend it
