i seriously love this place. 
the owner is an amazing, sweet lady.
the desserts are totally out of hand.
the food is IMPECCABLE. 
and reasonably priced, 
and organic, and locally farmed if possible.
the building that houses this establishment underwent a green remodel.
and the to go stuff is biodegradeable.
and its all reasonably priced!!!!
the only bad thing about this place is that it closes at 3. and is closed on sunday. 

explain to me why you would go eat a cesspool of gloop from harlow's when you could walk across the street and get something healthy and organic and DELICIOUS for the same price. 
you have horrible decision making skills and must be held back if you prefer harlow's to here. seriously.
