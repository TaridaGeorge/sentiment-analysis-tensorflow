As a native Phoenician, I have been coming to Manuel's for the last 15 years and have never, ever had a bad experience here!! The food is always amazing, the service is great, the prices are perfect.  By far my favorite Mexican restaurant in the Valley!! Would highly recommend to anyone.  Very casual atmosphere.
