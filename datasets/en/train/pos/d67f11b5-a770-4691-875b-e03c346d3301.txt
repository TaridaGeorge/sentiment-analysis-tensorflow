Great spot for a peaceful walk with or without your puppy dog.  There are well-marked trails and some with informative plaques regarding local flora.  Couple of decent geocaches in the area as well.

I suspect this is a corridor for traveling wildlife.  I've seen a coyote or two, and imagine the javelinas seen down by sushi brokers came this way.

This is shoehorned in between major roadways, so it is limited in size.   It's long but narrow in spots - or at least that is my impression. But, when you are in the heart of it you do feel away from it all.  However, if you are looking for a true desert walk, this might be a little too urban and sanitized for you.
