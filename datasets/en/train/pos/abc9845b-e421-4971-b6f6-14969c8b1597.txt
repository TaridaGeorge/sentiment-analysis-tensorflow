We came to Olive & Ivy on the last day of my boyfriend's vacation and it made for the perfect ending. I can't compliment our server, Tim, enough for his excellent customer service. We went with lamb meatballs, hummus, and the fritto mizzo (sp) appetizers and were blown away! My boyfriend owns restaurants in California and it takes excellent flavors, textures and quality of food to make him happy. He was so impressed with everything (especially their beer) and we couldn't thank Tim enough for his wonderful attitude and lovely approach. We would have stayed to thank his manager but his flight was leaving in an hour (we got way too caught up with enjoying our dinner). I'm hoping the manager will see this review and thank Tim for his selection in food, beer and being the best waiter we had this weekend!
