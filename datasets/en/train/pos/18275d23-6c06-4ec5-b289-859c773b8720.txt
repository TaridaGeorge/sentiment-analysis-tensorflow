If you do drive it, you can make it all the way to mcdowell coming down w/o hitting the gas once at night.

Silent Sundays!  They shut the road down to cars so bring your skateboard/bike/radio flyer wagon and roll it.

BRING WATER.  I never unserstood how people live in the desert and then end up stuck on a mountain dehydrated with heat stroke.  News flash, its hot and dry here.  Come prepared.   This mountain has probably the best views of the city and some really cool trails.  If you are gonna drive it make sure to fill your tank up because while it takes nothing to get down it youll go thru a half tank getting up it :)
