Roka Akor is the new best place for sushi in town!  Helluva drive but hella worth it.

The decor is absolutely stunning and a great place to go on those dates/anniversaries/birthdays/whatever days.  We asked for sushi bar seating and was seated right away.  The seating gave us a great view of their chef working on the sushi  rolls and they definitely were a piece of art.  Salmon sashimi served on a honking slab of ice??? Ingenious!!

Didn't get a chance to try the kobe beef or the hot pot but the sushi was excellent.  Sapporo beer rounded out the awesome meal and the Tokyopolitan the girlfriend had was worth the money.  

You pay for what you get and Roka Akor is as good as it gets.
