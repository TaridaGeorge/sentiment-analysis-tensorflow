I have to agree with everyone- Loveland is a terrific boutique. Althea finds pretty and fashionable clothes, and I love that they don't look like they're from the mall. The kids' stuff is entirely too adorable, too. 

Bonus- they have a doorway leading directly to Solo Cafe! 

Plus, easy-to-get-to location and easy parking! Definitely worth checking out if you haven't already.
