I have been a fan of Wild Thaiger since 2006!! This is some of the most scrumptious thai food i have had hands down in the Phoenix area.  You HAVE to have the thai iced tea, peanut chicken, and the veggie rolls...yummmm.

The only negative is I recently went there on the weekend and the service was HORRIBLY slow because they only had one server for the whole restaurant, although small.  Im not sure if this was just an unusual day or what because during the week they are speedy.

Love this place!
