I happened about this little gem during a recent Google search and boy, was I happy to find it!

My lady and I had an awesome guide (Ken) who was not bias to our city slicker attire and my inability to make my house go any faster than a slow crawl. We took the two hour ride up a cliff & a mountain with excellent views of Saguaro Lake. We even learned a little bit about the local flora, mainly painfully sharp catci and fauna, a dead pig. It may not sound exciting, but it actually was.

If you are looking for a good time in the desert for a bit of cash and like horses, than this is the place to go. Judgments will not be cast no matter what type of designer jeans you are wearing.
