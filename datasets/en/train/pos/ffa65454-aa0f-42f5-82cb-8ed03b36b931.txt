This place is amazing and my friends and I have been coming here for years! I have two favorites... The first is just regular pho with well done brisket. Simple but super tasty. My other fave is their #22... Bun Bo Hue. It's like pho broth but spicy and it comes with the thicker noodles. I also like their Thai Iced Tea.

Their service is great... All the people that work there are really friendly. One of the guys there even remembers my order down to a T... Not just which pho I want but also that I don't like white onions(I prefer cilantro instead), and that I use a fork and not the chopsticks that are already provided on the table. I'm a little picky so I think it's really nice that he remembers.

Try this place, you'll love it!
