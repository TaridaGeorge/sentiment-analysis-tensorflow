I'm a drummer and Sam Ash is the place to go for all your drum needs.  Guitar center has a small selection and not nearly all of the smaller items I need.  The staff is great and very knowledgeable.  If they didn't have something I needed they would order it for me.  The guitar section is just as big as guitar centers.  I also know they have free clinics often, but I've never been so I can't speak on how they are.  Basically it's like guitar center as far as selection and prices go, but with a way better staff, and an actual care for their customers.
