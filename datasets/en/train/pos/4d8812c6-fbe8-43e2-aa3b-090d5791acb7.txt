I've only eaten here once but it's hard to imagine a better burger. Went in on a Friday night and was seated immediately. It was busy but not packed. Ordered the Kobe burger with tempura mushrooms and Asian slaw and it was absolutely amazing. Also got the six cheese scalloped potatoes and while it wasn't a huge portion, they were fantastic. For 2 burgers, a couple drinks, an appetizer and a side the bill was roughly $60. 

I plan on going here again and soon.
