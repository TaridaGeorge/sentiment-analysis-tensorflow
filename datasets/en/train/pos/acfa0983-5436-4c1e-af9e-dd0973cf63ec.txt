Unfortunately, we used to live in the hood (Coronado). Then we moved. Then Lisa G opened up. Then we wanted to move back to the hood! I can only imagine how awesome it would be to be able to walk there.

Keeping it simple:
The Meatballs are big and magical. Get them on the bread as a Grinder. Love them so much we ordered 60 of them for a party. All gone!

The trio of sliders are inventive, fresh tasting and delicious.

The Juno, chicken sandwich with caramelized onions on fresh ciabatta, is crack.

We didn't know Lisa when we fell in love with the place. But we know her now because we love her food. She is a wonderful and funny person. But even if she were a raging psychotic bitch, I'd keep coming back ;-)
