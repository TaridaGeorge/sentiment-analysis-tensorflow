5-star rating for the beer!

Beer tasting platter--what a freakin' awesome idea. Forget food! Just order this smorgasbord of delicious yeasty-ness and drink your dinner. 

Some Phoenix-based friends took us to this brewery for dinner one evening and that is when we discovered... the Four Peaks beer tasting platter. This idea is not a foreign one for mini-breweries like Four Peaks, but the quality offered here is second to none. 

I wish I could remember the names of the ones we liked the best... but we finished the lot before our dinner arrived, leading for a semi-sloppy evening. All in all, just try it for yourselves--you won't be disappointed.
