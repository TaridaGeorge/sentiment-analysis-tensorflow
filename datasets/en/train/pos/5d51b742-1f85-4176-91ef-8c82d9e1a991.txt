This steakhouse in Phoenix is a historic landmark!  Step into the walls of this establishment, and you'll be whisked back in time to an era where you could imagine Frank Sanatra and James Dean dining on steak in the corner booth.  The service, food and ambiance is not to be missed.  They do steak the way it should be done, and many amazing dishes!
