I don't think we could have found a more lovely place to spend an evening for an outdoor concert and the entire next day!

The plants, metal sculptures and displays are  w o n d e r f u l !!

Watch out, though.  I got "dive-bombed" by a hummingbird who was in a terrible rush to engage in a mating ritual (which I was witness to).

And since my friend and I were there two days in a row, she now knows her way there by heart.
