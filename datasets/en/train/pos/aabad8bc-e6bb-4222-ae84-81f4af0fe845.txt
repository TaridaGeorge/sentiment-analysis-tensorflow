Our server was great, attentive and personable!! You dont find that much these days so that is why im complimenting this location.  We ordered a beef something salad (AMAZING!), chicago pan pizza (takes 45 min. btw), and my FIRST EVER pizza-cookie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! how on earth did it take me so long to get one? I dont know... I have discovered a new vice and that is the pizza cookie!! My only drag about this place is how they dont take reservations... which is lame to me since the waits are always so long * we got sat right away last night though!!  Im just SAYING- they should take reservations.  Oregano's and the service was awesome.
