Back here in Phoenix again, and our first stop for dinner is always Via Delosantos. Love, love, love this place.

It's nothing super-special, just good food, good service, excellent prices. 

We always sit in the bar - love the vibe in there. It's casual, and definitely a "local" spot, but you never feel out of place. Free chips and salsa and the two salsas are delish.

Only weird thing was this time, I wanted two different kinds of chili rellenos... one cheese and one shredded beef, with a side of rice and beans.... they brought me TWO COMPLETE dinners..... each plate with rice & beans. Odd.

Stopped back a couple days later for a margarita at the bar after an evening out, and the bartender and all the patrons were fun and friendly and you can't beat the $2.99 margaritas. 

It's always busy - that says it all.
