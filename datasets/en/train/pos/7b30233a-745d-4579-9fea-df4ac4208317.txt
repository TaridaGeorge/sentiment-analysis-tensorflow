so i'm a chocoholic.  love good chocolate.  well, okay, love bad chocolate too.  have been even known to walk around cities on a chocolate-ice cream-tasting exhibition.  (you know: try ten different chocolate ice creams---to see which is the best...)

but, i go to sweet republic and consistently find myself **not** ordering the chocolate ice cream!  yes, the other flavors are just that good---to make me give up chocolate!  i've even been known to order the basil lime sorbet.  sorbet?  really?  i feel like such an ice cream fake... but, its just that good.... 

the one disappointment is the cheese ice cream.  it sounds so crazy that, you think, its got to be awesome.  plus, its cheese, and who doesn't like cheese, right?  but, i just can't get into it.... 

after writing this review, i feel like i've let down my two favorite food groups: chocolate and cheese...
