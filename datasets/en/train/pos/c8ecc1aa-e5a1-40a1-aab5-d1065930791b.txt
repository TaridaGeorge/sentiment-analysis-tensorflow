This place is great! Just opened up on central just south of camelback on the west side of the road. 
...AMAZING gelato and the coffee is just what I need! Family owned, really friendly staff, free wifi, flat screen tvs,....also just saw a flier for a monday movie night...I guess they are gonna have double features on mondays...even made a specialty drink for the night....sounds like fun!

...cool little spot, dont hesitate to check this place out!
