Came to this place after a horrid time at The Firehouse, very accomidating.  Service was a bit slow but the man working the tv's was all over it for the football games.  It usually takes forever for these bars to change stations or figure out their own systems but this man was walking arond with the remote knowing what to do.  And the food was very good and reasonable.
