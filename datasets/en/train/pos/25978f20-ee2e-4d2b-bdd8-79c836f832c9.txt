Although, my sports bar/grill experience is a little more limited than most I must say Santisi Brothers ROCKS!!! I personally enjoy the happy hours typically on Friday evenings! I have found that the drinks are made strong (which is highly pleasurable) and the food is yummiiiieeeeee! I do find that the food is always served nice and hot. 

Oh who can forget the service team...great to look according to the guys I know. They have a great personality and are always happy to help! 

I would recommend Santisi brothers for a happy hour...which I know I will be there in about an hour or so!! See ya there!
