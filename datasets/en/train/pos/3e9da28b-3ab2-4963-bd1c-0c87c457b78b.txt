What?!? There is a Cartel Coffee downtown?! How did I miss this for so long???!! 

I only "discovered" this location while aimlessly wandering around on my lunch break a few weeks and have been back weekly since!  The staff here is great and friendly. And, as one of them told me, they treat coffee like more of a science here.  They know their stuff and are always sure to highlight some of the tasting and flavor notes within a particular blend.

Their toddys are the best I've had and their pastries are divine! And to make it even better, their baked goodies are all half off starting at 1:30 in the afternoon - which happens to perfectly match my lunch hour.
