I recently had an issue I needed to been seen promptly for so I called the office and the phone was answered right away!  I was happy that they could see me the next day because I was worried about a mole my hair dresser had seen on my scalp that day.  Jessica Rosenberg, PA was very thorough and looked at the mole and told me was fine, but we decided to remove it because it was getting irritated from my brush.  She also looked at a few other spots and really took her time.  If you have a skin issue..this is an excellent place for medical care.
