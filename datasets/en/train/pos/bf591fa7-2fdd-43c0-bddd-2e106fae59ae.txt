This place just opened up one block from where I live. Big plus so I don't have to drive to the Chandler Mall any more. The place is obviously clean (new place) and I like the decoration. It has a tv and two big walls where you can leave your personal message with a marker. The owner was walking around introducing himself. Pretty classy. Only downside, the yogurt machine take awhile but that could be because they are new!? We'll be regulars.
