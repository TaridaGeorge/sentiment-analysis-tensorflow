All staff at Lesco in Scottsdale have such a  wonderful and helpful attitude.  I am hard to please  with adjustments and received kindness and smiles through it all.  My husband ordered from Canada, we arrived, and they had held his frames for him as promised.  We have both worn and ordered new prescription for many years, and we have never received the service that Lesco staff gave us.  We thank you all and wish we had found you many years ago. However we will be back. Cathy and Rome
