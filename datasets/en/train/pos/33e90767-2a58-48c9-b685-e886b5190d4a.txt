WoW! What an environment, this place is a Chandler icon. Outside felt California-ish - wind blowing , curtains reminded me of LL Bean catalog as well as the awning. Inside mellow, hip, music slightly loud for a one-on-one date but enjoyable. High quality clientele turnout. We were there at 9:30 pm and moderately filled on a wed, but my wife was there earlier w friends (7 pm) and it was packed. Water served in cool glass jars. 

We ordered a Root Beer Martini $8 - yummy and STRONG! Great hummus & bread (had the spicy pepper), 

Dessert a pazookie (they don't call it that for obvious reasons) didn't knock my socks off , but pretty darn good

Venue seems ideal for groups of 3-6 or so but can accommodate what looks like 10-12 is a good max size

I look forward to promoting your venue to my friends
