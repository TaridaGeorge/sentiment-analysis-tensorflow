I eat here frequently. I really dig the medium extra crispy chicken wings. They also do a really decent job of New York style pizza.

They have a GREAT lunch deal: 2 slices of cheese pizza with a drink for $5.00 including tax! Its way better than a CrapDonalds Value Meal!

Also a must recommend: The sugarfree lemoncello cheese cake! Sooo good!
