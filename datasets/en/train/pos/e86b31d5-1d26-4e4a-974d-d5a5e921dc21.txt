So, I pretty much love Sprinkles...I love the store, I love the cupcakes, and I love the service.  I live in San Diego, but I have family in Scottsdale and every time I am there, I hit up Sprinkles.  So far, my favorite is the Red Velvet...delicious.  My least favorite, although it was still good, the lemon coconut.
