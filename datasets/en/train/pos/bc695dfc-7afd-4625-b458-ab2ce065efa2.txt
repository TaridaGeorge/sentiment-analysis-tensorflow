What a wonderful museum! I especially liked the modern art area. Went with 2 adults, a 9 and 4 year old and 3 month old. In many museums this would be frowned upon especially by other patrons but we were pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, the kids area was closed the day we were there. Thank goodness they were all quite happy to check out the other exhibits! We only made it through about half of them before deciding that it would be best for us to leave the others for another visit. Loved the courtyard outside and would love to go back sans kids for a meal at the cafe. It will likely be a while before that happens because EVERYDAY the kids ask when we're going back!
