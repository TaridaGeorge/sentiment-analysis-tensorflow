Bought a tire from here due to a nail puncture in May. The same thing happens in August and they replaced it in 10 minutes flat! Printed me a receipt and waved good-bye. (FREE of charge)
Aaaaaand when I was there in May, my wheel cover was broken while they were attempting to remove it. They kept it, still have it and are seeking a replacement for it.
This location is convenient, efficient, clean, friendly and fairly priced!
