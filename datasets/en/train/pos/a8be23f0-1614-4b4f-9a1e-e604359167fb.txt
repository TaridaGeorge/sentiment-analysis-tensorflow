Yes...  going to have to say it... lives up to the name!!!  I have never been to a pho-stablishment that features the variety of regional cuisines of Vietnam.  Just happened that we had the owner take our order.  He was very willing to spend the time explaining the various regional variations of noodle soups on the menu despite it being a busy Friday night.  Not to mention, the food was delicious!
