We went early, 8am on a Sunday for breakfast.  There was a 5 minute wait (although they don't quote wait times), and we sat at the bar counter.  The coffee was delicious, as was the daily lemonade.  We ordered an egg special with country sausage patties, homefries, and toast.  My husband is a huge sausage fan, and he thought it was very good.  The bacon was delish, and the pancakes were simply but fluffy and flavorful.  We will be back, but we will go early because by the time we left, there was a very lengthy wait.
