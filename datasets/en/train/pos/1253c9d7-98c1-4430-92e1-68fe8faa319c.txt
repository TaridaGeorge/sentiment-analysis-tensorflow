Normally, I would deduct a star for having to wait three, that's right, three hours to get a table. But Chris Bianco, himself, mans the  kitchen and it's clear that he puts his heart into making pizza. There were four of us for dinner, so we sampled all the salads and appetizers, which were all wonderful and then had the wiseguy pizza which had homemade fennel sausage as one of the ingredients. 
And for a rare event in Phoenix - it was freezing cold. We luckily managed to get a spot in the bar next door where we could keep warm. 
Parking is limited, so if you have to park in the adjoining garage, as we did, make sure you bring your parking stub to get validated.
