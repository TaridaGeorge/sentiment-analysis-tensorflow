Let me just say, this gym is not your typical gym.  First you have to work.  There is no slacking. Prescribed workouts let you know what you will be doing for the day and take no more than 30 minutes.  But that is the most painful 30 minutes of your life.  Everyone gets a personal trainer, yes everyone.  And they make that work out easier.  Between motivation, form correction and their great attitudes, you go in thinking "I can't do that" and leave wondering "How did I just do that".

Give these guys a chance and they will change your attitude and motivation.
