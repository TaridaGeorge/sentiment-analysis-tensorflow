I was in need of a fill, Steve was amazing!  I went over on my lunch hour and he had me in and out quickly.  I must admit I'm happier with the job he did then my regular place.  There is nothing special about the front of this location, but dont judge there is so much more inside!  All of the people were very friendly, it was clean, and there wasnt that strong nail salon smell.  I'm a customer for good now!
