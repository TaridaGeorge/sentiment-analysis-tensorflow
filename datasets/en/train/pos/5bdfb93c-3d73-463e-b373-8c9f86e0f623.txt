I'm from San Diego so I'm very picky about my sushi. This place is top notch at a great price. It's hard to be in Scottsdale and find great food at the right price but Sakana breaks the Scottsdale barriers. I absolutely love this place. The portions are big and the atmosphere is cute. Not too shabby.
