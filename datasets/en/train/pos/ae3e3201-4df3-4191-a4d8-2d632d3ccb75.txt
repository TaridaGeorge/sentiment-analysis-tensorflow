WOW!!  Great experience!  At Salon Faith they not only do a great job when it comes to cutting, coloring or styling you hair but they more importantly educate about your hair.  It's great to have an expert such as Salon Faith teach you how to achieve the "I just walked our of a salon" look everyday.  I cannot count how many times in the past I only loved my hair the day of the visit, and now my hair feels like it visits everyday.  There's a saying, "If you are having a great hair day, you are having a great day!", at Salon Faith they set up for success everyday.  Thank you for your expertise!!
