Never ever had a problem (knock on wood) and I have used many different drycleaning services all over town. I've been to some places that have trashed party dresses and lost things and not compensated properly. I had my silk wedding dress cleaned at Prestige, they claim that they can take any stain out if they know what it was from but they are too pricey, request additional pay for a redo if they missed a stain, and don't have the convenient hours that Delia's has. Delia's workers are very nice and Anthony is an exceptional employee (no I'm not related to him or know him personally) he is professional, smart about the business and very helpful.
