Well we returned to caddy ranch for dinner, as the management really does care about the reviews, we were invited back for a "make up" dinner...   BLOWN AWAY.  Like I said before, the food was phenomenal my  chicken fried steak was AMAZING.. I'm sure the reason for inviting us back was not to pad the review or get me to change what i said, just to change my outlook on the establishment, which they did indeed.. prob would just take my own advice and realize the food is AWESOME and original , and above all they really do care about whether you would return or suggest them to friends. I will definitely do both now!!!    Good Job Caddy Ranch!!
