Try the any of the curries!!! We eat here once a week (Tuesday Thai). Small mom & pop place with good food, good prices, and friendly, quaint atmosphere. Thai Chef's Bistro is spicier than most (i.e., their "4" seems spicier than other "4"s I've had.), but that's how I like it. The nearby Thai House is good, but I like this better.
