I have to update and say that after my previous review of poor service, I was contacted by their Manager Mandi who appologized and committed to send us a gift card to come back - their treat.  Today we received our $30 gift card, and will gladly come back and give CB&C another try.  

Thanks Mandi for being one of the few business managers who actually follow up.  Seems to be rare these days.  Well done. :)
