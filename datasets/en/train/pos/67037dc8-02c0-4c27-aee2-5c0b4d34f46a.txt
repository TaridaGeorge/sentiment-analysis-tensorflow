Its great to walk into a place and be greeted right away, and when you return they remember you.  Customer service is a lost art in most establishments, not at Terroir.

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the wines they carry and they will let you taste what they are pouring by the glass if you are having trouble making a decision.  The cheese selection is great and the staff will recommend what goes with your wine.

Great wines, comfortable seating, great atmosphere, wifi, fantastic patio, and you can bring your dog, can't beat it.
