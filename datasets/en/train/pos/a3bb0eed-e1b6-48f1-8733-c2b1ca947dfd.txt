This place is great for good at a good price. You can get a combo meal for about $6. Their burgers are made from sirloin burger and extremely good. I usually get the patty melt.  The rye bread is butter toasted and so stinkin' good!  They're small patties, so it's a good idea to order a double. The onion rings are the best I've had at a fast food restaurant. 

The custard is so creamy and rich. They can make basically anything you like, but plain vanilla is pretty tasty.

The service is also outstanding. If you dine in, a manager will walk by and ask how everything was. Excellent customer service.
