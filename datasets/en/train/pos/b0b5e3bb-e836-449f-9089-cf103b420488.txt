They have the best pho tai. The broth is home made and not from a can. The egg rolls and spring rolls are really good. Bahn xeo is also the best I have had.. bahn xeo is a rice crepe filled with sauted bean sprouts, pork, and shrimp. You wrap it in romaine lettuce and dip it in the fish sauce. It looks kinda of like an omelette but there is no egg in it. The service is a little slow but it is well worth it, the two guy waiters kinda just float around, just holla at them if ya need anything. The fried rice and roasted chicken is also really good. Very affordable and so yum o!
