LOVE IT! I found this place on Hautelook about a month ago and booked it after seeing all the amazing photos on their website. I surprised my bf and took him here for his bday and he was totally blown away by how awesome the resort is. We had the opportunity to eat at SWB. The food was great. In regards to their pool, its pretty awesome. They're all so spacious and plentiful. It was never crowded and it really felt like we were on a secret vacation. The rooms were pretty big and even had a fridge for all your goodies. Because of my experience at this hotel, i would def return to Scottsdale.
