Love this place!  We are there every Sunday morning for breakfast.  Everything is good.  Huge portions.  Big fan of the hopple popple and corned beef hash.  Pancakes, oatmeal and omelets are great as well.

The staff and service are outstanding, a great place to go, relax and have the best breakfasts!

 Love to sit on the patio.
