I love this place! I've been here on a crazy Friday night, a weekday morning, a weekday night, and a Sunday morning during a festival and I've never had anything but an amazing experience! I went here on my birthday and the food/atmosphere was perfect. To be honest, my server wasn't great (she didn't even notice it was my birthday when she IDed me, or when my friend announced "it's his birthday!") but every restaurant has one of those. The burger Alfredo is insane, it's so good! Just watch out because apparently New Jersey moms frequent this place (probably for the attractive young servers :/) I absolutely recommend this place any time of day!
