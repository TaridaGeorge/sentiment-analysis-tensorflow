My first experience with PJ's was when 1-800 Flowers let me down and i was in a mad dash to find a florist to get my flowers delivered. I called PJ's and even though it was towards the end of the day, and last minute, they came through for me. I have used them three times since then and have never been let down, I fully reccomend Pj's!
