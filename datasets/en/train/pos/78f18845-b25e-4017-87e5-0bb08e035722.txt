Another great place to eat. I actually drive by the Santa Monica location 6-8 times per day, but never had a chance to go in to see what it's all about. So 400 miles away, I got my opportunity. 

I had the grilled salmon with asparagus and broccoli. Very well made and excellent tender salmon quality. 

The environment doesn't get better either. Great seating and great atmosphere. 

Again, if I didn't live in Los Angeles, I would eat here all the time.
