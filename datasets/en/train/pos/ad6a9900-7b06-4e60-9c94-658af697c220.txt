Organ Stop is like a trip down memory lane. Our family used to go a very looooong time ago, in the early 80's, when they were located in far West Mesa. 

As a child I  can remember this giant organ bursting out of the ground like magic. As it towered over the audience, complete with lights and sounds I was mesmerized by its beauty. It's a childhood memory that is seared into my brain. I'm sure many of the children that go will find it truly magical. 

The food is not what you go for, it is the entertainment and novelty of seeing this incredible organ being played, and the experience of enjoying something that you won't find many other places.
