This place is EXCELLENT!! My husband and I met up with a family member of mine here for a late lunch and I ordered the turkey bacon sandwich with chipotle sauce and it was absolutely delicious!! The service was great, employees very friendly. Since it was near closing they threw in free dessert which were these raspberry chocolate cupcakes which were to die for. It's unfortunate that we don't live close to this establishment because we would go here all the time!!! Hopefully we will visit some time soon when we're in the area!
