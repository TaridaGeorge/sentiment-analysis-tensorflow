I was recommended to Dodge Electric by my sister. I'm happy to say that I was highly impressed by Dodge Electric and their expert services and fair prices. We hired DE to install our alarm system (they also provide monitoring), misc. electrical issues, and low voltage lighting for us. I can't ask for a better electric co.!

By the way, I do think its odd that "Joe M's" review of Dodge Electric is the ONLY review he's ever made.
