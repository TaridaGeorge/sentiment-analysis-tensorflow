I love Lee Lee's! I love asian food, drinks, desserts and candy. There is such a great variety and it's a great place to buy new things to try at home, and half the time you don't know what you are buying so that just makes it all the more interesting. There is plenty of fish and assorted animals, the duck is especially delicious.
There is also a section of little trinkets and sculptures and statues. Very interesting, I bought myself a golden Elephant one time.
