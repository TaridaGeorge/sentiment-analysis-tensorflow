I went here in Valentines Day, third time I have been here, started by going to the bar for happy hour. The place is always busy for dinner on Friday nights. 

They have some very good martini's, I'm a gin drinker and they use tanqueray for their martini's. 

The caprese salad is a good appetizer.

I love there french dip, I a meat sandwich guy, and am always on a lookout for these. They have this down. 

The Banana Desert the the white chocalate shavings is really good finish. 

The services is really good, only one time at the bar, the bartender couldn't keep up on the ordering, didn't work a good uniform method of serving everyone, kind of favored the middle seated patrons.
