I challenge you to find another pizzeria half as good as Pizzeria Bianco. After reading a few of the reviews on here about this place, I really am quite surprised. I have been here MANY times before and never once would I have given my pizza less than 9.5/10. Each pizza is handmade by the owner and baked in a stone, wood-fired oven. Who could ask for more?

There seem to be a few people that don't understand the hours of waiting required to get a taste. Considering the entire building (including kitchen) is likely under 1000 sq ft, I think Bianco and his staff do an impeccable job at keeping things moving along. Sadly, they even have an entire additional building next door used just as a bar/waiting room. If you hear or read about people complaining of the wait, I would probably file these people under "scrooges."
