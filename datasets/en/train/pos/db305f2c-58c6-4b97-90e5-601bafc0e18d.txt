You'd miss Harlow's if you weren't looking for it, but you MUST stop here for breakfast.

A classic hole in the wall place, you'll either love the dive-y atmosphere think you're in classic movie posters hell. But don't worry, the coffee is hot, the waitresses are friendly, and the food is absolutely amazing. If the full parking lot didn't give you that clue, the food will!

Prices are average and reasonable.

GET HERE for Sunday brunch or a Tuesday morning before work. You won't regret it and will most likely be back before you know it. A Tempe staple!
