LGO is one of my favs.  Amazing flavor whether ording pizza or any of their sandwhiches (like tuna filet) or salads.  Pizzas (available with both smokey chewy flour or glueten free crusts) are to die for...Mother Earth Vegan and Rocketman are my two favorites (both vegetarian).

English Muffins are really the best of anywhere...I never knew how good a soft, freshly backed muffin could be, as it just melts your pallet.  

The only negative: parking is horrible (mainly since the place is so popular)...so use the free valet or go at mid-times.   Nontheless, the food and atmosphere more than make amends.
