I just purchased a used Acura TL from Power Subaru this weekend and had a fantastic experience. They were helpful, upfront and were genuinely interested in my satisfaction.  This was by far the most positive experience I've had purchasing a car from a dealer. 

I live in New Mexico and flew in to buy the car.  They picked me up from the airport and worked with through the whole process. Their price was fair and they didn't push the up sell items (warranty, anti-theft, etc) hard.  Shortly after I drove away the airbag light came on, I went back and they checked it out (it wouldn't come back on). They told me if it did to call them and they'd arrange for an Acura dealer in NM to look at it and they would pay any costs.

I highly recommend them.
