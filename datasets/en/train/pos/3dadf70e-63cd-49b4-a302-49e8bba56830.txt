for the price? awesome. 
got a two bed suite to share with a golf buddy and we had too much of everything.  too many couches, pillows, you name it.  free breakfast, free parking, free internet, you name it.  i loved it.  oh.. and the suites have kitchens so that was a nice touch.  and its close to walking to everything ..if it isnt too hot!
