I never thought I would find a viable option for espresso in Tempe without the 70+ people at Extreme Bean on a regular basis when I have tried to go there. I don't need a place option terribly late as I am not a night owl or a social butterfly in the mornings.

I like intimate with excellent beans and friendliness. Solo is all this and beyond.

The art is amazing.
The books I could stare at for hours alone.
The velvet couch had my name on it as I walked in the door.

Geez. 
Can't get better than this in the area.
