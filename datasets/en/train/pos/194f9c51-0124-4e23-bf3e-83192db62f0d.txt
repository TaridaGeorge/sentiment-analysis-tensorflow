I've been to a few laundromats back in the day, but got spoiled with my own washer/dryer. Then I moved to an apartment with a washer/dryer combo (like in one machine). It was tiny and could barely hold 1/2 a load. So, I went down the street to this place and loved it. 

Unlike the other laundromats I've been to, this place was air-conditioned. It had plenty of machines in a variety of sizes. Also the staff was helpful in showing me how to use the machine. Just a tad on the pricey size for the larger machines. But, no complaints over all. The place is wonderful! Highly recommend. 

They even have a fluff and fold service available, if you are interested in that.
