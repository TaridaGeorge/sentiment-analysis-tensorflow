Fez is swell, juuuuust swell. I love taking out-of-towners here or chilling with my local peeps on a Friday night. It's an attractive space filled with all kinds of people. Very welcoming and posh without feeling uninviting. The kind of place you could wear that hat in the back of your closet that looked like a good idea in the store. Why not? Sure you can pull off a fedora here.

The veggie options are spectacular - though my one caveat is that you'll taste garlic in your mouth for DAYS after eating the hummus plate. Worth it. Wash it down with a damn good margarita and you'll be fine. Seriously, the margaritas are fabulosos. Happy hour and weekend specials are super cheap, and the service is incredibly friendly to boot. Alotta good goin on up in here.
