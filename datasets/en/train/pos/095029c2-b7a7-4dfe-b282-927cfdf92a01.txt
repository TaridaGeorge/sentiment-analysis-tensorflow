So I have been frequenting this shopping center since they started slowly opening a few places at a time a few months ago. This center is looking to be the creme de la creme of North PHX shopping and dining. Its better than across the street on the South side (Applebee's, Olive Garden and the worst offender Logans Roadhouse bleh!) Yes there are chains over here too but what can you do?? With the only Paciugo Gelato in AZ I cant complain! Check my Norterra list for a feel of some things you will find here. There are still quite a few places left to open like Ah-So for sushi and Miami Rice Pudding! It's definitely the best stuff we have seen up around these parts!!!
