White Chocolate Grill came highly recommended by friends and it did not disappoint.  The service, the food and the atmosphere were excellent.  We dined there for lunch after making a reservation on opentable.com.  We both had premium salads that were fresh, filling and delicious.  We didn't leave room for dessert this visit, but we surely will next time.

I look forward to returning to White Chocolate soon for a steak.  The menu posted on their website, www.whitechocolategrill.com, has a good steak selection and I am anxious to try one soon.  My lunch partner had the filet mignon salad and the filet was excellent.
