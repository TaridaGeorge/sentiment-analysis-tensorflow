I  always take first-time Phoenix visitors here and they instantly think I am (and all of Phoenix)  waaay cooler than I actually am.  Has a great vibe, always jamming the jazz music and has friendly waiters.  And don't forget the Pizzookie! (sp?)  If you are planning on ordering deep-dish and aren't wanting to make a day of it, you may want to peruse the menu online and call your order in, or at least  right you get there (even at typically slow times, there's always a bit of a wait for a table).
