One bite and I felt like I was in Thailand, all that was missing was the sand to sink my toes in.  I had a seasonal special which had pumpkin.  It was fabulous.  My husband had the green curry and he had it hot just the way he liked it.  He usually eats things extremely spicy but the hot but perfect, he did not order the Thai hot which could have been too hot even for him.  The wine list was pretty good for a Thai place.  I will most definitely be going back for more.
