This is probably my favorite old school Chinese restaurant in the Valley.  The quality of the food is always consistent and the service very friendly.  My favorite is their kung pao veggies.  They include a nice selection of veggies in the dish and the sauce is nice and spicy.  I have also enjoyed their pepper beef and orange chicken.  I know someone who always gets their egg foo young and loves it.  The vegetable spring rolls are also very good and so is their egg drop soup.  The atmosphere is nice and quiet, making it a great place to sit and dine, either in a group or alone.
