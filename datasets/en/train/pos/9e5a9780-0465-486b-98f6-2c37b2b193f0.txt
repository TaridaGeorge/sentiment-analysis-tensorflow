Absolutely the best happy hour in the valley! I am so glad it's just over a mile from my house!

Try the half-price lamb chops during HH (if you like lamb). An incredible meal, but also very sharable.

One warning: These martinis, even at HH, are really double martinis. Keep that in mind before you drive! (And even if you have a driver, I'd never drink a third!)
