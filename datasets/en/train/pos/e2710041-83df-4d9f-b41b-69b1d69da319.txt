Probably the best gunsmith I have ever used. He has done several trigger jobs on handguns and did an excellent blueing job on a S&W Mod 19 that I was ready to throw away. It came out so nice that its a keeper for sure now. He also installed a Creedmore ladder sight on my 44 Henry and it's so accurate I can hit the steel plate at 300 yards as good as a 30-06 with a scope. Someone mentioned high prices. I used to buy ammo in bulk at gun shows but don't even bother going anymore. The shows at the fairground charge $7 to park and $18 to get in the show. That's like paying $25 to get in to Bass Pro Shop.
