SO I haven't actually eaten here...but I keep hearing about this danged place! Upon one visit to Arizona, someone in our group did start to wait in line to come eat here....but we got too hungry and ate elsewhere.

However, I went to Italy with my friend Darlene this past summer AND we ate at Mario Batali's Pizzeria Mozza in L.A. She says the pizza here is even better than any place in Italy or at Mario's restaurant......HOW CAN THIS BE?!?!??!
I just don't get it?!?!?!

I vowed to myself after experiencing "nice cool" 85 degree springtime weather in Arizona that I would never go back out into the desert.
And yet...now I feel compelled to come back just to try this pizza....
Can it really be this good?!??!?!?!
Hmmmm....
Yah.
Maybe in the winter time.

Hold a place in line for me!!!!!!!!!!
