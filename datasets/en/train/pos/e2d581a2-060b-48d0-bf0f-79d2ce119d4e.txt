I've personally been to this store and have also ordered items over the phone and email. I randomly found this shop by browsing online when I was in Phoenix for work last year and decided just to give it a try.  

They have great turquoise jewelry that is hand made by local artists.  They have excellent prices, great selection of items, and their staff is genuine, polite, and very helpful.  I randomly found this shop by browsing online when I was in Phoenix for work last year.  I highly recommend it and have bought gifts for others from there since visiting the store.  I mentioned to their staff that I live in Nashville, TN and they told me that Winona Judd shops at their store! 

Give them a call or email for your turquoise jewelry needs.
