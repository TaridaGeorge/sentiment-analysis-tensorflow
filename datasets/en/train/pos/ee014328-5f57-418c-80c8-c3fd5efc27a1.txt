I fell in love with this Scottsdale treasure a few months ago.  Its the perfect place to grab lunch with friends, or to celebrate birthdays or wedding/baby showers.  I enjoyed the wild mushroom, spinach goat cheese tart, and a glass of chardonay, whilst sitting on the patio.  It was such a wonderful experience.  I look forward to my next visit there!
