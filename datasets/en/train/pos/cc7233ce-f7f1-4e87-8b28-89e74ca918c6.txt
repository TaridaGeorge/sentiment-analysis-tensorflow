Love Latitude Eight!  David has always been wonderful to myself and anyone I bring there.  Had our wedding rehearsal dinner there just over a week ago.  We were tight on funds and David suggested a cocktail hour with appetizers.  Reasonable prices for the food and drinks we received.  Lots of family members had not had Thai food before and everyone enjoyed the spread. Great ambiance, and Regina is fantastic as well. We can always count on a good evening there.  Highly recommend.
