Oh--I love this place!  Even though I have toy breeds, washing two at a time can be time consuming. Using their professional equipment trying makes their coats shine--and they just smell sooooo good for at least a week. 
The employees are always helpful and friendly--I would recommend Wag N' Wash to anyone looking for cheaper way to groom their pet.
