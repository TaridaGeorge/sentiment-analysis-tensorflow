Costumes are appropriate all year long! :D 

I love this place BECAUSE of the following:
~It's a local/family owned business
~they have a great variety of costumes to buy & rent
~they also carry gag/prank gifts ;D
~they aren't seasonal! you can visit any time of the year :)

The last item I purchased was a ninja set..... lol! The little nephew is gonna love it!

P.S. Pets & Children are welcomed in this store, but both must be accompanied by their owner :)
