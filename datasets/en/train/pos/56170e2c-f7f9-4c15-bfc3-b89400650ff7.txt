Amazing Bartenders, awsome place to meet people if you're in your thirties and single (I met my wife there some years back now).  Food is just fine the menu is simple.  If you want a great meal go around the corner to Morton's.  

Great scene on Thursday and Friday nights, starting about 4:30 pm, but it's  completely done by 7:30 at the latest.  Tip your bartenders well and become a regular.
