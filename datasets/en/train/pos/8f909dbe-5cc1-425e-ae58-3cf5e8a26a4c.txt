A little Italian oasis in the desert ;o)
We go straight to the pastries... looking for Canolli and Tiramisu.
Their Canolli, YES... it's sooo good...  
The Tiramisu I think it's just okay...
And then they have all kinds of cool Italian theme t-shirts, like "FBI - Full Blooded Italian"... which is cool...
So, make sure to get the Cannoli when you come over here, and they have the chocolate one also... we bought 10 of them the other day...ba da bim, ba da bum, then they're gone ;o)
