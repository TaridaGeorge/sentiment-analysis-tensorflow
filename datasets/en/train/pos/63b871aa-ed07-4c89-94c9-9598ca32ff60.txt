I think my scream of glee could be heard across the world when I found this place!  This Vine turned 1/2 restuarant of the day (Badda Boom then Maddie G's..what's next?) and 1/2 sushi/fantastic patio bar is such a score for us "east valley" folks....

They have great drinks and sushi, never tried anything else. You can't beat a drink in a fish bowl and it's just doggone fun to say "guppie cup"!
