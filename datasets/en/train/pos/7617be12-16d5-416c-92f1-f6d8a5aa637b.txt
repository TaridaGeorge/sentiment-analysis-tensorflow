This place is super great for lunch and is really cheap. Get all of their sandwiches on handmade pita for a great experience. The arabic coffee and pomegranate juice are great as well. They only do take out on certain days of the week but don't let that stop you. This is the best Middle Eastern food in the Tempe area for sure, not to mention the most affordable! Woop Woop!
