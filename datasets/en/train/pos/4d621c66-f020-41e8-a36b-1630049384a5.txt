This is THE place to go for a custom cake!
Baby shower cakes, first birthday cakes, insane wedding cakes, everything you can think of!
Any type of pie, cake combo (pistacio or strawberry mousse have to be my favorites), cheesecakes (prickly pear, snickers, margarita, etc).
Also a walk in bakery now, you can get muffins, crossants, cupcakes, fruit tarts, lamon tarts, brownies, 12+ different kinds of petit fours (aka petit sweets), giant eclairs, berry crostatas, doughnuts, tea bread, tea, coffee, or even a 6 inch tiramisu, strawberry bavarian, or chocolate mousse cake.
Only uses quality ingredients & fresh fruit. AND everything is made fresh daily!
