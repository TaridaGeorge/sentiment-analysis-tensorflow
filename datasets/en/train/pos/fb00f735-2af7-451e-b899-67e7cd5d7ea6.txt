This place is awesome! It just opened on Mill and we came here after a baseball game  and caught happy hour. Three of us got a seaweed salad, 2 Philly rolls, a spicy tuna roll, 2 Vegas rolls and a yum yum roll for about $27..  plus the portions are really generous for a sushi place! And being from the bay area we know good sushi and this is def my new favorite spot. Next time we will come here for their drinks happy hour which is also legit.
