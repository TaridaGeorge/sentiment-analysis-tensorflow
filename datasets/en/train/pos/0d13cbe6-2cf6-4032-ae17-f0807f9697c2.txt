It was a pleasant surprise to find that they serve local and organic foods.  I ordered the organic grass fed burger and It was great, cooked perfect, and the service was wonderful.  I don't normally order desert but when I saw they had bread pudding I said what the heck.  It was by far the best bread pudding I've ever had and I will definitely be back to have it again.
