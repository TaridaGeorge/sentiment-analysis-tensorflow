I had to pleasure of going to cherry blossom last nite with a good friend and lemme tell you it never disappoints me. i had not been in a while. the minute you walk in it is like being in someone cozy space, everyone is so nice a friendly... it was hella hot so i wanted to try to eat lite an you can do that here, plenty of yummy salads and sushi , the menu is amazing!! And they have tons of cocktails to choose from..Everyone that walks out of here will have a smile on there face.Great date taking place i am sure!! we had the best waiter ever also...
