We stayed at the W for my sisters bachelorette party and made reservations at Bliss Spa to pamper the bride to be with a spa day. Shelby Larson was amazing and extremely helpful. She scheduled our treatments perfectly and although there was a big group of us we didnt feel like we were waiting around for our treatment. Shelby also gave us a private room to relax and munch on delish treats (brownies, cheese/crackers, cupcakes) and sip on mimosas. Shelby was extremely pleasant to work with and was really good about staying in touch via email, she even made a goody bag for the bride to be and maid of honor!! I highly recommend this spa, the treatments were beyond amazing and the staff were super friendly. Def. will go back to Bliss if I'm ever in the area.
