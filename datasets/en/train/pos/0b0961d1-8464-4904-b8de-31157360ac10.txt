UPDATE: We have been to Litchfield's several times now. Since changing over from Red's we had some not-so-great dinners but now they've worked out the kinks. We had a great dinner here on the weekend. Prices are moderate for this quality of food and atmosphere, and the free valet parking is convenient! I had halibut and my bride the wood fire roasted chicken. Both were fine examples of how to do it right! Local ingredients are used wherever possible. It gets five stars because it has hit its target - a really good, moderately priced and casual Arizona restaurant. This is what Scottsdale used to be, and what Litchfield Park is now. It is a fine addition to the neighborhood! The only negative: we do miss the raspberry cheesecake tower the Red's used to offer for dessert.
