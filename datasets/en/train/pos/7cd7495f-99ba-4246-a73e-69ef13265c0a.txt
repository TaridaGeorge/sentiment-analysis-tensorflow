First time here and very impressed. Arrived to pick up my order to go and the place was packed, always a great sign. Wait staff very friendly and kitchen looks very clean. Brought the order back to work where everyone gave their food two thumbs up. Plus our complicated order was packed to perfection.  We were very satisfied and will be getting take out again!
