I've been using Starbarks for almost a year now. I love that my two dogs are taken care of by people who really care about and understand dogs. Mike, Janet, and Faith have been especially understanding about our difficult dog and have never had any problems. Pricing is great, especially for two dogs. 

I'm so thankful to have Starbarks - I can leave town comfortable knowing that my dogs are being taken care of by great people.
