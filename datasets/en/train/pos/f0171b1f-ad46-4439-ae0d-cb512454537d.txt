When i went I was taken to a place that was much cooler then Phoenix. The vibe was awesome. I didn't especially like the pretentious lack of light beer, I'm not much a "craft" beer drinker, but my husband was super happy. This place defiantly had a soul and I loved the bluegrass style music they had the night we went. Hard to find, but worth the effort.
