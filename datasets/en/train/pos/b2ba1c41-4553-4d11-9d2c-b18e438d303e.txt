I visited this place based on the other reviews and I have to say it was so GOOD! I got the special, roasted turkey sandwich, and it was so fresh and delicious. The atmosphere isn't anything to rave about but if you are looking for a cute mom and pops place with fresh, home cooked food, this is the place. The only negative would be that it did take about 10 min to get the food but it was worth the wait.
