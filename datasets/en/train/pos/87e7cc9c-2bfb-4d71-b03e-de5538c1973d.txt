Paul's Ace Hardware truly turns my to do list into a to done list. Very helpful, easy to find what you need and with my big paint order even delivered. They are currently helping me with new Z-Wave locks by Kwikset. Great customer service. Can't find what you were looking for, just ask one of their knowledgeable staff. Pricing is reasonable.
