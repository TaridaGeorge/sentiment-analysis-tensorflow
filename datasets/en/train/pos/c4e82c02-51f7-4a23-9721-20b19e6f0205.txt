After having a poor taste in my mouth from a visit to another Halloween costume store (on I-17 and Happy Valley) I made a visit to the Spirit Halloween Superstore, but the one I went to was at Arrowhead Mall.  All of the "Spirit" stores are connected and owned by the same company, and they are all over the valley. 

The staff was very helpful, and we were able to purchase all 6 costumes we came in for in one place.  There were six different sizes, for six different kids, and they had them all.

Thank you Spirit Halloween Superstore for actually knowing what customer service is, and how to treat the people who want to give you money in exchange for some really cool costumes.

We will be back next year.
