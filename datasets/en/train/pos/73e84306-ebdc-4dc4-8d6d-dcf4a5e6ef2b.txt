LOVE!!! This place is awesome. It's great itialian at a decent price in a casual atmosphere. I've never had a bad meal but the Linguini in white clam sauce may very well be my favorite along side the lasagna. They have an excellent house salad as well. I've heard the pizza is good but we've never tried it. Yum... I love this place! I'm so glad we live so close =)
