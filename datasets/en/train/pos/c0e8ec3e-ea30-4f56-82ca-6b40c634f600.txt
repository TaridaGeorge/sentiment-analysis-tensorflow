I don't get to go very often but their Happy hours are well worth it. The food is bursting with flavor and always great with presentation. You can't go wrong..Its not pretentious but I suggest you up your game a bit in clothing department...after all it's not Giligins. Great for a girls night out or a HH with coworkers.
