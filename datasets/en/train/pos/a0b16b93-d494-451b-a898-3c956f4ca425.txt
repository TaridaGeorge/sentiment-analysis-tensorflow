This is definitely one of Phoenix's dirty little secrets!  An amazing pizza place in the middle of town.  

There are other "big" names in the area, but in my opinion the biggest name of them all is Pino's.  This place is absolutely amazing.  Some friends of ours introduced us a few months ago and we have become quick fans of this great restaurant.  

You may ask, 'Bryan, what should I have?' and I say... EVERYTHING.  Especially if it has a crust.  OH MY the crust!!!!  Pasta pizza?  Don't knock it until you have tried it!

On top of the amazing food, the Pino's crew are fantastic.  They are real service oriented people who are passionate about the quality of their food.  

When you are downtown and you are hungry for something amazing, check out Pino's, you will not be disappointed.
