The Pho is delicious.  The owner [Sonay] is hilarious. All the staff are really sweet.  And, they just did a bit of redecorating.

This is a good place to take a date.  Just don't go there too regularly with the same person as Sonay might end up liking your Ex more than you and then once you've moved on and started seeing other people Sonay will give you flak for it and only let up once he feels comfortable enough interrogating your newest romantic interest and is sufficiently impressed with that person's responses.  I'm just speaking from experience... and it's all in good fun.
