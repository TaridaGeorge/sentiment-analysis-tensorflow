My friend Sang raved about this place, so we went there tonight. This was my first time here so  I ordered the combo burger with cheese and everything on it after Sam recommened it. She was dead on, the burger was mouth watering and the fries were perfect with the fries sauce. I was left feeling full and happy. 

I think Sam made my burger expereince the best as I was a newbie to the place and she helped me pick out the right burger, the owner should give this girl a raise, shes awsome!!!

I will be coming back for more burgers : )
