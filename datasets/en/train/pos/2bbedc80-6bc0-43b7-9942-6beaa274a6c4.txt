I love this place.
every time I come in, this place always crawling with people wanting to try for the first time. so its fun to watch while you eat your yogurt.
I love the pistachio mixed with coconut. but since I went here often, I have tried all of their flavor. 
I don't like their chocolate flavor. the taste kinda weird for me.
