We had a spectacular meal. Don't let the strip mall fool you. It's a place for foodies who love to have an endless wine selection right next door. The food was so fresh and each ingredient shined. The owner Todd is delightful as is his staff. The quinoa salad was amazing as was the grouper and pork tenderloin. This restaurant is a must!!!!
