Cafe Nordstrom is a great place to stop for a coffee or tea when you need a break from the mall rat race.  I picked up a really yummy Pomegranate iced tea there today.  Run, don't walk, to get one of these if you like iced tea. 

It was so refreshing on a gawd awfully hot day.

They also had really yummy cupcakes with about an inch of chocolate frosting on top.  So good..their pastries always are.
