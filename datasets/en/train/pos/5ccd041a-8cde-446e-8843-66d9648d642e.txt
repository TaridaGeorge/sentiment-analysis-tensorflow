What a perfect place to combine Dinner and a Movie in one location!!
There's a BAR right as you walk in after purchasing your tickets. The theater seats are comfortable but probably only fit half as many as an AMC theater since there are moveable table tops that take up more space.

You can order food at the press of a red button and a server will come and take your order. Word of advice: order early because once the movie starts, it's a little distracting to place an order during the movie.

Food prices are similar to any outside restaurant... burgers or pizza around $10-12. And you can order beer or any cocktail too!! There are some weekday specials like all you can pizza on Wednesday. 


Bathrooms are super modern & clean as well! 

Will be back.
