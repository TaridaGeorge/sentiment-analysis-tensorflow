I was set on a quest to find a Yoga studio near by my place, I did research on many studios in the area and decided on Metta Yoga in Arcadia. I must say I picked the BEST one. I have SO enjoyed the four classes I have attended. I decided to be a member so that I have the luxury of going to as many classes (they have a lot of classes they offer) as I would like (great deal, great pricing). The atmosphere is settling and welcoming, I know that it can be awkward to join a gym/studio/club on your own but with the co-owners being very outgoing/social and all Yogis & Yoginis's understanding of my beginner level made the experience enjoyable and wanting to return for another class. Whatever level you are try it out, you will love it!
