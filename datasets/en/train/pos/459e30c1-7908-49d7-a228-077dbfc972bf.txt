Myself, my wife and our dog love this place. Fun to get out and see people and their pets having fun. What's interesting is people watching to see how much the pets match their people :)

It'd be great if more people there would participate in picking up what their animals leave, but sometimes laziness does over take them and we end up doing it.

Our dog loves to run and play with the others and from time to time she airs her issues, but other than that it's a wonderful place to get out and enjoy the grass and be around people. Great place, highly recommended. Please police your animal droppings!
