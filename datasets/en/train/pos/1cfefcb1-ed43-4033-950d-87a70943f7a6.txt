Just had the BBQ on the terrace offered on Sundays during the summer.  It comes with an appetizer,salad, soup, shellfish buffet, an entree  with sides and dessert.  The food quality was fantastic (Kobe sliders, duck burgers, Olympia oysters, king crabs).  There are drink specials for $8. The cost is $49 which is expensive but I thought it was worth every penny.   The restaurant is beautiful and check out the bar.  Quite a change from the Marquessa.  We'll be back to try the regular menu soon.
