We ended up in JCL's ER on Christmas Eve night, 2000 miles away from home. Everyone from the front desk to the doctor couldn't have been kinder. They took wonderful care of my wife, apologized for the chilly weather - we kept assuring them that it was 25 degrees colder in Detroit - and made sure that we were out of the hospital before midnight.

I'm sure the employees couldn't have been all that excited about working on Christmas Eve, but they were all incredibly kind. We only wish we could have thanked everyone personally.
