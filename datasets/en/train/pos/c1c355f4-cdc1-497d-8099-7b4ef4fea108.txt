I've gone to Freddy's here in Arizona and in Texas and note that the food is the same in both states. The frozen custard is great for my wife who is lactose intolerant. The thin steak burgers are fantastic and rival Steak'N'Shake and Culvers fast food joints. This Goodyear location has always been consistent and tastes great. Love the fries and seasoning salt. Note: this is one of the few places to offer Code Red Mountain Dew at all of its locations.
