NICE. Just all around nice. Helpful, pleasant, friendly, and efficient. That's what this store is. And about their products...what's not to love? Yeah, so a belt will set you back a few hundred bucks, a bag or a pen even more. My friend made certain that I left with a big girl wallet so I can now be a real professional, or something like that. Well, whatever about the wallet but I LOVE everything else in this beautiful store. Great products and service? Exactly what you want when you're dropping extra on something special. The staff assured me the wallet will "last forever," which was exactly what I needed to hear. 

We knew what we wanted, they got it out, got it ready to go, explained the warranty, etc., and all with a smile. 

I will be back.
