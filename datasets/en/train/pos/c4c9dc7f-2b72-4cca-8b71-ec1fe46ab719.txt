One of my favorite places to go with the kids for lunch.  Bring a small amount of $ - grab yourself a table under the trees and enjoy the afternoon away while your kids play within eyesight.  The entire "patio" is really a large, fenced grassy, tree filled area with 2 volleyball courts, multiple gathering areas, ping pong, horse shoes, jumbo checkers and even another fenced in area full of sand and toys for the kids.
