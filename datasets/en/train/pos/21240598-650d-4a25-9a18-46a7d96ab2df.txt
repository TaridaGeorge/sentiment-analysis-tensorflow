Two words:  Boba Supplies.

I agree with pretty much everything in the other reviews, so I'll keep it short.  I got a trunk load of stuff for cheeeep!

Sometimes I want and crave a Boba drink, but don't have anywhere by me that sells them...and don't necessarily want to spend money on it.  Kind of the Starbucks mentality.  I got Boba, drink mixes, and straws all at Lee Lee's.  For the cost of one drink, I can make 10!

I'm seriously thinking about having a Boba party.  

BOBALICIOUS!
