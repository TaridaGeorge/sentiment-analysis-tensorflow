We have gone to Joes Diner many times for breakfast and lunch. This morning as usual the place was very busy and we had a short wait.  Regardless of how busy the food is always  great and the service very friendly and fast. Sunday morning they have an Eggs Benedict special that was great and reasonable price not to mention their fried potatoes. I have tried to figure out what they put in those potatoes to give them the flavor but still can't figure it out. Joe is always their making sure the guests are happy and satisfied. Joes Diner is the Best for Phoenix Breakfast or Lunch.
