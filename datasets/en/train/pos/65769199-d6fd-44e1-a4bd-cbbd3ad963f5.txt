When this food touches your tonge you will be in heaven food taste so great you won't be able to name another Italian restaurant, portions are big enough to share or to take home and belive me this is food you won't let go bad in the fridge it even taste great reheated oh servers are always full of energy and very nice, this is a chain restaurant but everyone is consistent and it taste the same from one restaurant to the next iv been in 4 different ones across Arizona they were all the same
