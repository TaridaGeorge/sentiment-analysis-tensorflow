Pretty sure we met the whole family last time we were in. Never been to Italy but when I do, I expect the food will equate. The food is fantastic but a bit steep for pasta and tomato sauce. 

Notables: 
Cash Only
Great place if you don't mind an arrogant waiter every once in a while
They don't serve alcohol but I hear they charge $0 to uncork.
