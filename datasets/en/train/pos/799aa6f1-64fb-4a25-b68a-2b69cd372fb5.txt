Italian Grocery items and dinner too! 

I can't say enuf good things about Niccoli's. Lets see....... they stock La Valle San Marzano Tomatoes and Tomatoe paste ( The only products I use for sauce) , Il Primo Hot giardiniera ( makes any sandwich yummy) and Panettone at Christmas. Fresh rolls and pastries!!! 

Their pizzas are great and if you want a GREAT sandwich, try Niccoli's homemade Italian sub...mmm mmm... best sub in the city...no question its homemade!

Niccoli's is like a little Italy right on 16th street! Check 'em out!
