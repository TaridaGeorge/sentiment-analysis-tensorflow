Outside of Little Italy in New York City, this is the most authentic Italian pasta place that you will find. It really is a Mom and Pop restaurant. One or more of the 3 generations of family members is always there. The meatballs are huge, dense, and flavorful but the Baked Ziti always has me coming back for more. The garlic knots with a side of their yummy, garlic infused Marinara sauce alone is worth the trip. Portions are huge, so we always have leftovers the next day!
