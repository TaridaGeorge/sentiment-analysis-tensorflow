Do you want to spend some time in Italy but cannot take the time to travel abroad?  Try eating at Tutti Santi's ristorante located at the Citadelle Plaza in Glendale.  A true Italian family-run business with the best pizza made fresh from the pizza oven.  The service is wonderful, the atmoshere is inviting and don't miss the desserts!

I want to go here every week for the rest of my life.
