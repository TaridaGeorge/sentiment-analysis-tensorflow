For fresh American faire with a French twist this homey little cottage with hardwood floors will tickle your fancy!  The owner is also the head Chef and the menu changes regularly.  Fresh salads featuring a little fruit and nuts is my favorite aperitif.  Seafood is usually featured, along with chicken, light cream sauces and nicely sized portions that a girl can actually finish.  This is a great place for a romantic dinner, or girls night out before the theatre, or intimate dinner with another couple.  I believe they now have a liquour license that allows for wine service and maybe more?!  A back room is available for larger groups, call ahead to reserve it.  Reservations recommended, in general.  Only open for dinner.  Moderate to upscale prices.
