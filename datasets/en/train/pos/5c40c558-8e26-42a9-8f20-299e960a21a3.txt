This was my first Grimaldi experience and I was blown away.  Huge portions - HUGE.  I had the house salad and it was fresh and tasty.  I did a personal pepperoni and kalamata olive with pizza with red sauce and couldn't finish it, it was so big - more than enough for one person - the tomatoes were extremely flavorful and the pepperoni and olives were delicious.  We'll be back!
