Yes this place is expensive but that's why it's a nice elegant fancy place to eat!  They give you endless  fruit or bread for your cheese fondu. The service was awesome! I didn't like the main dish I ordered because it wasn't what I was expecting, and he gladly took it back and gave me what my boyfriend ordered. Not to mention it came out so fast!

This place is intimate, great for date night with the boy! Or date night with a girl! 

If you sign up on their website, they give you free chocolate fondu for two next time you go there. You have to order cheese fondu an 2 meals but that's still awesome!
