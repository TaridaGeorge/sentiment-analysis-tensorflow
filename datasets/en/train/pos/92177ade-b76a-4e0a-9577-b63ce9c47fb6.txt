This is a great place to hike in the valley! There are so many different trails here that very in length and challenge. Yesterday, a friend of mine and I took advantage of the beautiful weather and went up an unmarked area of the mountain. It was pretty much straight up, and my legs still are hurting, but it was totaly worth it.  I honestly don't know where exactly we were, but when we reached summit there was an awesome rock formation at the top, and an excellent view of nearly the entire valley!
