I just got off the river and it was awesome. I am from TX and have tubed in New Braunfels and San Marcos and they don't come close to the Salt River. The water is prefect. The rapids are fun and make the float a different experience than just sitting in a tube. The surroundings are beautiful and serene. I can't wait to float again. I wrote this originally on July 11, we just got off the river again today. And we're going again tomorrow!
