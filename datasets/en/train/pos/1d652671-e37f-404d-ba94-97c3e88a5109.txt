I am a regular at this place and there are few places I can say that about. The food is excellent, authentic, and inexpensive. The waiters and waitresses may put you off at first by their casual appearance but it sets the comfortable atmosphere of this place. Inside is a little cramped but step out to the patio and you you can eat at the shore of a beautiful lake. The ducks are fun at first but as a regular, they can get annoying. Fortunately Pita Jungle has taken measures to stop them from visiting your meal. There Hummus is incredible and I also recommend their beef gyro and pesto pizza.
