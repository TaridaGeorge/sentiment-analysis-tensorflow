For us, Phoenix Wine has better values than Costco, BevMo or Total Wine. Each of their wines are carefully selected based on believe it or not, their clientele! They listen to what their customers are saying and what they like. Tom and Andrea (I think her name is) will guide you to the perfect wine. Whether you're into boutique Napa Valley Cabs or a value Pinot, you'll find it here.
