Sunday brunch is amazing and great pricing!! I love that they have a station that they make omelets right in front of you! Also I love having dinner outside, next too the waterfalls! SO beautiful and the food is great! :) They have fresh Mexican buffet on Tuesday nights and Italian buffet on Friday nights as well!!! Then sit down dinner the rest of the nights. Kristen is an awesome bar tender!! She is so much fun and makes great drinks!!! Don't miss out! :)
