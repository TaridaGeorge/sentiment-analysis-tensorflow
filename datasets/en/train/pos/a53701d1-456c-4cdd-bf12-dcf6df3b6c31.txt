Mention any sort of Kung Pao, and this vegetarian begins to shake and quiver. I tried the Green version with the crispy tofu, and found it delectable. Spicy yet not overpowering and the tofu lived up to its description. 

The wife got a jerk salad that was also very tasty. The servings are quite good for the price and the atmosphere is excellent. Good for people watching. Green reminds me more of a restaurant from Seattle or Portland, which is a nice touch in this never-ending drive of TGI McFunsters.
