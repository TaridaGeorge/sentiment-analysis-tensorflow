Attempting to get parts for my Giant brand bike was difficult, but only because I did not directly contact Bike Emporium.  After getting no response or help from many shops around the valley, I kept trying a larger and larger pool of stores.   Luckily for me, Glenn from Bike Emporium in Scottsdale was there to save the day!

Bike Emporium helped me get the exact parts I needed and had them in stock, ready to go.  I really appreciate the fact they worked with me over email to make sure I was able to get the exact items needed.  Five stars, a major thank you, and add one more happy customer!  I will be back, even though it is quite a drive from the West Valley.  WORTH EVERY MILE!
