Panda what?! It's all about Yogis Grill from now on when we need a quick sushi or teriyaki fix! This location is right next to another great place (Lucky Lou's) and the service was quick and friendly. I find places like Panda Express and Pei Wei too crowded and not that Yogis is dead but it's quieter so we can take our time. They do have lunch specials and you can definitely call in orders (four people just did that while we were there). I'm looking forward to going back and trying one of their tempura dishes!
