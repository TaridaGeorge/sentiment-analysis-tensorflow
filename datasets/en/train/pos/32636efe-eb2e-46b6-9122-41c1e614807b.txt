I could kick myself for not trying this place sooner. It's by far one of the best restaurants in town. 

The pork chop cooked in the wood-fired oven with spice braised cabbage and caramel apple is one of the best dishes I have had in Phoenix in a long time. I was officially over flatbreads until I tried the oven-baked roasted chicken flatbread with caramelized onion and fennel here. 

Service was off the charts, too. I ate there last night, had the leftovers for lunch (even better the next day; I was amazed) and I'm dying to go back. That hardly ever happens to me.
