I love Big 5.  I check their ads every Sunday Morning online.  When they have something on sale you can find really good prices.  I went in to buy a shotgun awhile back and the sales person talked me out  of it based on my needs and skill level.  I ended up picking up another one on black friday for a really good price.  This one is more spacious then the one on 19th ave, and has a nice parking lot.  I bought some cool survival stuff from here for cheap, some hiking boots and when my wife wanted some hiking boots and she was about to go to an expensive store I told her to go to big 5 and she got some for $20.  Can't hate on that.
