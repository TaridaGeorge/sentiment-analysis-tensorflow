Delightful. As good as cupcakes can get! I was given these cupcakes as a gift, and it prompted me to stop in. I tried the peanut butter cupcake, think Reeses Pieces....Double chocolate (my son devoured), and chocolate with a cream cheese topping....All were fresh and wonderful. The place and packaging is super cute too....Looks like they have a repeat customer :)
