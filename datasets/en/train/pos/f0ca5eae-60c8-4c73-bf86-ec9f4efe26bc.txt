This place was pretty good to me. I'll just sum the stars up:

(+1) - great tasting pizza
(+1) - friendly service
(+1) - two slices and a drink for $5.06
(+1) - I pay with a $10 bill, get a $5 bill back, don't need no stinkin' change
(+1) - My slices came from a freshly-made pizza, as opposed to the standard reheated shingle (I don't know if that's standard here, but I saw mine get sliced up fresh from the oven)

(-1) - The to-go packaging consisted of my pizza slices on a large (but not large enough) plate, covered with foil & no bag, which doesn't  fucking cut it for someone who likes his car like I do


Update: After a few more visits, I'm gonna give them a 5th star. It's really good stuff.
