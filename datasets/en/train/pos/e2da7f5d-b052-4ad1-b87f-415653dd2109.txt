I took privates from Melissa for a few months while her cute studio was being built and also had the opportunity to do group classes once opened.  I am a self-proclaimed anti-exerciser-- I absolutely hate it-- but I found pilates on the reformer to actually be enjoyable because it's a combo of body + mind.  Melissa's personality is sheer awesomeness, which was a huge part of why I loved her classes.  I also strongly dislike big gyms where everyone is there to be seen in their cute little outfits, and Melissa made sure her studio is the antithesis of that.  I had to take a little hiatus from classes but plan to get my post-Holiday flab back to see her soon!
