What can I say about LGO that hasn't already been said?  It's fantastic, it's consistent, and it's convenient (I live down the street, I'm sure some would disagree with me, though).  I rarely battle the masses and typically opt for curbside takeout, which really is the best thing since sliced bread.  For breakfast, get anything with an English muffin or bacon.  For lunch, their bread is excellent and every sandwich I've had has been good enough to order again.  Oh, and don't forget to stop by the dessert case.  You really can't go wrong with anything in there, but to be safe, you can order a piece of red velvet cake and thank me later. 

Don't listen to people who tell you this place is overrated--some people like to pick on things that are popular.  Other people just like good food.
