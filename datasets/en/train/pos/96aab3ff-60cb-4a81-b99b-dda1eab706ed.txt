By far my favorite Fro-Yo place. I love that they have more selection, especially my fave, pistachio, YUM.  Will drive 40 miles round trip for it. They are really friendly and generous with their samples, they actually hand you the sample cups. The place is very clean, the toppings bar is always well stocked and the heath bar pieces are the right size (I like them really small), so I can sprinkle it over yogurt.  Then top it all with ooey gooey caramel, HEAVEN! On top of all the goodness they are about 12 cents cheaper per ounce.  Can't beat that.  I am always finding an excuse to drive down and make a pit stop.
