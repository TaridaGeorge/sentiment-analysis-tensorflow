I have loved LuLu lemon even before it showcased in the US.  I first discovered LuLu Lemon on a trip to Canada many years ago.  I was so excited when their store opened at Biltmore!  I have been there many times & have been so pleased with the level of customer service and large selection of products!  I have never seen their clothes on sale & I was shocked to see so mammy items marked down!! I'll be back very soon! Great job!
