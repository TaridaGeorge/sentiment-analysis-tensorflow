I love this place! All the doors were open and the breeze flowing through the restaurant was perfect! I sat at the bar and the bartender recommended the perfect dinner for me. It started with artichokes & portabella mushroom bruschetta  . It was deli-sh and only $5. Dinner was seared sea scallops with mushroom risotto and arugula topped it off. Outstanding!
