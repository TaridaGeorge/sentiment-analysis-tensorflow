I wasn't sure what to expect when walking in, I didn't check reviews first because I always give bagel places a chance. I'm from Ohio and miss the great Jewish NY-style deli's I had all around me, because there is a serious lack of them in Arizona. However, Bagel Man has the best bagels in the valley. They have great varieties and are incredibly delicious and last for longer than most you would get at Chompie's or some other fake deli. The owner was awesome, he introduced himself and was doing everything well. They serve Boar's Head meat which is the best if you ask me and they have some variety for being a small place. I recommend this place to all for a nice little lunch or bringing bagels home or to the office.
