You don't need to break the bank to fly to the Middle East when Haji Baba is right around the corner. Unequivocally this is the best restaurant and everything on the menu is superb.  The overwhelming spicy aroma encompasses you and you really do feel like you have found yourself in a 'whole new world' (as Aladdin would say).  It almost leads to you believe that you just might have a magic carpet out front waiting to fly you home.
 
Something about Haji Baba stirs up thoughts of romance... maybe its the lamb tongue sandwhich or the hummus platter.  Either way, be careful who you choose to dine with... you might just end up finding true love. 
 
Don't forget to browse the attached Middle Eastern grocery store for all your sardine and pickled onion desires.
