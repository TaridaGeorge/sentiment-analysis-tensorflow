My husband and I have been going to this place for years. They recently opened up the new building and it is beautiful! I'm not a fan of Kool-aid but it's a must have here, the blue "flavor" is EVERYTHANG!! I usually get the soul food platter, comes with chicken, 2 sides (mine are mac & cheese and greans) and a big azz stupid sized piece of cornbread. If you have high blood pressure or clogged arteries I wouldn't recommend this place to you. You'll definitely be eating good in the hood here but if you come at night carry a blade in your purse. ;-)
