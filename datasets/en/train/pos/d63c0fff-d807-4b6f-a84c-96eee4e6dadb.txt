They always have the books I need, and I can always check online if they have it. If you ask them in the store for a book and they don't have it, they will order it for you and have it ship to your home for free. Always helpful staff. Friendly environment. They top B&N if only for their weekly 33% off coupons (and sometimes 40% off)!
