Hmmm, let's see... when was the last time I went to the same place for breakfast 3 days in a row before Yoli's?  NEVER!!!  

Fantastic food, great service, great prices, cool outdoor seating.  

You MUST try the french toast, and biscuit/gravy.  yeah, I usually don't get those together either, but then I'd never been to Yoli's...
