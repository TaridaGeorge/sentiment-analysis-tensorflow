So happy/elated/amazed that Rudy's has finally arrived in AZ. 

The Brisket!  

Rudy's is why I bought a professional smoker to try to get my brisket fix.  Rudy's is where I go whenever I travel to Texas. Rudy's is what all other bbq places try to achieve when it comes to brisket.

Yes, you should always, always, always get the brisket...ahhh-mazing!

Went here on day two and everything was perfect...I got there right when it opened and was still about the 50th person thru the line. Felt kinda bad for the 100+ people in line when I left...at least it isn't 115 outside yet for those last 40 or so that were in the line wrapped around outside.

AZ is going to love Rudy's...wish I had the money to open my own.
