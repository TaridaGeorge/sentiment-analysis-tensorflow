We like the extensive menu.  Most of the items are pretty good.  Some of the items we have tried are truly great.  My personal fav is the Spicy Tie Chicken Pasta (or something like that).  The first time I ordered it I thought it was absolutely perfect:  Nice and spicy, pasta done al dente, some crunchy corn strips for texture...sauce is addictive.  Other times I've ordered it seemed less spicy (but still good).

Also a plus:  service is always courteous, place is always clean.
