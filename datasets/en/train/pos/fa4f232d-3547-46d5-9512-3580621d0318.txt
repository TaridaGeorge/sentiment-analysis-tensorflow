By far, the freshest fish to be found anywhere  - Toyama is a gem - and Chef Owner Mo is very accomodating, and has a great sense of humor. His hand rolls and specials are some of the best in town.

For a true live experience, I do recommend sitting at the bar as the sushi chefs are quite talkative and very knowledgeable about their trade.

Recommended specials: Toyama roll, orange cup tuna, seasoned squid salad.

Service: best at the bar - dining room staff is attentie, yet inconsistent and more often than not - just plain aloof! If you want to sit in fron of Mo at the bar, just make sure you arrive there plenty early.
