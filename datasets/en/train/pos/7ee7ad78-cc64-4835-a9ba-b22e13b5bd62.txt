Again...every single Gelato Spot is amazing!  Clean, friendly and inviting and the cases are just beautiful with fresh gelato in any flavor you can imagine.  My favorite is still the Cookies & Cream...I think I seriously dream about this stuff!  If you haven't tried a Gelato Spot yet, get yourself to one quickly...you will not be disappointed!
