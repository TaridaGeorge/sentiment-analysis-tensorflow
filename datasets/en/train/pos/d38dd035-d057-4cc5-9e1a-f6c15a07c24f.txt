I love this place.  Rarely would I ever consider becoming a "regular" at an establishment, but this place is so incredible, so fun, so hilarious, that I may at some point in my life become a regular at Char's. I've gone several times with a fellow yelper and every time I've had a blast.
Every time I've gone there's been live music with dancing on the dance floor. The singer typically wears a suit you'd only see on cop movies from the 70's, gold colored, frills, with the personality to match. The band pretty much plays on the dance floor so you can basically be right there with the band. 
All in all one of my favorite places to go in Phoenix
