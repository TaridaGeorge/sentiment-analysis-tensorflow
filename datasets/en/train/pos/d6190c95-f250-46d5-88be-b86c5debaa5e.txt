I'm never disappointed by the Vig.  I have no complaints.  It's a great place to grab dinner or late night drinks.  I like the hot chick sandwich.  They've got a decent drink selection.  I ordered the hoegaarden belgian white beer.  The atmosphere is very modern, the bathrooms are nice, and they do complimentary valet parking.  They serve food until 1, so you'll never have to go hungry while you drink.  I've been to the other location and am a big fan there too.
