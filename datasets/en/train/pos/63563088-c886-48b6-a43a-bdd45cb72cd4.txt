luv luv luv their bean and cheese! I am explaining it to everyone I know that it is the crack they put in the beans. I know that it is not trully crack in them but I have to let you know that this is what I think it must feel like to be "addicted". Oh, and have we talked about their torta yet? Lord.. peppers, avocado and beef OH MY. I could die happy. Or atleast think I am "HAPPY" because I swear there is crack in the beans. HELP
