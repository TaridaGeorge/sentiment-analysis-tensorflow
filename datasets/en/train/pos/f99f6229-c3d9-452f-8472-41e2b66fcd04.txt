LOVE this coffee house. 

Excellent service from down-to-earth and honest-to-goodness staff, a drive through service for those mornings on the go, appropriate pricing, fresh baked goods, and delicious coffee (according to my coffee guzzling fiance). 

My only complaint - and it is a small one - is their chai. Sigh....some love it, so it may be just your cup of tea (teeheehee), but I like my chai with a bit more spice. But, as I write that I just realized if I were to ask the staff, they could probably just add in a little extra spice. Because, yes, they are that nice.
