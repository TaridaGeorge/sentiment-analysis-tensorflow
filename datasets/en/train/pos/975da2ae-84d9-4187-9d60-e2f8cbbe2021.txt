Amazing little family owned place! The woman who helped us order (I think she is the owner) was extremely sweet and helpful....and VERY proud of the food, and rightly so.  The  Bosnian sausage sandwich was just fabulous.  We also shared the spinach pita that can only be described as fluffy goodness.  Then we finished off the meal with homemade baklava and Turkish coffee.  Wonderful comfort food.  Also, they have some imported cookies and chocolates for sale. Just lovely.
