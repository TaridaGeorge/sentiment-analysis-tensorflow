We learned about this bakery on the Food Channel. We decided to not only give it a try, but do a head-to-head taste test with another local cupcake bakery that had been featured on the Food Chanel. Sprinkles Cupcakes won hands-down. They were superior on customer service, presentation, appearance, texture, flavor and variety.  My personal favorite out of the eight Sprinkles Cupcakes we tried?? Vanilla... Truly amazing.
