So.......I love Defalco's. My bf and I are addicted to the Il Purista, which is JUST PERFECTION, with and without the prosciutto. I've had someone describe their service to me as "New York style" and I agree with that assessment, so if you cant hang with it, then go be a baby somewhere else. The food is fresh, delicious, and incredible. Their lattes are bomb, and the cannolis pretty great too. I dont have a single bad thing to say about these folks or their amazing food.
