Stopped by after Randy from Pittsburg Willys Hot Dogs gave us his thumbs up. Imagine that, he absolutely knows what he is talking about when it come to Thai food. Our martini selection was perfect and chilled just right.  Outrageous yummy Mahi, The braised beef was cooked to perfection. All the flavors, my wife was in heaven  
Salt and pepper squid with the sauces are a great starter.
