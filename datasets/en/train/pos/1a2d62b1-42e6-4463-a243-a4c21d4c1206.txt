Great place...planning to go back to buy tea tins and some more of the Caramel Apple that I got as a free gift for purchasing over $20 worth of stuff the first time I went.  I love the Afternoon Delight, and I like to mix their Razzleberry with some of my other teas to slightly change the flavor (although it is perfectly fine on its own, too!).

I had great customer service the first time I went there...the woman behind the counter suggested teas based on what I said I liked.  I didn't feel rushed, and it was a pleasant experience.
