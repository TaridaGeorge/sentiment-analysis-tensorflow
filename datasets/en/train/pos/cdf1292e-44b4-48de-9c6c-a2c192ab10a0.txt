GORGEOUS STREET!!!!!  So much to walk down or bike ride and day dream.

We used to live near here and you could tell when the Suns players were home and when they weren't.  All the Escalades were there when they were in town, and it was dead when they weren't.  Two of the Suns players live across the street from each other.  We even ran into Shawn Marion in the gas station.
