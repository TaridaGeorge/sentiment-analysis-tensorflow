I was sick of fast food and I needed to eat something different for lunch today . A coworker mentioned Lemongrass and I had one of the best meals of my life. I ordered the pad thai and every bite was amazing. I didn't know that pad thai could taste that good. This is going to be my new lunch spot I can't wait to try everything off the menu! If you are in the area give Lemongrass Thai Cuisine a try.
