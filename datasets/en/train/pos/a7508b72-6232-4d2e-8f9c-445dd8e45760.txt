Roy's is a perennial favorite on my hit parade.  When restaurant week occasioned itself upon us, I saw Roy's on the list and said let's go!

There are two things that make for a great restaurant:  1.)  product (the food), 2.) process (the experience).

From the moment we walked in the place, every single member of the Roy's team went out of their way to make us feel like royalty.  Secondly, the moment we sat down, a very deliberate system came into play that leaves you feeling very well cared for.

This is what the experience should be like!  The setting was beautiful, and the food was out of this world.

And....of course...the chocolate souffle.  If it were possible for one's mouth to experience an orgasm, Roy's chocolate souffle would be the ticket.

Great job Roy's!
