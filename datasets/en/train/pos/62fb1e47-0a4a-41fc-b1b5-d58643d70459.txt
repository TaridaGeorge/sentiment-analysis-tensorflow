I've been going here for about a year now.  I travel so I'm usually in another state and very rarely get a worthy haircut outside of this place.  I usually come back, head in hands and ask politely if they'll PLEASE fix my bird's nest.  Stan always obliges and does a great job.

Great atmosphere, tv's, drinks and a great haircut at a great price.  What more can I say.  Try them out.  You won't be disappointed.
