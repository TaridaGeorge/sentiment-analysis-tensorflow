Dallas was a beyond helpful associate at the store. After searching the malls I finally convinced my bf to check out this store. Great, individualized service! It was especially refreshing after dealing with the not so friendly or helpful department store associates.
My bf was in a little bit of a bind, needing nice slacks for an upcoming interview. Luckily the Men's Wearhouse has finished bottoms in many sizes and the bf walked out with a couple of pairs of pants, socks, and a belt. 
Of course, they pushed dress shirts and ties and shoes but with a simple, "no thanks" we moved on. Dallas made the shopping experience easy and quick. Give that man a raise!!!
