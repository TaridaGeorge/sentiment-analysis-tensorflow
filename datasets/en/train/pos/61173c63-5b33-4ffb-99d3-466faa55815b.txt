I've gone to N'Joy quite a few times recently. I love their pedicures, eye brow waxing, and they have a great kids' pedi that includes art. For the 4th of July my girls' got red and blue toes with white stars. For back to school they got their school colors, red and black, with white flowers. They are also really sweet with my two year old that I keep next to me in her stroller.
