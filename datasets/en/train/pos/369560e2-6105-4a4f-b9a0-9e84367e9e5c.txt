I can't believe that I forgot about this hole in the wall that was my weekly lunch getaway when I worked down the street.  Since March, they've expanded their space which is awesome.  Now I feel comfy sitting down to enjoy my sammie without someone breathing on me.  

They are vegetarian friendly, I love the griefo that has their hemp cream cheese and then I have them add hummus.  Put some guacamole on that sucker and I've eaten the perfect veggie sandwich.  I'm definitely going to make it back here when I'm slumming it in Tempe next.
