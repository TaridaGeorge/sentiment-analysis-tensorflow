I come here too often to write a unbiased review :)  It is good food, great service (80 percent of the time) and just a great place to bring friends, family, and out of town folks to.  I believe they would prefer the originality and creativity of the creations found here over a bunch of other chain breakfast places.  Especially their omelette creations, which can go anywhere from a classic denver omelette to the new princess.

Also check out their lunch sandwiches and burgers.  I had their chicken tortilla soup, and it was good.  I hear good things about their burgers too :)

if you got a sweet tooth, check out their bread pudding for dessert.  its moist and warm, and just so very tasty.

Read the other great reviews for more details, i need to focus on my food now.
