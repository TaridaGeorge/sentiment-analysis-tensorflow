Mido has been my go-to sushi spot since they were in Tucson. Yes, I used to drive all the way out to Tucson just for Mido. Delicious sushi at an amazing price.

I always order the All You Can Eat Sushi for $19.99. You really can't beat that price. And, it comes with Soup, Salad, Edamame, & Ice Cream. Yes, even Ice Cream! I understand the temptation to be skeptical when contemplating both "value" and "raw fish" at the same time. But, trust me; Mido is the real deal. Mido has better sushi than a lot of places that aren't all you can eat. It will make you a devout believer in the all you can eat sushi concept. ...Well, I can't vouch for other all you can eat sushi places; but I can vouch for Mido.
