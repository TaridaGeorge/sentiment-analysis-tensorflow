Our network was down at work so I took a stroll over at Lowes, just checking out some things.  Planning...

I think Lowes is nicer-cleaner than Home Depot, and it's always less crowded.  Today everyone was very very friendly.  I was asked at least 5 times if I was doing OK or in need of some assistance.  That's how it's supposed to be at a Home Improvement store!
