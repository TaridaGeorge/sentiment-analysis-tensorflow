Shopping at the Ski Pro in Mesa is always a pleasant experience when it comes to anything I need. Whether it be a snowboard, skateboard or wakeboard, the staff has always been able to answer my questions. It was no different when I came in to shop for a Gopro camera. There were quite a few people giving me information on these cameras since I have asked about them more than once. Because of all of their knowledge and help, I finally ended up buying a Gopro camera! This has been the greatest purchase!

Thanks to Ski Pro for being thorough with info about their product!
