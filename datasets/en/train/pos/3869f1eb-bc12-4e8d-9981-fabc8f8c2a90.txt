I am huge fan of this place!  I have been going there for about 3 years now as they are very close to my office.  I can call in an order, drive over there in 5 minutes and it is ready for me.  It is always the same gentleman helping me as the cashier.  The quality of the food is AWESOME!!  I am pretty snobby about my Asian food :-).  The only thing that I get confused on is do I tip?
