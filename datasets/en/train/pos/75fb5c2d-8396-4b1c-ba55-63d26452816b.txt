One of my favorite spots in old town. This place has a very dynamic atmosphere offering a setting geared to almost everyone. Weather you like to enjoy a live band, or want to shake it in the Shaker Room, or just simply want to hang out and converse on one of the two bustling patios, this place has it all. 

Lines aren't too long to get in and are not long at all for drink purchasing. The staff is friendly and seem to be in tune with meeting the patrons needs. Drink prices were a little lower than average Scottsdale pricing, with the exception of the $9 Patron shots. Those really add up, if you're not careful. ha!
