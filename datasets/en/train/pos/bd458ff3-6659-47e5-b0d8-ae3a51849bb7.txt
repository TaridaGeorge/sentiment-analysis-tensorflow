Come for the awesome menu, stay for the beer selection.   Chef Aaron May created this upscale but affordable menu complete with oddball items like pig ears.  The food is great even though I usually stick with the chicken sandwich.  The bartenders are always smiling and genuinely happy to be at work.  The best part is the beer selection.  You could try a different one every day for a couple months and not have the same thing twice.  I'm a fan of the Asylum which has a 13% alcohol content but doesn't taste like your grandfathers moonshine.   Will definitely be back!
