Oh my GOD. 

I consider myself an Indian food freak, and this is by FAR, in all my travels, the BEST Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan that I have EVER had. PERIOD. The basmati was also cooked perfectly. I am super picky, for sure. Ask my dinner companions. I wouldn't shut up about it, and then they tried it and agreed.

The service was spot on, even though it was late at night. The server even steered a friend away from a dish that they had, but admitted wasn't exactly fresh, and offered a great alternative.

This is going to be my new go-to for Indian food!
