the chicken salad with the peanut sauce is delicious! its perfect every time. service is stupendous. atmosphere is great for dates or lunch. 

menu can be a little boring, but whatever you choose you will probably like. 

my family cannot get enough of the artichoke appetizer.

wine choices are good, too. 

although ive noticed they dont put ice in their waters automatically. who wants a cup of water with no ice?

also, i just had surgery and went in a wheelchair. they were so accommodating!
