Gotta love, Yelp. I recently had a very strong Gyro craving and turned to the help of Yelp and the only thing I'm sad about is that I didn't try Z's Greek sooner. I'm. In. Love. Amazing Gyros, insanely sinful Greek Salads, Greek Fries... drive through or sit-in, you're getting the real deal at Z's. It's a family run business and the service is just as good as the food. You'll be sad when your Gyro is gone. Promise.
