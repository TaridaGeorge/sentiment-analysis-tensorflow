My coolest gal pals and I celebrated my birthday at Frank & Albert's at the Arizona Biltmore Resort.  We went during happy hour to take advantage of their lower pricing.  Unbelievable time all of us had!!  There was enough of us in attendance that we were able to try everything on the HH menu.  The food, the drinks, the service was beyond belief.  It truly lives up to the name and reputation of The Arizona Biltmore.  Of course, we shall go again and again.
