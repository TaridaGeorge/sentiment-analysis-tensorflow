Ceviche, wings, rosat corn pizza... drooooool. 

I have eaten here four or five times and can not find ANYTHING to complain about. Service is constantly spot on, food is always good/consistent, and i LOVE sitting at the bar.  I have to agree with Tee D, when i am home for the holiday i will probably feel myself gravitating towards LGO before i brave the hours of wait and hassle at Bianco. It really honestly is just as good but without all the hullabaloo. 

They did have a white sangria that was... white (no one told us) and kind of gross but who cares, the mouth watering quality of everything else made that a minor footnote in our dinning experience. Also The gladiator and the padre deserve honorable mention behind my roast corn 'za, all incredible pizzas.
