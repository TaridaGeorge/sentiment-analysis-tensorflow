I almost don't want to post this review because I feel like Lustre is my little secret, but I'm a nice gal, so I'll do the Yelp community a favor and share it:

You may not know it yet, but your soul has been searching for an amazing pool-side, rooftop bar with breathtaking views of downtown and the mountains to the South.  You just found it.  What more could you ask for?  An excellent happy hour you say?  Well, check that one off your list too!  I think I might become a fixture at this place.

Come for the free yoga on Wednesdays; stay for the free happiness.
