I would not consider myself a tea expert or snob, but I enjoy my Pu-Erh tea brewed in a pot made from the clays of Yixing China (in Jiangsu province if that helps).  Souvia has an impressive selection of real tea including the difficult to find Pu-Erh.  They have fuffy flavored type teas too.  I prefer the traditional green and Oolong teas.  Pu-Erh is the king of teas made from the leaves of very old tea trees and aged for a decade.  No matter how narrow or adventuresome your tea taste is, Souvia has a bunch of choices you will like.
