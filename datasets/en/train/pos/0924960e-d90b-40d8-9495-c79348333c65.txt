Best chinese food I have tried in Scottsdale.  My parent go here all the time.  The owners are very friendly and stop by our table at least twice a visit.  They always hook us up with a pretty unique deserts.

Their Chilean Sea bass is OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Do yourself a favor and try it.  The cocktails are also really good.  The bartender pours a strong drink and always has a story to tell.  He seems to be there everytime we go.  

TRY THIS PLACE OUT.
