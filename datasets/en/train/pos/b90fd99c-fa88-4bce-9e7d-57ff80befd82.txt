I have been to Centurion multiple times and this is by far my favorite place to eat!  The intimate setting is perfect for a date or just to get away.  The food has always been exceptional.  The wines are  excellent.  I recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  Don't pass this place up.  Treat yourself!
