Yet another impressive event! While the heat always gets you, it was much less muggy then last year. 

I was very impressed by the increase in the amount of beer vendors in addition to wine vendors for this year's go-round. 

The demonstrations by Chef Payton and Chef Kantak + the infamous Richie Moe were definitely a highlight. 

I think the only improvement would be to segregate desert and coffee oriented offerings in to the shaded corner by the museum, instead of interspersed amongst the rest of the offerings. Otherwise, what a great time!
