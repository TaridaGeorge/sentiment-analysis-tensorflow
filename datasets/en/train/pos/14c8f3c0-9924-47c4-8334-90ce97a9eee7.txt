this coffee is so good that you probably shouldn't ever go here. 

"but why," you ask. "that makes no sense," you proclaim. 

listen, if everyone starts going here and then i have to wait in a line next time i stop by i'm going to be a little disgruntled. the last time i was here it was totally low key and peaceful and i got to enjoy my coffee and small talk with the owner without being rushed. what a gem.. especially for me coming from los angeles. 

so please.. stay away from Cartel. for me.
