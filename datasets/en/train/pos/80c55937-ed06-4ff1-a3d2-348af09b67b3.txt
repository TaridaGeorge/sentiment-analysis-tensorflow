I love La Bocca's Bruschetta so much! La Bocca is definitely one of my favorite places in Tempe to go. Their sangrias are great, I've had the white and the red and they both are very flavorful without being too much. 
Most of all however, I have to talk about the bruschetta because that's what I get every time I go. I always get the same thing - one caprese, one pesto tomato, and two prosciutto goat cheese fig. They are all fab but really I could probably get four prosciutto goat cheese fig ones because those are the best!! Absolutely delicious. I've also had their limoncello which is pretty tasty. I go to La Bocca all of the time and it's definitely my favorite spot on Mill Ave.
