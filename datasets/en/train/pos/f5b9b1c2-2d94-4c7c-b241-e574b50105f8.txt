I don't do 4 stars but Shady's deserves it. The bartenders are dicks and refuse to talk to me. I like that! Who the hell needs to have small talk with the person serving up liquor?  Just keep the glasses off my table which they do, with attitude even! The regular crowd can be a lot of fun. But only if you like belligerent conversations about dog spiders and pool tables. Which of course I do. This place has character in the vast sea of carbon copied Pablum called Phoenix.  Shady's feels like something else. I personally love it and I hope all the rest of you DON'T GO.  We like it that way.
