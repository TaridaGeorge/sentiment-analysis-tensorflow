Even though this Game Stop is located in a rough neighborhood, the staff and cleanliness of this store would never show it. Dave (general manager) is top notch and very professional. All staff are helpful and knowledgeable about the games. I've  never been in the store where I wasn't immedately greeted and asked if I could be assisted. Overall, one of the better Game Stops I've been to and I look forward to the progress being made here.
