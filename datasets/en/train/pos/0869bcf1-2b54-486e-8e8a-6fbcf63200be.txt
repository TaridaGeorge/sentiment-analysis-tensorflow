My wife and I experienced an outstanding dinner at the Palm Court. The service staff was professional, friendly and attentive. Ambiance at Palm Court is elegant and a great place for a nice romantic dinner. I enjoyed the Veal Medallions and my wife had the halibut. Both dishes were excellently prepared and very flavorful. To sum up, this was perhaps the best meal and dining experience I have had in the past year.
