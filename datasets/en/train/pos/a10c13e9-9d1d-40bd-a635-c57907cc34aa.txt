This seriously is the nicest most beautiful stadium I have been in. I went to spring training game with my girl & we were both so impressed with the layout & design of everything in this complex. First I can not describe how clean everything is here. From the restrooms to the seats to the food areas. Speaking of food, this place puts the dodger dog to shame! Here the dodger dog is huge!! & grilled not steam like dodger stadium plus wrapped with bacon. The parking is great if you know the trick, park in the back cuz it's the parking lot closest to the field & where the players parking lot is. I wanna come back next year how great it is
