HUEVOS RANCHEROS! I must ask my fiancee on every one of my days off if we can go to Harlow's. I just love the atmosphere, kind of a 1950's diner feel with old movie posters on the walls and all the waitresses call you "hun". It's just friendly and very warm. Plus Harlow's is always hopping, it's just the place to be in Tempe, you could run into anyone here.
   Harlow's is a breakfast spot, they have lunch, and it's pretty good, but if you want real justice you have to try breakfast items, like the HUEVOS RANCHEROS! Man are they good, by far the best I've ever had. The service is always great, and even though there can frequently be wait times, it's totally worth it.
