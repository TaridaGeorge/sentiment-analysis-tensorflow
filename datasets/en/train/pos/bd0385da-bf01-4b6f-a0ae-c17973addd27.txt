ok..so i had a really good friend who took me here a few times...well not here..actually when it was on Indian School and 7th st. it looks so much more inviting now. i just need to bring myself to want to gorge nom nom nom on some fry bread. it's like a big pile of fried crack. you seriously get hooked on the decadent fried morsals. topped with hot and saveries these are just to kill for. maybe even worth dying for. a sweet one is excelent..nom nom nom. ok i think i need to end this post before i eat my keyboard.
