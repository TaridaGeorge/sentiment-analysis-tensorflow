Staff was friendly, check in was quick and easy just needed to catch a shuttle to all rental cars in Phoenix, prices are extremely reasonable $145 including all fees and taxes for a week for a full size car. Was apprehensive about this inexpensive rental company but could not be happier. Upon arrival we were upgraded to a brand new Hyundai 2013 Tucson SUV with 14 miles on the od!!  This company is beginning opening locations throughout the us.
