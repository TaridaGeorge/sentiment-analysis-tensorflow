Oh Scratch, you have my heart. I love your delicious fresh ingredients. Your mouth watering little desserts, and that coffee is to die for. Your customer service is always great. My only issue with you, I need to be rich to eat you :( Thats okay though, this is one local business I will be happy to support no matter what the price is. The bread is always fresh, nom nom nom. I love eating chicken that actually tastes like chicken! No overprocessed chicken here. This place is definitely worth trying out. My favorite thing to get here is a vanilla latte with soy milk, and the chicken/mozzarella/pesto/tomato sandwich.. it is quite possibly the best sammich I've ever tasted. And a bit of a warning, it can sometimes take awhile for your food but the wait is well worth it.
