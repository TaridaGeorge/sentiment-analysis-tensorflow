My family and I have been regularly venturing out to the Mining Camp for dinner for over 20 years. We love the traditional all-you-can-eat meal of ribs, chicken, and ham. We treat all of our out of town guests dine here. Thankfully they have added a new dinner style with a menu as you would have at a regular restaurant, but there is NOTHING regular about it. The food is fantastic in both rooms and they offer a great atmosphere through their old fashioned service and style. Every employee from the gift shop to the kitchen to the management acts as if it is not a job, but more as if it was their family. Their PRIDE shows through their experience, service, and food. I recommend everyone try it. Check their website and call to check for their hours. ~ V. Reaves.
