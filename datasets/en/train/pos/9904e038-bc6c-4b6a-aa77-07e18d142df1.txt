KILLER workspace, definitely fits the name *nudge* haha, get it?! No? Ok I'll stop. 

Moving on. The workspace/meeting space is contemporary, comfortable and welcoming. Especially for all you Macophiles in the world - they look like the Arizona division of Apple, Inc. (I think they have more Mac's than the Apple Store). 

I was here for a Brew Camp about homebrewing, and the atmosphere was perfect for the learning, talking and tasting that took place. And the cooperative concept of Gangplank is really revolutionary. Makes me want to pack up my Scottsdale office and open shop in Gilbert!
