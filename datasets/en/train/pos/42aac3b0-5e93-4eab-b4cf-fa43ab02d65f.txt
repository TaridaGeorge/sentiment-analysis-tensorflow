Great place to hang out with your pooches. The crowd is generally mellow and the dogs adorable.  MY 2 dogs love it .  Extra perks are the doggie obstacle area if you are into that . Also there is plenty of room for running which the little gal loves. Also there is a smaller enclosed area for little dogs or puppies.
