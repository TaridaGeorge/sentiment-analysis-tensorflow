Mellow Mushroom - WOW

As you may tell from recent reviews, I have been on a Pizza crusade. Well, I took a friend to Mellow Mushroom today and the pizza rocked.

We shared the Thai Die Pizza which had curry chicken and tasted awesome. The crust was think and delicious the pizza burst with taste when I bit into it. I am a traditional pizza guy but this diversion worked.

Great service and a nice patio to eat topped it off.

I'll be heading back...soon
