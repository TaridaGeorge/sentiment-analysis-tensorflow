I'm a HUGE fan of this place at the Phoenix Airport! I usually don't like airport food, but this is one of my exceptions! 

Kale & Quiona Shredded Salad - 5/5. Delish and refreshing! This one has no meat, but tastes incredibly healthy! Instead of croutons, there are grapes, which I will have to try to add in to my salads at home. Kale & quinoa are some examples of super foods and I'm so glad they have it here!

Thai Chicken Salad - 3.5/5. I ordered this because one of the employees recommended. It was A-OK, but nothing spectacular. I would not get this again. 

The airport site also has gelato! I like the pistachio samples! 

This is my favorite restaurant at the Phoenix Airport!
