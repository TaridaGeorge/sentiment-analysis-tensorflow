Looking to surprise spouse while in Phoenix with good German. Of course, the Rouladen was not as good as her Mom's, but then again, I am sure there never will be one that competes with "Mom's."

Other than competing with Mom's, the food and service were excellent.  The Rouladen, though not Mom's, was thoroughly enjoyed, the Brats, German potatoes, sauerbraten and spatzel were delicious. Desserts, wow!!  Got to try the sauerkraut cake - it's a chocolate lover's delight.
