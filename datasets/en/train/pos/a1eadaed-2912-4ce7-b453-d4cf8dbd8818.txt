back in town for spring training and we had to go back.
Alot of the time when you go back somewhere its never as good as the first time but not here. I ordred the brisket and its the best. The dont hide the meat with a gallon of sauce. they actually dont give you enough sauce. They dont need to because the meat is that good but most sauces are bad and you would actually want them to drence the meat with there sauce. Its hard to find great meat with great sauce. The mac n cheese was the best. good bread. I cant wait to go back to Phx to see family of course :-) This is also the place to be. came on a friday night and it took forever to get a table but the club/bar was jam packed.
