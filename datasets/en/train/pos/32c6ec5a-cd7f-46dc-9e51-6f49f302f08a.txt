When I used to live in Phoenix I would be here a majority of my mornings! The Staff is so friendly and the food is high quality. I always stick with the classic bacon and eggs with some coffee, but I've had friends get the sausauge and steak which I tasted to make sure it wasn't poison...and I haven't tried anything that wasn't good! Part of what makes this place so good is the atmosphere. A tiny, trailer-esque diner? Sign me up! If there is a wait they usually have some water or lemonade to sip on while you wait....but the table turnover isn't too long, so it's nothing to complain about.
