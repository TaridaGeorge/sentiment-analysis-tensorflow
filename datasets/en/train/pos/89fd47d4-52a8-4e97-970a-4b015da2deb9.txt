LOVE this place! I first had it in Nashville and when I saw that there were Cracker Barrel's in Phoenix, I almost did back flips. They offer good food, for great prices. This is comfort food, people, Mama's home cooking kind of food, probably made with Crisco and coffee that only needs 2 creams and a sugar. I appreciate the "store" part as it keeps me from trying to sit with strangers in my haste to eat.
