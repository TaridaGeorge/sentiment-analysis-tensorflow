This small restaurant is definately worth a try, but call ahead for reservations, they're very busy. I found the menu exciting and interesting; I litterally wanted to try everything. I did end up having the rainbow valley butter | radishes | local honey comb | cashews, the salad of lady apple | crispy prosciutto | pecans | blue cheese, and the grilled spicy broccoli | meyer lemon aioli | pistachio. They were all amazing, it was a euphoric experience.
