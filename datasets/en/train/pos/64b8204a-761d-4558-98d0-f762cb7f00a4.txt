How could anyone give this place a bad review!  Actually, this location (Campus for Compassion) is truly magnificent.  If you walk in expecting the typical animal shelter with depressing crowds of people waiting to abandon/euthanize/adopt their pets, then you will be blow away by this campus.  We adopted our lovely dog here, as well as shopped for one of our cats.  The staff is great, and they provide great facilities to meet and greet your future family members.  I've never seen a nicer shelter.

Point of clarification: this is only an adoption center, not a place to drop off rescued animals.  At least that's what I remember being told when we had a batch of stray kittens last year.
