I live right around the corner from Frasher's and up until yesterday have only gone there to get a drink and after finally getting some food there, I'm angry at myself for not eating here sooner. I ordered a strip steak to which they prepared at exactly the way I requested it, medium rare, and it was simply delicious. Coupled with a baked potato and garlic mashed potatoes (I know, I'm weird) the meal and the company I was with we're simply amazing. I'll definitely be back.
