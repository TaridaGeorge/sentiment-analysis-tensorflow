This is my FAVORITE Mac location in the world. 

They always have everything I need in stock, and the staff members are always super friendly and willing to help out. I have shopped here probably ten or twelve times and have had the same, positive experience each time. I'm glad they moved to a bigger store... means more products available for me to buy :)

My only dislike is that it is in the Biltmore Fashion Park, so parking can be a bitch, but if you are going there anyways its the perfect time to stop by and pick up some Mac!
