What a great spot to support a private, non chain, restaurant.  Great food and half the price of the trendy burger places elsewhere in town.  Can't say enough good things about the food and service.  It is a casual setting, like something you would expect to find in a beach town.   Even though it is basically burgers and tacos, some thought is put into it.  A Brulee Burger!!!  French Toast fries!  Love this place.   Please support these guys!
