My favorite record store in the valley! Awesome store, awesome dudes, awesome events. I stop by every time I go to Trader Joe's (nearly weekly). Great selection of vinyl, I've found some really great used stuff there over the years, all for good prices. Hint: scour the "bargain bin vinyl" section under the normal racks. I've pulled out so many awesome dollar records from there!
