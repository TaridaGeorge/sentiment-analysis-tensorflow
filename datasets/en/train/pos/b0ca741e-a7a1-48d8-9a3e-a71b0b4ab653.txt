Noble Beast is great.  The owners are really nice and always seem to do their best to be personable, even when they are busy.

The prices are reasonable, they always have cute toys and other little gifty items for your pets, and they really participate in the community - especially in trying to find homes for pets in need.

Definitely worth checking out.  Also, they carry a line of dog food that is truly the very best, and it's made here in Arizona.  It's called Azmira.  Our dog eats it and she is totally lean and healthy.
