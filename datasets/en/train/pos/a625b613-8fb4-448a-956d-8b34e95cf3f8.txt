Awesome.  Went for Sunday brunch.  Great selection and variety of all kinds of foods - breakfast, savory, sea food, ethnic food (Italian, Mexican, Chinese, etc), caving station, and expansive dessert options.  Food was being cooked continuously and stations replenished often so food was fresh, not old and dried out like it can get at some buffets.  3 drinks included with brunch.  I was uncomfortably full at the end because it was so good.
