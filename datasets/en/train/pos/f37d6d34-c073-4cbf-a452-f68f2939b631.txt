Just had my first haircut here.  I've always been one to cut my own hair, hated going to those chain places and spending the money.  Just had surgery so I wasn't able to cut my own this time.  Choose Zev's do to location and the reviews here.  Excellent service, haircut, and price.  I really was in awe of the service, never expected so much from a barber shop.  I highly recommend this place.  I'll be getting my hair cut here from now on!
