The big problem I have with Yelp is that all of my favorite secret dining spots get discovered!  Well since the word's out here is my two cents worth.  This is a gem of a sushi joint.  It's tucked away in a strip center off of Hayden and you would not expect to find one of the best deals in town here.  Really fresh product, good portions and very reasonable prices.  The bad news is there can be a bit of a wait around six since it only has a dozen or so tables.  The good news is my neighborhood bar is still off the radar.
