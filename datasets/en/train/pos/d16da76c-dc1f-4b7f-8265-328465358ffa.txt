Clearly, I should frequent here more often.  I was looking to purchase some alcohol to spike my Sonic slush I got during happy hour, and I felt like I walked into an adult Toys R us.

The selection here is huge!  Wine, liquor, beer and galore.  Great full selection, along with amazing prices.  If you sign up for a membership (which I understand is free) you get discounts off your purchases.  Prices are awesome, store is clean and well kept, and prices are clear and easy to see.  They carry a great selection of product, and even though I am not a drinker by trade, I feel like I could not go wrong in this place.

Shop here for good booze!
