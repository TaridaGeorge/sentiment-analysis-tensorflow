My wife and I have eaten at Petite Maison twice this summer, and both times we have been impressed by the food and the service. We used to be regulars at Metro, but have now decided to switch due to superior quality food, better value, and swifter, more attentive service at PM. PM is a little hard to find, yet it is creating such buzz in our neighborhood that it is almost always necessary to make a reservation. We recommend the foie gras, the fish dinner for two, the salmon, and the steak frites. The French onion soup was excellent as well.
