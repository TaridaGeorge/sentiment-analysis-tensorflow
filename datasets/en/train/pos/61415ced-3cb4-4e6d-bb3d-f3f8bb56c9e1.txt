It's dark, it's dank, it's small and it's filled with amazing people who appreciate a good drink, good music and good times! Chars is a place that I had meant to check out for months but never got around to it, but when I did, I had a great time! I love the blues and funk, and it felt great being able to listen to great classic covers and a few new tunes (live and within reach, mind you) while enjoying a beer. I can't wait to get a chance to spend another evening here! I'm definitely telling my friends.
