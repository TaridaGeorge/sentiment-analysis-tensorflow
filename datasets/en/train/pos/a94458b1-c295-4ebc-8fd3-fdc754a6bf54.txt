Best place to go for a pint. The revolving beers make this place fresh and new with every visit. They feature delicious craft brew, none of that yellow piss stuff college kids call beer these days. The local features are always great since you don't have to hunt all over the valley to find them. 

The folks behind the bar are great and laid back, offering up suggestions if you're ever stuck. The biggest bonus to this place is the fact that you can drink here anything you buy from next door, and they have a remarkable selection of already chilled bottles.

Also, if you're hungry they let you bring in food from Thai Basil or the pizza place just down the way. Awesome.
