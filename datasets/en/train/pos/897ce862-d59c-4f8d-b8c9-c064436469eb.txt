Most knowledgeable staff on plants and gardens I have ever encountered.  Prices are great too.  It seems they sprout their starters instead of receiving them from some wholesale company.  The whole place seems to be run by people who garden themselves.   

Sometimes, I just call them to ask questions.  They are always friendly and interested in helping diagnose my plants and other garden folly.
