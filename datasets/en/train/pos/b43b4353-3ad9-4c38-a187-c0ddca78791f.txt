Loved it! The scene was very dark and the crowd was diverse. It's the kind of place where you look around and wonder who people are and what they do. A DJ was spinning some nice music in the background. The bartender was very knowledgeable and even gave my friend and me a free shot for her birthday. It was a nice, unexpected extra.
