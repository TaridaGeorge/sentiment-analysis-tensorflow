Tech Dean showed up 5 mins early for first appt, great sign of things to come, the sales guy George also showed up to help out which shows he cares about the people he signs up and wants to see them happy.

The two worked together to knock out the treatment in record time and covered the Summer and Fall treatments in a duel effort to stop the bugs in their tracks.

Dean went above and beyond what was listed on the web sites to make sure bugs will not make their home in my house by adding extra treatments to the windows and attic. 

I have nothing but good things to say about this company. I recommend them.
