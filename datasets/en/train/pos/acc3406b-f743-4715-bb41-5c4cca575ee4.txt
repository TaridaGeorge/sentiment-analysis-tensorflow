Would like to write a longer review, but I am on my phone.   Doug was on time,  charismatic, and courteous.   He had very interesting banter, and the ride was entertaining and prompt. I highly recommend Riding The Dougie instead of going with a franchise, as it seems that he is way more personable.   The price was more than fair.   I won't hesitate to call him up again, and you shouldn't either!
