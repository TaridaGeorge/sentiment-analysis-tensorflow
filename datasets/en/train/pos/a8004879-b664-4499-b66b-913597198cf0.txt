My mom recently celebrated her 64th birthday and she loves Coconut cupcakes!  I didn't feel like driving to Scottsdale to pick up her favorite cupcakes from Sprinkles so I took her to Urban Cookies. She ended up leaving with one of each of their 12 magical flavors, including coconut! We were not disappointed!! :) Each cupcake was better than the next....so flavorful, moist and not overly sweet. Simply fabulous!!!
