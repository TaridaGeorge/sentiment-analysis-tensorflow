I visited Hana with friends on my recent visit to Phoenix. We had an awesome experience. The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and attentive, and the food was outstanding - the fish was fresh as can be (despite being far from water) - and the noodles and salad were tastefully done. I've heard there's oftentimes a wait (they are small and don't take reservations), but we went after the lunch rush and didn't have a problem. Some of the best Japanese I've had!
