By far the most professional, efficient and comfortable experience as far as waxing goes.
EWC gets their wax especially made from Europe.  Organic Beeswax that doesn't adhere to the skin.  Absolutely a pain-free bikini wax.  
5 Star Service and a wonderful, friendly, staff.
Your first brazilian wax is only $21, and after that I think it jumps to somewhere in the $40 range....but they give you coupons and if you buy a package you get an even deeper discount.

In & out in 15 min.  Great service, and friendly staff.  5 Stars.
