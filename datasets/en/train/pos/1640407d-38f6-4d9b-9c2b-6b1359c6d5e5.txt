Oh Fez, you and me...we've hooked up a few times. 

Sometimes just for drinks, a quick bite, an early dinner, a late dinner. but this last breakfast, it put me over the top...I'm movin' in. That's right, you and me are hookin' up! Cuz you are the real deal, Holyfield and I like my restaurants smooth, sweet to the touch and able to go the distance, and you Fez, you go the distance. 

You serve up an amazing eggs benedict, omelets that make a grown woman cry and a breakfast kisra bread that is a sweet, bacony, tangy, cheesy deliciousness. Oh, and the $5 mimosas...yeah, I'm not leaving you anytime soon. Call your mother, you've got a new girlfriend!
