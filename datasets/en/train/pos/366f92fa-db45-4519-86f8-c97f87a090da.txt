I'm not an expert on New Orleans seafood by any means, but the mixed seafood grill was very good.  Everything was cooked perfectly, which is quite a trick, especially with the variety of meats on the skewer.  I would have saved some for leftovers, but my hotel room doesn't have refrigerator or microwave :(

The only thing I could have wished for is wild Pacific salmon instead of the Atlantic salmon, but I guess that would make it less authentic.

I dined on the patio, so I didn't much of a feel for the ambience inside, but it did seem rather loud as I passed through the lobby...
