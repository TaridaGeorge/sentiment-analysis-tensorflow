Another great Happy Hour! The selection of dishes was very nice. The calamari was delish and the burger was huge and very good. The drinks very strong- the definitely don't skimp on the alcohol just because its happy hour. 

The bar area was crowded, so I would recommend getting there early for Happy Hour. Sit at the bar, you will meet some really interesting people!
