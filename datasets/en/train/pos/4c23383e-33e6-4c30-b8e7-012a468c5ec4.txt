One of the most reasonable clubs we've been to in Phoenix, in terms of pricing.  But if it's truly a good club, that isn't as big a factor.  We got there waaaaay early (right after dinner), but that allowed us to sit and have a wonderful conversation.  The club began to pick up around 10, and was pretty full by 11.  The music was very dancable, the service was timely.  Highly recommend it.
