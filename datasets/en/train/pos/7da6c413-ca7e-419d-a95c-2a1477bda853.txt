Yes, I agree with the other reviews.  Incredible hike, especially if you continue up to Flatiron.  The waterfall was dry, and I bet its fantastic when its flowing.  If you make it to Flatiron and back, go ahead and pat yourself on the back for making the 5.8 mile trip.  I'd suggest hiking in a group.

You'll park in the Lost Dutchman State Park.  There is a $5 day use fee per vehicle.
