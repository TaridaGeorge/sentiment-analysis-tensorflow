I spend enough at Bed Bath and Beyond, I should probably just get a weekend job there for discounts. But they have such good deals, especially on those random household essentials that other stores don't seem to stock as much, and I cook a fair bit and I'm obsessively organized, so I end up here a lot. Anyway, this is my closest location and I've always had excellent service here. I seem to buy a lot of wedding presents here too, go figure.
