I love Ikea. Its just goodlooking cheap furniture. Which is excellent for me since I change my mind about stuff so fast, it wont cost me an arm and a leg to decorate that way. I also love their Lingonberry Jam and Swedish meatballs. Oh Ikea you only have one problem. Tempe. Wy must you be in Tempe? Why must it be that everytime I go in you I must see some rotund mormon mother waddling around in her demin jumper gone shapeless dress? Why must you be a day trip? Its okay though... I forgive you Ikea.
