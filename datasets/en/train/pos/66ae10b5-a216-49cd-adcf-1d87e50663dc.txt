Lemongrass never disappoints a poor, hungry college student. The food is fresh and well-spiced, and the atmosphere, while not spectacular, is at least comforting. One of my favorites was a wide-noodle dish that came with veggies, beef, and egg. I can't remember the name, but I still taste the wonderfulness in my mouth.
