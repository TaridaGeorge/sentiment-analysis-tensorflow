Hands down my favorite sushi bar in Phoenix.Their food and drinks are not only really beautiful and unusual, they are so amazingly delicious. The staff are amazing, they have always made the experience fabulous and are a huge contributor on why I recommend them and go back so often... can be slightly spendy if your on a budget and plan to drink but I always find it to be worth the money...plus they have an awesome reverse happy hour that can really cut cost. 

Only teeny tiny grip is what others have mentioned, uncomfortable chairs...boo hoo, I know...all else trumps chair discomfort.
