I am so blessed to have this place near my house.  It's the first thing we ate while we were moving in and it's going to be in our lives for a long time to come.

First off, it's pretty expensive for pizza but it's worth it.  A large pie is huge and for a big guy like me, 2 slices is all I can eat.  A combo pizza will run you $20.  The sandwiches are cheap and delicious.  The wings are decent, but not great.  Maybe they taste better when you eat inside.  We always get delivery.

I love alot of things about NYC.  The 2 most important things (besides my sister) are pizza and bagels.  I am happy Joe's NY covers the pizza side.  Oh and they deliver LAAAAATE Thurs-Sun.
