NY/LA-caliber talent right here in Phoenix, and we are so lucky to have him. Jon Simpson is creative, funny, great to work with, and is the master of getting the best shot that reflects his subject's personality. He has photographed my kids for years, always to rave reviews for the photo holiday cards. And when I needed my business headshots done recently, he even made this camera-phobe look good. Plus, he's got a funky studio right here in the heart of Arcadia. Highly recommend!
