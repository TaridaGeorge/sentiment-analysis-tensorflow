This is a neighborhood gem!! We love it & eat here frequently!! 
The other night I ordered the Vovo special - it was 'portugese surf n turf' (a steak, shrimp & rice) but dont let the simplicity of the dish fool you!! the sauce was heavenly - a demi-glace but better!! we also had the grilled brie sammies for a starter and...well they have brie in them - enough said -yum!! 
We love that they make all their drink mixers - housemade sodas, it really makes the drinks extra special and delicious.
The staff is always fun and friendly...
GO!! you will love it!!
PS- the savory cupcakes....the BEST (but they sell out quickly!!)
