Any business that helps me get home more quickly after work to pour that first glass of wine is a-ok in my book.  They come to ME for pick up and delivery, which I absolutely love.  Every Monday and Thursday they swing by my office, always consistent.  I was happily surprised to see the prices in line with other cleaners, I really don't feel I'm paying much for the delivery service, and am vey pleased with the quality of work.
