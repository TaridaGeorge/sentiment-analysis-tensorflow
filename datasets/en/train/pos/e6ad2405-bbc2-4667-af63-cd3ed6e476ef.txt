I can't say enough good things about this place. LOLA, my beautimous lil' pup, is half Corgi and half Bionic. She doesn't do much bored destructive chewing (i.e. socks, towels, chonies, etc) as long as she has playtoys. Problem is finding her ones she wont destroy in 20 minutes. Enter WagNWash, which has naturally shed Deer Antlers. Who would have thought? Now 8-15 bucks a pop is kinda pricey, but if it keeps my little Kong-Destoyer happy (and my throw rugs safe) it is worth it. Also love the fresh baked goodies, and the Solid Gold is reasonably priced. LOLA gets her first groom here this week, so I will report back later on how that goes...
