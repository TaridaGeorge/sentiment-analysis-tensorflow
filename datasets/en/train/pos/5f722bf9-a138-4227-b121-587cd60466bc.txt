I had Happy Hour with friends here last night.  (My one disappointment is that Happy Hour ends at 6PM here; what's up with that!?)  OK, it could have been my company, but I was so impressed with everything here last night, this will quickly become one of my favorite lounges/restaurants.

My Dirty Martini was perfect...perfect!  The waiter was so friendly and genuine that we decided to forgo the waitstaff service to return to the bar for additional drinks.

The appetizers were good.

But the lounge areas and the view were absolutely gorgeous!  This place has such a wonderful ambiance.  It is definitely a place to which I will return, and definitely a place I would like to share with visiting family and friends!
