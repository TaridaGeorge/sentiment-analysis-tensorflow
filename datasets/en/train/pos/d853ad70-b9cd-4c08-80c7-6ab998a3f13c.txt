Well Chris Demarco has done it again! Great sense of "place" and food to match. Appetizer was Calamari and it was good... not great but good but not great.We got there for happy hour (before 7 PM) and had wine at $4.50 a glass, now that is nice.
 I had the linguini with clams...you will not be disappointed. Companion ordered the Scampi and a caprese salad. Scampi was a 7.5 on a scale of 10 but the caprese salad was a solid 9.5.
We both had deserts, companion with the gelato (good) and I took a "flyer" with the Olive Cake. Pleasant surprise with the Olive cake. I wanted something to soothe my sweetooth craving and I was skeptical. Very good. The cherries on the gelato.....wow!
All in all 4 glasses of wine, 2 appetizers, entre's and two deserts around $115.00. Worth it!
