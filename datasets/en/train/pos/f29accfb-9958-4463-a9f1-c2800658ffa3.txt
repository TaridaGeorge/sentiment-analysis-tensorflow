As a business traveler, this hotel checked all the boxes...central location, clean, free wifi, free breakfast, gym and spacious rooms. What puts this hotel in the five star category was the staff. They were superlative - friendly, helpful, and genuinely nice people. Jim, the guy who works at night, was particularly awesome. I've stayed at hotels all over the world and these guys really rocked on customer service. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone needing a place in Phoenix - business or leisure. You'll love it.
