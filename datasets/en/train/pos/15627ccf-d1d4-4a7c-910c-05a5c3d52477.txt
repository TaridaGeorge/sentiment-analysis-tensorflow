I cannot get over how AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS their seafood is. I haven't been able to get over it. Appetizer: Prince Edward Island Mussels. I don't think I will ever be able to be completely satisfied with other restaurants variations on Mussels for the rest of my life. The sauce was light, but so rich in flavor. Mmmm! I ordered the Manila Clams Linguine. Sooo tasty and a great transition from the mussels. The sauce wasn't too rich, and their clams were delicious (no surprise). I tasted the Zin Braised Short Ribs with the gnocchi, and it was great too. Do not hesitate, go now!
