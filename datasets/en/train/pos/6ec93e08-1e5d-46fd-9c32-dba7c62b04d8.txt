That food is great!! I have had several dishes and they were all amazing, especially when comparing to other premium restaurants of the same type. 

Service is very good. 

Location is a little out of the way but in a very quaint spot. I love the interior and they have a great patio. 

The only negative is that it is so far from my home... I'd like to visit it more often, but the distance will not stop me.
