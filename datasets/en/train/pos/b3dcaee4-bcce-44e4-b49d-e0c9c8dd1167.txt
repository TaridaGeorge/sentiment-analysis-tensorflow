Love, love, love this store! Furniture, wine, coffee, tea, snacks, sweets, dishes, wall art, jewelry, gifts, I can find it all here! Always something unique and useful. Whenever I'm not sure what to get someone I can almost always find something at Cost Plus. The bad part is I usually find a few too many things for me as well.  Good thing they have such a great rewards program. I'm always getting coupons. Ten dollars off this, 25% off furniture, great prices on wine.  Staff is great!  Very friendly and always ready to help!  Yep, I love, love, love this store!  Check it out, you might too!
