OH MY GOD....the culinary gods got together and let this special baby out into the world...

The chef is cutting edge and the food is out of this world...handmade pastas, unbelievably fresh fish, amuses that will make everything else you eat feel so sad... 

Yes, it is in a strip mall, but who cares...there is a ton of parking and the prices are cheap! They also have sunday night suppers and duck fat fries that I cant wait to go back and try... 

The chef and his students (there are like 10 top-chef like people back there) are truly special...

ROCK ON NOCA!!!
