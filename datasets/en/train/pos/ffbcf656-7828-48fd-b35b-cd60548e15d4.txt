Yum yum yum. Why sit at a bar in Old Town Scottsdale when you could be sitting at the Sugar Bowl counter on a Saturday night? What? I'm a nerd? Yes, yes I am. But everything on the Sugar Bowl menu is amazingly delicious and tastes so fresh!  One scoop of their ice cream is a HUGE amount, so when I want an "extra fancy" ice cream dish I grab a friend or two to split it with. I had the Desireme Banana Split last night and it was great, but very large.

The whole place is covered in old fashioned pink stripe ice cream, pink booths, pink paintings, etc. The only downside is the bathroom, which is not pink, just dirty. Also, they don't give you napkins unless you ask and there aren't any on the tables, which seems kind of silly, for an ice cream joint.
