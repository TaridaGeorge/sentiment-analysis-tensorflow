Hot Wok Mr. Cook.
I have been into the actual establishment twice. I have ordered delivery on many occasion. I don't know what New York style means, if it means damn good chinese food, then well done.  When in New York I will ask that they do it Hot Wok Mr. Cook style, because if it's that good to be copied then they will know what I'm talking about right?
