Great service and excellent food!! Please try the Mac and Cheese AND the Walnut Pear Salad both are phenomenal. The selection of beer is vast but offers something different for everyone. Its a great place to dine inside OR out and it is almost always packed. If you haven't tried it, you must at least once!
