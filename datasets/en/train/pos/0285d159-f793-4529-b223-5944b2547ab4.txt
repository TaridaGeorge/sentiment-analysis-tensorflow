I really love Bomberos although it is true that servers are few and far between.  Fortunatly the patio atmosphere more than makes up for it....I'm a total sucker.  Go for happy hour prices and enjoy the trees while munching on tasty bruchetta that is only a tiny step under postinos on the deliciousness rating.
