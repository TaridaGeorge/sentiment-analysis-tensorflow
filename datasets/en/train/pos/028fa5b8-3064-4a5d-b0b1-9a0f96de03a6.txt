I hosted a charity fundraiser, Love, NORTON, at Oakville. The food was absolutely fabulous and the staff was so amazing and accommodating. BTW. Great wine! Their outdoor patio is lovely, especially with the fireplace. I just love their iced sport tea and brownies which are SOY FREE! I wished I lived closer or they had one in my neighborhood. I would be getting to-go food everyday! I have been to the Oakville in Napa as well and didn't know they were connected. Great place any time of the day! Start off the morning with a fabulous latte and chocolate croissant, and end the day with an amazing glass of wine and wonderful cheeses! Love this place!
