This is a very small, friendly restaurant with big portions. The Friday dinner menus changes from week to week. Mark (chef and owner) seems to take pride in his restaurant and food, if you are lucky you may also hear him singing in the kitchen. Bring your favorite wine or beer in on Friday night as this is a BYOB restaurant. There is no corkage fee if you do bring your own wine and they have wine glasses available, but if you are bring beer, bring your favorite beer glass as they do not have glasses for beer. The food was fresh and well prepared and really had homemade quality. This restaurant is so well liked in neighborhood and by the regulars, that many volunteer came together to help this restaurant reopen and remain in business, that says a lot about this neighborhood gem.
