We finally went to Smashburger after our daughter told us how fantastic it was.  I wasn't convinced it was my kind of place.  But shame on me.  I love the fact you can pick your burger size.  And the rosemary and sea salt fries are beyond good.  Beer is cold.  Food is awesome.  Service is enthusiastic and friendly.  My kind of place after all.
