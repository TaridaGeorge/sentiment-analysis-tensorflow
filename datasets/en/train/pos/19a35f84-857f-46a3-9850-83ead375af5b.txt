OoOoOoOh how I love the herb box & team :)

The menu is packed with amazing healthy dishes that include; huge market salads a mixture of medium rare steak with watercress, avocado, bacon and sweet dried corn with a tangy blue cheese vinaigrette. 
There are shared plates, wraps, sandwiches, flat breads and The Herb Box's signature butternut squash corn enchiladas. Most meals can be ordered vegetarian or gluten free. One of my favorite sides is the to die for mac & cheese! It's a must! :)
Also I recommend trying there new soup flavor each week! ($5cup | $7 bowl | $12 quart)

Parking is free underground. Everything on the menu is amazing, so don't worry it looks intimidating but you wont be disappointed!
