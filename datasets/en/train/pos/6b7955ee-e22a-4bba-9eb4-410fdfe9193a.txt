This is a great Walgreen's. It's open 24 hours, has a very helpful Pharmacist, Photo Center, and the staff is very pleasant. I live just down the street from this Walgreen's and even though I don't go there often, every time I do it's a pleasant experience. One of the things I like best is that if the cashier gets a little busy they immediately call for assistance and open another cash register. There is nothing worse than standing in a long line with only one check stand open. Thank you for providing good customer service.
