Best place in the valley to get a coffee. If you like LGO you'll love this place. Same principal without the crowds and stress that LGO has. You can actually relax here and hear yourself think. I had their Breakfast Burrito this last Sunday and I can say with out a doubt that it was the best Breakfast Burrito I have ever had, and I know my Breakfast Burritos. Another great idea, and this goes for any coffee shop, other than Starbucks because they don't have it, use Almond Milk in your Mocha instead of regular or non-fat. It is amazing. My next plan is to try their cooking classes.
