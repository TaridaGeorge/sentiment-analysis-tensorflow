Can you beat a $2 buck car wash?  So you have to do it yourself, c'mon Man, get sudsy and do your own car (shout out to all your high rollers who pay Danny's for their luxury wash)!  Weiss Guys on 40th Street is a T-bird secret.  Tucked away next to Circle K, it offers self serve and a drive through wash.  Always clean and neat, well-stocked, and with very friendly service.  If you pay for the drive-thru, make sure to give the guys a couple bucks for their hard work.  They do a great job drying your car off and deserve the cash.
