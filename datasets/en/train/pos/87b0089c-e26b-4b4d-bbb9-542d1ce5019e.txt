I'm totally baffled that the Tee Pee only has 3 stars on yelp!  I've never before had a better (American) Mexican food experience than what I've seen here on numerous occasions. 

The place was wall-to-wall packed every time I was there, they HAD to have been doing something right.

Those quesadillas are just out of this world.  I try to emulate the style every time I make em at my house..they're never quite as good, but at least they take me back to the Tee Pee.  I love their burros and the machaca.  Great drinks and friendly, attentive staff once you finally get seated.  

You gotta get to the Tee Pee when you're in the Phoenix area.  You won't be disappointed.
