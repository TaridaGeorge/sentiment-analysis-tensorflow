I've been meaning to write a review for this amazing place and keep forgetting.  My Wife recommended riding our bikes there this morning for coffee and bagels while Grandma has the kids for a few hours.  

Bottom line, the bagels are the best in town (the closest you can get to NYC).  The owners are there everyday and greet everyone with a smile...which goes a long way with me and the staff is just as helpful and friendly.

Don't waste your time or money on any of the other bagel shops is town...this one is a can't miss!

PS - it's a great place for kids too, they have etcha-sketch boards and play tables and both my kids love their bagels, donuts, and muffins.  

Enjoy!
