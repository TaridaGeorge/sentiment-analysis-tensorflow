Holly was awesome and I was looking for a black cinnamon herbal mix. She picked out a couple with me and actually suggested something out of left field a early grey tea which I'm not a fan of.. but one sniff and I had to try it. I bought more then I thought I would ...love the prices of the tea. I'll be back for sure since I just finished my tea about a week ago its about time lol.
