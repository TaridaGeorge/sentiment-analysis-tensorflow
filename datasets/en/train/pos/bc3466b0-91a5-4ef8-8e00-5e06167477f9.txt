My family LOVES The Coffee Shop! 

The San Diegan is sooo good for breakfast! Fabulous pastries and sandwiches, you really can't go wrong with anything they serve here. The turtle monsoon is one of my favorite things ever.

The atmosphere and service are amazing. It's a great place to just come hang out, have some good food and take in fresh air! 

Can't say enough good things about it!
