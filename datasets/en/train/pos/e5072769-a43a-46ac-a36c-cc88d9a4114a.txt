Stealth!  As many times as I've been to Scottsdale in the last 5 or so years I've never seen or heard about  this wine bar.  Who ever heard of a speakeasy wine bar...genius.  It's fun, and it wasn't very crowded for a Friday night in Old Town.  The staff is very helpful and friendly.
  
This venue serves up a mean menu full of hundreds of different wines, beer, liquor, and a unique food menu.  I tried a glass of white wine - can't remember which one, and this brandy shot thing - that was really good!  I shared a pizza that was light and not oily - thumbs up.  
They have live music on the weekdays - can't wait to go back!
