I have been going to Spa Nordstrom for years.  I have never had a bad experience.  I always get treated wonderful and never get made to feel like they don't have enough time to complete my service even when I have been a little late.   For the type of spa experience they offer I would say the pricing is amazing.  I have gone to resort spas that are supposed to be the tops but Nordstroms out performs them by far.  I recommend them for sure.
