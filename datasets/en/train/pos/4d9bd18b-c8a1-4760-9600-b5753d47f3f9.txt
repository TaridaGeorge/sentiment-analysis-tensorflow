It's asking a lot of burger joints these days to offer a burger that actually tastes like beef but five guys does not fall in that category. Incredible flavor! Made to order makes a difference people. Everything about this burger is worth the hassle of airport security or five hour drive from Vegas. Can I get an amen for free toppings? I thought so. Cajun fries were to die for, I'm convinced they were sprinkled with heroin as even after I declared myself unable to get out of my chair without assistance I couldn't stop shoveling these fries. Note, the regular size is about the same size as the drink cups and enough for two (possibly 3) to share. 

Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll definitely be back with an empty stomach and my elastic lined pants.
