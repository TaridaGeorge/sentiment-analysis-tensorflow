This place deserves five stars for two reasons. First, it is commendable that a "corporate" restaurant makes this level of a commitment to serve numerous gluten free and vegetarian options. My SO has celiac and although many restaurants in the Phoenix area are trying harder to provide gluten free options, very view provide this extensive range of options or achieve this level of excellence.

Second, five stars is  deserved for the overall quality of all dishes on the menu.

Other thoughts: Sitting at the bar for dinner is a fun and casual approach to dining here. The people that comment on the small portion sizes are out of their minds. One can only assume they frequent places like Cheesecake Factory. Eat right and live longer!
