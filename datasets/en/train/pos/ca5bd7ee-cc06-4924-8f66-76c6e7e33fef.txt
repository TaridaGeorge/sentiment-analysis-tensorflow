Great location if staying near the convention center or in downtown Phoenix. This is by far one of the best sports bars I have ever been to. I had a perfect view of ESPN 2 and the place had plenty of sporting events on other teles..but not too many. 

The atmosphere is fantastic and perfect for lunch. Food is great and they had vegetarian options, a major plus for a sports bar. What is better than veggie options? They made exceptions for me, my whole meal sans dairy with no complaints, evil eyes, etc. This is greatly appreciated. 

The evening scene is great also. 

An overall 5.5 stars. hellz yeah.
