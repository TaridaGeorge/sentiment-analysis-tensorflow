The first word that comes to mind is YUMMY!  I am in this area every Wednesday and had been looking forward to eating here; last night I finally got the chance.  I had the Chicken Pesto Grilled Flatbread; great flavor at a great price.  The atmosphere is nice, very clean, with friendly and quick service.  I am already looking forward to trying the Peanut Butter Crunch and one of the many smoothies they offer!
