After many failed attempts for pet sitting, including friends and relatives staying in our home, we finally hired Kimbur Pet Care and highly recommend the service, every service they provide. It is very easy to schedule pet sitting, and they are happy to help, even on Christmas. It is also very affordable, and actually cheaper than other sitters I found. The do it yourself wash makes things so much easier, and they can even take over and calm our very high strung dog when needed. Even after returning from a 2 week long vacation, our dog was completely happy because of her 30 minute visits every day, where before she would be extremely anxious after 2 days. They are completely reliable, trustworthy, loving and compassionate to all our pets. We are so thankful for the peace of mind when we are away!
