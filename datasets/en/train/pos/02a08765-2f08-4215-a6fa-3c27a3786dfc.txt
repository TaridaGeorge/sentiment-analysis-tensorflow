A delightful, friendly shop that is owned by Claire and her mom,Jean. This cottage is filled with great vintage goodies. Most items are from the east coast. Classy and collectable. Spend an hour browsing ...... have a nice and warm chat with Claire.....you will find her chalked full of knowledge on her items. A terrific place to search through and rediscover the past.......
