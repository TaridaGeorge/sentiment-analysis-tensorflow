This In-n-Out is awesome because when I was here there were a lot of coeds in bikinis.  That has not been my typical In-n-Out experience so that was definitely a bonus.  I'm a big In-n-Out fan so what else is there to say?  

You can see all the In-n-Out Burgers I've eaten in 2010 in this blog entry:
