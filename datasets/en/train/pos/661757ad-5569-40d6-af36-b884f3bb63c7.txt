Best Mexican food ever!! Been going here for 15+ years and still love it! Green sauce on everything is my favorite. Delicious, great quality chicken! Recently discovered the quesadilla with green chile strips in it and OMG- amazing! Great dine in experience or super convenient take out with a drive thru window. Now serving breakfast too- go for the senor jorge or verde scramble...
