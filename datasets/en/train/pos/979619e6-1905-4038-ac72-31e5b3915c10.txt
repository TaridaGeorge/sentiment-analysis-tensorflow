I have used Kevin Shroyer as my exclusive home inspector for years. Kevin is a knowledgeable and experienced home inspector who is more than familiar with the different things that are a concern of any person buying a home in the general Phoenix area. Kevin stays current on all of the updates and licensing reviews that are required by the state just to maintain a license as a home inspector. He is personal prompt respectful and communicates well with others. 

I very highly recommend Kevin and Primespec Consulting as a home inspection company.
