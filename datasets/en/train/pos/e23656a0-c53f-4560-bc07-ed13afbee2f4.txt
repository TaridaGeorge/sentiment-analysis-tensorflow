If I ever felt any regret about having moved to Arizona, it was probably because I thought that here I would never find pizza as good as those I've enjoyed for more than two decades in New York. But then I read Wes N.'s  review of this place and decided to give it a try this afternoon after my trip to my beloved Costco which was in the area. Pow!!! Flashback to the great pizzerias of Arthur Avenue in The Bronx and the Lower West Side of Manhattan! Thanks, Wes, for letting me know about this place that brought a piece of New York into my life in the Valley of the Sun!
