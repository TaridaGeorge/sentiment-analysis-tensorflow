We have only had pleasant experiences here.  The place is kept very clean.  The pizza is pretty decent, too.  We usually go for the lunch buffet so for the price it is not bad at all.  I love the play area for kids who aren't really old enough for games.  My kids have a blast here and the people who work here have always been very friendly and welcoming.
