I took my 2 year old queensland heeler in to be spayed this weekend and didn't really know what to expect, as this obviously is not her regular vets office.  We were wonderfully surprised by the level of service provided not only by the doctor, but by the techs as well. Everyone who handled my dog was very friendly and very understanding.  They took excellent care of her, and didn't charge me an arm and a leg for doing the surgery!  For the price I paid here, it would've cost over $400 at her vets office and why pay that when you can get the same things done for less without sacrificing your pets health and well being!  I would absolutely reccommend this clinic to everyone!
