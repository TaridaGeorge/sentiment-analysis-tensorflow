Love this place....maybe not the fanciest place, but the food is great, portions are hearty, clean atmosphere, and although the servers are young and not the most cheerie, they  are absolutely nice and attentive!!!!

I live in the area and find that you give what you get.  If you have attitude and treat people poorly then expect it back!  I'm a beliver in treating servers with respect and not like your personal butler.

I've never experienced anything bad.  The food is great the waitstaff has always treated us very well!!!
