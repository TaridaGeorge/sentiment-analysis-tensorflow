We have been here many times. It is a drive thru~ but  lets say before I try a new place I go inside first ALWAYS. 
 This  place was spotless, floors sparkling.They also serve Boba wich is a fav of my teens.
 The prices are perfect and Oh the donuts were  divine! Fresh warm and melted on your tongue.
My daughters always wants a  few doz. for the morning when having sleep overs. They ARE better than Krispy Kreme by far and BOSA is  open 24/7! 
 I did go in the afternoon one time and they weren't as fresh so  make it a morning trip!
