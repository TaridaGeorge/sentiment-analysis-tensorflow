This is one of my familys favorite hole in the wall establishments in Phoenix. Almost as good as Valle Luna or the original Garcias on 35th and ossborn, but for a fraction of the price. Great tacos, rellenos, encheladas. The homemade salsa is excellent. They have coupons on yelp, groupon, and entertainment book, don't pass them up.
