Now serving breakfast and Cibo offers the perfect alfresco experience. I've always loved the front portion of the property and today we enjoyed perfect weather and an amazing meal.  I want to move in!
We both started with a cocktail, I had the Bellini and we looked over the menu and both decided on the Fritatta Melfitana, an egg omelet filled with Schreiner's sausage, mozzarella cheese, Schreiner's bacon and topped with grated Pecorino Romano and chives.  Our dish came with roasted potatoes with chives, toasted bread, marmalades and a side fruit parfait. The price point is just a tad higher than most places BUT the quality, taste and presentation make it well worth the extra change. 

 I posted a pic, yeah...THAT GOOD!
