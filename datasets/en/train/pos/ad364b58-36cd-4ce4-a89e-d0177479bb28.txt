This place is reason enough to visit Phoenix.  I am not so secretly in love with the guy behind the counter.  He was amazing and happy to tell us all about how he makes every bit of gelato himself.  Can't imagine a better treat after a day in the sun.  It's too bad that I can only give this place 5 stars.
