I've only eaten here one and it was for my 2nd wedding anniversary but dear lord, was it delicious. My husband ordered (and ate in full) a 5lb lobster and I had the beef wellington. I've had beef wellington only twice before (once at a friend's and once at a restaurant in texas). My food was absolutely delicious and our waiter was awesome. My husband had made reservations so when we walked in, the hostess and the wait staff already knew it was our anniversary. We waited in the bar for our table and my margarita was yummy. Overall, it was a fantastic anniversary dinner. Perfect end to a perfect day of celebrating our anniversary. :)
