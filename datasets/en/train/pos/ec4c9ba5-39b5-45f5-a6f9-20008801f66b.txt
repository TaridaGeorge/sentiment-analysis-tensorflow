We love Roys. The service is usually outstanding and the food is wonderful.The ambience is nice and usually pretty hopping on a Saturday.  My water glass is constantly being refilled because the people Roy's employ are totally on the ball. We have dined here 8+ times over the past 2 years and have never had a mediocre meal. They also have a delicious vegetarian menu if you ask your server. The wine list is comprehensive and they are known for their creative cocktails.We have dined here on both special occasions and regular Saturday nights. It is kind of like being on vacation when we go since it is located in the gorgeous JW Marriott. ...definitely in my top three Phoenix area restaurants.
