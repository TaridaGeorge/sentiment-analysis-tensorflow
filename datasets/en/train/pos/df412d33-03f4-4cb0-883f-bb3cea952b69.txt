I went to a foot Dr. in Tempe.  He wrote me a prescription that was to be filled at a Apothecary shop.  My boyfriend had been to this one before so we came here. Lots of parking in the lot . It is sort of hidden in a building full of Doctor offices.   They do take insurance,but since it is a natural product it cost more, than a pill type script would. But, of course well worth it because,it is all natural. they sell a lot of really cool things here in this store as well as getting scripts done here. If you are looking to going down a more natural path in your life with your food and what you drink as well/ Then, give this place a try.
