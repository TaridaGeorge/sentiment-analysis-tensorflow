Note that I am rating this place based purely on their supreme/deluxe/whatever gyro, and that I've never actually sat down to eat here, just gotten my food to go. Now that's out of the way: sooooo goooood, and inexpensive compared to some other places that offer gyros!

There's a minimum $5 purchase to run a debit card transaction, so if you don't have any cash, be prepared to buy dessert (poor you!)
