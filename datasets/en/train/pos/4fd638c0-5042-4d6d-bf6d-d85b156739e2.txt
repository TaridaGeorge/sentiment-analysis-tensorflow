I have not been back here for about a year.  What a mistake to wait that long...  

All the food is well above par with creative spins on traditional items that make you wonder why everyone does not make them this way. Delicious and creative food and drink.  Very friendly people and atmosphere.

They have a lot of ingredients that you might not see on a menu very often.  For Example.. Chimichurri, kalamata olives, haricot verts, manchego cheese and the way the put them together make for happy mouths.   They have a great selection of veggie options too.  

Then there are the drinks...  Wow...The Mexican chocolate latte!!!!  The white sangria!  Ginger Mojito!!  You just have to try it.

I cannot wait to go back and try more!
