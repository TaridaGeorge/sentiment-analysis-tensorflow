Looks like a dive from the street, but through the doors is a cute, fancy little restaurant that has the best Italian food around.  Great for date night or a family celebration. I am Italian (neopolitan - since we Italians all like our own region's cooking) and I don't like many Italian places, but this one rocks!  Give it a try.
