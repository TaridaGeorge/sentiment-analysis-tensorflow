This is a cool dive away from all the Old Town BS. The jukebox is one of the best I have heard in some time. They were playing songs I never heard of so I know I'm going to be in trouble in the future by using Shazam to identify songs and then buying them from my phone!
Anyway, just be sure you eat before you get there as this is all about hanging in a dive and having drinks. They have lots of beer and the bartenders are cool. If I lived closer I would hang out here much more......
