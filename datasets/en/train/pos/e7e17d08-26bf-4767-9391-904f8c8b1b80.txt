Bone-in ribeye was everything that I dreamed of and more. Everything was so superb, that I'm drooling at the memory of it. Yes, I dined here over 2 months ago and am just now getting to the review but damn...that was a memorable steak. Medium-rare mouthwatering insanity in my mouth!!!! Probably could have done without the sides -- too much food and didn't hold a candle to the steak (mac n cheese was overkill and the spinach was too salty). Just stick with the steak folks and you won't be disappointed. Loved the al fresco seating...I don't think I've ever been to a fine-dining steakhouse with outdoor seating, so that was a really nice change. Oh and best bread tray ever.
