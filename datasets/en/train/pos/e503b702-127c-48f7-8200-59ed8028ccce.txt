I have been making meals at Dream Dinners on Ray Rd every month for almost a year now. The staff is very friendly. Katie & Laura always remember me. The work stations are very clean. It's great that you can alter the recipes to fit your taste. Don't like spice, than don't add it. Allergic to nuts, don't add them. I have never been disappointed in anything I have gotten from Dream Dinner.
Friend had complained that all the Ziplock bags you assemble the food into was not environmentally friendly. I pointed out that because Dream Dinners buys everything in bulk (spices, dairy, sauces etc) there is less packaging waste. An even trade if you ask me.
For a busy family on the go who want healthy, home cooked meals, this is the place.
