The food was the best in recent memory. Two of us had the wonderful stuffed chicken special. The seafood dish and asada were also amazing.Everyone in our party of 4 loved their meal and decided that this was their new favorite restaurant!! Unique and very tasty!!The ambiance, TOP-NOTCH service and mojitos were all divine as well.
