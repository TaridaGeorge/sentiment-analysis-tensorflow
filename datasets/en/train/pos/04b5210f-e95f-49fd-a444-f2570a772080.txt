Been here several times for dinner and drinks... Food is great, atmosphere is even better. Even more so now that they added the "North bar/lounge" 

Went here today for lunch, the place was very busy but they managed to find us a table quickly. I ordered the Angus burger which was very good! The service was as well. 

The reason I love this place is because it's not defined as being a "happy hour" spot or "lunch" spot... North is a great spot for a quick drink, long lunch or an intimate dinner. It is a well rounded spot for any occasion and I have never been disappointed.
