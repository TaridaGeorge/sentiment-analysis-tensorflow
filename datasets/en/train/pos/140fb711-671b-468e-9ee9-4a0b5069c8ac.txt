From their unique organic teas and fruit juice selections, to their fresh fully stocked salad bar, this place has me SOLD! I'm not usually in the Scottsdale area, so it was a nice surprise to stumble upon this wonderful market and grab a healthy.  I was surprised at how inexpensive it was, and still so fresh! I will definitely be back many a nights before class to indulge on the (did I mention fresh?) Salad bar ;-)
