A friend of mine stayed here while visiting Scottsdale, and I was very impressed! The resort is very hidden and quaint, but it was so nice! I liked how it has a small charm feel and yet it was also was very luxurious! We hung out at the hotel a lot one day and just hung out in the beautiful room and grounds. My friend also had breakfast in the dining room every morning and he said it was excellent. 

If you have friends or family coming to visit I would recommend The Scottsdale resort. It's beautiful and doesn't have the vast cold feeling of most hotels. It's also located in a great part of central Scottsdale! 

I believe he found some deals on hotwire or priceline as well.
