Found out about Cary through a friend of a friend, and I'm glad I did. He is such a great and honest mechanic, you almost want your car to break down. He is friendly, explains the problem thoroughly, has reasonable rates, and gets the job done. He is now my mechanic for all my car work (minus oil changes, as he tends to stay away from doing those).
