There's no better place in Old Town than the Blue Moose for a beer (or several in my case) before and after a Giants Spring Training game.  We hit the Moose on Saturday and we had a blast!  Great people, good bar food and a cutie bartender.  Plus the Giants beat the Dodgers.  What more can a die hard Giants fan ask for?  Love it!
