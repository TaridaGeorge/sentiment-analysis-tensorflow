Amazing!  From the first call to the time the installer left these people were great!   

They installed a dog door through my block wall.  Not even a scratch on the paint or a bit of dust left behind.  (They ever bring their own vacuum cleaner!)

Now my lazy ass doesn't have to get off the couch to let the dog out anymore.   It took my puppy about 2 hours before he figured it out and now he loves freedom.

A little expensive, but it's so worth it.
