Curl up in this cozy, (and by cozy I mean totally and utterly tiny) dark pub with friends, a boddington and a Cornish pasty, preferably of the "thanksgiving dinner" variety. There are of course other amazing Cornish pasty flavors which my Phoenix mates have raved about, which I've yet to try, mainly due to the fact that I live in Los Angeles. I trust their tastes though, so you can believe that everything on the menu is definitely worth a go. The atmosphere takes you right out of the States and puts you smack dab in the middle of London on a misty summer night. A tasty way to stay-cation. Cheers!
