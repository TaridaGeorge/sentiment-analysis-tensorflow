I could not have imagined anything better. I just relocated to AZ and sent an email request for a custom cake with less than 48 hours notice.  I was amazed with what Jennifer had created but even more so it was the BEST cake  I have ever had! The entire family was in heaven. I'm not a cake person however I loved it so much I had a piece for breakfast the next day! You will NOT be disappointed.
