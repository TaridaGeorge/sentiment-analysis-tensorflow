We've made this place a regular monthly stop in for dinner. Service is great, excellent cajun food. We have given up going to Pappadeaux. We prefer sitting at the bar on Friday nights and always get great service. Love their seafood gumbo and ettoufe. The cajun vinagrette dressing they serve is a special favorite of mine. I wish I could buy a bottle! Only disappointment is they are not open on Sundays.
