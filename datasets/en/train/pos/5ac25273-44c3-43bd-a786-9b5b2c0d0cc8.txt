This place is great. There are enough reviews on here that go over the concept and the process of making a good Mongolian bowl. Best advice 1. Pack your bowl with your fist  2. Use at least 5 scoops of sauce  3. Don't forget that there is rice, soup and ice cream still waiting for you after you get your bowl cooked.
