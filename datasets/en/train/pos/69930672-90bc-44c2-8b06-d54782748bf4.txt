Um hello - BEECHERS!  The fact that I can go a mile down the street and pick up a brick of Flagship (and Flagship reserve) just makes my day!  My Seattle cravings have been slightly tempered by the introduction of this fromagerie.  I love that they make their own mozzarella and will be frequenting them quite often.  Thank you so much for bringing us something so amazing to CenPho!  I can't wait to go back.
