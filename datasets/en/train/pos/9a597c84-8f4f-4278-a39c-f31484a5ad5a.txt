Being one of the recently turned lactose-intolerant kind, I'm limited to eating sorbets these days. But man, what an awesome selection at the Geleto Spot for folks like me. Each sorbetto flavor tastes exactly like the fruit. The texture is great and scoop portions are generous. Service is friendly and efficient, offering you a taste of whatever flavor you want. Friends I've taken here have been impressed with their gelatos, so it's definitely a winner for me, especially while slowly disintegrating in the Phoenix summer.

They also have free wi-fi, which I guess is great for anyone who can type and eat ice cream simultaneously.
