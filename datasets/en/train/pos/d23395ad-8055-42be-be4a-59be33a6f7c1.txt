Best.Yelp.Event.Ever. This was amazing. Enough said. But, not really. It deserves more than that. I honestly had such a great time. Not only was the food absolutely delicious - beef short ribs I will be dreaming of you tonight - but the whole experience was tremendous. The staff was great and incredibly friendly and attentive. The wine glasses were never empty. The manager of the restaurant and the general manager of the complex were there and made sure everyone was happy and had a good time. They really know how to put on a good event. I can't wait to go to iPic and try out another one of Tanzy's amazing dishes beforehand.
