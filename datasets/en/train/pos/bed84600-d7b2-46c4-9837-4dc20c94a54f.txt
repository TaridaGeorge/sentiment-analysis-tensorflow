Went here during spring training after a baseball game.  We were a large group but they accommodated us no problem.  The place was very quite at the time.  Unfortunately we were loud and rowdy.  Thinking about it now.  They were very patient with us.
The food was fresh and tasty.  I think we ordered everything on the menu between the nine of us who went.  Everything was awesome.  The owner even came at the end of our meal and did sake shots with us.
And to think my friend told us not to eat sushi in Arizona.  I say "bah".  Yellowtail Sushi is a great place to eat sushi.  Take it from a guy who lives in San Diego and eats sushi at least once a month if not more.  This place is a must if your in the Glendale area.
