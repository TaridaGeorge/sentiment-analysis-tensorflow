Ahh! I went here one day and took a whole 2 hours to go back again! This place was great! I found curtains for my house for a whopping 12 bucks!! (for both panels) And books, games, the whole shebang! Yeah, I agree with Jessica on wanting to save this little secret of mine.. but man oh man! I spent so many hours at antique stores and totally neglected the real deal! Definitely recommended.. or not recommended... if you're going for any size 6s!
