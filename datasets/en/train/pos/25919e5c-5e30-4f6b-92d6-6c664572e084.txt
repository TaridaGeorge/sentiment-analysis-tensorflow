I'm glad I ran into this place, I love the no nonsense approach to chiropractic here. I am already a fan of chiropractic, but have no real back, nerve, or spine issues of note; however, sometimes you just need to get adjusted to keep everything in alignment. Their monthly subscription is perfect for people who want to commit to a monthly arrangement, you can also pay per visit or you can pre-purchase 'X' number of visits for discounted rates.

I woke up with a pinched nerve one day recently, I visited on my lunch break and the immediate pain was taken care, followed up with an adjustment two days later and today I'm back to my normal self!

Happy Yelping Phoenix!
