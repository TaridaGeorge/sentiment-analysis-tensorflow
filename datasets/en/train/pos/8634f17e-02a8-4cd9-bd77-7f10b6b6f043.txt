WOW! This place is amazing! I went for the Lunch Buffet on last Tuesday and was blown away. The food and atmosphere were perfect! The actual restaurant is medium sized with two TV's tuned to Indian favorites (Cricket game & Bollywood Videos, lol). The food was sooo good! I really liked how they served freshly baked Naan bread at each table (your choice of garlic or plain) I'm not sure what the name was for all the food items, my favorite was the Butter Chicken with the Naan- YUM! Nice variety of dishes from mild to spicy and lots of vegetarian choices as well. I'm pretty sure this is the best Indian food restaurant I have been to; I'm certainly coming back soon!
