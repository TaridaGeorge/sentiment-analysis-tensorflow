This has out beat whole foods for sure!!  The quality of food, the variety and the cost you can not beat.  Some of my favorites are the pecan encrusted Salmon, White bean hummus, Goat cheese covered in blueberries, Vintage reserve cheddar cheese, Carne Asada. I Love their Well organic red wine and the Chariot Gypsy Red wine both $4.99!!  Buy them by the case because when they are gone they are gone!  I love their ready made salads as well.  You really cant go wrong in this store!  These are a few of my favorite things:)  And the customer service is 
 A +++++  Also right now a case of fresh organic nectarines $4.99 my kids ate them in 24 hours!
