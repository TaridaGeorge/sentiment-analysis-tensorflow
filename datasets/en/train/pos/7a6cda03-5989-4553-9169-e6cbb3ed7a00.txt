I love this place. It's not just oriental foods, but majority of foods are. Has everything from Indian, to Filipino, to African to European, to Jamaican...ok you get it....close to EVERYTHING that I otherwise would have to look online for. They have a little restaurant just before the main store, not sure if contracted out or theirs, I forgot what I grabbed, either a frappe or a fruit slush, either way I would remember if I it was gross. It wasn't. For those looking for international taste, I highly reccomend this place!!
