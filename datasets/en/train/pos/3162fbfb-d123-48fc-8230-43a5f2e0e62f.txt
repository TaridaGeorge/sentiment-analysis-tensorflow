We moved into our new Richmond American home a month ago and we love it! 
Everything went so smoothly- from sales, to design, to walk-throughs!!
Everyone was just a pleasure to work with! This is our dream home, but if we ever build again, I will definitely be on the lookout for another Richmond American neighborhood!!
