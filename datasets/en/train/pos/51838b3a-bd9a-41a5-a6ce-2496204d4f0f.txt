This is a small indoor play area in the Arcadia area.  I would say it is geared towards children 5 and younger.  It is a very clean place and has a varitey of fun toys for the babes including a small pumped up air jump machine.

They offer a punch card-buy 5 admissions get the sixtth for free or you can buy a year membership for $110-I believe that is what the owner told me.  Each additional child's membership is a little less expensive.

This place is definitely worth checking out if you have small children and want to meet up with friends for a playdate : )
