The rating is because of the gluten-free crust. Anyone who is gluten-free knows pizza is tough to come by. This is my third shot at a gf crust, and it's a ton better than the others. Thin, fairly crispy (not easily done gf) and good. I got the napoli (tomatoes and basil), and they have a bunch of other specialty pies. Very casual and they do slices. A definite pizza stop downtown.
