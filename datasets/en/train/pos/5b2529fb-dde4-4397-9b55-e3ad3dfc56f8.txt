I love this place. We ate there last night for the first time. Had the St. Louis Pork Ribs. Can't say enough about the experience.

... and and where else can you get a shot of whiskey along with a Kona Pipeline Porter chaser for 3 bucks early on a Saturday night.

The staff is excellent, the service is perfect and the ambience is great!! 

Hello? WiFi... ahh ... yes!!
