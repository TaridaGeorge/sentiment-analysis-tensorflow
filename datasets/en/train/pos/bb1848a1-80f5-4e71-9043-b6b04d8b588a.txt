This is a great little place inside the Airport, on the Southwest Airlines side. 
They serve food as a sitdown meal or you can get it to go.
The prices are not that bad at all, remember you are at the restaurant inside the Airport.  If you choose to have Alcohol it may be high in price, but that is why there is a choice.
They are very busy here, non stop. Our waitress, Rachel was great. Even though she had so many tables she was quick and on it. Breakfast was not bad at all.  If i have time the next time i fly, i will visit them again.
