Moda Fina is a great place to shop for jewelry.  It's discounted pricing without the discount feel.  The setting is what you expect from a luxury jeweler, but with a friendly feel.  I frequently come in wearing jeans and tennis shoes and have always been treated with the same care as a celebrity.  I also trust this company with all my repairs.  They do quality work and guarantee their repairs.  No high pressure sales techniques, just an honest desire to help you find what you want at the price you want to spend.  I agree with the previous comment that Steven is the best!  I will continue to drive across town to shop at Moda Fina for all my jewerly needs.  The drive is worth the service and selection!
