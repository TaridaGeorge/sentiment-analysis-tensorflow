This place is excellent.  The food is great, excellent hummus and PROPER pide(pita) bread...for those that have never had real pide bread you don't know what you are missing...you may never have that junk that is passed off as pita bread again.

The doner kebab and the adana kebab were excellent.

Only slight negative is the service from one of the waitresses(desiree, I think) is not the best....she is not very friendly and has an unpleasant attitude.   Fortunately, the food overcomes her attitude.
