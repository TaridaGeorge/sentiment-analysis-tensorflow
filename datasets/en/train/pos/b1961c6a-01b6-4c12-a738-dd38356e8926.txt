This place is a very chill wine bar. Came here after flying in for work and wanted something that would be light, have a good wine selection, and a nice outdoor patio/bar area. Daily Dose fulfills each of those items. 

You MUST get the bruchetta plate. My favorite was the smoked salmon, pesto, and capers and the prosciutto and fig. 4 slices of bruschetta for a single person was too much, but you shouldn't hesitate in bringing along friends. 

I also tried the raspberry chicken salad. Sadly, I was looking for more greens than the chicken pieces. It was still super delicious.

I ended with an affogato. You can never go wrong with this choice and Postino didn't disappoint me!
