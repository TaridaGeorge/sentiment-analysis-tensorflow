I love me some Yucca.  I moved here from Chi City and this was one of the first bars I visited.  I really love it here!  There are great beers, good food, and one of the main reasons why I started going here was to visit with my favorite bartenders!  Truly a great atmosphere.  I love that Yucca always has a variety of shows and there is no scene here, except for the crowds that bands bring in.  Awesome place.
