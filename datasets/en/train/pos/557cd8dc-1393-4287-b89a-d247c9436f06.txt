Since their remodel this Trader Joe's has really stepped up their game. I prefer them over all other grocery stores. I often find myself spending less than I would at say, a Fry's or Safeway, and the quality of the food is much higher. Their staff is always eager to assist, and their in-house chef is always creating new meals that are simple to replicate at home. They have a huge wine selection with a great selection of micro brewed beer. If you haven't been yet I highly recommend them over other grocery stores.
