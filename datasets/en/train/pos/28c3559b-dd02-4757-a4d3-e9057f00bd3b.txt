Honestly one of the best reasons to go to the Farmers Market. 

The good news: The free samples! 

The bad news: The free samples! They have so many varieties, it was near impossible to decide which kind to get. So we kept having to try the samples just to make sure... And then there's the heat to contend with and oh no, the chocolate toffee we just bought is going to melt! 

Oh well, guess we're going to have to eat it right now. Gee. Darn.
