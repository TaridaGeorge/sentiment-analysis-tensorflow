I frequent this spot a lot b/c it's close to my work and a couple of the employees already know me by face and name! My favorite is the buffalo burger but I also love their other exotic meats, ostrich, elk, and wild boar. I still love their regular burgers too! They are probably my favorite burger in the Valley, not far from Johnny Rockets, another favorite! :)
