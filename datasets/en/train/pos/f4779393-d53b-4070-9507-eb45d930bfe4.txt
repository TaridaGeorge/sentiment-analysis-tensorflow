Travis and the team are the best! I have been going there since they opened and honesty is the key to their success! My vehicle is usually done when they estimate it to be done. It is done right, I have never been overcharged, and they are more than fair with their diagnostic charges, which much of the time is $0. 

I have referred friends who couldn't believe a shop could be as good as I say Network is.  So it's nice to get a call from them, raving about how Network saved them from costly, unneeded repairs that other shops swore were necessary.
