I had a turkey sandwich and a fudge sundae.  Mmm mm.  Jerry's is like a good version of Denny's or any of those late night diners.  It was difficult for me to wrap my head around the concept of a 'good' denny's, but their food is actually tastey, their booths are comfortable, it feels like a diner the way it's set up, and they didn't fuck up a sundae.  

Oh and I didn't feel sick or gross after eating there AND I saved half my sandwich for later.  Now that's a level of diner food that is deserving of 5 stars!
