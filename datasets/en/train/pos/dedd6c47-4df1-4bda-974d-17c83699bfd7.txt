Came here yesterday for lunch and for $6.95 I got a HUGE plate of orange chicken with rice and it came with a cream cheese won-ton and egg roll.  I split the plate and actually got 2 meals out of it!  Did I mention the orange chicken was awesome!  It makes Panda Express look like well...Panda Express.  The chicken does not have a huge amount of breading and the orange sauce was delish.  The atmosphere is pretty nice for being in a grocery store strip mall.  It is full service dining or take out and they even deliver.  I highly recommend this place and will going back again soon.
