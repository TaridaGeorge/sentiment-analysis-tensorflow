AMAZING burgers! This place is, hands down, one of THE best burger joints I have ever tried. It's a build-your-own-burger style picking everything from the meat, bun, cheese, 4 toppings and 2 sauces. I recommend the roasted garlic on the burger - I tried it for my first time and loved it. You also get a choice of side with your burger all for exactly $7. No tax either!

We've been there twice the past two weeks and had the same great service from the extremely friendly ladies up front and of course the delicious burgers were just as we expected. We also tried a fish taco today (Fridays only) and that was amazing as well!

In-N-Out who? Five Guys what? Smashburger?? .... Two Hippies are on an entirely different level!!
