I have purchased my past two pairs of running shoes from this store and I have no complaints from either of those experiences.  The employees appear to be very knowledgeable and will help you find the most suitable pair of shoes for your running style and price point.  Although the shoe selection here isn't overwhelming, there is a large enough variety to meet the needs of nearly every runner.  Additionally, I never felt as though I was being pushed into the most expensive pair of shoes; that is reassuring because they carry some pretty expensive kicks.  

Another great aspect of this neighborhood-type shop is that they offer running groups and training advice.  So if you're thinking of entering some races, or curious about ramping up your mileage the employees here are a great resource to tap into.
