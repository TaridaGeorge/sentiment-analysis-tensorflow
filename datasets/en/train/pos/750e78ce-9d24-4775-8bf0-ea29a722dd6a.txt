IKEA is so much fun. It's a little bit of a walk up and down the store but with all the different items on display there is time to sit and relax on the chairs, couches, beds. I love walking around the store looking a new ideas for my own home. They have very good prices on all household items. When shopping for accessories for the house I highly recommend going to IKEA because you are bound to find something. Simple things such as Tupperware, trash cans, bathroom accessories can all be found at a really good price.
