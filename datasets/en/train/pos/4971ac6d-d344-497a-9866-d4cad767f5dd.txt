So I won't lie. I HATED my first Bikram class. I must be a sucker for torture because I came back. Again. And again. Now I am a month into my 2-month Groupon pass and I have attended 28 classes in 35 days and I'm going strong.
The instructors are extremely helpful when I have questions about poses. They are also very understanding concerning modifications I have had to make due to an injury.
The studio has very even heating due to an updated system. I've been told we're spoiled.
Considering going for the 30 classes in 30 days for my second month...
