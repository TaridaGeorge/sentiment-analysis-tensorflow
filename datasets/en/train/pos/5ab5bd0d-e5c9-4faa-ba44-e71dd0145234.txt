Big fan of the Gyro Picada salad, have it all the time. I'm on a moderate carb diet (less than 120 carbs) and the Pita is one of the 3 things i reserve my carb-space for.  It comes with a healthy serving along with the salad. I eat there at least twice a week.  Great food and awesome service. Ask for Angela, she's absolutely wonderful!
