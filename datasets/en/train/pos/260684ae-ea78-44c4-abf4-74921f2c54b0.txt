I could spend hours here, and I do! I inform all of my friends of the majestic jewel this park is. 

The Rio Salado Habitat Restoration is EXACTLY what this city needs. It's a collaboration of avian culture, preseveration of the fragile river ecosystem, an abundance of plants, wildlife, and water, and a large city park in south of downtown. 

It's also cooler down here. During the Summer, coming here is a retreat. The shade from the lush greenery, and the cool air projected from the numerous ponds and bodies of water make it a delight. I wish more people knew about it- or would grow the balls to park their cars in South Phoenix. I live in Scottsdale, and it's ALWAYS worth the drive.
