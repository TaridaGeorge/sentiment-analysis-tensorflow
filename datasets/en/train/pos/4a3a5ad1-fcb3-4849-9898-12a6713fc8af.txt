Decided to try out Eastwind after a couple friends and I had seen it was open last month.

Recently, I have been addicted to Teharu as it has a similar conveyer belt system but after trying out Eastwind I highly doubt I will be going back to Teharu!

The presentation of the sushi was fantastic!  The Rainbow Roll actually looked edible compared to Teharu's.  In general, they had much higher quality fish compared to the aforementioned sushi joint.

Overall, if you're hungry for a quick bite of sushi, I'd definitely try this place out!

I'll be back!
