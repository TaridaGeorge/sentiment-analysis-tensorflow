Local owned coffee place where the coffee is excellent and the food is delicious. The cookies are a thing to behold and you wont be disappointed. You also can't miss with the paninis. K enjoys the delicious non-coffee options such as the lemonade which is freshly squeezed and excellent. I believe everything is made from scratch or close to home: from roasting of the coffee to the homemade whipped cream. Chances are the owner is the guy making your coffee which is a pleasant change from ordinary places. The staff are genuine and just very nice. There is definitely a reason why I am there every day.
