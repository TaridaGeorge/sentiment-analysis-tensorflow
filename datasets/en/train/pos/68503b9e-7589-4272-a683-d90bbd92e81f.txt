What an incredible experience.  They sit you at a counter, overlooking the kitchen, watching chef Juan do his magic.  For $65  you get a great four course meal, a shot of good tequila and 3 nice wines to go with the  wonderful food.  It's called the "Wine Me Dine Me"  Not only that, I mentioned that the ceviche looked really good.  Even though it wasn't on our menu, he whipped up a small plate for me.  Terrific.  We had a running conversation with the chefs and learned all about their backgrounds.  All in all, one of our favorite dining experiences.
