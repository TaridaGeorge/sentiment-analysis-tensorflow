This show was fantastic. I highly recommend it to everyone. It was act after act of pure enjoyment. The price of the ticket was a huge value for what we saw. If you are going to see the show, this is defiantly one you don't want to go cheap on the tickets.

I didn't follow the whole storyline but I really wasn't there for the story. I wanted to see the acts that the performers did. Wow! Was it worth it. Just when you thought an act couldn't be topped, another performance outdid the previous one.

The clowns that did perform between the acts were pretty funny and did keep you laughing throughout the show.

I saw Mystere in Las Vegas and felt that this was better. 

Don't miss this opportunity to see it while they are here.
