Every once in awhile when I have time, I like to stop for coffee at Tammie Coe Cake Shop on Roosevelt St. in Phoenix. The other day I decided to get a muffin to go with my coffee. What a great decision!! It was the blackberry honey bran muffin and probably the best muffin I've ever had!! I've also had brownies & other sweets there that are really good too.
