When I draw a blank for date night, it seems the Improv always ends up working out. 
LOVE that they have a dinner menu/show, and a late night option. I love options!
I think the best part of the show is how accessible the comedians are. The second or third time I went, I saw Tom Wilson (who played BIFF in back to the future) and he was great, and signed my trilogy set.  We got to chat before the show and bought his stand-up CD. 
Another time, we saw Jamie Kennedy (who is MUCH funnier than you'd think) and were able to see him after the show as well.

I LOVE the Improv!
