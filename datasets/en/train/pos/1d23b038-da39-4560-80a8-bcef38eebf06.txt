This is a real gem in Old Town Scottsdale. Perfect for an intimate date or hanging out with friends to chatter. The perfect place to start or end an evening... 

Very charming and intimate, lots of nice regulars (me included), tables and a cute fireplace outdoors, smoking-friendly patio, another private upstairs patio too.

Great Martinis and mixed drinks! If "Kevin" is working: he'll give you a discount if you mention his "fabulous roller blading skills"...  :)

(located just east of Main and Brown on the sidewalk)



*UPDATE* 2009 - now called Brackin's Bar it is just as cool!!!
