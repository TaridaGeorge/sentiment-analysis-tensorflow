RNR! Thank you so much for making sure my birthday happy hour went off without a hitch. To making sure I had reserved tables, to separate checks, to EVERYTHING! I am so very appreciative of the entire staff and everything you did to make sure it was seamless. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!
