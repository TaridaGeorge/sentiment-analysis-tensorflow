Jam is Shauna, and Shauna is Jam. This fun and funky little shop is a fiery ball of good karma, energy, and bliss. At its core, it's both a boutique with girly, lacy, frilly, funky, fun, and even sometimes a little edgy stuff. It's also a space for classes from the crafty to the kitchen kind.

And yet--it somehow seems like it's greater than the sum of its parts. When you start with an adorable old home and add the flavah of owner Shauna, you get a place where friends come to drink wine, where strangers come to be friends, and where the unbeliever comes to believe.

It won't be everyone's cup of tea. Some people just won't get it, but to those who open their eyes, embrace the energy, and want to find somewhere truly off the beaten path Jam is certainly that place.
