By far THE BEST sushi in AZ! Not much by way of atmosphere. It's clean and traditional in its decor but not only is the waitstaff terrific but the fish just melts in  your mouth. I actually go at least 2 or 3 days a week and most of the time by myself after a workout. I sit at the bar and Hiro (the owner) takes good care of me! Prices are reasonable for sushi and the salad dressing is the best EVER and I am a sushi-a-saurus!
