Dr. Kim is wonderful.  She was kind and compassionate and really took the time to listen to my concerns.  I picked her because I wanted to be have my skin exam by a woman - and I am really glad that I did!  I appreciate her honesty - she gave me recommendations for over the counter products which were affordable and have helped a lot with my skin.  It is great to finally find a good dermatologist.
