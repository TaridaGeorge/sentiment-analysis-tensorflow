This is one of my favorite places in all of Phoenix. Food is incredible. Atmosphere is great- tons of sports memorabilia and autographs of the celebrities and athletes who have dined here. 
Apps very good. We had onion strings and spinach/artichoke dip. Ribs are amazing- get them "Don's way" (charred and no extra sauce)
This is the place I take my out of town guests for a fun, casual, great meal and conversation.
