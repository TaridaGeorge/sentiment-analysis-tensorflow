this place ROCKS! my bro's friend owns it and we had the pleasure of stopping by before our flight out of phoenix airport. sushi chef and owner, rich cho aka "roll-meister", uses fresh ingredients and creates mouth-watering inventive rolls. we didn't order off the menu and just let him prepare the rolls for us. my favorite was the spicy tuna stuffed in jalapeno's. YUMMY!!!! *drool*...he seriously dominates all the other sushi joints in the area (probably because he's from the bay and we know what good food is)! he even mentioned how being a sushi chef = psychologist to those sitting at the sushi bar...so true! 

cute tidbit: the regulars they get their own real chopsticks (not disposable) and is brought out when they come in. 

if you're in the area....this place is a must!
