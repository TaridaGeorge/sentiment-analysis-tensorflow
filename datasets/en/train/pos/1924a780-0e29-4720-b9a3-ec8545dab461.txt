This place is amazing. Great selection and also a lot of rare finds. They are doing something right because it seems like they've been open forever. Hollywood Video is gone and Blockblusters have been shutting down left and right and these guys continue to prosper.

      Its one of the few places you can still rent a video game console by the hour and they sell and rent adult films if you're in to that.

     I'm really glad to have an independent video rental place really close to home :]
