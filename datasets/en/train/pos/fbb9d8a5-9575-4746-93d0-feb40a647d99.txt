I love the drive in. We turn up the stereo and climb up on the hood of the car just like when we were kids. You can bring your own popcorn, snacks, drinks: you're not limited to the crap they sell for 5 bucks a pop at the concession stand in normal movie theaters. Tuesday nights are "Family" nights it's only $4.50 a person! What a bargain!!!
