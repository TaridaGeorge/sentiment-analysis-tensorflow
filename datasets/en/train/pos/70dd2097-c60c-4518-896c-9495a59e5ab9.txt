It's hard to wax poetic on Tammie Coe when everyone has already said what needs to be said. 

The Ooey Gooey cupcakes are outstanding as are the stunningly designed fondant cakes (for a pretty penny).  But I will add that the sandwiches they serve during the day are delicious as are the slider they serve come First Friday nights.  

What a concept...Produce easy-to-grab-and-go sliders ($2.50 each I think) for people walking down Roosevelt.  It's nice to see businesses react to consumer needs like that.   I tried the Cuban, which was ok, but it lacked the roasted pork that also goes in it.  It was still good, but not as tasty as the muffaleta.  

This is my pick for food on a First Friday night.  Just order 2 -3 of these and continue walking to the galleries down the road.
