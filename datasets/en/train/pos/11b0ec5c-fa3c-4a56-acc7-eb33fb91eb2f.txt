Oh wow!

Stop what you're doing right now. Just stop. Walk away. Get in your car and drive to Sweet Republic and order a Toffee Bonafi sundae. It will blow your mind.

Best. Sundae. I. Have. Ever. Eaten.

The contrast of flavors and textures...the salty sweet caramel...the crunchy toffee...the decadently rich ice cream...*drool*...this may be the best sundae you've ever eaten too.
