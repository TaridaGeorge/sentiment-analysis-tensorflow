Great store.  I remember back when it was  Smitty's Big Towne #7.  The company changed ownership several times over the past 30 years.  It picked up the "MarketPlace" name when it was a Fred Meyer MarketPlace.  When Kroger bought FM, it was rebranded Fry's MarketPlace.  

It's clean, always well stocked, the best produce of any store near it (except Sprouts @ Southern/McClintock) Maybe someday they may convert it to a Signature Marketplace.
