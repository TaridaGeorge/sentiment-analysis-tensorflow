Cool place, just wish I had been coming here more often.      It's in an old house so it has that cool "old school downtown" vibe about it. 

Pretty healthy menu items with funny names that you'll be sure to remember, like Cheech and Dijon Chicken, The Very Brady Clubster,Teriyaki 90210, Gringo Star, In Like Fin, Rocky VII, The Veggie Jackson, and Bird Is The Word , just to name a few.

I had the Prince of Thai which I really enjoyed. Just spicy enough for my tastes. I tried the pasta salad as a side and was impressed that it wasn't oily or had too much useless stuff on it, simple is good.  At $6.95 I thought it was a heck of a lot better than a drive through or a sub sandwich.

I'll be back soon to try one of everything on their menu!
