So far one of the best Asian Sushi buffets I've been to since I moved to Arizona. It's the CLEANEST and the service is much better than others buffets in the Valley.

The restaurant is fairly big, so definitely great for large groups. They have a selection of Sushi Rolls, Sashimi (Salmon, White Tuna, Tuna, Octopus) and a small hibachi station. The also have a fresh salad corner with Romaine and Iceberg lettuce with other veggie toppings. The chinese food selection was great too including prime rib!

I would say the dessert selection was the best. They have ice cream (with a lady ready to scoop for you with a smile!) and individual served cakes (red velvet, chocolate and a couple of asian pastries)

For dinner $19.99 not a bad price! Plenty of parking too!

I had a $5 off coupon for checking in on google places.
