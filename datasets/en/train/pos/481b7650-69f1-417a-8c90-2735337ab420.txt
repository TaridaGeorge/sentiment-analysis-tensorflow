I've been to this location and the mesa location over a dozen times. The first time I had "a lovely bit of salmon"...it was amazing. The second time I had the pepper steak, which was also amazing...but let's face it beef is easy. So every other time I've been I have "a lovely bit of salmon" because there's just no place on earth that does salmon better.

I went so far as to bring adults (people over 45) with me one time. They loved it too; even though I have to admit it's a bit noisy and young-ish in the atmosphere....but not too young. ~I know all the songs playing, but many of them are older than I am.
