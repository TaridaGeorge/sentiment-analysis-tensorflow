After searching Yelp for a great Tailor in Phoenix, I couldn't pass Valentina's specifically based on her reviews alone. I have gone to her shop about 3 times and have recommended her to friends. None of us have ever been let down. She is the best in town, friendly, priced well and has a fast turnaround. She even fixed a tear in my chiffon dress which I thought would end up ruining the entire dress. The dress is as good as new. Thanks, Valentina!
