I like to make my review short and simple.  Get off your computer, get in your car, turn the air conditioner on, drive down (or up ) to switch and leave the rest of the work to the fabulous chef and other great people who work there.  Seriously, The lamb appetizer did this little happy dance in my mouth.  My daughter and I both enjoyed different salads.
My daughter had TWO Sangria's, and loved them both.  The waiter was tons of fun.  The place was moderately busy but, the one very hysterical waiter had it under control and he let us know it.  Yep, I love to switch!
