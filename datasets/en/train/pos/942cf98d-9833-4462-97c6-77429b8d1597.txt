Great stadium to watch spring training.
Parking is ample, is paved, and is easy in and out.
All of the seats seemed to be good seats.
The concessions are nicely situated.  This stadium also has very good coverage of people selling beer and snacks at the seats.
The prices are not as ridiculous as I had expected (only $6 for a draft beer).
The bathrooms are large and surprisingly clean.
