I love Haji-Baba more than words can say. The food is cheap and delicous. Their iced tea is AMAZING (the best I've ever had, and I only drink iced tea and water 99% of the time)! The hummus is to die for. The pitas they make in house are fresh and delicious. 

I have yet to find a place as yummy as this anywhere else in the Phoenix area (or even in Seattle where I live now), and the low prices make it that much more awesome!
