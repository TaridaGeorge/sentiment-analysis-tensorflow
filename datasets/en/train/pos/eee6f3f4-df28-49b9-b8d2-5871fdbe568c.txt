Recently, I had the VI Peel to help with my melasma and pigmentation.  Jennifer, the aesthetician was extraordinarily warm, gentle, and communicative about how the procedure would help with my problem areas.  I would highly recommend Adam and Eve for any medical aesthetic needs.  From the staff to the clinic itself, in every way imaginable, this place makes you feel like a VIP.  Once the procedure is over, you are left looking and feeling like a movie star.
