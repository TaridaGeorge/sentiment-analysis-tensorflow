I recently moved to the neighborhood, and I am so excited to live down the road from this place. I've had two breakfasts there already, and both were delicious. And the organic/local ingredients make it all even better. The iced coffee is quite good, too--a welcome alternative to the Starbucks down the block 

Addendum: Went back for lunch yesterday, and I can heartily recommend both the chicken salad sandwich and the macarons. The latter were incredible!
