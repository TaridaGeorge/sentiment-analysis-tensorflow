What can I say that everyone else has not already confirmed. This place is great!!!!

Its always hard to fine Billecart-Salmon Champagne in the valley, especially at a good price.  Total wine was selling them at eighty seven a bottle, unbelievable!!!  Excellent selection of each wine category. 

Very nice staff, lines were moving at the checkout, five stars all around!!
