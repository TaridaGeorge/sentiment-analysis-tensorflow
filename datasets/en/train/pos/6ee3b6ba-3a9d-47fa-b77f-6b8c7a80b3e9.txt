I moved to AZ about 4 years ago and for the first couple of years I would fly back to TX to get my dental work done, because it is HARD to find a good dentist!  So after much research I found Dr.Miller at Aesthetic Dentistry and I am so happy I did.  The entire office staff is so friendly!  The hygienist takes her time with you and is very thorough and gentle.  Dr. Miller filled my cavity and when he gave me the injection to numb my gum I could barely feel it at all!  Which is good because I'm a sissy about needles.  The office is extremely nice and I can't stress enough how friendly and comfortable they make you feel.
