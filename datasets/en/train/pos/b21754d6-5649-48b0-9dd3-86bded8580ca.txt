Thank GOODNESS they finally started a HH!  It was getting insane to pay $18/martini - esp. in a group - and we were always paying!

This is the BEST little bar to start - or end - an perfect eve.  Want a fantastic & romantic sunset? Presto!  This is it.  Talk about "impress your passenger" with the amzaing drive up - they will wonder what you are "UP" to.  Valet is there in an instant to meet your needs.  

I like walking down the steps, but instead of walking straight in, I detour to the right, which offers the pristine views.  You also can provide the option of "shall we sit out here, or in?"

The place is really small & intimate - in and out - so be prepared for that, as it can be quite popular.

I will absolutly be back - again.
