All i wanted was a little mu shu.. but boy was i surprised at the large portions, the dish i ordered was the Spicy Mu Shu Burrito with Chicken and Beef with Fried Rice.. yeah i paid a little bit extra to get the combination of meats, but to me it is worth it..  The flavors are so unique and satisfying that i wish i could finish two.
