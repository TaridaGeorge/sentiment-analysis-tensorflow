Dr. Bader and her staff provide outstanding service and professionalism. She is definitely the best dentist I have had in my 30 years as an adult. The staff are always friendly and genuinely helpful. Every experience I've had with this office has left me feeling like I was treated and cared for as a person, not just a number or a patient. Their office also offers orthodontic care a couple days a week through visits by Dr. Shawn Bader. My son had his orthodontia from him, and our experience was equally positive.
