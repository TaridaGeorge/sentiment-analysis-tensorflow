Oh. My. God. Holy crap this was wonderful! Better than I expected by a million. The BF and I shared a salted caramel and it was perfect! The salty and the sweet together were an amazing combo and the texture was wonderful. It was even refreshing on a hot day... which I didn't think it would be. I want this again... like right now.
