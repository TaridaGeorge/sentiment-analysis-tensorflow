I just have to say, this Fascinations is awesome!!!  In comparison to other Fascinations & Castle Boutique, this deserves to be in N. Scottsdale (haha)   ;-)
VERY clean, tidy, non-offensive & the gals working there didn't give me the heebeejeebee's!  Nor did any of the other customers that came in!
Also, all the expensive higher end 'products' weren't locked up behind glass cases so you could actually look with your hands & not JUST your eyes, now isn't that fun!?!

I hope it get's enough business so it will stay, because if I move, I will drive to this location over any others!
