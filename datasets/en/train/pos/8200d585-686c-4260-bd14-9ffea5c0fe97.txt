One of the better airports I've been to. It's never busy traffic wise. easy to get dropped off, and easy to pick people up. The directions make sense, it's easy to loop around, and the officer people don't scream at you to keep moving.

There are a good amount of restaurants and shops in all the terminals and there is free WiFi everywhere. The only downfall is that the people who come in and out of this airport are...older...and security takes way longer than it should. I'm not going to knock a star off for that cause it's not the airports fault...but would it be illegal to have different lines for the senior citizens?!
