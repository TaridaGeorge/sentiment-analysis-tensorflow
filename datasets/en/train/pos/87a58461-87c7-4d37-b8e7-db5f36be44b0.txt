In my first review, I indicated I would give this place another chance.  So glad I did!  After a concert Thursday night, we decided to stop in here for a late night drink.  It was pretty late, so not much of a crowd.  The lights were dim, the atmosphere was cozy, and I was happy to see an interesting tap selection.  I had some kind of pale ale by Anchor Steam, and it was yummy.  While I hadn't intended to eat anything, I saw the late night menu and had to try the hummus plate. Best part?  The sweet pickled baby cucumbers. Just like my mom makes!  Bartenders were knowledgable and attentive, crowd was mellow,  it was a romantic way to end our night out, and our last night for this trip to Scottsdale.  Couldn't have been better!
