This place is AMAZING. we order lunch from here all the time at work and they have NEVER gotten our order wrong. Even with special instructions. The food is always fresh and good quality (and this is coming from somebody who is REALLY picky about the quality of the meat that I eat). They cook their vegetables to perfection. Their lunch specials are such a great deal.
