I went to see Erica (hopefully I spelled that correctly) at this place.  She had me run on the treadmill and gave me good detailed information on the type of shoe I needed to have the best possible running experience.  So far I have felt great with the shoes she recommended.

I am training for a half marathon so I'm not a "runner" and I don't have much experience but I can't imagine how anyone could find this place lacking in running apparel or shoes, etc.  I recommend wholeheartedly.
