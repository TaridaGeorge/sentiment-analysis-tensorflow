Let's start at the top, the drinks are outstanding.  There's no other place to get a 24ish ounce jar of Old Fashioned that was perfect for two people, and not just the volume was impressive, the drink itself was top notch.  Followed by some cranberry drink with enough vodka to knock out a horse, but tasted like I was drinking straight juice, very well done.  For food we ordered three items off the menu, all were good, but the surprising star in the food category was the home made chips.  No doubt I will be back.
