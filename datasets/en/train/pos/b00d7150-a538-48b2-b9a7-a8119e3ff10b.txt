Churn is great!  

The space is adorably decorated with bright colors, argyle wall-paintings and toys and penny-candy.  But, really the ice-cream is the star of the show here.  $4 for an ice cream sandwich with homemade cookies and a generous helping of ice cream?  Yes, please.  Once you try the Belgian Chocolate ice cream in a pretzel cone, it will make you want sweet/salty combinations forever.   

The punch-cards here only require you to buy five scoops (OR coffee drinks) before you get a free one.  The addition of two parking spaces out front for drop-in parking is a major plus. 

So, yeah.  Churn for President.
