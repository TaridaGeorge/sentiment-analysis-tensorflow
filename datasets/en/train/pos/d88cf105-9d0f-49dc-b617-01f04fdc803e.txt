Although different than the traditional coffee shop, cartel, is arguably the best coffee shop downtown. They take more time making each cup, and thus the quality is increased but the wait is also increased. I would wager that as cartel grows in popularity the wait will become unbearable, much like Matt's big (slow) breakfast.
