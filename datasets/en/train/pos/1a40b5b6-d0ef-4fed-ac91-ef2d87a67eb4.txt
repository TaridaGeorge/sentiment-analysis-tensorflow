I love this place...especially on the water at Lake Pleasant...foor is great, service is great the view is awesome!

I have had the pulled pork with the sweet heat sauce and steak fries! Perfect meal.

The staff is generally a younger staff but they appear to like working on the dock of the bay. They have always been great. 

I did try the potato salad and being picky it passed my tests. I prefer the mustard, mayo, pickles type not a sweet kind. :)
