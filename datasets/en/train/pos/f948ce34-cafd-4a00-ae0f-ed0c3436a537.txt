I visited the new store to get rid of Vista and get Windows 2007.Josh ,a computer genius ,who is nice to people too ,is so great.
While there ,I also  bought the cutest Mini from Evelyn.I wanted pink but took 3d white instead.She was very knowledgeable and took time to review my options.She went out of her way to set it up for me .I even got help carrying everything to my car.I can't wait to go back to one of their classes.  Not that any of you care ,but this could be a good pick up place as well.
