Michael just left. This company is great. I ordered 4 small sun screens for my front door. OMG, what a difference, especially with the heat starting. I also got a new screen for a window and a new sliding patio screen. They were here on time and did a great job. They even had to make modifications to the handle on the screen door. I would definitely recommend them. Other companies will do this stuff on the spot, big deal if you have to wait a week for quality. They were also cheaper than the other companies I looked into. I wiill be using them again.
