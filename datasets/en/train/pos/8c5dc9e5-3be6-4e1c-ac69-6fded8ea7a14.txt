As a culinary industry employee/baked goods enthusiast, I have to say that I really dig this little gem.  They have everything you could need for baking that perfect cake, cookie, candy, chocolate, etc.  They have decorations, edible glitters, sprinkles, cake toppers, utensils, cake sheets, food coloring, helpful staff, classes and more!  I love coming in here and just walking around to try and get ideas.  They can be a tad pricey but it's worth checking out.  I even found rose water here when I was making a chocolate cake and wanted to make a vanilla bean/rose frosting!! Yay cakes!
