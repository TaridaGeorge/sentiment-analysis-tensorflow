While I mourn the passing of Fate, which for 7 years was my answer to "where to take the out-of-towners to prove that Phoenix can hang with urban hipsters", I'm somewhat consoled by Johnny Chu's new adventure at Sens.  

In addition to tapas that rocks the presentation in an atmosphere that is pretty hip without being another intimidation-machine - the food is just fantastic.  My boyfriend and I opted for the fixed price menu on New Years and after the first 2 courses, my toes began to curl when I saw someone headed our way with a plate.  Johnny does things with halibut that are the culinary equivalent of porn.  *homer drool*
