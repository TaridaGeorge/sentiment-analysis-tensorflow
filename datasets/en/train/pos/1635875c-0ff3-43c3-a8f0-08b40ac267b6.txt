The only reason to go to this (or any) Whole Foods - and the 5 star review - is for their delicious MARY'S AIR COOLED CHICKEN in the butcher department, and HONEYMOON SWEETS at their bakery. 

All other items are a rip-off and anyone with a brain would buy at Safeway, instead, and warrant a 1 star rating.

The chicken - Mary's Air Cooled fresh chicken - and Honeymoon Sweets, are unparalelled anywhere in America for fresh chicken and pastries and mini desserts.
