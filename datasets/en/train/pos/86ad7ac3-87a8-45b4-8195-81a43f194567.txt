It's super easy to travel to and from Sky Harbor International Airport.  It really is America's friendliest airport.  I travel a lot through this airport and I am very happy with it.

Baggage claim is consistently fast.  And I've never had trouble with parking in the economy lot and using the shuttle.

Free wi-fi is awesome.

Pretty good shops and restaurants inside.
