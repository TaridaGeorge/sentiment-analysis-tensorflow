Best secret ever! This theater is so convenient and nice. While its not the easiest to find, once you're inside it is first class. The prices are the lowest around and everthing is brand new.

Definately give this a try the next time you're doing dinner and a movie. Now that PV mall has Oregano's, Chipotle, and Culvers in the parking lot it is a great date spot.
