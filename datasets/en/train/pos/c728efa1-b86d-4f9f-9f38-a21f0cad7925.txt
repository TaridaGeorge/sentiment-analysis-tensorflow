We often frequent the Four Seasons Scottsdale, and always make a point of dining at Talavera. In addition to the great ambiance and gorgeous views, the food and service are sensational. The steaks and seafood are prepared to perfection, and their wine list is second to none. The chefs (Mel and Jesse) do a great job with creativity and quality. In addition to the food, Talavera is a special place because of the people that work there. Susan is our favorite food server of all time, and she is an absolute joy to talk with. She anticipates our every need. If Susan has the night off, ask for Penny or any of the other food servers as they all do a great job. Whether it's a special occasion or simply a night out, Talavera is a great experience.
