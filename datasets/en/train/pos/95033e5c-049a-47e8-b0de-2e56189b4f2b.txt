Being a very experienced pho eater, I must say that the pho at the BlueMoon is excellent!  That, plus the pho is 50% off, so that must have added to my utility.  Veggies were fresh and the service friendly.  Oh, and the appetizer came out only a minute after ordering.  Meal was hot and came out just as we finished the appetizer.

Spent a total of $13.61 (including tax) for (2) large bowls of pho, a Thai ice tea and a order of fresh spring rolls.  Our bellies were stuffed and wallets intact.

Will eat here again!
