Delicous pasties and great beer selection! They will make vegan pasties too if you call ahead of time to order.... What more could you ask for?! I email them asking if they have vegan options and this was the response (I hope they don't mind me posting this): 

"Yes we can make vegan pasties with your choice of ingredients chosen from any of our vegan ingredients in the menu, or we can come up with a surprise pasty from one of our cooks...? Please just call the store of choice an hour and a half before you wish to eat." 

Loving this place!
