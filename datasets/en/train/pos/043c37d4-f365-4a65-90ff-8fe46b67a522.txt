I love how one review of this place was deducted stars cause people were smoking outside.  Duh!  It's a bar in Tempe.  People have a tendency to smoke while drinking at a concert.  Get over it!

I love this place.  I've been twice on Thursday night to see this amazing Grateful Dead cover band called Xtra Ticket.  They play there every Thursday night at 9:10pm.  

What's great is before 9:10pm drinks are two for one.  Usually we stock up.  The sound is AMAZING here.  AMAZING.  The staff has always been more than nice.  Typically going out of their way to be friendly.  

Drinks are cheap.  Good beer for cheap = winner!
