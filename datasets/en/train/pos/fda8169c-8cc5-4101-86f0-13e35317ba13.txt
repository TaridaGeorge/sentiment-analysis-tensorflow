It's been over 10 years since I've become a vegetarian &amp; had Pho. My mom &amp; I were in town for a short getaway &amp; I am so thankful to have found this restaurant. Talk about LOVING!??? We started off with the wonderful lentil soup (on the house no less) and then went on to the spring rolls (gone in 60 seconds!). My soup was better than I remembered &amp; from the silence across from me, my mom's BBQ Vermicelli was excellent as well. We spoke to one of the women behind this restaurant &amp; she was so gracious and happy to see our bellies full of love. I swear it felt like this place changed me from the inside out &amp; I needed it. I hope they come to Chicago very soon, we need some LOVE here too!
