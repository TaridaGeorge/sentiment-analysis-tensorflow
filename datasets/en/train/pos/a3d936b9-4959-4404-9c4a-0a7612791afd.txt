Finally! These past few months I have been going to a different nail salon every 2 weeks looking for the right atmosphere, quick and friendly service and most of all, acrylic nails that DON'T LIFT! I have found my new place and it is such a relief. My nails are over a week old and are still beautiful, which is a huge deal for me since every other place I've gone have given me sloppy, uneven nails that lift off in about a week.
