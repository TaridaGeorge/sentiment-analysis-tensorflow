Wow...  fantastic food.  The Chef does an amazing job utilizing local produce for (almost) all the dishes.  
I have been several times over the last month and have yet to try anything on the menu that was not outstanding.  
So far my favorites are the roasted vegetable appetizer, and the amazing smoked brisket.
Next on my list is to try their daily homemade pasta.  Each of the last two times there others in our party ordered it before I got a chance to, so I picked something else to try.

With the weather getting so nice the outdoor patio seating is going to fantastic too.
Make reservations on Friday and Saturday night.  Other nights walking in has been fine.
