This is the second time I visited Scrap Happy Sisters while visiting from Chicago.Although they have oodles of wonderful product and amazing classes,I believe their real gift is a love of their customers/ friends and of making an array of beautiful art.The owner was so generous with her time, help,and hospitality, I felt welcome all four days I scrapped there. As if that wasn't enough, two other women,Margaret and Sue were great company too!  Sue even gave me a lesson on a project she did that I had been admiring! If you are in the area don't miss this gem.
Thank you so much for making my visit areal pleasure,see you next year!
