One of my all time favorite restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale. The rotisserie chicken is wonderful, but what brings me back every time is their AMAZING Macho Salad. I dream about this salad, find myself craving this salad several times a week...and not living in Scottsdale this sucks (although just found out they are a chain and I can now go to the one in Orange County, CA. Yay).

I also recommend the skillet cornbread, it's VERY good! The wine & beer lists are really good too. Only thing on the menu that ever disappointed was the mashed potatoes, who the hell puts cauliflower in mashed potatoes?! LOL
