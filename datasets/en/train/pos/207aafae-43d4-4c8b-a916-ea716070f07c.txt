Tracks In Wax has been a landmark here in Phoenix, and it was just today that I found out of Dennis' passing.

I spent many a day hanging out in this store when I was went to high school down the road. Admittedly, most of the time I chose hanging out at Tracks instead of making my mid morning English class.

I learned a majority of my early music knowledge thanks to those many days at Tracks.

Stopped in today, filled with nostalgia and didn't leave empty handed.

RIP Dennis.
