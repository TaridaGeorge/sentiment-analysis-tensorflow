I love La Grande, they have made improvements to their eatery and their pizza is awesome. Love all the cheeses and wines and pesto in their market. The setting is great in a neighborhood instead of some busy transit street. Parking can be difficult but as in any place, go at the right time and be patient, someone is bound to leave soon so you can park. I give it all Fingers up!
