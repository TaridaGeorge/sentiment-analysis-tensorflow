This is Phoenix' sacred mountain; a prestigious namesake for numerous surrounding areas and businesses. This is perhaps one of the greatest landmarks in the city and is, in a sense, a geological addition to the skyline. It's noticeable from the air upon arrival or departure into Sky Harbor, sitting north of the flight path. Whether or not you hike it, you will notice it as it is visible from most parts of the Valley. You may also notice it change colors throughout the day. It's a simultaneous "must-see" and "can't-help-but-see" attraction in Phoenix.
