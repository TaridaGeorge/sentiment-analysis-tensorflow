This fabulous restaurant is tucked into a corner of a shopping center just off of Bell Road.  Once inside, the decor is inspiring and the waitstaff personable.  The food, from appetizer to dessert, exquisite!  The spices in each dish were well balanced and unique.  While enjoying dinner, plans were already being made to share this place with others.  It is just too good to keep to yourself.
