Excellent food.  The flavors and combinations that Chef Silvana puts together are unique and really tasty.  Our favorite waiter is Hugo so ask to sit at his table.  Be prepared to wait and know that it is completely worth it.  If you need to use the restroom just be prepared for a unique experience.  To describe it here would take away from the experience.  Again the food is the best gourmet Mexican I. Town and the tequila selection is incredible.  Enjoy!!!
