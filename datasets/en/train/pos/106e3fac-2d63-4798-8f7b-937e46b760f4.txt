Wow, I have been meaning to come here for a while now.  I followed Joel L. recommendation and had the chicken souvlaki with salad, we also had falafels, hummus, tzaziki, gyro and the twins had chicken tenders.  Everything was delicious and enormous, we had so many leftovers to take home with us.  The flavor of the chicken was perfect.  I tasted a portion without any condiments or extras, just to check the flavor of the chicken and it was delicious, perfectly marinated and cooked.  Unfortunately this place is about 25 miles from my house.  I wish they were closer, I love greek  and middle eastern food.
