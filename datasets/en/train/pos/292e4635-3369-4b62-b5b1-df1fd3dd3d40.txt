I had to go with 5 stars...I'm SOOOO picky and this place hit all my sweet spots. Awesome local owner...fresh ingredients...no chemicals or MSG....authentic and just really, really good and the price point is right on too. I had #4 Pho and veggie spring rolls and we shared the fried rice. Yum Yum Yum! We will be back.
