My boyfriend and I went here on a double date last week...

DELICIOUS DELICIOUS DELICIOUS!! Food is wonderful.
COCKTAILS ARE FABULOUS!!
AMBIANCE IS FABULOUS!
SERVICE IS BEST IN TOWN (Sit in Tracy's section she is the best server any of  us had EVER had).
I cant say enough good things about our experience.
