I have never given a pizza place five stars.  My lovely bride met up with Tim and Sarah and their two teenagers at Pizza Bianco on a Thursday night.  A table for six required a 45-minute wait in Bar Bianco.  It was well worth it.  Given there were six of us, we ordered five pies:  Margherita, Rosa, Sonny Boy, Biancoverde, and Wise Guy.  Okay, I hate to admit it, but they were the best pizzas we've ever had, bar none.  I recommend the Rosa and my wife likes the Wise Guy.  This place is stellar.
