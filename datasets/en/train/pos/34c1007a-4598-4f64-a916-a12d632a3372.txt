This place is amazing. I love their food and I love their service. The staff are so friendly, they come over and chat with us every time we eat there. They reccommend new thigs for us to try and it's always so delicious that I can't stop eating. It is by far the best Indian food you can get in the area. Try the spinach fritters and the mango lahssi drink(don't know how it is spelled, sorry). The prices are also very reasonable.

The atmosphere is also nice and there is a Sunday brunch whic is decent. The brunch food is not quit as good as the freshly made food, but it is a good value.
