Such a great place- 
Great ambiance & atmosphere and the food is incredible.

Strongly suggest to any newbies to try the Pollo Colonial w/ sweet and spicy glaze and the patatas Bravas: [spicy potatoes] the portions are enough for 2 (in some cases). Chase that meal with some of their House Sangria and you are set. 

The staff was very friendly and courteous. If you're looking to take your significant other out or possibly going out for a first date, this is a great place.
