They've done a number of arrangements for us and their designs are really cool. Sure they do a lot of corporate events and arrangements for hospital gift shops, but where they shine is in contemporary arrangements. Give them a little leeway for creativity and you'll be wowed, and for a good price, too.

If you're a DIY kind of bride, you can buy your flowers through them and use the shop to put together your arrangements. If you need guidance, you can hire a designer to assist. 

They have a huge selection of containers (vases, etc.).
