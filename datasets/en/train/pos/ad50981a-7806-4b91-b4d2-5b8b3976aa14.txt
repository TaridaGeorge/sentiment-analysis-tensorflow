Imagine this... a delicious, flaky pie crust that's been stuffed with delicious stew like middles.  Yum... making you hungry?  It should be!  This is the kinda cuisine that the Cornish Pasty Company serves up.  And they do it well.  Really well.  So well in fact that I've told my friends in California about this place and we try, in vain, to find something similar in the Bay area.  ((sigh))  Please CPC, come to Sunnyvale, California!

Aside from the tasty food and reasonable prices, this is a joint with unique music and appeal.  It's a cool place for a date though maybe a lil loud for a meeting of any kind.  They have an outdoor patio and inside seating... and a well stocked bar!

I'd definitely recommend Cornish Pasty House to friends and in fact, will have to visit again really, really soon.

See ya there!
