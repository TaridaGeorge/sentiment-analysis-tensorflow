I suck. I've been going to this strip mall for many, many years and always thought "I need to check that place out".   I finally went and it was so simple and good I be a regular form now on I promise.

Had the brochettes, all were very good. Not "oh my f'ing God" good but yet very solid.  The lentil soup was fresh and full of vegetables.

I had the bolonanase (sp?) ragu.  Past with meat sauce but oh so much more when it came to the taste.  I cleaned my plate.

Keep in mind this place is BYOB. You sit on plastic chairs. and there are only about 8 tables in this tiny strip mall location.

Nice.
