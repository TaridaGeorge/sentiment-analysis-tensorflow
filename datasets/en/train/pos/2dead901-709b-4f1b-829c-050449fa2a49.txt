I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but I do love their chai tea. This is a great place to go for a quick meetup with a friend, or a drink on the way to school, work, etc. Every person who works here has a fantastic personality for my tired, groggy, sometimes crabby self, and it really does make my day. I love that the drinks are made to order, and you really feel like the staff is truly happy to create you a delicious drink. I want to go back today now that I wrote about it!
