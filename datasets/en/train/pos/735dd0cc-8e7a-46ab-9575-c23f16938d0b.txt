I have never had anything but the very best food and service at NYPD Pizza. They have the most delicious pizza and calzones for a good price, slices and small calzones for lunch, and salads that are just amazing.

It is a small place, but that only increses the feeling that you're being taken care of by friends. I really do applaude the folks behind this little chain and hope that they will never sacrifice the high quality of their food.

If you like great pizza, I mean really great pizza, then you MUST give NYPD Pizza a try. You will be impressed I am sure.
