Since I moved to AZ from CA I have tried several Vietnamese places, and until now was eating only at Pho Dalat.  I recently relocated near MCC so I decided to try Pho Ao Sen, and boy am I glad I did!

Their food is fantastic; the meats being much higher quality than most local competitors.  I've tried three of the rolls from the appetizer menu, the pho ga, and two different bun dishes.  All were excellent.

The atmosphere is very nice.  The service can be a bit slow like most asian restaurants.  The only thing lacking IMHO is a liquor license; I likey my beer with my pho!
