Amazing! 

I live in California and wanted to send a birthday surprise to a college friend of mine living in Scottsdale.  I called Rachel the day of and she was more than helpful in providing me great service.

I wrote my friend a silly and completely non-traditional birthday note which Rachel noted with laughs and welcome ear (no judgement when I dictated the words "from you favorite a-holes, happy birthday" over the phone). 

She then sent me a photo and even a paragraph on my friend's reaction to the flowers. Great, great great! And affordable!  No charge for the last minute order and no delivery fee
