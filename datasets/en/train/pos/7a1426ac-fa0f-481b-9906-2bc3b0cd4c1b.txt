Great service.  My son and I went for our first time and they bought us lemonade.  It was fresh and fantastic.  The service was wonderful... continually offering us refills.  My son got the hummus with gluten free pita and a gyros on GF pita.  The pita bread was so good I bought a pack to bring home.  For only $3.50 my husband and son have had 24 sandwiches.  12 slices of pita makes 24 pita pocket sandwiches!!  Great deal!

I ordered the vegetarian combination was enjoyed everything I ate.
