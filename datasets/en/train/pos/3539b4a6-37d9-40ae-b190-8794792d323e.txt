My friend Monty' (actually R) brought me a brownie the other day.  I brought it home and forgot about it, that's how much I'm not that into brownies.  So a day goes by and I get home with my son, and I see it on the counter.  I said, awww, I'm such a nice mommy, I'm gonna share this with him and he'll be really happy.

So I cut it and gave him some with milk, then I took a bite and OH MY GOD!  Seriously!?!?!?!?!  I don't consider myself one of those "crazy for brownies" people, but Jesus H!  The Cream Cheese Swirl was effin awesome!    I almost died of pleasure it was so good. 

WOW... I have to go there and try them all now!  

Thank you R!!!
