I was lured in by a smiling, waving, guy with a sign on the corner--that I passed and waved at every day for 3 months.  I finally gave in.  I almost regret it.  Their cupcakes are SOO good.  

I have been there several times...having tried vanilla/vanilla, tuxedo, german chocolate, toasted coconut, lemon drop, and birthday cake.  

The cake is light and super moist.  The icing is sweet, creamy--but not too sweet.  


Love them!!!
