Is this fast food?!  For some reason, this hole-in-the-wall appears so random to me.  Because I'm so accustomed to taco trucks/Mexican restaurants in LA areas, I was at first hesitant to try until I saw the reviews.  I would consider this place authentic, affordable, and offers you a good portion of food if you want your Mexican fix.  They don't have carne asada fries, but they do have carne asada (haha, we made the mistake of asking if they had french fries).  I got their fish burrito and really liked it.  Will definitely come back again if I'm in the area.
