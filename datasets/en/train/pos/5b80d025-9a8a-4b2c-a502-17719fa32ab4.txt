Had another great meal and dining experience at girmaldis Scottsdale quarter.  The manager Marla, goes above and beyond to make sure everyones happy.  Marla is the best, she recommended the best wine to go with our calzone, it was delish. Thanks Marla your the best.   Girmaldis is a great place to go for wonderful service and the best pizza and calzones in Scottsdale..
