After indulging in my three course meal last night for Yelp Eats, I'm reminded again to do my penance at the gym.
I've been a member for about 6 months, and it's all been great.  The equipment is clean and new.  They have a decent selection of TV shows that I can watch to try and distract myself from the sweat dripping into my eyes.  They have one group fitness room and a good selection of classes.  They post the group schedule online so you can plan accordingly.  
There are people of all shapes, sizes and fitness levels.  
Also, if you buy your membership from Costco, it's a pretty unbeatable deal.
