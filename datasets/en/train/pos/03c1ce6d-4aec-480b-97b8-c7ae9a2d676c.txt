I. effin. love. this. place. 

The food is homemade, and the menu has a ton of variety.

Its like having your grandparents that are badass cooks open a restaurant. I always get the breakfast burrito, because I cant get a decent breakfast burrito anywhere else. 

They have this apple syrup stuff they make themselves for the ice tea that is glorious. It makes for the single greatest glass of iced tea in the valley. Per the owners, it takes hours to boil and make, and they use mint from their own garden. 

I love this little spot and the owners.
