I had some family in town a couple weeks ago and their first morning they were looking for a nice breakfast.  I had heard nothing but great things about this place, so it was worth a shot.

After seeing how reasonable the prices were I was afraid we had just stepped into a fancy IHOP.  I'm glad to say  I was wrong.  The California Omlette was great, though the pancakes on the side seemed a little off.  But I chalk that up to trying to stuff them down my gullet after I was already stuffed by the rest of my meal.  It was a Friday morning so there was no wait, but I can clearly see why it would be packed on the weekends!
