I have been working out at IMX Pilates for about 7 months and have seen significant changes in my body in that time.  I have lost weight doing something I truly enjoy.  The owner Melissa is very knowledgeable about Pilates and has a warm and inviting personality which made me feel so comfortable from day one.  It is the first exercise class that I look forward to taking.  All of the clients who work out there are super sweet and fun to work out with.  I have made a lot of new Pilates friends at IMX Pilates!
