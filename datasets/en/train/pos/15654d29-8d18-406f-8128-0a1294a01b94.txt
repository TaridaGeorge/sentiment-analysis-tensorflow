The long and the short.

Bob is awesome.

We recently moved to Phoenix and inherited Bob as our mechanic through my in laws (they gave us one of their cars).

Then that car got into an accident and the damage cost more than the car.  We needed a new one.  After all the stress of trying to find the right car in our budget, we found one.  We needed Bob to look it over before we agreed to buy it, and he was able to see us on the spot!  24 hours later the car was ours.

(Additionally, he's just an awesome person.  Be prepared to see lots of sweet cats around as he rescues them.)
