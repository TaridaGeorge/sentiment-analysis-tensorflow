Excellent deals here. 2 for $2.00 gallon jugs of water. Donuts for .49 after 4pm. Guaranteed gas that doesn't mess up your car's engine. Just as the name states, service is quick. After sundown, the tweakers, prostitutes, and crackheads start to roam the area coming from the nearby rent by the week motel unless PPD is on site. (sometimes they hang out there). Beggars can get a little aggressive. Ladies; bring your pepper spray at night.
