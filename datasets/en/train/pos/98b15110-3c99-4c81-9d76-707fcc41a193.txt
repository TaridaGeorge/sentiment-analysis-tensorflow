Love this store!! Great place to shop for personalized gifts. 
They have tons of delicious smelling teas, which you can smell , taste and ogle over. My friend Kris and I stop by with my mom and we were impressed. They have ice teas, fruit teas, chocolate teas, white teas anything you can dream of. 

I am already imagining creating gift baskets with the goodies they have here. By the way , the prices are more than reasonable and give you lots of choices to contemplate. 

Stop in here to relax , shop or just get creative with tea! Love it!
