Excellent experience.  The office is clean, modern and comfortable, the front desk very pleasant and helpful, but most importantly Dr. Brian was knowledgable, gentle and skilled in his adjustments.  Having had chiropractic care my whole life I was unsure about a "chain" store, but will definitely go back and recommend it to others.
