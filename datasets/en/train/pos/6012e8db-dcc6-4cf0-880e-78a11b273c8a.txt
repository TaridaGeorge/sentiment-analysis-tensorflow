Caramel. Creme. Macaroon.
To die for.

I got one due to all the rave reviews and eagerly scurried to my car with takeaway coffee in hand, unwrapped the pastry delight, and took one bite...uttering "oh my god" * as I devoured the entire thing on the drive to work. The coffee was good too, but I barely noticed. CCM's - I'm yours: truly, madly, deeply.

* I really did this. Alone. In my car.

===UPDATE===

So the chocolate macaroon isn't as nirvana-inducing as the caramel, but it is good. The little box of sweets I bought for a friend? Yeah, I had half of them before she even had a chance. And the egg sandwich? Yum! Very simple but mighty tasty with Havarti & tomato and a nice light breakfast choice.
