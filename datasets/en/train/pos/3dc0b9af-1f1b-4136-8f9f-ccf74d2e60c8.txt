OMG.  So good.  Seriously authentic italian food housed in what looks to be a former Circle K.  Sneaky! 

I'll echo the Pasta Giovanni praise, but the real star here is the pizza!  Easily the best pizza in North Phoenix.  The wait staff are complete pros - not an ounce of ennui or arrogance.  

As a result, this place fills up quickly in the evenings. Go early or be prepared to wait in the akward entryway or at the bar.
