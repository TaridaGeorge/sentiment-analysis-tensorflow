Ummm..WOW!

Can I end my review here?  Perhaps not.

The Italian ice (granita) was amazing!  Orange was an absolute favourite in my family.  My husband wishes he didn't get the gelato but the rest of us really liked it.  The vanilla gelato tastes like frozen whipped cream.  Totally healthy, I'm sure :)  We didn't try the mango, but my son had the birthday cake and I had the root beer.  My 2nd favourite was the sour patch kids :)

Only disappointments here?  No traditional lemon flavour and the fact that the staff didn't seem to really know the history of their product or the difference between the words "gelato" and "gelati".  I'm a grammar nut.
