So I have found myself in a situation like many here in the valley.  I moved here from Seatte to take care of my sick mother, and by the time I realized how sick she was all her bills and house payments were really behind.  Last Wed I found out her house was going to auction this Wed.  So of course im freaking out and need to move asap.  I found a house Monday, was given the code to see the house that day.  Fell in love with the house.  Filled my app out Tues it is now Wed its completely processed and has been handed to the home owner for approval.  Eric Evans has worked quickly to get this approved for me.  Regardless of what the homeowner says...he work quickly on my behalf!  Thank You Eric you ROCK!
