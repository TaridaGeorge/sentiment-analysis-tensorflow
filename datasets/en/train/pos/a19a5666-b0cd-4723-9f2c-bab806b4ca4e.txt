Great place for a cheeseburger!  They make butter burgers here, so if you are looking for a healthy way to enjoy your lunch, the mixture of cheese, fat, greese and butter probibly makes this a bad choice.  But if you love burgers, I say this sometimes is even better than In n' out and 10x better than 5 guys.
