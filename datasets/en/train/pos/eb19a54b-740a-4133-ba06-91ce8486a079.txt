I love this restaurant.

The food is inventive and delicious. The chef will make special vegetarian dishes off the menu, which I have tried a few times. I love, love the salad with blue cheese and carmel corn. The burger is good, too. And the halibut is amazing (when they have it). I also have had a peanut butter dessert that was excellent.

I also really like the atmosphere. The "floating" wine cellar is beautiful. And the contents are amazing. 

Best of all is the service by the best waiter ever...Winston.
