Best grocery store in the valley for fresh vegetables.  Their meat and other products are generally a little bit pricier than Frye's.  They have a large variety of breads, coffees, and pastas, all of which I like.  This Sprouts is great, and really the only place for healthy grocery shopping in PHX.
