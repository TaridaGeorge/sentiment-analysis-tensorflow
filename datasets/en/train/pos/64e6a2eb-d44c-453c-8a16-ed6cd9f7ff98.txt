I was here for the first time recently to see M83 and Active Child.

I would certainly prefer to attend a general admission gig here over any other venue I've been to in the metro area. It's clean and classy, a cozy size and quite relaxed.

I was able to find parking on the street a couple of blocks away. I was not a patron of the two strategically placed bars.
