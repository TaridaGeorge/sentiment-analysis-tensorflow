I'd have to say that Malee's On Main is my #1 all-time favorite for restaurants in the entire state of Arizona. 

Why? The ambiance. The consistently (over 10+ years) superb service. The to-die-for food. And of course the memories, since I've celebrated a few of my life's key events here (namely both my college and law school graduations). 

Oddly enough the decor is closer to that of an up-scale gourmet American place than what's actually on the menu: Thai food. But the combination works. The tom kha gai soup is the best I've had anywhere in the US. The beer and wine selections are excellent. 

Simply put this is a restaurant where it's obvious that the owner works very hard to make sure your entire experience as a customer will be first-class. 

There is a second Malee's in north Scottsdale that I've never been to.
