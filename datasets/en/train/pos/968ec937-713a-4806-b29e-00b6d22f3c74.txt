We love this place. I have never tried anything on their menu that I didn't like. I really enjoy the Rumbi Beach Burger, Chicken Teriaki Sandwich, and Pulled Pork sandwich. Their sweet potato fries are excellent. Always good to wash it down it a Mango Iced Tea. I'm just disappointed that the location in east Phoenix and Scottsdale have closed. Wish they would reopen another closer to our home.
