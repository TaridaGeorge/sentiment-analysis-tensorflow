Nothing can replace the original Postino's, but this Central Ave. location comes pretty close. Perfect little lunch spot featuring your favorites (i.e. bruschetta planks in all the varieties, yummy paninis and plenty of wine) AND my personal favorite part, the smokin' $5 deal.
Just five bucks for a mini pitcher of a draft beer - that's a little over 2 pints' worth of Kiltlifter, Hoegaarden, etc. - or glass of wine = sa-weet. That special runs 7 days a week from 11a-5p. The lunch food items are well priced for what you get, too, with generous portions. Delicious and fresh, for less than $10. 
Same great design and atmosphere and killer sliding-door bathroom with a sink big enough to wash your hair in (I'm always a sucker for a cool bathroom!).
