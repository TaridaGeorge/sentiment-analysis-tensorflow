Oh Gammage, how I do love thee. 

My husband and I usually see 1-2 shows a year.  I would definitely see more if we could afford it!  It's so much fun.  I've always found Gammage to be comfortable and does a fine job providing that classic theater environment.  It's big enough to house big shows, so you feel like you're getting a Broadway experience every time you go.  Someone on here complained about parking, but they have their lot as well as parking garages.  You must not have seen them.  We've never been without a space and we have gone at various times of the year. 

I work at ASU, and I like to walk to Gammage sometimes over lunch.  It's such a pretty building with pretty landscaping.  And sometimes I can hear bits of rehearsals going on, which is always fun.
