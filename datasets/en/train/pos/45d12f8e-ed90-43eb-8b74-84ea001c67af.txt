At the recommendation of my parents, I took my kids on the Moonlight Dinner Ride last month.  WOW!  Amazing experience.  We started with a cowboy style dinner around the campfire prepared by the ranch cook (YUM!)  she made us steaks, cowboy beans and amazing biscuits.  After dinner, we met our horses, mounted up and rode for 2 hours.  The desert is amazing at night under the full moon!  We heard coyotes and saw owls and other nocturnal critters.  Our guides Kris and Dave were so helpful and informative.  The horses were very well trained and were a blast to ride.... Not your normal nose to tail ride.  The kids and I loved it and are ready to go back for a pack trip.  Thanks guys... you made our trip to Phoenix a blast!
