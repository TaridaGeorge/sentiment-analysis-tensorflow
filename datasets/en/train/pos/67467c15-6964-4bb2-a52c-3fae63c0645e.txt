Excellent food we had the pretzel fondue appetizer, main dishes gnocchi, the pasta dish with rib meat and tomato sauce, and the burger. Yes there were three of us and we did not leave hungry. We ate almost every bite. The service was very friendly and attentive (not overly attentive). We sat on the patio in the last week of March and enjoyed our dining experience (not loud at all).  My husband is a private chef and dined along with another great friend of mine who is the General Manager at 5th and Wine a few blocks away. My friend has dined here several times and we are all foodies who did not leave disappointed.
