BRUEGGER'S BAGELS on Arizona Avenue and Guadalupe has got to be the best bagel shop around. I go there about 2 or 3 times a week. The bagels are far waaaay better than Einsteins. You cannot compare. I love their Western egg sandwich. Lots of goodies on that sandwich. The store is always clean and let me tell you the bathrooms are Super clean!!!! The staff are super efficient and always warm and inviting. They 
persuaded me to try lunch and I sure did. WOW the sandwiches are HUGE!!! and they come with a pickle, and a cookie. My favorites sandwich is the turkey chipotle club. OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!  For those of you who havent been or  have been in the past please go!!!  It has been under new management for a little over a year. Definately a great experience.
