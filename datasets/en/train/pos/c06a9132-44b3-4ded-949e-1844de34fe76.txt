I've been here 4 or 5 times. The french press is what I have purchased all of those times, and its excellent. Smooth tasty cup of joe, at a cheap price, and a great atmosphere. I'm not one to loiter around coffee houses too long, but if I were to do a little bit of loitering this would be the place to loiter. They have a great selection of teas, as previously mentioned. Steves is recommended.
