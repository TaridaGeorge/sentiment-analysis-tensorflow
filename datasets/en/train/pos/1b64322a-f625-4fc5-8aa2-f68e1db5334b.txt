The Phoenix Zoo is my favorite place to spend beautiful spring Phoenix days.  My 5 year old daughter and I love the sting rays, the petting zoo, the water play areas, the carousel, the tree house, the horse back riding classes ... this place has so much to offer.  My personal favorite exhibit is the Savannah and the new Komodo dragon exhibit is cool too. The membership is worth the money and pays for itself after just a couple of trips.  You also get free passes and discounts as part of the membership so I definitely recommend it.  Once you go there, you will find that you want to go back time and again to play, explore and hang-out.
