One of the best meals of my life!  There was way too much food served, but the leftovers were just as good as the first time!  Lobster mashed potatoes and snap peas were SO good.  I ordered the Sea Bass and it melted like butter in my mouth!  The seafood tower over dry ice was very exciting and delicious as well.  This is a great place to celebrate something special or splurge BIG time!
