Had the Salmon & Tuna sushi and is was amazing. Some of the best sushi I've had in the Valley.   The sushi was generous, and very fresh (can't really ask for much more at a sushi place).  The also seem to have an assortment of rolls that are on special from Sunday-Thursday night, but the sushi was so filling, I couldn't eat any more.  The place was very busy, and the staff was very attentive.
