This place unlike Corp gyms has everything, but with the mom and pop feel. LOVE everything about this place, and recommend it to anyone that has a open ear. I have only just started going, but after a month of having 24 hour access to this fantastic gym, I have dropped a dress size AND feel so good! Not ever over crowed AND people to help you with something at all times? No trainers to jump on you to buy supplements every day?  How does it get any better than that?  I am a member for life!
