This is a BUFFET, not a gourmet restaurant, let's keep that in mind, people!  In comparison to buffets, this one is the king of the bunch.  It's heads and shoulders above any Golden Corral/Country Harvest Buffet/CiCi's Pizza.  They have an amazing variety of asian foods - sushi, chinese dishes, soups, mongolian barbeque, a huge salad bar, desserts, and best of all? ALL U EAT CRAB LEGS!!!! I've a frequent visitor to Joe's Crab Shack and Red Lobster, but none are worth it compared to here.  Between 2 people @ Joe's/Red Lobster it's easy to drop $90-$100 and only get about 6 crab legs and a filet of fish, whereas $25-$30 @ Crazy Buffet will get you all the crab legs, popcorn shrimp, and sushi you crave.  Easily the best buffet in the Valley.
