Kazimierz is wonderful for dates: first, second, or millionth. It's absolutely one of my most favorite date spots (obviously) and the extensive wine list is fab. I've never tried the food. The service is always so wonderful (as seems to be the standard for the Kaz/CowCiao/SeaSaw group)... just go, it's really great.
