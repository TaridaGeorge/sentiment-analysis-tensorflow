Never approach a Bull from the front, a Horse from the rear, or a chain pizza joint from any direction. If you had grown up in Phoenix and are over 40 we've all seen good pizza places come and go. Shakeys, Village inn, Genos, Dego Dan, etc.

But through the generations, westward the wagons, across the sands a time some old time pizza joints stay in business. Pat's is one of these. 2nd to my all time favorite Riazzis in Tempe I encourage all of you to give them a try. 

This place is extremely busy so call ahead to take out or eat in and don't forget the mushrooms!
