If youre looking for a place to begin or start Bikram again - this is it!! 

My first time to the studio was amazing! I was greeted by incredibly nice teachers, and even got a mini-lesson beforehand for the pranayama breathing exercise!

After I took off a semester and returned (yesterday as a matter of fact!), it feels great to be back!
