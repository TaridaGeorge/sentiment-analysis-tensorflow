Gratzee Charles and Isabelle for providing this venue!

I love to invite students & buddies, especially int;'l, from school & work to join me & my French friend for a Sunday breakfast just after a GreenBelt Run!
Veggie Omelet is my favorite, especially w. salad and fruit.

Waiting service is provided by two adorable & dedicated kiddos (in addition to ever-present Momma Isabelle): handsome son & beautiful family friend.

Atmosphere is relaxed cafe-like, and when we bring Chopin sheet music, we find the piano is always in tune :)
