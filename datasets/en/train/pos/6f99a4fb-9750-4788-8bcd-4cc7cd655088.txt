So glad this place is in the neighborhood!  The sandwiches are generously sized and stuffed with freshly prepared ingredients - I watched everything go on the grill from my seat.  The southwestern influence melds really nicely with the classic grilled steak and cheese.  Kind of like a good steak torta from your favorite fast food joint, but with higher quality cuts (and vegetables, and bread, and sauce...). House made sauces and chewy, warm buns seal the deal - plus the fact that $10 gets you stuffed with a  sandwich, a drink and fries or onion rings.
