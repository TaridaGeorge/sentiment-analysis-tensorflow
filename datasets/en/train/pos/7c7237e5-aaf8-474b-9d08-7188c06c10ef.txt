One of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. The parking lot is nothing spectacular but don't let that deter you from visiting Razz's.  I've been there twice and it's one of my favorite restaurants for cajun/french cuisine.  The restaurant is very cozy and colorful with a charming vibe. The owner is personable and reminds me of a shorter version of Steven Seagal.  I ordered their salad wrapped in cucumber glaze with a nice, flavourful dressing. It was perfect in size and consistently delicious.  The braised short ribs was fantastic!
