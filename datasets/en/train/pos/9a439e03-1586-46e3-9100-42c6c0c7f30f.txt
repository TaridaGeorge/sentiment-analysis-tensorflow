I love this place!  All the guy workers are awesome!   Julie, Angie, Heather, and Zayne are the best girls ever.  ;)  I get treated very well here, and I love the atmosphere. I've never been treated so well at any other restaurant in my life.  I used to go here almost everyday for breakfast and lunch, because they have such great deals!  I've been here a few times for karaoke and to watch local bands.  I have not been disappointed at this bar.  Grandma still cooks at this place, and her food is fabulous.  She is the sweetest lady, and she is more than happy to talk to her customers; you can even call her Grandma!!  Even their doorman is super friendly.  This place is like a home away from home.  Thank you, Hollywood Alley.  :)
