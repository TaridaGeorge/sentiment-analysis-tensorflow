The Heard Museum, consisting of 10 galleries, examines the foods, culture and religious beliefs of 21 Southwestern Native American tribes. Knowing how much Native American history is neglected in schools, the Heard Museum does a wonderful job educating visitors about a select few of tribes through a display of historical artifacts such as Kachina dolls. I loved the large images, very colorful and expressive.
