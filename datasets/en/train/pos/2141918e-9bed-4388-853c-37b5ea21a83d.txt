This is a workout like no other. I've been doing Bikram yoga for about 2 years and while I love it -- it doesn't do much for upper body strength and it is the same class each and every time. Sumit is a perfect fusion of Bikram heat with Ashtanga power moves done at a fast pace. Definitely the most strenuous yoga I've ever done. I'm currently doing the 2 week intro -- so glad I found this place!
