I LOVE COSTCO!!!!!!!!!!  I could freakin LIVE HERE.  I get so excited to go here, its not even funny.  OMG.

Ok, so my mom's in town and shes a costco member.  She KNOWS I live for this place.  Of course, its set up like all the other ones, but shopping here can't be beat.

Granted, we went on Christmas Eve, and it was SO busy!  But, its always busy at costco, so its not a surprise.  They carry everything I need, and I love it here.  Lots of stuff to buy, including booze, food, gas, and the obvious other items that are sold here.

Totally worth the membership, as long as you don't mind being around lots of people.
