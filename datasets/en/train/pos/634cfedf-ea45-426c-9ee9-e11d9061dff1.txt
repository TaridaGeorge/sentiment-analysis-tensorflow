I've been regularly eating at George & Son's for years now. I'd say I'm knowledgeable about their food, and let me tell you, it's pretty damn amazing. The staff is friendly (although a few of them are difficult to understand), and although the place is frequently packed, the service is still pretty good.

Some of the best dishes here are the General Yang's Chicken with the green beans and white rice and, of course, the all-inclusive lunchtime buffet. Also, if you order an appetizer, Do Not pass up the Pu Pu Platter.
