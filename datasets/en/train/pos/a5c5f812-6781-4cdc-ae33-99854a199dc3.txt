i have a pit/pointer/something mix, and she's a big girl.  most people are automatically intimidated and i think that's complete crap because she's the sweetest thing in the world.  the folks at Del Lago see this and they couldn't have been nicer.  the vet even pointed out things my last vet didn't even point out.  couldn't be happier with Del Lago.
