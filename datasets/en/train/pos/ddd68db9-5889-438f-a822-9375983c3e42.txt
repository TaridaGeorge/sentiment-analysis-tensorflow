Our first time was at the season ending wine dinner. There was a set menu for the event each paired with a different wine. We were not disappointed. The table included some picky eaters who were nevertheless impressed. Wonderful halibut and salmon in delicious sauce, perfectly prepared, grilled shrimp and escargot, crisp duck and beef wellington, and a dessert cake (mango) with berries. Can't wait for them to reopen in fall to try the rest of the menu.
