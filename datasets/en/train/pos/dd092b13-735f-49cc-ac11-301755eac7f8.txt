I've been to a number of shows here, and performed in a couple as well. The theaters are top notch - both front and back of house. The seating is a little close - for tall people like me it's a little rought when someone needs to cross in front of you - but that's nearly the same in every seated venue (a lot like a standard mpvie theater). It seems like every seat is decent.
  The only challenge I've had is that sometimes the volunteers can be a bit overzealous.
  The other problem is that downtown Mesa is pretty dead when the shows are over. There's nowhere to walk around and get a bite, etc. It's a bit like they roll the sidewalks up. Maybe as the area grows a bit that will change.
