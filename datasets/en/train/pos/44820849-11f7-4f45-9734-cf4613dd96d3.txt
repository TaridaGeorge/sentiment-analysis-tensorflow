Update:  The management was grascious enough to thank me on Yelp!.  That is another huge plus. 

I love the Gainey Ranch, but I also love the Phoenician... and I have a lot of Starwood points... Maybe Starwood should buy the Gainey Ranch? Then it would be perfect (for me)!   Nonetheless, it's over the top service and quality. 

And really... how hard is it to be nice to people?  It's amazing how many in the hotel industry screw that up.
