I love this place!  I have worked in the area for 5 years,and these folks are probably the best quality lunch you can find around here.  Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, rather quick service.  The Greek salad with gyro meat (#41) is so delicious, I haven't swayed from it in three years.  The dining room is always clean.  I highly suggest lunch here!
