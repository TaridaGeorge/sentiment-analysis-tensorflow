Zorba's.  I drove by this place as a kid in the front seat of my mom's 1986 DODGE 600 SILVER CONVERTIBLE and my friend and I were fascinated at what was inside.......................

Then one day a few weeks later at a video store I found the VHS (remember those?) box for......

"Zorba the Greek."

Did he live inside?  Were Greeks perverts?  What IS Victoria hiding in her panties?

OK.......I'm not sure Victoria's Secret ever really entered into my mind that many years ago (did it exist?)..........but it sounded good at the end of that sentence.

But Zorba is by all accounts a staple of Scottsdale.  Been there FOREVER.  And in this corporate world--not an easy thing to do. 

SO........ZORBA...........keep doing what you do best.  What that is today.........I cannot say.  But you seem to know..........
