I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. The husband and I have been coming here for years now and it is still one of our favorite burger places. The Delux Burger is just fantastic with caramelized onions, blue cheese, and arugula. We always order Medium-Rare and it is always perfect. The burger is huge - we usually split and then order a basket of mixed fries. Their Sweet Potato fries are my favorite. Not a big fan of the regular fries, but the husband likes them. The fries come with some aioli sauce which is addictive. The husband also loves their Lobster Bisque soup and they make a pretty good Chocolate Malt Shake. Definitely check this place out if you are ever in the area! If you don't order dessert here, you can always head over to Gelato Spot for dessert!
