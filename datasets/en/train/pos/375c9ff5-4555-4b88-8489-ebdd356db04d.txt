I am by no means a yoga expert.. and I am still not even sure who this Bikram guy is...

But I love this.  Saw a noticable difference in the shape of my body and my Girlfriends too..  in 3 days.

90 minutes of HELL will lead to alot of pleasure.  I have never sweat so much and I can't believe how hard you work.. but it is amazing. This is a great way to lose weight/get in shape/detoxify/gain peace of mind.
