Had a great experience at Valley Eyecare. Went to see Dr. Lindsey Clyde and her team in Dec. 2010. Complete eye exam that was explained to me at the time, they worked with my insurance and helped my select two pairs of prescription glasses that are fun & functional. Thank you Valley Eyecare! This is my doctor of choice.
