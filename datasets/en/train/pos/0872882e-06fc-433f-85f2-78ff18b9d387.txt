This is my favorite place in Downtown Chandler for lunch.
The atmosphere is clean and simple. I enjoy sitting by the huge front window watching the world go by.
They have a tasting menu available for lunch for around $11.50. It includes:
Spring rolls
Papaya Salad (my obsession)
Choice of an entree (I like the Phad Thai and Yellow Curry)
Dessert.
They also have a full menu to order from.
It is a great deal. The staff is always very friendly and accommidating. 

Check it out!
