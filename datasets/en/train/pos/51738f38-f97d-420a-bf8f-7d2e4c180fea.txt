I love this library, I found out about $80.00 in fines later that in April you can donate canned food and they trade away your fines! I've been saving food now so by April I will have a bunch but hopefully not big fines again!
Update....I had paid off some fines but this April when I went to get my botanical garden pass...i dropped off 20 food items and got my last 10 dollars of fines removed! Woo Hoo
