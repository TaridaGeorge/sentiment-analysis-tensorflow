Loving this place since 1991. It has been here since 1960 though.                    Always great food. They truly have the best Pizza in the Valley they still hand toss the crust.                                                                               Which makes a huge difference.   The wings are fab,as well as every meal we have ever had here.   To Go orders are also great! I love eating inside because, it has a wonderful Italian ambiance that is old school and natural. it reminds me of the East coast restaurants.   Parking is a little tough. Always busy ,so you must sometimes park on the road , but well worth it.
