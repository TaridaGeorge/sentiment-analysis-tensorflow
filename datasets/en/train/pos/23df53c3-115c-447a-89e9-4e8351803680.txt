Love, love, LOVE Caffe Sarajevo.  There is nothing on the menu that isn't delicious.  

The beef soup - stew-like - is out of this world delicious.  I could wrap the bread around myself like a blanket and wear it it is so warm and delicious and comforting. The pitas - cheese, spinach and cheese, and meat - are so good I could eat them every day.  

The prices are very reasonable.  

The interior is so cool - very European and completely unique from any restaurant in Phoenix.  The server we've had all but once, Johnna, (not sure of the correct spelling - sorry!) is a delight!  So friendly and welcoming, and a very, very good server.  

Give it a try - you won't be disappointed.
