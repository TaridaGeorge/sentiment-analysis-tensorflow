One of my top-five places to eat in town (I know, I'm a cheap date).  Their toasted subs are fresh, fast and amazingly good.   What is it that makes this place so delicious?  I dunno, it just is.  Mention Cheba Hut to any one who has tasted it before and watch their eyes light up.  It's just that good.

Several premium choices for vegetarians.  My weapon of choice 'The Humbolt' (hold the onions).  Try the thick, fudgy 'hemp' brownies for dessert.
