I waffled on my rating because I have some issues with some things here. Issues: Slow - it took over 10 minutes to make my sandwich. Soggy - the recommended bread was soggy.  I left a good portion of it behind because it was wet and blah.

I gave them 5 stars in the end because this was the best darn Chicken Parmesan sandwich I've ever had.  The guy taking my order recommended I get it on the Rosemary Sea Salt bread instead of the Cibata bread it comes with standard.  FABULOUS recommendation except the soggy issue noted above.  For flavor though... YUMMMM!  Next time I think I'll get the bread on the side or on top - an inverted open face sandwich, hmmm...  No matter, this sandwich was the bomb, even the shrooms and spinach was yummy (not so fond of shrooms).

I'll be ordering this again!
