Joe's Pizza is delicious. But Joe is mean. And scary. His pizza joint is right across the street from a nightclub, so he can't expect his customers to be meek little mice that eat their pie in silence, right? WRONG! I came in with what one might describe as a rowdy group of girls on an early evening and Joe immediately started yelling at us to be quiet. We became a little annoyed and may have mentioned the fact that he can't really expect his patrons not to laugh or talk loudly and he promptly kicked us out. That's right, I have been kicked out of Joe's Pizza. But I'd still go back, it's good stuff.
