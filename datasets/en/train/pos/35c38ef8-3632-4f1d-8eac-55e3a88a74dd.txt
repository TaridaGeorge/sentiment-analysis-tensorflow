Let me first say that I am not a pie person, however these are some of the best pies I've ever had! I'm definitely not a fruit pie person either, but the apple crumble was so delicious.  We also tried the coconut creme pie, both were perfect-not to sugary, but just sweet enough. Also, something about her crust...to die for!!!
