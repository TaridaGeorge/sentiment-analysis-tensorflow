I just ordered some items online and received them today, so I tried them out for the first time.   Their donuts are AMAZING!!!   I can't believe they are gluten free, they taste exactly like regular donuts except possibly better.  My teenage son is also weaning off gluten and he had to admit how good these were.   
I will definitely order them again!
