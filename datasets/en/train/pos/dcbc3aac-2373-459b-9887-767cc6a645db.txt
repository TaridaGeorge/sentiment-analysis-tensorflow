Felicia, Felicia, Felicia...

The best service I've had in Phoenix to date. I told Felicia what I normally drink, she shook her head approvingly and walked to the bar, came back with several originals for me to partake of. 

They stayed open late for us! Im sure she had better things to do. ..


Sidenote:

When I walked in I saw 4 skateboarders at the bar. 
Apparently, they work there, so, yeah, I'll be back.
