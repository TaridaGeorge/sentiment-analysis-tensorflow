Yum! My husband picked this up for  dinner tonight, so I didn't see the place on the inside.  But the food was fantastic.  Chicken Lo Mein, wonderful with fresh vegetables.  Vegetable fried rice was also full of fresh vegetables, broccoli, snap peas, yum!  My husband loved the Kung Pao Chicken, his favorite dish.  But the best was the spicy shrimp, absolutely divine!  The best chinese food I have had in a long time.
