We were at this restaurant last night in a party of 6.  What a treat! The service was Great and the food was even better!  All the staff took the time to say hello, the owner came over to with us talk and to thank us. Very comfortable, a bit small but worth any inconvenience. We live in Surprise Az and we are already are planning our next visit. Mac & Cheese, The Bolognese, everytthing we ordered was great. Don't forget the desserts, they were all very special.
