This is the perfect addition to downtown Phoenix's cultural offerings and I hope it stays around for a long time to come!  Unique venue to showcase Arizona's jazz talent, you can see our state's most well known jazz legends performing alongside up and coming students.  A living laboratory of teaching, collaboration and some pretty fine improv on open mic nights, which already have quite a following.  

Only the basics here food and drink wise (prepackaged soda, water and snacks) so grab a bite to eat or a round of drinks somewhere in the neighborhood before you arrive.
