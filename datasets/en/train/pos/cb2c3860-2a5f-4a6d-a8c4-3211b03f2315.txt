I've been back and it is still equally as yummy! 

Last time they had a mushroom curry, which I've never heard of, but it was delish! It was also really empty when I came last week and I was sad. This place is so great, but its in this crappy strip mall where everything else has gone out of business. Its sort of tucked away, but totally worth the effort to look!
