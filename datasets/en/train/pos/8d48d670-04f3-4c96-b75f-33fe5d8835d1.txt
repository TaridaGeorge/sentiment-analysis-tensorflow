Dr Cooper is the GREATEST!! He is the best dentist I have ever had. My boss recommended him and I will never go anywhere else. He makes you feel so good and even gives hugs sometimes! 

I have always been so deathly afraid of dentists but not anymore! His staff is also really great. If you're on the fence about your dentist- RUN to Dr Cooper. He rocks!!
