Very friendly staff, great collection of books, and I totally dig the cafe and the culture passes that let upto four people enter select museums for free. It's a really cool place to spend an afternoon. Just sit back in one of the cushioned armchairs, bury your nose in your favorite book, and forget about the world. The library has study rooms, free WiFi, and computers for public use. The Friends of the Library (they're in a room right next to the entrance) has an incredible sale...paperbacks and children's books for $1 and less!
