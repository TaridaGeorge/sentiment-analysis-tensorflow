who doesn't love a target? i could easily spend $100 if i'm not careful just stopping in for toilet paper or something.

i've really been into their clothes, believe it or not. they've got good, nice shirts for work - they look stylish and fit well enough for the price, and you never want to spend a ton on dumb old work clothes anyway.

i'll occasionally buy shoes here, only to realize that cheap shoes just hurt your feet, bad idea.

not the cheapest place for electronics like TVs, but they have them.
