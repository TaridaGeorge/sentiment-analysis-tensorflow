Yogurtland is my favorite froyo joint in the valley. They may not have the best toppings or widest variety but the yogurt itself simply tastes far better than the yogurt at competing businesses. I usually try 3-4 flavors at each visit and every time I am amazed at how rich and flavorful the yogurt is. 

I tend to use far fewer toppings at yogurtland simply because the base is so good. 

Also, I have a general expectation that businesses around college campuses look more like a disheveled  dorm room than modern european kitchen but Yogurtland does a great job of keeping this place neat and tidy. Something I didn't expect for a place right across the street from Sun Devil Stadium
