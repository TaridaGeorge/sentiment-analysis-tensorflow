Hint: Park on Coral Gables and start hiking from there, off 7th Street.
This is my favorite hike in Phoenix! No crowds and there is always parking. There are several different trails to choose from, so you could go for a quick 20-minute hike or 90 minutes. The climb to the top is pretty fun because you also have to use your hands.
I've seen people rock climb here, too, which is cool. I like bouldering when I get the chance.
