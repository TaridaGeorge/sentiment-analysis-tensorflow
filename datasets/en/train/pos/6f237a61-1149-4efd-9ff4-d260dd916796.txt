This is where I go to get my tea. I don't care if I have to drive out of my way, I'm not going to settle for less. They have the best selection of loose leaf tea. The staff is friendly and helpful and have great tea recommendations. Thanks to Fleur de Teas, I am branching out into iced teas. Never before have I tasted an ice tea blend that was worth drinking. 
Fleur de Teas, I love you.
