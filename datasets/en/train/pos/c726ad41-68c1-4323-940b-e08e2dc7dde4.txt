This is the best frozen yogurt I have ever had, and I try frozen yogurt wherever I go! 

Not only are the flavors refreshing and of the highest quality; the fruit is always fresh and ripe!

The store is always kept clean and the staff is very nice :)

I would travel 30 minutes to get to this place anyday!
