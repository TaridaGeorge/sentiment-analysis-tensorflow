Yea for Yupha's!

Definitely a fun favorite!  Used to eat lunch here frequently when I worked nearby.  Soup and peanut dressed salad bar accompany the lunches - which is nice when you come in hungry - you can hit the ground running.  The staff is very nice - it got to the point where they would simply order for me when the special was particularly good that day...  Good flavors, good environment!  Had the Panang this evening, very tasty!
