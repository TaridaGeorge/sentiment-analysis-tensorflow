This place is absolutely Pho-licious!  Best Pho in town, hands down.  The restaurant is conveniently located on Mill Avenue and is very comfortable and well-appointed.  The menu has lots of great options and everything I've tried has been terrific.  The staff is knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful.  It's always very clean and unpretentious.  Try this place and you won't be disappointed!
