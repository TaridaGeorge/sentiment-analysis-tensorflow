I am completely blaming my dear friend T for introducing me to this place.  

I love tea.  I have always wanted to have that euphoric feeling often referred to as Nirvana.

Now...I'm addicted to Teavana.


T...you owe me $61.00.  (well worth it though, my mornings have never been so peaceful thanks to some blossoming tea!)

If you go there...don't blame me!  Just add to the blame I have placed on my friend T!
