Love this place. The atmosphere is cool but the staff and food are what makes it. We now got to CPH every time we are in town. We sit at the bar and watch Thomas do his magic. Damn he makes good cocktails. He is very creative. We have had the truffle popcorn with pork belly, e fondue is to die for but the best thing we had was the watermelon salad with grilled halloumi, mint, evoo, and a Japanese green. It was refreshing on a summer day. People watching is pretty good too. Apparent, they have a speakeasy bar upstairs, next time.
