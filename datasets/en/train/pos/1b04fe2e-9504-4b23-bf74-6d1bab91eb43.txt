It's going on two years since my original review of this Smashburger, so here goes a little Update:

Everything is still great here, so I would refer you back to my original review.  It's still the same except that the menu has expanded significantly & they now serve beer!  With or without the new items, this is my favorite hamburger (& Malt) place in the whole world!!     :-))

Today's feast was an Arizona Big Smash ($6.99), Fries ($1.99), & a Chocolate Malt ($3.99) = $12.97.

Ok, it's a little pricey, but WOOHOO, do they ever deliver a great meal!     :-))
