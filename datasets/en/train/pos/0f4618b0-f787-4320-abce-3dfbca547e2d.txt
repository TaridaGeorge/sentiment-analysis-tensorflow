The food is consistently good at Province. We often go here for breakfast..the steak and eggs is delicious. The steak has chimichuri on it to die for! The benedicts are also very good, their hollandaise has just the right amount of lemon flavor. For a short period they had build your own benedict and that was THE best thing I have had at Province....a benedict on brioche with bacon, avocado, and spinach....it was amazing! They stopped having that special the week after I discovered it....lame. Bring it back Province! Please! Anyway, we went for dinner again the other night and it was very good. Plus the BF and I got engaged here that night so it gets a little extra on its five stars. Hooray province!
