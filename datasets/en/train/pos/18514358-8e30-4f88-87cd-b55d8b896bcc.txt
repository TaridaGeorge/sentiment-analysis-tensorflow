I love the fact that the menu is constantly changing. If you've been before, you need to return, because there is always something new and tasty to try!  I was back in again, and happy to report that the cuisine was still stellar. 

New Musts to try:
- Bacon wrapped...Anything (take your pick: Okra; Beech Mushrooms; Lychee)
- Beef carpaccio (marinated in lime)
