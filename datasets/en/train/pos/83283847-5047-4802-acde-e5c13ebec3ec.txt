Great experience at the Wild Horse Pass Resort & Spa.  Friendly staff.  Resort is away from other businesses/residences so it is secluded and quiet.  Has a few pools (one with a slide) and a couple jacuzzis.  Rooms were spacious and clean.  The rooms can be a little far from the parking lots so be prepared to walk a little distance.

Overall, very relaxing. I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I am in Arizona for Spring Training.
