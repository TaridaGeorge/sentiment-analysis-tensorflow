The drinks, service and atmosphere at Lo Fi are about the best around. Sam will pour you a perfect cup of whatever you want with a smile and some friendly banter.

The prices are very reasonable, especially when you consider the quality of the drinks.

As for food, I've only had an amazing cookie. I've heard great things from those around me, though.
