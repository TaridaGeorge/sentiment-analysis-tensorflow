We, meaning a group of  neighbors go to Barro's every Monday night.  We get great service and love the folks work there.  The food is excellent and we are really treated right.  We use to go to one of their competitors but switched to Barro's about a year ago.  Thinking about pizza, wings, or pasta........ stop thinking and go to Barro's.

                                     My best to the folks there,    Paul
