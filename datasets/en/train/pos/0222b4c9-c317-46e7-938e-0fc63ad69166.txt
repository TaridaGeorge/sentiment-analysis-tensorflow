I own a PR firm and have my workspace in the loft at monOrchid and LOVE it!  I have been visiting the art gallery and attending events in this fabulous space for years, and it's one of my favorite buildings hands down in downtown Phoenix.  I also utilize it for events of my own and for clients, and everyone who walks in the doors falls in love with the building's architectural details and history.
