YUMMY!! I loved this place!! The food was out of this world AND  they have a HUGE menu with tons of veg options.  I would recommend this for anyone that loves Indian -- especially good for first timers.  You can get the sauces in mild if you don't like it too spicy.  The staff was soooo sweet and polite.  We went last night for the first time and even though I had an allergic reaction to one of the spices.....(I think it was cardamom) and had to get wasted on benadryl when I got home I am still DYING to go back ASAP!! We will definitely keep going back again and again.  :0)
