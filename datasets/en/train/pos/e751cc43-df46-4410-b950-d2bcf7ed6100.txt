One of the best breakfasts I have had.  I had the breakfast sandwich with the chorizo potatos and my wife ordered the eggs benedict with a short rib on top.  Both were amazing but I have to say my favorite part of the meal was the thick cut bacon, its kind of like a ham steak.  This was incredible.  I liked it so much I ordered my second bloody mary with a side of bacon in it.  Don't knock it till you try it.  The best part was the bloody marys are $3.50 all day.  With bacon you do pay extra though!  We have since been back for lunch and several other breakfast and were equally impressed.  Also try the BLD iced coffee.  I will try and post a picture of the bacon mary.
