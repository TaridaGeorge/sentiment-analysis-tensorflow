One of my favorite spots in all of AZ. 

Green proves that vegetarian, and more importantly, VEGAN food can be interesting and delicious. More importantly, the dishes served here can fullfill your junk-food cravings.

I am a vegetarian, but not usually a fan of mock meat products. Green does such a great job at creating tasty vegan creations that the mixed crowd will amaze you. Not to stereotype the vegan "look", but if you come in to Green during the very busy lunch rush, I would bet money that 50% of the patrons are regular meat-eaters. The food is just THAT good!

I have tried most everything on the menu, and my personal favorites are:

spicy buffalo "wings"
jerk tofu salad
mexicali burger
thai peanut bowl with crispy tofu
original "g" spicy po-boy sammy

One more thing:

They always have delicious daily specials and homemade desserts.
