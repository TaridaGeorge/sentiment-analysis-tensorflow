This is all I have to say:
Mongolian beef, Shrimp fried rice, key lime pie martini
once again that is,
Mongolian beef, Shrimp fried rice, key lime pie martini

I have narrowed my PF Changs experiece down to this and am NEVER unsatisfied. The shrimp fried rice always has the perrrrfect amount of ingrediants that I never have to douce it with soy sauce and my mongolian beef is mouth watering perfection. Topped off with my sweet dessert martini. And if your in the mood, the lettuce wraps are quite yummy too.

Trust me, get these and be satified! It's capital D-licious!

p.s. I know it's packed in there sometimes but don't be afraid to sit at the bar, I LOVE sitting there everything comes out just in time!
