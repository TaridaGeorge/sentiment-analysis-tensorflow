From the moment I pulled up to the store for a simple tire inflation, RJ (the service team member) expediently assisted us and he was extremely helpful and polite.  Even though our issue was minor RJ dealt with it in a timely fashion and he took the time to educate us on how to take the best care of our tires so they would last longer.  I am thankful for his help and the nature in which he handled our issue.  I would strongly recommend this store and be sure to ask for RJ.
