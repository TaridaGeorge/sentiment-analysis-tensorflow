Dozo is a wonderful place to get quality sushi and genuinely friendly service.  The prices are fair and the owner (Robert) is fantastic, and always remembers our names even if we haven't been there in months.  The difference in experience compared to chain sushi spots like Ra and Stringray is incredible, and you won't regret supporting this amazing local business.
