Best run ever!   It may not be the longest but it sure was fun, and what a great cause! 
Only complaint I have (and I hate to complain about this cause)   When people sign up they for some reason like to put down that they are great runners with great times so they get put in the front of the group, well after the first mile they give up and walk, making obstacle for the rest of us.  If you have a chance to do this race, DO IT!
