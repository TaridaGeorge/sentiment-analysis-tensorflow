A meat feast!  Woo hoo!

I am STILL full. 

The staff was great. Everything was delicious. I really can't pick a favorite. I wish I would have been able to have more of what was offered at the salad bar, but I wanted to save as much room as possible for all the meat. And there was plenty of it. 

Thank you Rolando for taking us on a tour of the kitchen. This was so neat. I think he said all but 2 of the cooks were Brazilian.

And thank you Gabi for putting this together. We had an amazing time.  :)
