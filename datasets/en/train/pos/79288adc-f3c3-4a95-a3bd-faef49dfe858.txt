I love love this store!! Their reduced fat chicken salad and pasedena salads are to die for. The prepackaged frozen meals are also yummy! My daughter loves their yogurt and premade pasta meals. Their clif bars are 1/2 the price as supermarkets!! The employees are extremely nice and helpful. I would SO recommend this store to any and every one!!
