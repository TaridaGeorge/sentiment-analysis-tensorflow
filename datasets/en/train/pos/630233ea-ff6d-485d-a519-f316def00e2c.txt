I less than 3 Red Hot Robot. I really don't need any of the awesome cool kitschy things they sell but I want them anyway. Want them like crack.

Do I need I stuffed mustache I named General Robert E Lee? No. But they have him and I love. I also don't need the billions of tiny stuffed ninjas but they make my life somehow more complete. And safer. Nothing is safer than having an army of stuffed ninjas at your back.

Every time I come in the store is well laid out and as well stocked as possible considering most of what they sell is limited edition and awesome.

It's also super conveniently located next to Smeeks Candy Shop and the light rail.
