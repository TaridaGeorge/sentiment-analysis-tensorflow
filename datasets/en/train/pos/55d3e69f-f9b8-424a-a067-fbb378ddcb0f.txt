I selected Kai when having a special dinner with my son who lives in Phoenix. Binkley's is closed for the entire month of July, but Kai serves very nicely in its stead. While a few dishes were not outstanding (the melon soup and the roast buffalo were only good), other dishes represented the highest level of modernist cuisine (and the cocktails are great). For the main course, the squab is distinguished and as an appetizer the seared Wahoo is enlightened (I wish that I had ordered it other than my son), and it is impressive that the chef brings in Southwestern, Mexican, and Indian flavors. Kai's is first rate.
