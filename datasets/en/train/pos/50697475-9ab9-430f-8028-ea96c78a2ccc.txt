Wow!  Happy hour from 4-10 pm...everyday?  Who's heard of that.  While the location is downtown and deserted on Sunday night (when we went) the bartender was great and very attentive.  I live Guinness so for $4/pint you can't beat it.  The appetizers are also very tasty and 1/2 off.  We have been to the one in Hawaii which is old and only has happy hour from 4-7 so this is great.  I would definitely go back.
