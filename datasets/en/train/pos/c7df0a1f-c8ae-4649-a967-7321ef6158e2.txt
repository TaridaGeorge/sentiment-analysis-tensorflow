Wonderful family-owned business with the BEST tasting citrus (oranges, lemons, grapefruit).  We visit every year and pick up boxes of oranges to eat and to make juice.  Well worth the drive!  This is a family owned business and I believe the man now running it is at least 3rd generation.  Nice people and great "country-store" atmosphere.  Is a wonderful place for locals and visitors alike. 

 I also learned that they sell corn, squash, tomatoes and watermelons at another location off of Gilbert Rd. and Thomas beginning Memorial Day weekend.
