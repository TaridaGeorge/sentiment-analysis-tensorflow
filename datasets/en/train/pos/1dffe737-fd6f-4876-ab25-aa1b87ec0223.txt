Hyundai of Tempe is great folks. They walked me through my first car-buying experience. I managed to get a pretty good price on a nice ride. (Who knew you can still get a decent car for less than 10 grand?) The sales manager (Vic) cut me a deal because I was ex-Peace Corps. They have free hot dogs and soda. All in all, it was a pleasant  experience.
