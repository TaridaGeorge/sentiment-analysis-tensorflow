How delicious can BBQ pork be?  This great!  Had the pulled pork sandwich and the meat was incredible, the best I have had in Phoenix.  Waffle fries are really tasty.  The food was ready right now.  The owner and night chef went out of their way to explain the menu, the options and and suggestions.  

I cannot wait to try the ribs.  By the way, found POAF via Urban Spoon on the iPhone.

Pork on a Fork makes Thee Pits Again on Bell Rd and Dillons look like imposters.  You want juicy meat?  Pork on a Fork is the answer.
