We are IN LOVE with this place!!! We even took family here when they came from out of town. We are big produce buyers (don't buy much processed foods), and this place has amazing prices and quality of produce. If you are a healthy eater and eat mainly non-processed foods, I would HIGHLY recommend this place. It's nice and airy and not cramped at all. The staff is always very helpful!
