A great side trip when exploring the Phoenix area, located in a rural agricultural zone that seems out of place in the desert.  

This is a real olive mill, with tours too.  The small gift shop features their beautifully flavored olive oils, tapenades, olives (duh), and SAMPLES!  I would have to pass on the cupcakes made with olive oil though.  Not great.  The cute little deli where they put together a mean sandwich or two, salads, and other delectibles is a great lunch spot.    You can eat outside too, as long as the weather permits. Probably not a good idea during monsoon weather or the scorching heat of the summer.

If this charming little place were in Napa Valley, CA, it would be over the top slammin' busy.   Even as it is, it's an obvious popular stopping place that will help lower your blood pressure just to be there.
