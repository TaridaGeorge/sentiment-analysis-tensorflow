The bartender, Shelley,  ROCKS; she draws her clients in, treats them like old friends and truly makes this place shine!  I would recommend Don & Charlie's just for drinks at happy hour.  The bar regulars are a dashing group and it's a great place to go if you find yourself wanting a drink and happen to be on your own -- not weird at all to show up at the D&C's bar alone and Shelley will serve you dinner with all the white linen and formal touches you'd expect, right there at the bar.  
The food is top notch (primerib!) and the atmosphere is upscale in an understated way -- and the memorabilia collection is stellar.  Our server was fun and caught on that we wanted to treat our guests (my parents) special that night and she was spot on taking care of Mom and making their evening memorable.
