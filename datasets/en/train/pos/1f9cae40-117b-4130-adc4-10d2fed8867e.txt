Upon first look Pearl does not look like my type of place.  Trendy location/atmosphere often equals mediocre  food. Pearl is an exception to the rule. The sushi is creative and tasty and the drink specials rock. I love that they have different flavors for edamame, cheap bombers and did I mention the fish sticks are way to good. All of that would equal four stars in my book, fifth star is given to the staff. Steve is the type of bartender that others should aspire to be like. Knowledgeable and observant without being intrusive. Always goes the extra mile, I really appreciate how he makes my husband and I feel so comfortable. Overall great value and relaxed attitude.
