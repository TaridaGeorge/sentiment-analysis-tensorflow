You might have been by Honeymoon Sweets and wondered whether you can just wander in.  It does look sort of like a warehouse from the outside, but you really can just wander in.  Honeymoon probably makes most of its money selling its amazing huge intricate cakes for weddings and the like, but they do have a counter where they sell tarts and cookies and coffee. Their sweets are incredible and everyone just has such a (dare I say it) sweet disposition.  They make everything from scratch using the real stuff (butter and sugar, not canola oil and HFCS).  If you're in the area, stop in for a pastry, or if you are having house guests, pick up a box full for breakfast. And it really is worth it just to stop in and look at their amazing cakes.  They are works of art.  Mmmm, cake-art.
