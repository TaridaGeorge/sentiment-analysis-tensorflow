Love this place. I can come here and get a quality meal with fresh ingredients. I have used them as my study haven. The San Diegen is my favorite breakfast item, but I have to admit I have not ordered much else since I love it so much. I have never had a bad sandwich from here either. When I have reached my study milestone I will treat myself to a sweet treat. They are a real down home establishment.
