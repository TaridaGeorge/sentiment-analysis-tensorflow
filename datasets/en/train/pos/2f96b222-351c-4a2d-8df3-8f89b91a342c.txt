A great place to go for a game. Go for dinner. Or go on Saturday night and have fun with Tino's karaoke. The staff is always friendly ( Allison is our favorite). The food reminds me of the neighborhood places in Chicago. GREAT and plentiful. Helen and Cary make a drink that lets you know they want you to come back. And it's fun to see the Chicago sports memorabilia. And old Pictures from home. Like the newspaper from the Blizzard of 67. I always make sure to bring visitors to Jimmy's for a good time with great people. From the staff to the patrons. You always feel welcome at Jimmy's of Chicago.
