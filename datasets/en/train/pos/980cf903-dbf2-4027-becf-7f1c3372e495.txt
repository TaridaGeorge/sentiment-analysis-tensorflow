Waited 25 minutes with about 50 people on a Sunday evening.. all i can say is WORTH THE WAIT & THE PRICE 

The service is great the food comes out fast and they are constantly cleaning the buffet areas (cause we are all pigs!). The selection is everything from BBQ chicken and fries to a sushi & tempora stand, Mongolian wok, plenty of sea food, crab legs, 15 different kinds of shrimp, all you favorite Chinese buffet items, and some strange surprises. Escargot(snails) and lotus bean leaf wraps, squid, octopus, kimchi Duck, muscles, clams, asparagus. over 200 items. 

Dessert is from fresh fruit, canned fruit, pastries cookies cakes AND 8 self scoop BRYERS ice cream flavors! 

cons, The need some form of table waiting buzzer systems & they need pics for the escargo and crab legs. other than that perfect.
