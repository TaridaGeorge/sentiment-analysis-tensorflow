This place is fantastic-really.  I've been there a few times for brunch (mimosa flight anyone?) and a couple times for dinner and I've always been pleased.  The service is great-LOVE the atmosphere and patio-it's very close to North Mountain so it's a must when coming down from a Sunday morning hike-and it's pretty close to the canal-if you're feeling like a bike ride to brunch.  My favorite is the egg-white frittata-I always want to try other things but this is so good I can't say no to it!  For dinner-the sandwiches are phenomenal....and a fantastic wine selection!!!!
