This place might not look like much from the outside but the food on the inside is to die for!! Everything is freshly made and absolutely delicious! The owner is so friendly and very helpful and is always there which show me that he is dedicated to his work to make it the very best for his customers. That says alot! This place is VERY reasonably priced and the portions are great! Great lunch specials as well. Happy hour is severed there from 3pm-6pm
