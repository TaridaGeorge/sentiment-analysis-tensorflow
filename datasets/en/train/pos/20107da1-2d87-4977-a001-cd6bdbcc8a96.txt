You'll always be satisfied with the quality of Ted's food and services.  Their menu is simple, and they grill everything right in front of you to your liking.  I recommend ordering one of their famous hot dogs, but their burgers are just as delicious.  And the next time you find yourself at Ted's, do yourself a favor and order their made-from-scratch onion rings.  They're hands-down the best in town!
