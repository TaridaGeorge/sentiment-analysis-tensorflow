This was going to be the absolute last time we bought "Groupon." Had a bad experience with the last Groupon restaurant. We just decided only looser restaurants go with the Groupon thing. Changed our mind today. Some Groupons are hidden gems like this one. LOVED THE BREAD. The Calabrese was fantastic. Best Italian. Loved the Cannoli. Fresh. Super Great Quality. Clean and simple surroundings. He told us we could get our own Beer or Wine if we want. Next time I am taaking a bottle of Chianti. I am ready to go back for dinner tonight and just might. There is so much more on that menu I want to try. I want this place to be there forever, so spread the word and lets support this wonderful place...The owner was courteous, kind, prompt... and a great Host.
