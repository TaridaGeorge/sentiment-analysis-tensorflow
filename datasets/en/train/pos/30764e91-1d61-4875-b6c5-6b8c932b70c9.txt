My list of 'badass places' only contains of about 10 places in Phx; and SideBar is one of the best! It is perfectly located, perfect size, prefect crowd, amazing beer selections, and you can have Pei Wei delivered to you. SideBar is #2 on my list for best beer selections (Yardhouse is #1). I have been here numerous times and eachtime I find a new beer that takes my breath away. I have experienced everyday of the week here and Sundays are by far the best. The best DJ and the most eclectic crowd
