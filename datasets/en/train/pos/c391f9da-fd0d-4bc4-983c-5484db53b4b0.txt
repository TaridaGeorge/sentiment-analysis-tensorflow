I tried this place for the first time on Saturday and was very happy that I did. This is going to be one of my favorite breakfast places! The staff was top notch with fast friendly service. I had the ham and eggs with a pancake and hash browns. Everything was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  My friend had the made from scratch corned beef hash and it looked awesome so I will want to try that myself next time. They had a sign on the door "We don't serve fast food, we serve good food as fast as we can"  The strawberry preserves were really good, I was tempted to buy a jar of them on my way out. Price was reasonable for the quality and quantity of food I received. I will definitely be a regular here!
