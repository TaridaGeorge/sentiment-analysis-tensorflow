KJZZ,
Yesterday, due to a malfunction, you were off the air for about 20 minutes of my morning. I moved SO slowly, trying to get ready for work! And I realized how much I depend on you to make my mornings not suck. 
I especially love your international reports with National Geographic, and I've even grown to like the "This I Believe" segments.
The only thing I don't like is Car Talk. Oh well. You could make up for it by maybe adding more David Sedaris to your mornings????
Overall, you let me learn something new every day. And I love you for it.
