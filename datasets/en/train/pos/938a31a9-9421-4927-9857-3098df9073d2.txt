What a great new BBQ Restaurant in Glendale!  REAL smoked meats, done out back with a variety of quality wood every morning.  They feature "no oven" BBQ and the owner, Sommer, is happy to explain why this makes her fare so awesome!  Home made BBQ sauce is superb - can't wait to try some of her other flavors.  $2 bottle beers!   I will return!
