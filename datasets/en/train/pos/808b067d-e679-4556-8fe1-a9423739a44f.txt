I can't get enough of Ted's!  I'm in Tempe once or twice a week (at least) and I'll usually have lunch at Ted's.  They easily have the best hot dogs in the east valley.  There's always a line for lunch (depending on when you go--there have been times there wasn't a line when I walked in) and it can run the length of the building and out the side door.  Whatever your wait, it'll be worth it.  I stick with the all-beer hot dog or the foot- long dog with mustard, chili and cheese, a side of fries and a large drink and they get $9 from me--and I happily hand it over.
