Amazing food, every single time. I have never had a single complaint about the quality or the service. Cibo is doing it right.

Side note: I recently had a birthday get-together here and they were quick to set up the tables for our reservation and were very attentive. The patio was beautiful with all the plants and twinkle lights. Thanks!
