I have to say, its so nice to find what I consider, a great family resturant.   They have a great menu selection, and the atmosphere is relaxed and warm. Great family dining.

Being that its an italian resturant, I feel that they serve all of the great traditional italian food, with out the "chain resturant" feel.   Calzones, Pasta, pizza, salads, etc.  Great full menu, with lots of selection!  They also seem to have quite a variety of wine to choose from as well!!  I love it!

Now mind you, I only had a greek salad when I was here, so my experience with eating off the menu was limited, but it was tasty, none the less.  Its a great casual enviroment, and the resturant seems to be well kept and clean.  Warm, friendly staff members, with a lovely atmosphere.
