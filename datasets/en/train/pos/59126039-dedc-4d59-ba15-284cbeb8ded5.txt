I love Golden Spoon. First of all they have great hours especially for being in Mesa where the entire city closes down around 6pm. Secondly I babysit my 2 year old cousin quite a bit and she loves picking out topping here for her yogurt and the staff are always extremely nice to me and her even though she sometimes takes a bit to decide what she wants. they even let her try some of the toppings to see which one she liked. I make sure that she isn't one of those crazy screaming kids and that she doesn't hold up a line but I appreciate a place that is nice to little kids. They always have a fun selections of yogurts and the toppings are always fresh. So check them out the next time you see one.
