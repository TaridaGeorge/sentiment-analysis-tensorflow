Dr Kwan is extremely thorough in her approach.  I have been impressed by her dedication to really understanding the needs of her patients and not just bottling up one remedy for everyone.  instead, she looks into all aspects of your condition and determines what she thinks will be best for you.  Her expertise has helped me and I would certainly recommend her to anyone looking for a Naturopathic Physician.  She's the best there is!
