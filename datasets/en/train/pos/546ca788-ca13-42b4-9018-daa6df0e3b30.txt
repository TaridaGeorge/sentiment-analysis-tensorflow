We love NaRai Thai and Sushi.  Great happy hour prices.   Friendly service.  I enjoy the Panang chicken or beef it is my personal favorite and their Lychee Martini.  If you like it hot go for level 5.  Which personally I like it hotter ask for the (Prik Nam Pla) it is a Thai sauce to add for a salty spicy kick.  My  husband enjoys the sushi and Pad Thai chicken.   You won't be disappointed.
