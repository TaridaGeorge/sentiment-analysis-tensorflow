The bar is superb. Rich and Tyson are the real deal. This is the only place I've been to in a Red State that matches the authentic quality of East Coast bars. 

Food? Never tried it, and who cares? Go to Applebees for that. A bar is all about the drinks, the bar tenders' personality and service, and the vibe. I will definitely be coming back.

(Anyone who is a regular, feel free to connect with me. I just moved to Phoenix from Boston and I'm looking for other expats...or those who are East Coast at heart)
