Why the 5 star review you say?... well the fact that gas is the cheapest here earns there them the 5 star rating. Yes this costco can be filled with people and yes there are a lot of old people here, yet this costco is amazing.  The staff here has always been helpful and the facilities here are really well kept. The Optometrist here is pretty awesome and he soo nice. I would definitely recommend this costco.
