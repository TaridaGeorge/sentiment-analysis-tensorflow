This place gets HIGH marks in my book!! I have been twice and I really don't know when I would stop.  I've had a few things on the menu (
soft pretzels & provolone Fondue, 
Chicken Curry, 
36 Hour pork rib, 
Butternut squash Cannelloni, and Bistro Steak).  All were extremely delicious and fantastic!!  We shared plates and the chef split the portions up for us. WOW!! As far as drinks go, my fave has to be the Acai Mojito.  It's one of those drinks that taste so good and before you know you are having number 3 and BOOM your drunk. LOL! 

The salty caramel desert is DIVINE!! Creamy custard goodness!!

I highly RECOMMEND this place! The decor is unique, mismatch furniture  and extravagant chandeliers. GENIUS!
