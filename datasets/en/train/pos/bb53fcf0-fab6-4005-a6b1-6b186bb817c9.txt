We have been here SO many times, with SO many different kids and people - EVERYONE loves it.

A nice little place with delicious popsicles (paletas!) - definitely try the key lime one - really good. And the sour lemon.

Some people really like the chocolate one - spicy - and my son loves the orange one. The arroz con leche one was good too.

Go try those paletas made by Betty that have a bite taken out, and stick that sticker on the wall!

Also, it's best to keep track of their ever-changing selection/availability on their constantly-updated website! Very nice touch!
