Lived in house for 9 years and just thought was time to replace the carpeting, had used some of those "$99 room" services over the years for routine cleaning, met Ray Odom, Owner of Hydro-Pro, and gave them a crack at cleaning the carpets before I replaced them. I was Amazed at results, by the time they were done the carpets looked brand new, took their time and did incredibally throrugh job.  Great service at reasonable price-well worth it. My carpet cleaner from now on.
