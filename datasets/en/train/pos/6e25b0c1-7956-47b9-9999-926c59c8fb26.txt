When I say I enjoy Boston Market people are like what... This is a one of a kind Boston Market the staff is always so friendly and will help you pick the best meal and joke around.  I always order the Quarter White Rotisserie Chicken with a side of Corn, Loaded Mashed Potatoes and Squash Casserole. The staff is so helpful they bring the food to what table you pick and are always around to fill your drink or get anything you need. The meal is always great and I can't get enough Squash Casserole so good...  I will be back soon for sure.
