The Armadillo Grill is where it's at for Philly Cheese Steaks! My boyfriend and I have searched high and low through Phoenix seeking out a better Philly and have yet to find it. I mean, it's not the prettiest place but who cares? If you want to relax and get your grub on, do a little off-track betting and drink an ice cold beer, this is your place. We often take family and friends here for a low key yummy dinner and boozin'. The service is always great and you're likely to have the owner stop by and ask you how your meal was. I love that:) It's a big place with a big bar and plenty of TV's. It's easy to miss so keep your eyes peeled!!
