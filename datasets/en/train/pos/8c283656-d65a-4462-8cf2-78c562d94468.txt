I went online and read the reviews to find a good barber shop for my son. This one was close to us, and had great reviews, so I though I would give it a try. Its a small whole in the wall, but we walked in and were helped immediately. He asked what kind of haircut and went to cutting, styled the hair, straight razor to the side hair  and massage to the back for a few minutes, 30 minutes later we were asked to pay $14 and I gave $20. I thought it was worth the extra tip. We were happy with the service and cut. I recommend the Spot Barber Shop.
