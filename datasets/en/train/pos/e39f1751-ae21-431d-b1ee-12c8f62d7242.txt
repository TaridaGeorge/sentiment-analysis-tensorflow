This is a little kiosk of a restaurant/dining area inside the hotel/casino.  I highly recommend you try it.  The seafood was GREAT and fresh.  I had the shrimp cocktail appetizer and then the shrimp boil.  Very good!  I came back the next night and had one of their specialties and it was excellent as well.  I wholeheartedly recommend that you try it.   Especially if you like shrimp, oysters and such.

I agree, this is a hidden gem and it won't be the last time I go there.
