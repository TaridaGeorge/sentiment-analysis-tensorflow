I always get great food and fast service at Dave's.   I have not found better bar-b-que in local Chandler area.    I recommend the Texas Pit BBQ sauce, but my family loves that you get multiple sauce choices.   The cornbread is awesome, and we always get the famous breadpudding (I tell people who claim they don't like breadpudding that they cannot be sure they don't like breadpudding until they try Dave's as it is the best).
