I always have a Soup Nazi moment here. Once I ordered a 'Navajo Taco' and not an 'Indian Taco' -- a mistake I will not make again. They are hardcore, but pretty much some of the best food you'll find in Arizona. Every time I sit down to my Indian Taco, I think...this should be the official food of Arizona.
