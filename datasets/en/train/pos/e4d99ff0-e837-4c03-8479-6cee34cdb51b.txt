I have been meaning to post a review about this place, I have tried this place a few times. I only get to try it when I go to Arizona, from Cali to visit my friend attending ASU. Really enjoy the pizza here, great taste, sauce, cheese, toppings in general! I am really sad now that my friend has moved back to Cali, for work! Don't know when I will go back to Arizona.
