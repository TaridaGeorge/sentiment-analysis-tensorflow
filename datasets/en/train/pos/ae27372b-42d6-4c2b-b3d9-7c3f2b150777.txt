OMG! this place is heaven for women and everyone who wants the place they live to be awesome and do it on a poor mans budget. I buy almost everything here and love to take newbies there and watch their mouths hit the floor. Between the size of the store, the low prices to that heavenly smell of cinnamon rolls baking ALL DAY,  you can't lose.
