Best Vietnamese food in the west valley!  Price is right too, and the owner and young servers are friendly.  Try number 52 for a special treat.  Includes beef,shrimp,egg roll, noodles and salad greens and sprouts with a dipping sauce. 
 Even served  cleverly in a boat.  Lots of flavor, very fresh....and we are picky.
