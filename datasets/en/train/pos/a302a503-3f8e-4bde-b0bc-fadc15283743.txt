Me and my family have been going here for years.  They have THE best Mexican Take-out food in AZ.  If I could name anything on the menu that IS NOT delicious, I would, but every item on the menu is superb!  The menu is limited to quite a few items, but every item is too good to pass up.  I highly recommend any of their burritos enchilada style... You won't find a better tasting burrito enchilada style in the state!  Also, it's not on their menu, but on occasion they will sell shredded beef tacos which are deeeeeeeeelicious.  You have to ask one of the 2, very nice, cashiers if tacos are being served.  A PHENOMENAL place that I highly recommend!!!
