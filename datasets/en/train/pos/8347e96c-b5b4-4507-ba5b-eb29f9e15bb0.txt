Delicious and inexpensive, exactly like Chinese place in NY (except the egg rolls are small). The soups are dead on as is the cuisine. My favorite is the Boneless Rib Tips and Egg Foo Young. The Pork Fried Rice is delicious. The Roast Pork and Vegetables is also perfect. Here is a hint go for an early dinner 2:55pm and order a lunch special for 5 bux. The one negative is the Sesame Chicken is not the same as you are used to, very garlic-ey. The family meal is well worth the $29.99 price and will get you stuffed and feeds 5-8, I'd say!
Overall DELICIOUS AND CHEAP!
** WAY BETTER THAN CHEN'S OR MOON CHINA.....**
