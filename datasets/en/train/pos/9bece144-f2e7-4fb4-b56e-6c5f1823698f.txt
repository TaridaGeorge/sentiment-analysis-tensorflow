Hands down the best place to get a burger in Tempe. This place pwns in and out and five guys. I usually get the big one, but have fucked around with the tijauno torpedo, as well as the great big one (too much meat for my taste). They also have great appetizers (mushrooms, and onion rings), but tend to avoid the fries. The wings here are unique, worth a try, but stick with the burgers.
