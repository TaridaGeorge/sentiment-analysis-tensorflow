I absolutely (heart) smashburger!! This is definately a place worth raving about.

We have never been to this place before but decided to give it a try since it was on our way to the movies.

This is what I call a BOMB burger joint!! You know that you found a great burger place when you feel that you need a freakin' bib in order to eat there. 

Everything is absolutely delicious and fresh. Meat, veggies, fries... Mushroom and Swiss Burger is a burger worth trying - more than once.

smashburger will now be on our regular rotation! ;)
