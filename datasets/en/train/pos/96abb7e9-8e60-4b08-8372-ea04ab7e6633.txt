Being from Michigan and Arizona, I know my BBQ....what of really? Ok fine...I have never had good bbq....BUT

Joes does it right...quick, tasty and priced right. 

The pulled pork sandwich appeared to be lacking meat on the over sized bun but once into it it felt just fine!

The sauce was good and had a great flavor. 

The side of beans were killer with hunks of meat and veggies...YUMMY

The mac and cheese was the surprise standout for me. Usually it is just good but this was great. Nice crust on top and nice blend of cheeses. 

Go early for lunch and you can zip right through the lines.
