love this place. i worked on a project with their store once in college and thought i probably should check this place out before i work on it..ended up buying about 5 pieces of jewelry. they have the best selection of little dresses for women and my boyfriend even enjoyed the guy section [he is hard to impress.] i highly suggest this place if you like unique accessories and clothing.
