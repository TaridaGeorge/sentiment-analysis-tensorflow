Best Beef Gyro I've ever had. The entire staff are very friendly and attentive. This is by far my favorite place. Even when my mom comes into town from Texas she always askes me to take her to lunch here. The prices are very reasonable; and the portions are appropriate.  Everything is made fresh. I also love love love the salmon dish and sautee spinach.
