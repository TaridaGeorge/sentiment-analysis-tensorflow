It's worth the hype! 

Reasons being:

1) Tons of flavors, most that you could not find anywhere else like SWEET CORN!
2) They don't skimp on samples. In fact, the woman working encouraged me to keep trying more!
3) Turtle sundae. Whoa baby.
4) Prices aren't outta control.
5) Seating both inside & out.
