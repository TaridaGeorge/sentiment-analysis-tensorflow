Ish Salon is a wonderful place to have your hair styled or if you need a new "do". I recently had a bad color on my hair, I went back to Andrew at Ish because he has ALWAYS performed his magic with my hair and has it looking fantastic. Well he did it again. I promise not to go to anyone else when it comes to my hair. Ish is the best and they even helped me with my new IPhone. They are the BEST!
