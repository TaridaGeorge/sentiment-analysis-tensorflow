This is one of Scottsdale's hidden gems - all wine drinkers need to stop in. Tom (the owner) has a fantastic selection of wine - and he marks them up fractions compared to other wine shops. He's extremely knowledgeable and can recommend the perfect bottle of wine for your tastes. If you're looking for a particular bottle that he doesn't sell, he can easily get it in for you, too. 

Cheers!
