Butter & Me Cupcakery.....What fantastic cakes and cupcakes!!!  The rating should be a 8 but then you might not believe that rating.  
Kelly makes some amazing items for the majority of humanity, but when one has to satisfy those that are Vegans, which means no ingredients that have any animal content, Kelly can really shine.  I had her make two separate cakes, different occasions, for my wife and my daughter and both came out so wonderful that even those of us that like cakes with the other stuff in them found the taste as good.  None of the visitors were told that the cakes were Vegan till after all had eaten.  The comments were that they could not tell any difference.  
Thank you very much Butter & Me, you helped make the events a wonderful success.   Ed
