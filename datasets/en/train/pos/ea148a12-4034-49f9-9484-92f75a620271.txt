This is my brother's favorite sushi place! We took him here for his birthday and they did an amazing job making his birthday special. They have this fun multi-colored strobe light that they turn on when they play their "Happy Birthday" song. It was really sweet. Also, the sushi is fresh and tasty. Their happy hour prices are cheap! My brother loves the "all you can eat buffet" for only $20.
