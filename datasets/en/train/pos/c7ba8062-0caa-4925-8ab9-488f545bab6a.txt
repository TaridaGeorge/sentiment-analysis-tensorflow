Delux is great - lots of good beers on tap.  also a bunch of vegetarian options - grilled cheese is great as is the caprese sandwich.  we usually sit at the bar which is good.  they have a great patio even though it overlooks a parking lot.  inside seating is not for me - it's like long picnic benches where if its crowded you are right next to strangers.   something i hate.  great atmosphere and a smallish tv which usually has sports on it.
