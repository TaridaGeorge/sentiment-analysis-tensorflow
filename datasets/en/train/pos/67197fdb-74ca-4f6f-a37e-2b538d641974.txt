Love this restaurant!! My daughter and I had dinner on a Thursday night, and it was hopping! I loved the atmosphere and music was just the right level of loud.  Our server, Danielle, was amazing!! She was very attentive and took great care of us. The starters were very interesting. We had a hard time choosing, but decided on the goat brie with cherry marmalade and rustic bread-delicious!! Then we tried the homemade hummus with artichokes, olives and cherry tomatoes-all served with warm pita bread. Such delicate flavors for what I thought was a pretty ordinary dish. The entree was sweet potato tortellini with mushrooms, brussel sprouts and hazelnuts in a light butter cream sauce. It was one of the most unique and delicious meals I've had in a long time.  I will definitely be back!!!
