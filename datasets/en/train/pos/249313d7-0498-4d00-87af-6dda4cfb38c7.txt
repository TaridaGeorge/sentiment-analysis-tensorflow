We didn't get a chance to try the deli, but the pepperoni was delicious and made some awesome pizzas at home.  The homemade sausage was delicious, lots of fennel seed, parsley, and mozzerella.  YUM!  

They've got a great selection of canned Italian tomatoes, olive oil, pasta, olives, frozen desserts, meats and cheeses, balsamic vinegars and more!  The tomatoes (Cento) I bought were so delicious and flavorful... made a great dinner with bread, olive oil and pasta also purchased at Defalco's.

I'd definitely come back... I'd love to try the deli items (anti-pasta, salads, etc) and OMG the desserts looked amazing!!!
