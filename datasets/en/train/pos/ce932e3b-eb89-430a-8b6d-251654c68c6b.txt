I've been here waaaay too much, first of all if you've never had Viet food I suggest getting an order of spring rolls or egg rolls for appetizers and a bowl of beef pho with meatballs for entree. Or if you feel like a rice plate, pick the pork chop and butterfly shrimp. You can never go wrong with what I just listed.
