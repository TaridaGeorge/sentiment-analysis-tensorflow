We were on our way to Las Vegas and read about the The Vulture Mine in Wickenburg, AZ.  We decided to stop by and take a tour of the town.  You better have your batteries charged and enough memory on your camera.  I literally took over 300+ pictures here!  Definately a ghost town with awesome photo ops- buildings, old cars, vintage furniture, etc.  The pricing is very cheap and well worth the visit!
