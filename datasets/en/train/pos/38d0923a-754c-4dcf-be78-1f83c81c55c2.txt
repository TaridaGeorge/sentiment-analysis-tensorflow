Absolutely love this place! My very active American Eskimo/sheltie mix puppy go to doggy daycare several days a week and comes home absolutely exhausted from playing with all his buddies! This is also where he stays when we go out of town on the weekends... They dont kennel the dogs so they are free to find there own little sleeping spots on doggy beds and staff is there overnight to keep an eye on everyone. He absolutely adores the people who work there. The staff is very friendly and helpful. LOVE this place!
