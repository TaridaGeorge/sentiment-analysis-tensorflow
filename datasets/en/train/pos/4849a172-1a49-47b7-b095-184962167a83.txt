This place adorable! The staff and owner are authentic Italian, and you can taste the authenticity in the food. They use the freshest ingredients and I believe they make everything there on site (as in, all the sauces, etc.). And when they bring the check, they bring everyone a free lemon-cello shot! The atmosphere is so cute and it's very intimate. A great date spot or a nice place to take visiting parents.
