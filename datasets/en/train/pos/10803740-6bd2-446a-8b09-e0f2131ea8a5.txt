I LOVE this place!! Such a cool, unique vibe.  I love the assortment of broths (if you like hot, get the tom yum or house spicy).  The choice of veggies and meats is extensive.  I always wind up having to google some of the menu items! This place is great for adventurous eaters.  AWESOME for groups!
