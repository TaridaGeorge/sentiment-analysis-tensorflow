This is by far one of my husbands and my FAVORITE spots.  Living up north off of Cave Creek there are not a lot of options.  Many restaurants have occupied this space all of which we hated.  Amazing lounge area with lots of TVs, free wifi and  great staff.  Matt or Kevin usually wait on us in that area and we now actually consider them friends were there so much!!!  Only bad thing is you can not sit in the lounge area with kids...which is awesome now but will be annoying once we spawn. Gluten free options for me and when we feel like cheating delicious artichoke dip!   Patio was nice in the spring and were looking forward for the cooler weather to sit out there again.  YUMMIE PIZZA, BEER, WINE  AND SALADS and a good spot for watching sports!
