Love this place, and now the hours are expanded! This place is so authentic but also clean and friendly enough to take the family to anytime. While they are known for the Pork I still love the spicy chicken burrito and the Vampiro! I don't think Melrose has a bad restaurant, seriously just park anywhere and walk. America's is the best for all around Mexican that you can take anyone to. I just had a friend visit from Mexico and she loved it so I feel great about my choice!
