This place is so good! My boyfriend brought it home for dinner one night and wow! We got a cheese pizza and a meat lovers of some sort and I've never once actually enjoyed a cheese pizza before Spinato's!  Also their home made sauce is sort of sweet  which I really enjoyed. When went back again on another occasion and they were all very friendly and the atmosphere was very warm and inviting. This place has definitely become a date night go to for my boyfriend and I!
