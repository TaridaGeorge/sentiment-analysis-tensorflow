I love my Trader Joe's!
I need a weekly T-Joe's fix, and this location definitely helps me with that. They have a REALLY good selection of..well... everything. The employees are super friendly, and the manager is extremely helpful and friendly as well. I have never gotten anything that was bad from here. And here's a quick tip: If you're looking for a quick and delicious meal I would say try the Orange Chicken (in the frozen food section) and try there fully cooked brown rice(by all the other rice, gee.. who would of thought that?) and it makes one amazing meal. I am always craving my T-Joe's Orange Chicken, Mmm mmm!
