LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE HERE! The server was very friendly and personable.  I took my mom here when she was in town from Colorado after my boyfriend recommended it.  It's all inside, but you feel like you are outside.  It is important to note that it is NOT THE SAME MENU as the VIG, but that does not discount the food quality whatsoever.  There is small overlap so that I am not confusing anyone.  Menu is not overwhelming, it is actually relatively small, but I liked that.  

It's cool to see a spin off of the same restaurant in a different area.
