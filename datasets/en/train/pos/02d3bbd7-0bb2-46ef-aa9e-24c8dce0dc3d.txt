If you're coming here, you know this stuff is absolutely horrible for you. BUT THAT'S THE POINT!

The lard fries were amazing.
The burger was absolutely mouthwatering delicious.
The Mexican sugar cola was tasty.

Yeah, maybe I put on a half pound or so in the process, its fattening as hell and dunked in grease and butter, but it's damn tasty. Couple that with hot girls running around in nurse outfits serving you up and you've got yourself a winner. The owner was awesome too, real laid back and chill guy. The fact you have to throw on a hospital gown and the overall atmosphere of the place is pretty amusing and cool. 

This place is no gimmick, if you want a bomb burger and fries and don't mind tossing over a G of calories in your system, slide through!
