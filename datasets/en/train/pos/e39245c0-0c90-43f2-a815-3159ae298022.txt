Sit on side if busy. Henna is of okay quality but I would not use it again on my hair, instead use the body quality henna on your hair. The Arabic coffee is a great treat before or after your meal, so thick and chocolatey.  I hate Pita Jungle and places like Haji's is why!

It can get kind of loud with people running their mouth and the place being so small with sounds bouncing off of the walls, but if you bring enough people with you to strong-arm a big enough table you are set to at least be comfortable.
