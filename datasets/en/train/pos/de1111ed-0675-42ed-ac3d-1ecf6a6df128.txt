This is by far the best sandwich place in the whole valley in my opinion. I love sandwiches too!

The owners are great, super friendly and makes it a point to remember people and make them feel welcome, even when it is packed.

The food is awesome, and the service is fast. The prices are great. When I worked in the area I went there almost daily and it was cheaper than going to McDonalds etc to get a similar size meal. I tell everyone I know to go there, and you should check it out!
