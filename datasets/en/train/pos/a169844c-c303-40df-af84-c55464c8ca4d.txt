I know, this place from the outside does not look great. The sign is broken, the building looks worn out. 

Don't let the outside scare you. Hole in the wall type of place but the best darn donuts in town! You have to get there early because they are usually out of donuts by 8:30am. 

The Donut Lady is as sweet as her donuts. She is there every day but Sundays. I call ahead sometimes for the croissants because those run out first. 

The place looks run down however in this day and age where people are losing their jobs and businesses, God bless the Donut Lady for keeping her American Entrepreneurial Dream alive.
