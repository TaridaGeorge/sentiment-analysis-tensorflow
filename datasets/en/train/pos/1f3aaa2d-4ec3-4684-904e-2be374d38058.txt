Love it! I've been lucky enough to make it in there a few times since they opened and love the Purple Rain and the Real Mint Chip. The place is very tastefully decorated and is always clean. The owners take great pride in the flavors they create and that everything is homemade. If you haven't been there already, I highly recommend you get over there and try a scoop for yourself!!!
