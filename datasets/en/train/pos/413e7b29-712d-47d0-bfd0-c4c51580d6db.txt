I'm staying at the Care Free Resort and find the resort's restaurant to be overpriced. I based my decision to go here for breakfast on the 1 review before mine and it did not disappoint.

the waitress there  is super friendly and welcoming, she's a great person to chit chat with and ask for advice on what to do where to go. 

The food is pretty darn good! If you're looking for a good, affordable breakfast menu, this is the place to go. Pancakes, eggs, toast, biscuits & gravy, omlets, etc. . .

You can't go wrong!
