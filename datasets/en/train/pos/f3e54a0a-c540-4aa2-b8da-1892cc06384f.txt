My wife and I are big fans of Bella Luna, It is where we go for our date nights. The service, staff and of course the food are all phenomenal!!! 

I had the "Surf and turf Italian" It consisted of grilled shrimp and Filet Mignon covered with a pesto sauce. I was able to cut the Filet with my FORK. The same could be said for my wife who had the Veal Piccata. It was probably the best Italian meal we've had in a long time. 

The Tiramisu all I can say is WOW!!! One of the best I have ever had.
