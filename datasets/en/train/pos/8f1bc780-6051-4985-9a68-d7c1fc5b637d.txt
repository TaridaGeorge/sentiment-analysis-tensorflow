I see one review that complains about organizational money scandals, but I was just there to see the garden and the art.  If it is true it is sad.  This place is a gem!

And the Chihuly glass installation was wonderful.  I realize it is just temporary so I do not see it as demeaning the nature of the garden.  If anything it gets more locals to visit and support the place.  It feels both organic and alien.  Eye candy even!

By all means go see it.  You might be surprised.
