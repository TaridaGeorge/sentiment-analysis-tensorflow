I went there the other day to mail a package. 

Scott, the guy behind the counter, was an interesting character. He was super beyond-all-reason helpful. He had this strange Southern accent that I've never heard before. He made the experience almost surreal. 

Should you ever need Fedex services and you're in the area, go there. Ask for Scott. If he's not there go back later and see if he's working. It's worth it. 

Other than that, there was just a lot of copying and regular business stuff going on.
