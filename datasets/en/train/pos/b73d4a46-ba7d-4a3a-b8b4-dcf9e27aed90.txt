First things first... FREE WIRELESS?!!! I love you Sky Harbor. I don't travel very often for work but when I do I always end up having to pay $6 for 2 hours worth of wireless, and I often only get to use about 45 minutes of that before I have to board my flight. This does not make me happy.

So free wireless would get you 5 stars in my book, but add on the fact that it was the fastest check-in and security process I've ever been through (on a Friday morning no less!!), makes me love this airport. Hopefully I will get to come back to Phoenix Sky Harbor because although I'd never thought I would say it, this airport made travel a pleasant experience!

Go Phoenix!
