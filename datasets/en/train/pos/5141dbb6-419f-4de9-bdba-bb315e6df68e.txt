We stopped in last night for dog food suggestions. We had been going to petsmart but noone could truly answer our questions about the dog food. The gal there was super nice, was able to answer and recommend a different dog food since 1 of our 3 dogs would no longer eat the life source bits in his blue buffalo. Grr but since his bread is common for chicken allergies we wanted to stay away from chicken. We ended up choosing the pinnacle. And last night man did he eat it faster than ever!! Will definately be back!
