I have been frequenting this restaurant since 2004. This is the finest Chinese food establishment you'll find in the greater Phoenix area. I would highly recommend Chaos Chicken (spicy), sesame chicken or the sweet and sour chicken, which is my wife's favorite. If you're in the mood for quality Chinese you've found it.
