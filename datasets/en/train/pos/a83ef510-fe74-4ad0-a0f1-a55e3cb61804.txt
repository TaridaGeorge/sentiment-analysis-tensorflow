BREAKFAST BURRITO.

Hands down, that's the most famous item on their menu. I can get one every week without getting sick of it. I know that whenever someone leaves this town they always miss Nico's Breakfast Burrito. Don't eat at the shack though. The tables in front are not always cleaned, flies are everywhere and mostly it's just not the place to enjoy the food. Do yourself a favor, go home and sit in front of the tv enjoying the famous Nico's Breakfast Burrito.
