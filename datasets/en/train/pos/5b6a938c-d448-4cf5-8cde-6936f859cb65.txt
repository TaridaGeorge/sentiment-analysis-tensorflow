Wow I blown away how nice this Walmart Neighborhood  Market is. It is not the typical Walmart. The place was spotless and fully stocked. My hubby and I found the item that we could not find anywhere else. It sure was nice to see the assistant manager out on the floor. The lines were unbelievably short and fast. The cashier was very friendly. It is nice to leave the store without a greeter or security checking your receipt. I highly recommend this store to everyone. This store is focused on grocieries and everyday items like pet care. I encourage all fellow yelpers to give this store a visit.
