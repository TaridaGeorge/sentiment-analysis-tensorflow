I came to batteries plus after going to a couple of other stores that didn't have the batteries I needed. The batteries I needed were extremely small, smaller than hearing aid batteries, and they had little Japanese writing on them. When I went to Batteries Plus I walked up to the counter, and asked if they had these batteries. After waiting about 1 minute the gentleman emerged from their back room with the batteries I needed. I have never seen so many batteries in my life. For all of your battery needs, visit Batteries Plus!
