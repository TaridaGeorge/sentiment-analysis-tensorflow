MMMMM....finally checked this place out last week and I'm so happy that I did. I can't stop thinking about the burger I had! Smokey with a great , grilled-in-your-backyard taste, with pickles and mustard. DELISH.

As I pulled up to the drive-thru window I couldn't help but notice the sticker "The people at Yelp love us". YES WE DO! 

A true diamond in the rough, I will be back.
