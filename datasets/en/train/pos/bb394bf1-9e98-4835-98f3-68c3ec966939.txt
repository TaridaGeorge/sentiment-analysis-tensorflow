I have been a Netflix member since 2001, and I don't intend to stop anytime soon.

I've always been able to get the movies I wanted quickly, even new releases that I wanted to check out. The replacement service is great for the times when you get a bad dvd (usually a cracked on from the delivery) and they've never let me down with price, selection or service.

I too did a head to head vs BB, and Netflix is way better.
