Crimpers is hidden in a small strip mall on E. Chandler Boulevard. Frank, the salon owner was so kind and genuine and went to work on me immediately asking questions and listening to my endless chatter of salons I've visited in the area. An hour later, I was done and very pleased at my new look! Frank wouldn NOT take a tip and charged me nearly nothing for the treatment I've paid big bucks for at other area salons! This is a great find!
