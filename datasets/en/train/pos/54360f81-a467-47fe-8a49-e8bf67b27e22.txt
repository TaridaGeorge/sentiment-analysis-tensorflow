I went to see a show at The Tempe Center for the Arts with my son few weeks ago. Rock the Presidents was showing and it was highly entertaining! The venue was incredibly beautiful. The music was fantastic, the cast was incredible, and the presentation was just phenomenal. We loved it! My son learned so much about the leaders of our country in a 70 minute show. There were students screaming and dancing, fist-pumping, having a blast rocking with the presidents. Thank you for providing such great entertainment! Deserves 5 stars!!
