As told by Damon Gogh:

There's nothing I could say to make you try to feel okay,
And nothing you could do to stop me feeling the way I do.
And if the chance should happen that I never see you again,
Just remember that I'll always love you.

I'd be a better person on the other side I'm sure.
You'd find a way to help yourself,
And find another door.
To shrug off minor incidents,
And make us both feel proud.
I'd just wish I could be there to see you through.

You always were the one to make us stand out in a crowd,
Though every once upon a while your head was in a cloud.
There's nothing you could never do to ever let me down,
And remember that I'll always love you.
