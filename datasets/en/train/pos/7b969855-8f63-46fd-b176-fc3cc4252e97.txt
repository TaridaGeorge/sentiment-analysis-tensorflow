I cannot say enough good things about this place, just GO! Service is excellent, food is ALWAYS top notch. I've had nearly everything on the menu. I'm very picky with my food and all the dishes rates 'above average' up to 'stellar'! 

Seafood soup is very good and the mushroom soup is one of the best I've ever had, period. The Insalata con Rucola  comes with the raspberry vinaigrette but I recommend the champagne dressing on any salad as it is amazing. My favorite "normal" dish is the Pollo alla Genovese.

Go and enjoy!
