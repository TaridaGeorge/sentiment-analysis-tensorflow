BW3 in Arizona????

OMG! I am so pumped. Nothing is better than chilling at a BW's on a saturday getting ready to watch your favorite college football game.

They have huge tv's, huge selection of beers and some of the best wings ever (imo). You think hooters has good wings...make a trip to bw's and you'll never go back!

You must try the spicy garlic sauce it is delish. My mouth salivates just thinking about it.
