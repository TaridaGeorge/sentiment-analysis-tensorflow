I came here for the first time with a deal of the day, don't remember which one, I had a really great experience with Krista.  I am now a regular and I love how easy it is to either book online or call/text Krista and get an appointment.  They have the best prices for shellac/gelish manicures.  I wash my hands constantly and this is the only kind of manicure that will last more than three days.  I actually get bored of having the same for so long, which is a great thing.
