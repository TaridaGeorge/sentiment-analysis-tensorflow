Excellent and unique!!  The steak quesadilla is huge...a meal in itself.  It was fried to crispy, flaky perfection.  The tacos - el gaucho steak and cochinita pork - were very delicious.  Prices were very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food.  It's a smaller place but we went at 4 pm before it got crowded.  It's a must for taco lovers.
