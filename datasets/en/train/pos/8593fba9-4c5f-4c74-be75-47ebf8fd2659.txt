Delicious food.

I discovered Asadero while driving down 16th Street one day.

Normally, rolling down 16th Street means a few nice whiffs of gnarly sewer fumes.  But on that day, as I drove by a restaurant, I smelled the best grilled meat smoke ever.  I had to make a u-turn to see where this was coming from, and I had to try it out.

When you walk inside the smell of grilled asada is pure heaven.  The food does not disappoint.  The charro beans are great (I think there's some cerveza and bacon involved).  I'd recommend the parillada- it's a great way to order up a variety of meats to share with a group (my favorites are the asada and the barbacoa).

Great tacos, burritos, very good mesquite roasted chicken, and pretty much awesome all around.  My favorite Mexican place in the area!
