X O Lent!  No! I don't mean the cognac! First off, food was great.  I don't know what "real" Jamaican food taste like or look like, but I gather it's similar to what I ate or hope it is :)  This is a small place so if you want to try it out go during the weekday like I did.  It's a BYOB restaurant so like your best friends NFL gathering bring what you want to drink - though unlike your friends gathering they'll charge you for what you bring, but the price is not bad...really!  Our server tonight was on top of it.  I give this place 2 thumbs up!
