Wow. 

The food was amazing. The service was amazing. And the company was amazing. 

There's nothing more that needs to be said. Good work, Tanzy. Good work.




Oh...there actually IS one more thing...Isaiah was ridiculously good at his job. Sincere, knowledgeable, and pretty damn funny too. He could be running the place!
