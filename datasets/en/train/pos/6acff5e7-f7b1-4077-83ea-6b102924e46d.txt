I love this boutique. The ladies that work there are super friendly and they have a ton of cute clothes as well as Steve Madden shoes and purses. I got a cute LBD and a shirt for $60. Oh and they give you heels to wear while you try on the dresses. I love it. They also have really good customer service. We went in right before they closed last week and they didn't ask us to leave or act rudely towards us. This is why we went back and will continue to go back!

Right now they have a parents weekend sale going on: jeans are buy one get one free.
