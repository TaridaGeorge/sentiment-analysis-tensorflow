Spinato's is my favorite pizza place! I think what really makes their pizza so good is the sauce. I have a feeling that they use red wine in their recipe. I have had several of their pizzas, and have yet to have a bad experience. I like the toned down atmosphere too! It's not too much like a bar, it's not too trendy, and it doesn't remind you of some grungy chain like pizza hut (even though they do have other locations). It's locally owned too! The staff is always extremely friendly, and they always give timely service. 
Their pizza is a bit pricier than your average chain, but it's soooo worth it. If you're getting a large pizza, plan on spending about $20. I recommend them over any pizza place in the area.
