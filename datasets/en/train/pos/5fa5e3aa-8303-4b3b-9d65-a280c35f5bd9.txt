I always love coming here. They have a fantastic cocktail list, skilled and friendly bartenders, and a cozy atmosphere. I also usually like the music (it varies but I often here Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Spoon, Wilco, etc.). When it gets very crowded (late on a Friday/Saturday), there isn't much standing room, so I prefer coming other days of the week. One of my favorite bars in town!
