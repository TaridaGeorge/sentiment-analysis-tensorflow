So chill, So delicious and So priced well.  The Living Room is a great place to kick back and relax on a date or with a group of friends.  The drinks are made well, generous and affordably priced.  The menu goes above and beyond "bar food" and has enough to interest pretty much anyone.  My favorite was the sausage sliders- WOW!  Delicious! And when you need a french fry fix, this is your place!  Portions are big, so perfect for sharing.
