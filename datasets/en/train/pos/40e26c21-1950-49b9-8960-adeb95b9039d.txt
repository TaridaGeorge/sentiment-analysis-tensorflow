I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews I saw. I have always had exceptional service here. I like that you can be fairly casual or dressed up and still be very comfortable here. I also like the decor and smell of rich wood as you enter. I appreciate that the menu is healthy but you don't feel like you're missing out on anything. They offer some fantastic wine selections as well. Sorry to see some others didn't enjoy it. Hopefully they'll try it out again with a better experience.
