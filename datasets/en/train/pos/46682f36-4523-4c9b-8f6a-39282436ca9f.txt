I lived in Jacksonville Florida for two years and went to firehouse every week and when i found out that they were coming to Arizona it was the greatest day of my life.  This is the most amazing restaurant ever and I encourage any one who likes meat, sandwiches, or just food to go eat here it will be well worth it.
