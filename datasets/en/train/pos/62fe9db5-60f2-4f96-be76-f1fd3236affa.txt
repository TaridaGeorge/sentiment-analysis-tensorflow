This is the best DSW location I have been to, and I've been to a few.  The store is laid out very nice and organized and spacious.  Even the sales in back have more room than other locations, which is nice as those usually get the most crowded.

The shoe selection is good, I would venture a guess and say this location has a bit more in options but I can't be sure, it may just be the layout.

The staff was nice and helpful, which is a nice change from the other locations.  

This is the place to go to find shoes..and more shoes...and more shoes...etc.
