I just stayed here for a week while i was in Phoenix for a convention down at the U.S. Airways center and it was absolutely AMAZING. Our group usually has three requirements when looking at hotels 1) it has a pool, 2) breakfast is included, and 3) its not a trash pile. This hotel obviously met and exceeded our expectations. 

The decor of the hotel and the rooms was very nice, beds comfortable, pool was decent, and the breakfast was way more than expected. The staff were all super friendly and very helpful when answering any questions we had. This is seriously a hidden gem.

I would totally stay here again!
