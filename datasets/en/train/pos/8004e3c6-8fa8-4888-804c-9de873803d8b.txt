Hands down the best Chinese food in the valley. When I used to live right next to this place my roommates and I would get takeout at least once  week. Obviously its not as good as San Fran or some other large cities I have been too, but this is Phoenix for crying out loud. So when it comes to Chinese, Wongs place is the only place I like to go.
