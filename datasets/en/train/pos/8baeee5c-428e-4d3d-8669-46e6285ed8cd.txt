Wowwwwwww, definitely coming back for more! Sure, it comes off as hole-in-the-wall, dark, and a little sketchy, but don't be afraid! Great beer and heaven stuffed in buttery, flaky crusts awaits you beyond Cornish's doors. Staff was generally not too friendly, but one of the many dudes with huge plugs is cool. 

Come with a group of people so you can enjoy dessert. I almost died eating two pasty's by myself.
