I headed over to ZOYO Neighborhood Yogurt this Sunday afternoon...and got nothing but good things to say. Plus its a couple blocks from the house...so glad to have them in the Neighborhood.

The Decor is Modern and has a total open indoor/ outdoor setup with sliding glass doors that opens this place up...very inice. Sit inside or out on the patio either way ..your going to enjoy the day at this spot.

The Pricing is great.....its a cheap sweet low cal treat. Only 39cents a ounce for all the frozen yogurt and toppings you want.

The Frozen Yogurt.  Its was very good. Many choices to choose from and they have sample cups to taste test. I was very happy with my selections of Peanut butter, Chocolate, and vanilla :-) 

I will be back ...maybe too often... hope they change the flavors often...we will see.
