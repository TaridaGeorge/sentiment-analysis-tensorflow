Went to see about finding a used car in our price range. Daniel helped us and was very professional and nice. He checked out the inventory online and unfortunately they did not have what we were looking for. The cool thing wad that he was still willing to show us around the lot and maintained a friendly attitude with us.

If you want a nice, used car and your budget is 11k+ then go here. You will not be pressured into anything. They don't even try to check your credit unless you want them to. More dealerships need to be this hassle free.
