I love Ocean Blue, I've never had a bad experience here. Granted, I've only been a hand full of times, but every time I'm reminded why I like it better than Yogurt Land. To me, Yogurt Land has a funny after taste to their froyo. The flavors are always changing here at Ocean Blue, and they're always delicious! Nomnomnom! I also love the atmosphere, very chill and inviting.
