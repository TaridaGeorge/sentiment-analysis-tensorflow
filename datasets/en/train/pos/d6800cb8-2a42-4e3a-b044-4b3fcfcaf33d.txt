Having a business in Phoenix and relatives in the area, I was helping them search for a Family Medical Center and based on several reviews from fellow yelpers I would have to agree with the positive results. It is very nice, modern and clean! The staff was very courteous and knowledgabe and the doctors were phenomonal! We have currently been going to Healthy Outlook Family for awhile now and would not hesitate to recommend others in the Phoenix area!
