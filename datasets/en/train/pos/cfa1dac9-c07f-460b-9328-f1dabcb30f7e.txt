I hate and love this place. I always go for one thing (usually treats for the dogs) but end up buying 4 or 5 other things.  Ground beef with bacon for burgers, jalapeno cheese brats, bacon wraped filets... so many choices... AND I'm trying to go vegetarian.  Not helping me out here are you Von Hanson's??  

Oh and their coupons are awesome - buy one get one on a lot of stuff. OH yea and the stuffed chicken breast(with stuffing)... we pick up extra stuffing just for the holidays since it's always a hit. If you need something specially cut they will also cut it anyway you want. We get leg bones for the dogs and have them cut in thick rounds so they have hours of enjoyment.
