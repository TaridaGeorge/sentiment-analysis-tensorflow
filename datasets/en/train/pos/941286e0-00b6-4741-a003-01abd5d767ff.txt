Great Cambodian food. Unique drinks and dishes. My husband and I just discovered this restaurant and was fascinated by it. Great service and just great all around. Beautifully decorated. There is just nothing bad I can say about this wonderful place. I hope it stays around for a long time so that we can continue to enjoy it.
