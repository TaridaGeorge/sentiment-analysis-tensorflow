Stumbled upon this place after leaving LGO because I couldn't find a parking spot.

Once inside, I picked the owner's brain a bit about what to order.  I ended up with a freshly baked blueberry scone and an Iced Toddy (some sort of altered iced coffee).  Both were great and reasonably priced ($6 total, I think).

Carmel's has a nice, laid-back feel to it; small but open space with simple decor. The staff was very pleasant and welcomed me like I had been there 100 times before.

I am definitely going back.
