WOW!  Joanna can make anything look good on anyone!  All is takes is the right tailoring.  For the first time in my entire 30 year old life, I had to have my bridesmaid's dress taken in (thanks, low carb!) and Joanna made this dress look great on me (well and the help of steak and salad for every fricken dinner for a month).  

Totally affordable too- she is nice and very talented. Go see her!
