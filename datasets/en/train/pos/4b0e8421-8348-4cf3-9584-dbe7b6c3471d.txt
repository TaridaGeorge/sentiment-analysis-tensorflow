Looked this place up on Yelp.  My boys and I are so happy we tried it.

Great, friendly service and the food was fab!  I liked that we could order sushi, soups ( miso and wonton ) and tasty currys!  My sons loved the food too.  My 8 year old ordered from the kids menu and the portion was grown-man-size! 

Looks like this might be our new favourite sushi place on this side of town!  The chef did a beautiful job!
