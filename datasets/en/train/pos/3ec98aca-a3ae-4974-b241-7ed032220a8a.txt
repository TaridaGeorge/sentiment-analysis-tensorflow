Saturday evening 02 September we returned to FnB for the second time in a week - this time with friends along.  We had appetizers, entrees and deserts - swapped food all around and had one of the best meals that we've had all year.  Reservation was ready when we arrived; the staff was pleasantly attentive.  This locally owned restaurant deserves all the rave reviews that it has garnered in the past 2.5 years.  A must try if visiting Scottsdale.  We're lucky - we live here and we know enough to call head for a reservation.
