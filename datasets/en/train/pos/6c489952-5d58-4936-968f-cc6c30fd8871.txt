We bring our three sons to Dr. Hartsook!  He is the best Ped in town I would have to say! Always takes extra time to explain everything going on to us and is genuinely concerned about our children. I love that he will not only ask about their health but make sure their development is above average as well. I recommend him as a Ped to everyone!!!
