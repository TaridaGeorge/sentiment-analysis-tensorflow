I ate here a while ago and I can't remember everything we ordered but overall I thought it was pretty damn good. The atmosphere reminded me of Delux Burger, a little too loud for me but not too bad. The tomato gazpacho I had was fantastic. Someone else ordered the simple salad and I remember thinking it didn't look so simple, it looked great. My friend ordered the squid ink pasta which he really enjoyed (it was more sea-like than I expected but I liked it too, just maybe not a whole bowl of it). For dessert we had cotton candy, donuts, and a chocolate souffl√©. They were all awesome. I will definitely be going back.
