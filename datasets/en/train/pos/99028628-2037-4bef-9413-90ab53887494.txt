A group of us came here after an Angels spring training game and every one of us fell in love with it. I was with a group of guys drinking for 6 hours surrounded by servers dressed in short kilts, baring midriffs, and massive amounts of cleavage, of course they loved it. We came during happy hour where domestic beers were $3, imports were $5 and almost all appetizers were $5. Awesome place to hang out, drink, and much.
