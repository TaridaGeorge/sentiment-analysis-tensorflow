Smeeks is my happy place. 

After one visit I was hooked, and now I get nearly all of my gifts, treats and goodies at this amazing Phoenix candy shop. The colorful decor, fun atmosphere and amazing staff make Smeeks a rare find. 

With a wide variety of sugary treats, fun games and gifts and the perfect accessories to help you celebrate (a confetti cannon and sparklers are among my weaknesses), Smeeks is the perfect combination of sugary sweetness, downtown hip and good old-fashioned great business. 

I will be returning to Smeeks for gifts, treats and a good time for years to come. YUM!
