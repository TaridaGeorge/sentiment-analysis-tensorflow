We have been looking for a good Indian restaurant in Phoenix/Scottsdale.  Thus far we have been disappointed at the quality.  Al Hamra was a complete delight.  Lovely, simple, clean decor.  Polite service.  AND the food was delish.  So often I find Indian food is swimming in oil.  We had an eggplant curry and a chana massala and both were wonderful.  Their papadum and naan (especially) were wonderful.  If you are vegan or vegetarian and want a NICE meal, I would highly recommend this restaurant.  They can make your food spicey or mild.  And, if you have meat-eating friends there are many, many excellent selections.  So nice to eat in a civilized restaurant that offers tasty, well-prepared food at reasonable prices.
