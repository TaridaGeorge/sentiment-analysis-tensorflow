I don't eat sushi but my Grandfather does. And I take him out for his 87th birthday here on a recommendation. He was so happy here.

They were so kind to us. They didn't mind me yelling because my Grandfather couldn't hear me otherwise. They didn't mind me constant requests and they even served him up some ice cream and make sure we had everything we needed without fail.

So nice. Would be back... you know, if I ate sushi (hey... I'm a vegetarian!)
