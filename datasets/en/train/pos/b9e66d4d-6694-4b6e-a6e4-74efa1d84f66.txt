All I can say is OMG! Food was great I got the shepherds pie pasty with a side of gravy it was great. It was worth the drive for pick up from my home in Gilbert. Staff was friendly and the place looked warm and inviting. I will be back again. Theres like at least 5 more things on the menu I want to try.
