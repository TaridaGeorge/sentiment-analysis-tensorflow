Hands down our favorite place for some quality beans and drinks. Also, our favorite Cartel location. We love this location because of the staff is incredible nice and the vibe all around is completely chill. The hubby enjoys an espresso while I sip on a latte or drip coffee. They also have an amazing chai! 
I really enjoy taking home a bag of El Limonar beans. Whenever we have these beans at home I become smeagol and cherish my beans. However, I end up brewing cup after cup. From start to finish, the taste and smell is exquisite and I want it all.
