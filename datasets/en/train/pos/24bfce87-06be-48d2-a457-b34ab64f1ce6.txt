We were at the Margerum Winemaker dinner at Modern steak last night and it was incredible. Food and wine were amazing and for 5 courses and 6 wines for $65 it was an incredible deal. The food was original and perfectly paired with the wines. Cant wait to go back to another one at Modern Steak. The staff are first rate and the ambiance is beautiful. We had an amazing time. Thanks Modern!
