after what seemed like forever, i was on southwest after a 4 month hiatus from arizona. 

the flight was delayed in atlanta, but the gate crew tried their best to lighten the mood, apologizing constantly and then throwing some jokes around. the flight was packed, yet the flight attendants were friendly and helpful the entire trip. they even walked up and down the aisle with iPads talking to customers and mapping out their connections in phx. as usual, you can get plenty of free snacks and drinks and the attendants are consistently up and down the aisles asking if you need anything. 

at one point, one of the flight attendants just started singing on the PA. i thought it was hilarious, even though she didn't sing that well. 

great to have a fun flight home.
