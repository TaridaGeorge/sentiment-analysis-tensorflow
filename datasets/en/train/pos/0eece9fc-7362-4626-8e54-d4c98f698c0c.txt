Group of Ten DINK's loved this place!

Deanna, the resident wine steward, was fantastic....highly suggest the following:
- First, Deanna sat us at a table in the grove where water was waiting. She then gave us a brief intro of the mill.
- We did the wine tasting in The Grove...no fee...just tips. Live acoustic music while we tasted 5 wines...very fun.
- Then Deanna gave us a detailed overview of the olive oil business and process...very cool facts shared.
- Then she gave us a tour of the olive oil "factory" and we tasted some oils.
- then we ordered lunch, picked up samples of oils, a bottle of wine and a baguette.
- For lunch we ordered antipasto, sandwiches, salads, sangria, beer, etc. All were great.

Highly recommend The Mill for a great afternoon under the olive trees..ask for Deanna, she was awesome! We will be back...
