I am a New Yorker and I approve this PIZZA.  Seriously legit - these guys know what they're doing - prob b/c they're also from NY.  

Plus they have veal parm heros - seriously like the only place in Phoenix that does that.  Good sauce, good crust, fresh cheese. (Did I mention fresh pasta?)  Seriously, this place is the ONLY thing I miss about living in Ahwatukee.

PLEASE PLEASE open a second location in Downtown Phoenix????  I'll even run it for you!
