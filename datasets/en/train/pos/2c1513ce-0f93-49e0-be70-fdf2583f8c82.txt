I went to the yelp event last night with Sarah H and Sarah A and we all had a blast.  Yummy food by Brio and the chance to get crafty!  Because my little sweet pea was heart broken he couldn't come, I made him a candle with sharks and dolphins on it and the biggest hit, soap!  The soap with the hot pink brain and glitter, scented with Birthday Cake, was his favorite and he used it this morning in the shower.  I'm looking forward to bringing him here so we can make something together.
