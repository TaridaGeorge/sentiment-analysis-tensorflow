We ate here about a month ago in the evening. The food was exquisite! We both had kabobs. One of us had bacon wrapped pork medallions and the other shrimp and sausage. We started the night with the warm spinach dip.
The service was attentive and the feeling of the premises ambiant.
thank you I will be back soon!
