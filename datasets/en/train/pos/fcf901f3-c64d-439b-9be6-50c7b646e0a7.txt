I absolutely adore Uncle Sal's! For being in a strip mall, you would think it's probably a so-so place, been around a few years, and will have no one in it.
I can tell you that's not the case. Not only does this place have some history (You will have to go there and ask to find out for yourself....but you'll see it's more authentic and cooler than you could imagine), the same wonderful faces always are there, and it's always somewhere busy.  The pasta sauce is the BEST, and if they bottled and sold it, Id be making pasta nightly. Even the garlic bread they bring to the table is good. You can't go wrong w any of the menu items. My favorite is the chicken saltimboca, but go and see for yourself.
And don't forget to ask about who originally owned it and how it happened!!
