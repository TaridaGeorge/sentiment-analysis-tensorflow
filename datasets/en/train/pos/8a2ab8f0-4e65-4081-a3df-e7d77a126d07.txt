My boyfrind and I attended here this past weekend on Serptember 8,2012 to celebrate our one year anniversary. Every employee went out o their way to tell us Happy Anniversary. We were seated quickly after entering the restaraunt. Our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly and very professional. We were given our own privacy to celebrate intimately. The food was amazing and we both enjoyed our selves so much!! Thank you Meling Pot. We are going to make you our annual celebration spot!!!
