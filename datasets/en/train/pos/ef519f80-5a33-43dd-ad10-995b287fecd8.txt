I was skeptical about "Phoenix Pizza" after growing up with NYC pizza. However, Spinato's didn't disappoint! We had the spinach/garlic/tomato (their house special) and it was delicious. Different for sure than a typical NYC pizza, but oh so good. If you are in Phoenix definitely try it out! Oh, and the wait staff was super friendly and the beer selection great!
