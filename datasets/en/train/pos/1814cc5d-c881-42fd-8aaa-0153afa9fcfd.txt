Fabulous!! Went for dinner on a Friday night...sitting under the stars, listening to live jazz and eating delicious food- what could be better, right?!

This place is a gem-low key, reasonably priced and the olive oil is the star!!  We all ordered the pasta specials -mine was a bit dry (chicken pasta w/b√©chamel sauce) but yummy enough that I ate the whole thing. Can't wait to go back & order one of the yummy panninis. Of course we couldn't leave without some olive oil purchases!
