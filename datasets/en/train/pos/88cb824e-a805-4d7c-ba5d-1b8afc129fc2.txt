Love going here for coffee and a great panini sandwich! Damian, the owner, is so friendly and fun to joke with when he's around. The other staff is friendly as well. 

There's a great vibe here. His brews are named after his daughters which is super cute. Depending on the time of day you have a mix of business professionals and students from the nearby Phoenix School of Law. I love the giant stenciled tree on the wall of the lounge inside.
