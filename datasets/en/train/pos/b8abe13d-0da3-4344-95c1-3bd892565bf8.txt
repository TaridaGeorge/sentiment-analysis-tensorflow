I had great service here. I came to the check-in booth as an Express Business Member and it was so easy and simple. They had my reservation and car ready. I signed some documents and got into my car within 5 minutes. The car was parked right next to the check-in booth. It was great since I didn't have to carry my luggage far to find my car. 

At check-out, it was painless too. The gentleman came to scan the barcode on the car, looked around and gave me my receipt to leave. I would definitely use Dollar again the next go around.
