Ignore most of my previous review.

Went here Saturday.  Place was hopping but food and service were excellent.  Brought an extremely picky foodie friend visiting and he loved this place.  Loved the dumplings, toro sashimi, yellowtail sashimi and mackarel sashimi.  

What I didn't realize the last time I ate here when I spouted off about limited sushi selection, is that they have several sushi specials which more or less doubles their offerings.  

New favorite sushi place.  Seriously, get over there!
