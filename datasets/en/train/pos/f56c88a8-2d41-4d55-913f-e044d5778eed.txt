Since this location is right down the street from our house, we always go there. We've never been disappointed with anything here, and we absolutely love going! Everything is so delicious, even the Green-V! It took me a while to try it, but I'm glad I finally did... so even their veggie juices are good :)

Everything else, of course, is also delicious. Our favourites include the Hummingbird, Pomegranate Power, and Caja Cooler. We used to love Jamba Juice, but now we can't go back there haha. It's probably the employees and the owner, though... everyone is just so nice there, and very helpful if you have any questions about any of the drinks.

Keep up the great work, guys! Definitely as good as it gets!
