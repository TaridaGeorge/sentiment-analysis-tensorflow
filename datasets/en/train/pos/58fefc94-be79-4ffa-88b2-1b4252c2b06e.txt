This was my first time using a business that I located on Yelp. My home windows were in need of cleaning since I hadn't had then cleaned in over twelve months. Clearly Professional Window Cleaning to the rescue. Brad showed up on time, checked the windows and went to work for several hours. By the time he was finished the windows looked great and I did not have to look through filthy/dusty windows at least until the next Monsoon :) I will absolutely recommend Clearly Professional Window Cleaning to anyone I know looking for this type of service. BTW, Brad also: cleans light fixtures (inside and out), cleans ceiling fans, glass tub enclosures, mirrors, screen repair, light bulb replacement, cobweb removal, pressure washing, smoke detector battery replacement, plant shelf cleaning, and seasonal shade screen service (remove in Fall, reinstall in the Spring).
