Again I don't like waiting for my food, so when I started going in to this location there was a few seats open at the bar, so my girlfriend and I sat down. The bar staff there was amazing, like more amazing than the regular wait staff there. I am always amazed that they have to memorize the menu, the whole menu and get special long training to be able to work there. I am not sure the bartender's name but he has long hair and is very friendly and definitely a Great Waiter/Bartender, you just don't find many these days. The food is always good, no matter what Cheesecake Factory I have ever been to, but I just wanted to comment on the bar staff and their extraordinary friendly and knowledgeable service they offer.
