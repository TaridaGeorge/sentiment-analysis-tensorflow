2 Things - Either my appetizer grew or I'm just being a chunky monkey!?  I don't recall the last time I finish a pizza on my own - wow!  Look mom I cleaned my plate off!  Yes my friends I had my O face on.  Needless to say food is was awesome.  The ambience was great; it's literally a house with rooms as the dining area.  Love the hardwood floors classic!  One thing I notice was the artwork; I believe they are from local artists - plus fresh flowers on the table...nice touch.  The patio is like walking onto hollywood movie set - Xmas lights hanging from the trees.  Service was good - my server reminded me of that dude from the Devil's Reject - scary but cool dude.  Got a date? ... now you got a place to go :)
