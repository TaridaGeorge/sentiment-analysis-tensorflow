I'm still in shock and awe that the Cardinals are (might be) a real, bonafide team.  Come January 2009, I *had* to watch the Super Bowl just to verify that fact.

I was once convinced that they were part of some elaborate, Andy Kaufmanesque hoax.  I had heard of the Stanford Cardinal.  I knew that there was a baseball team called the Cardinals. But, football - really?  

Now, after their performance in this year's Super Bowl I'm not necessarily convinced of the opposite but I'm definitely on board and willing to play along. Bravo.  Nicely done, AZ.
