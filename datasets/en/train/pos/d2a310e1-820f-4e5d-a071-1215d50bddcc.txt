This place is great! I wish I had found it before our last day and on the way to the airport. This place has fresh fruits and nuts and breads. There are a bunch of samples and quite a good selection of items. The staff is also very nice. We picked up a loaf of pumpkin bread as a thank you for our ride from the airport once we got home. I think they liked it, I know we loved our samples. 

If you are in the area, I definitely would go in to this place. I think it is probably a bit more than the market, but the produce is very fresh.
