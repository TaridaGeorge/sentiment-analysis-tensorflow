I was in town for a convention and was very pleased to find Hulas! The decor is fun, but not over the top- and the drinks were dangerously delicious. I had the Mai-tai and my friend had the zombie. It was hands down the best Mai-tai I've ever had (including the ones in Hawaii!). We had sweet potato fries and island style poke for our appetizer, and I still can't stop thinking about the poke! Our entrees continued to wow us with the jerk pork (my friends dish) and my wasabi style ahi. Everthing from start to finish was excellent from the service to the dessert. If you are in town Hulas is a must go!!
