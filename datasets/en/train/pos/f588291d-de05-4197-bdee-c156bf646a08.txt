LUX has the best coffee in town hands down. I've been to nearly all of the local coffee shops in Phoenix. I'm a complete addict. I work out of coffee shops and despite what some of these other folks say they observe I actually get more work done here than most other shops. I think the loudness and business of the place does it for me. Kind of like working out of the eXtreme Bean in Tempe.

Any way, no other shop makes a white mocha (velvet) like Lux. Do yourself a favor and order a regular velvet mocha for here with their fresh homemade espresso whipped cream. Additionally, all of the pastries you see there are freshly baked in house too.

So good.
