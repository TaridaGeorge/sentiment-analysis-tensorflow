Friendly staff, great food and a bar with a wonderful ambiance and outdoor seating.

I'm a regular at J Alexander's in Northbrook, so I typically come here more often for drinks than food and to say hello to the occasional Chicago area transplant that sometimes find themselves working here. One item I typically order here as it's often AWOL on Chicago area menus are the Huevos Rolls. 

They also make a pretty good Prime Rib here. And while the Carrot Cake is second to none, the Key Lime pie is not to be overlooked - best of its kind as well.
