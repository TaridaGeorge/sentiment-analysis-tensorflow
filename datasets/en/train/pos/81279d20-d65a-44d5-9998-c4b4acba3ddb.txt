Great specials: 2 slices and a drink for $3.50
It's not the greatest pizza ever (for that, go to Pete's # 2 in Chicago), but it beats anything from Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, etc. 

The portions are big, the pizza is not too ridiculously greasy, and the people are friendly without being fake. Delivery is also quick! 

ETA: I'm giving them a full five stars because they are so friendly and have great service. They charged me twice for a pizza, so I went in and they gave me the cash right then and there. They weren't even snotty about it!
