Without exception, the BEST gyro I have ever tasted, anywhere! Mine came "chock-full" of the most tender, flavorful, melt-in-your-mouth meat stacked and piled so elegantly, it seemed a shame to mess it up by eating it. The Pita was busting at the seams trying to hold all this meat in! My fries were made to perfection. Crispy, (seemed to be double-fried?), lightly salted, fluffy on the inside. More than substantial portions served. Well worth every cent. You definitely get your money's worth here. Plus, the most delightful, charming, friendly service from a husband and wife team who could be your own mom and dad. Loved every minute of it! Probably a good thing I don't live too close, or I would feast on a gyro here every damned day, IT'S THAT GOOD!!
