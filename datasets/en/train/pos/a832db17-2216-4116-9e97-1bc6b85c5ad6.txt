Professional and perfect.  I haven't ever wrote a review, but here goes. I got in an accident last Monday and saw their billboard that said that they will pay your deductible. I have a thousand dollar deductible. I decided that I would test out whether they were telling the truth. I went in and talked to Justin the manager and within half an hour he had arranged a ride home for me and the car was brought in before I even left the shop. 4 days later he called and the car was ready for pick up. When I got there the car was spotless and they even cleaned the papers and crap I had left in the car. I will give them a great review. It was fast, great and very professional experience. I will highly recommend fast auto to anyone.
