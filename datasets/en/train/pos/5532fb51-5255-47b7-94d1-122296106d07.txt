This is an update to the Spa Pima student massage clinic. I have had the $25 one hour student massage before and enjoy the spacious, relaxing environment and music and the student massages are always great. I stopped by today and was pushed for time and had one of the $8 chair massages (15 minutes). What a great value and the chair massage focused on my shoulders, back and neck--just the places I was all knotted up at.
Thanks for offering the $8 chair massage. It is just perfect for days when I don't have time for a full hour massage or just need the neck, back, and shoulders worked on.
