Green is my favorite restaurant to visit when I go home.  Yummy, fun food.  If you go to Scottsdale, Phoenix or Tempe for any reason...add this spot onto your to do list! I like their vegan "crab and cream cheese" puffs, the samosas, the faux chicken sandwich, the meatball sammie, the portobella poorboy, their FRENCH FRIES!!!  But the fave for me is the Cap'n Crunch SoyNami!!  You have to try it to understand.  AND YES, your animal eating friends will love it too!!
