I have been eating here for 10 years now.

BEST BABY BACK RIBS IN TOWN!!!  these babies are fall off the bone and delicious.  I have a smoker and rarely buy BBQ out of my home. I can't duplicate these at all, and I've tried. The salad that comes beforehand has a croissant drizzled with honey on it.  half rack is available too, just have to ask.

beautiful decor, casual but classy at the same time. I've had most of their menu and never had a bad meal.  Try the appetizer happy hour deals.  the SHRIMP CARGOT is incredible and really hits the spot on a cold winter eve.

Lastly, no matter what you order, try the BURGUNDY MUSHROOMS for your side dish if you like mushrooms.  They are 1 of a kind and super tasty. Enjoy, tell 'em IKE sent ya.
