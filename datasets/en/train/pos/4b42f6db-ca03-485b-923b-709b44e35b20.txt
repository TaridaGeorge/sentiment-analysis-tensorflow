A couple coworkers introduced me to Mu Shu over a year ago and I was instantly hooked. As lover of Asian Food, this place is right up my alley. Its a quick and easy concept and you'll end up with lunch, dinner and lunch again the next day - there's THAT much food for less than $9. You pick your meats and spices and the rest is up to you to load up your bowl with veggies as much as you'd like. Don't be scared - load them in there!  They grill it all up and serve it hot over rice. Its delicious and generous. While you wait, you can help yourself to crunchy noodle chips dipped in sweet and sour (delicious) and a soda fountain. I love that you're not waiting on servers but you still get that sit-down lunch vibe. A must try.
