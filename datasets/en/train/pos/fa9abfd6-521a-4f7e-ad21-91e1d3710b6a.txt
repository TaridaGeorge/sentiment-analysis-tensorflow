My kids grew up going to this park, it's AMAZING. We go every Christmas, and although it's packed, it's awesome. The train ride is well worth the wait during Christmas, and the rest of the year there's usually not much of a line. The prices are unbeatable. The kids love the parks and getting ice cream. I love the history, and FDR's train is pretty impressive. Do not miss this place!
