This is one of my go-to places for casual, but fun, dinners / lunches / meetings, etc. I love the menu &  the prices are fantastic for what you get! The decor is dark and intimate, but you feel very welcome and at home there. They have a great bar for watching games, a glass of wine with a friend, or even just to unwind after a long day.
