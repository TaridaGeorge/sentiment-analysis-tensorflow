Pretty much the only independent bookstore in the area that I enjoy going to-the author appearences are great, staff is friendly, carry indie magazines and NYT and adjoined with a great casual eatery with good coffee and great breakfast/lunch deals.

UPDATE

JUST WON BEST BOOKSTORE IN THE US BY PUBLISHERS WEEKLY!!!!!
