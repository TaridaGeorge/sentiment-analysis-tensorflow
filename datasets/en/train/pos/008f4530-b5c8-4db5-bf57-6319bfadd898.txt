I think Boyd below must have had the opposite experience I did. I brought in a bunch of estate pipes and the owner told me the value of the pipes and told me the cost if i wanted a fully redone pipe that was like new. I gave him 3 to do and they all came back just as if they had never been smoked before. I will definitely be back many many more times to come. 

Pros: AWESOME pipe and cigar selection, sweet humidor selection, nice lounge to enjoy your purchase, the guys at the shop will let you try before you buy.

Cons: the jerky fat fella that words there sometimes. He isn't very helpful and is kind of rude.
