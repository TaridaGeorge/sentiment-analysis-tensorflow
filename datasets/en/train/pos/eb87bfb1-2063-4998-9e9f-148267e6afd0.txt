I visit Postino almost every time I visit Phoenix! I love this place!! Their food is very reasonably priced and yummy too! 
My recent visit to Postino was for lunch with my sisters and mom over the Thanksgiving holiday. I had the bruschetta for the first time after much praise about it from my sister. My favorite prosciutto and fig...yumm-o! I also had the chicken chili which was also very good. 
It was the first time I ate inside, which was great. I love the outdoor seating as well. 
The service is speedy and very friendly, definitely a Phoenix favorite of mine!
