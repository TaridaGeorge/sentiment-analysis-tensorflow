Found this place late on a Sunday night and was surprised it was open till 11. It was actually pretty crowded, too. Spoke with the owner, I believe, he was very nice and made us feel right at home.  The menu is on the wall, above the kitchen. So, if you don't know what you want, and can't see the wall from where you're sitting, then you'll have to go look.  They didn't have actual menus, but we didn't find that to be any big deal.    I had the chicken tikka masala with rice & added a garlic naan. It was SO fresh & tasty. My husband had the mixed grill and really liked his as well. We will definitely be back.  FYI - they are waiting on their new sign so it's a little hard to see, but they're right next to Club Tattoo.
