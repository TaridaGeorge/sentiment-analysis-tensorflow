Dined here 200+ times. 

**My parents have been dining here for three decades - my review is prejudiced.  

Rosita's is the anti-Macayo's.  

As the above asterisks indicate, Rosita's is my "Best Mexican Restaurant in Phoenix." I cringe at the use of the word "authentic" when discussing cuisine, so it won't be used here.  What I can say to supplant that generic word is that their food is unapologetically spicy, they don't cater to vegetarians or finicky diners, and their entire operation - from service to the "security guard" in the back - is unpretentious.  

I've known the most of the staff for my entire life, and for what they might lack in their eagerness to interact to the common diner, they make up in genuineness. 

Please Have - machaca plate, green chile burro/chimi, albondigas, chips and salsa.
