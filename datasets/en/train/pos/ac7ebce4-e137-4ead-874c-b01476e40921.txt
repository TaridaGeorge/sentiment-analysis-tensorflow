Great spot to go to when you want to wash your own car! its really affordable and the staff is really friendly. I usually go on the weekends and a man named dannon always helps me with what ever i need. There's a lot of air fresheners , towels, cleaners etc..to choose from in the vending machine. its a great family owned business! Id definitely recommend it if your not too lazy. I always feel great knowing i washed my own car when i leave.
