I've been here many times over the past decade and always had great service and food. The ambience and location are fantastic. But the star of the show is definitely the soup! You have not lived until you've had their Tom Yum or Tom Ka Gai!! I've been around the world and no one makes them like Malee's. I love going there when I have a cold and their soup takes care of it in minutes. So stop wasting your time and get to Malee's NOW.
