I've been going to ACH for almost 12 years.  They've celebrated with me when new additions come to our house, and mourned with me on the passing of one of my fur-kids.  

Dr. Halver is wonderful.  He's low key, has a fabulous rapport with every animal I've taken in, and approaches any potential issues with a calm and reassuring manner.  He gives good advice and respects my wishes and decisions.

I recommend ACH highly.  My animals are my children, so I take the issue of their care very seriously.  And so does ACH...
