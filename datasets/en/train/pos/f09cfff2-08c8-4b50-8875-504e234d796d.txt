Delicious cupcakes and excellent friendly service.  If you go here after seeing a movie at Tempe Cinemas and show them your ticket stub, you get a free ice cream scoop with purchase of cupcake or cake pop.  The ice cream they sell here is Thrifty brand, and they have a good selection of flavors to choose from.  I had the toasted coconut ($2.99), which was rich, very moist, and not overly sweet.  It was covered with a healthy amount of cream cheese frosting and sprinkled with some toasted coconut.  Superb!
