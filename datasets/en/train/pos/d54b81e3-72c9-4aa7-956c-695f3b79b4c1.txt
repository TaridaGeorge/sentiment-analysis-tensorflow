After Audrey kicked me out of the pad. I went for a drive. I ended up in north Scottsdale with an appetite killer. I found this Jack in the Box out here in Boondock Ville. I ordered the Jumbo Jack no cheese, 2 tacos and a Diet Coke. I parked in the parking lot next to the Drive-thru. I ate my meal. Smoked a pack of cigarettes and watched cars show up and park in the shade. It was around 2 a.m. I pulled up thru the drive-thru for a second time and ordered a large Diet Coke. I asked the attendant for directions for the Maricopa Food Handler Card Department. The address read Peoria. I always get Peoria and Paradise Valley confused.
