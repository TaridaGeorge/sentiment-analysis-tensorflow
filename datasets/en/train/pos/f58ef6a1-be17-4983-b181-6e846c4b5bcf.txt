Wow, never have I though that pub food could be this delicious. Cornish Pasty Co. is by definition a hole in the wall well worth driving too from any where in the valley if you are seeking simple, affordable and downright deliciously satisfying food.

The menu is impressively varied, from typical, premium to signature pasties. I went with the lamb vindaloo and its spiciness left me goofy with delight.

There is no host/hostess at the entrance, so you can either seat yourself at the bar, and you can even hang your purse from underneath the counter!

The service is warm, friendly and efficient. Dinner for two without drinks was a bargain at $ 25.
