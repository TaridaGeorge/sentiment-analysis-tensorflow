all i can say is... its hard to mess up a Boba shop :)  this place is really good, they have so many selections and also some small dishes like fish balls (YUM), french fries and lots of other finger foods.  also if u like import cars, just show up there before closing and you'll see all the fast and the furious wanna be's park their ride in front of the place.
