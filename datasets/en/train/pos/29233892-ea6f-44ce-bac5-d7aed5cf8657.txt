I love that Elevate Coffee Co is a christian based coffee house! The atmosphere is relaxing and homey. Whether you're there to relax and enjoy time with friends or to get homework (or in my case, blogging) done, Elevate has something for everyone. Live music featuring local artists can be heart every Friday and Saturday night.

They have a wide selection of coffees, teas, and smoothies. Elevate also offers pastries and desserts. I even heard they serve breakfast! The baristas are always smiling and ready to serve.

For anybody looking for a local coffee place to hang out, Elevate is the place to be!
