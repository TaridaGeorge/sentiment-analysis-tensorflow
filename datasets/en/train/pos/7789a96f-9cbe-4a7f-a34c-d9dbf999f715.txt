These guys as awesome! The prices are very reasonable, the treatment is safe if you have pets in the house (after it dries, of course), and they are always happy to answer any questions. A couple of days ago my husband saw a black widow hanging around and building a web around one of our windows (obviously freaked us out), so even though we weren't due for our next treatment for about 6 weeks, we decided to schedule an extra treatment. I called them around lunchtime and someone was there by 3:00. They sprayed outside, around our doors and windows inside, and all throughout our garage- FOR FREE! If you buy a package and see activity in between treatments, they will come make it right. We will be using Evergreen for as long as we live in the Phoenix area.
