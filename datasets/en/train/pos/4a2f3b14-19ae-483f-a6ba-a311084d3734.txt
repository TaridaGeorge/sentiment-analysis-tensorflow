LOVE LOVE LOVE This place!  Scottsdale places are pretty hit or miss, in my opinion, but most of the things that come out of FRC is excellent.  This one is no exception.  Besides the $3.75 blueberry beer (which is cheaper than it is in Whole Foods, the food is wicked good.  There are so many things on the menu I cannot wait to try but the pork belly cubano was a must.  It was the best one I've had since I left New York and I've even visited Miami since then.  Great food, good prices, awesome wait staff.  There are a bunch of great reviews on here that go into more detail than mine...but all you need to know is that this place is great.
