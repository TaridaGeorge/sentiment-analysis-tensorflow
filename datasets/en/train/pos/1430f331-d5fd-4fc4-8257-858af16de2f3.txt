We discovered this place after a weary trip to Spencer's in the same complex. Talk about a pick me up for a tired toddler & mommy and daddy!  My son LOVED this froyo. He kept signing "more more more" it was hilarious :) we loved that you can get pretty healthy froyo loaded with fresh fruit and be refreshed. We have come back a few times. We love this place :)
