Wow, can you get lost in this place. I have driven by this place so many times and always wanted to stop. Wish I would have stopped months ago! This place has so many cool pieces of furniture. Most of which is made on the premise. 

Urban Southwest has numerous rooms that are set up with tables, seating and accessories. Great way to get ideas. Nick was extremely helpful in how they build their product and how they can custom build anything for you. The furniture is a little more than most places, but that is understandable with most everything custom made. 

Will be stopping by here again the next time I am in need of a table. Thanks Nick!
