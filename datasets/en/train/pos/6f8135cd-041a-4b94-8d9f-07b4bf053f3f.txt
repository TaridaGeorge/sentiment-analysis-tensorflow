One of the 'newer' options and one of my faves in Scottsdale by the Waterfront to grab a nice, healthy- light lunch! My mother and I both fell in love with this spot. It's casual the menu is pretty open for anyone looking for something healthy and not so heavy on the stomach. I got the Turkey Club with the slaw (which I might add doesn't have mayo) which both were amazing! The guy working that day was so sweet and being that it was our first visit, he gave us a complimentary hummus appetizer- which was delish as well. You can really taste the olive oil that everything is cooked in but it's not overwhelming at all. 

If you're in the area, give it a try. Definitely one of my more favorite Fox Restaurant's.
