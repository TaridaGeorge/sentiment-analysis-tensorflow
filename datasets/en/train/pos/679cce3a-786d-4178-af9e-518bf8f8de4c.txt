Great food, great service. Gluten free pizza was delish, definitely not disappointed as usually is the case with gluten free anything. I read the reviews before I went which were all positive but I was still apprehensive,  everyone's taste buds vary but the server gave us great feedback and we gave it a try. I have super high expectations when it comes to food. Something has to be really really really good to even review it and give it 5 stars.  We had the "mamma spinatos" and a "pepperoni and mushroom". I hope this review helps if you have any hesitations.
