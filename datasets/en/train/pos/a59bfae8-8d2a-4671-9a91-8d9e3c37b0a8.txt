I've been eating here almost weekly for over 2 years. My friends and I call the place "Roberto's", after the owner. The food is great; the wine list is very good; the service is superb. There has been almost no turnover in staff...that tells you something. The best pasta is the Bigoli. And don't forget to try the chocolate dessert. Also a good place for a business lunch.
