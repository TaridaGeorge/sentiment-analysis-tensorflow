We've stayed at all of the major Phoenix and Scottsdale Hotels.  Our Chiropractic Group (Schofield Chiropractic Training) tends to rotate through the nicer hotels and resorts. Some are wonderful, some are big, some are small.  This one is a favorite with our kids.  Yote the coyote, the lazy river, slide etc are wonderful.  Nice to have full service restaurant by the pool too. The bars inside each building on the edge of the pools are great for the afternoon conversation.  We stayed in a Casita with a King and 2 Queens, fold out couch downstairs and full kitchen.  Nice.
