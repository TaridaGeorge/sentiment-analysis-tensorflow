OK i gotta say - Best theater i ever been to so far. Just like that, yes!!! Its new, its huge, screen is amazing, sound is awesome - What else can one want from a movie theater!! I did not buy any food or drink there, so i can not comment on that, but judging by amounts of food others were hauling in, i would probably say that its not any worse then anywhere else.

"I like"
"Very nice"
