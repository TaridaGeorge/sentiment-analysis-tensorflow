I went in to this urgent care this morning because I've had a cough for several days. I signed up on-line and was called back within about 10 minutes. When I arrived I had to fill out some paperwork (standard paperwork which took me about 3 minutes). I was called back immediately. The exam was very thorough. I was out the door within 25 minutes. Everyone was very nice. I will definitely use this facility again if I ever have the need.
