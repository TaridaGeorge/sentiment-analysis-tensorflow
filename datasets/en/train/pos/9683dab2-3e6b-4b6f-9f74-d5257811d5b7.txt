Churchill's is as good as it gets in the cigar biz, don't you just freaking love getting a nose full of that cigar smell as you walk by the old guys out front on any given night? And that's how you know it's good, old guys hang out there. Huge selection for it's size, unpretentious staff, and the kind of look every man wants for his own humidor or cellar. One day, when I'm a hustler, I'm going to get one of those big, expensive smokes and pretend I understand why it cost me so much... can't wait.
