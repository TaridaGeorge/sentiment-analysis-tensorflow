One of my favorite places to eat in the valley hands down. Always fresh always organic. Can get just about anything gluten free or dairy free. The Dragon Bowl is awesome!
The owner and her daughter run this place and both are very sweet. The staff is very knowledgeable about allergies etc.. go here and try it ! You will love it!
