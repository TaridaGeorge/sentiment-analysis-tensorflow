Little Indian store and eatery rolled into one. 
Hands down the best place to have chaat (tangy snacks) in the valley - this coming from someone of Indian origin. Whether you want to make a meal out of these or just grab bites, there is great veriety to choose from. 
The lunch and dinner combo (chapati/puri, subji, rice, yogurt/pickle) plates are great deals - reasonable portions for 4.99/5.99. The rice is not the best but the sabjis are good. The meal feels complete and satisfying. 
And conveient when you can grab a package of sweets or snacks to go!

The men at the counter used to be frumpy, but I think the recession and loss of clientele have taught them to smile occasionally.
