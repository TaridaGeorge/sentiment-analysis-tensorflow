a GREAT place with a warm, friendly , classy atmosphere.   the lighting is perfect.....Bandera gets it!!     definitely a cool, but un-pretentious vibe

they deliver in the food & drink department .     all of the mention of the rotisserie chicken & corn bread is right on the money.   everything i have tried has been savory & delicious.

on of my favorites in scottsdale!
