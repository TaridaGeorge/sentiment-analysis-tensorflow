This place was awesome! Always SO busy too. The pizza was amazing and the few glasses of wine made everything even better :)  We sat outside in May, though a little warm, it was still enjoyable. The small, candle lit tables and overall ambiance of Cibo makes it worth going back. I can't wait to go back when it's cooler out and maybe they'll have the outside fireplace burning. They also had live music that I didn't necessarily care for, a little cheesy, but it was live and that counts :)
