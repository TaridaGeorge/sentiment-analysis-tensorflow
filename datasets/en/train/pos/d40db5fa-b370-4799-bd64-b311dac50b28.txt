This place is FULL of hipsters and I don't even care. I will take vegan food this good from dudes wearing scarves and man-purses.
The first time I took my mom here she loudly discussed hunting deer and her desire to eat a plate of raw meat with bones and hair. My mom is kind of a dick. My point is, after she ate here once she's been pestering me to take her back for the last year. So if it's good enough for my mom, it should be good enough for you. Unless you think you're better than my mom. Well, there's a good chance you are. But my point stands.
