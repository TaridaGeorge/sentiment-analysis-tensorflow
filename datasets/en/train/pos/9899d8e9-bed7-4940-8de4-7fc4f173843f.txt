I love this place!!!!! Very quick delivery and is hot upon arrival. Large portions for a great price. Awesome lunch specials too. A couple of my favorites : gang pang beef (spicy), sweet & sour chicken (white meat and crispy) hot & sour soup (actually packs some heat) and shrimp and scallops in lobster sauce!!!! Yummy!!!!
