The Breakfast Club is located in my office building and I have both Breakfast and Lunch there on a regular basis. The food is terrific, the prices are low, and the service is excellent.
On top of that they also cater lunch to my offices on a regular basis. They are always on time and are very discrete. My staff love their food and its usually quite a fenzy when the buffet gets setup.
I highly recommend both eating at their restaurant and using their catering services.
