This gym is like visiting a  mini-resort, everything from the workout area to the locker rooms, the fabulous indoor & outdoor pools are top notch. 
I love everyone that works here. Their friendly, know you by name and work hard at keeping the gym clean, stocked and inviting. 

I don't take advantage of the pool often enough, but it's great for people with children, great family atmosphere. 

I do take advantage of the challenging group fitness classes and feel they do their best to have classes at every level.

They also offer tennis, basketball, racquet ball and a climbing wall.
