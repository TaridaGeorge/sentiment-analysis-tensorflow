Man, their Pho is really addicting. I eat here about once a week, that's how much I love it. I'm impressed every time. The decor is super modern and sweet, friendly and attentive staff, and most importantly the pho makes me want to cry (good tears of course) it's that good. Every time I leave I can't wait to come back.
