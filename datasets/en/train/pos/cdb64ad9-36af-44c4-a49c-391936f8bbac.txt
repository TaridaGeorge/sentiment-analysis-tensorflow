Sakana is the best sushi spot I've been to in the valley, granted I have not been to many, but it's my favorite yet!  They have a great atmosphere, service, and last but not least, sushi!  They always have great deals going on and have a large variety of things to choose from!  Every time I have been to Sakana there has been a group there celebrating some sort of special occasion (birthdays particularly), it seems like a great place for them too!
