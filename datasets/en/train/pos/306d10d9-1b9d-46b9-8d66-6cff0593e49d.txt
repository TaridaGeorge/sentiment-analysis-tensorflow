I LOVE this Dentist office. The whole staff is really insync, and really has it together AND all of them are super nice. My son loves Sweet tooths kid friendly office, with a tv in everyroom and lots of toys to play with. I SO wish going to the dentist was this awesome when I was a kid! And the best part is I know my son is their #1 priority!
