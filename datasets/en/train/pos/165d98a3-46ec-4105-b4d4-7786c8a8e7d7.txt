Loved this place......I just went in today for the first time to check everything out and about half way through my tour the owner informs me they just announced they are closing their doors.  I picked up a few little things since everything is half off.  How sad.  I hate to see cool local businesses go out.  I wish I had found them earlier so I could have maybe bought a bit more in order to help.
