I'm going to keep this short and sweet. The pizza is delicious and the wait is ridiculously long. However, I look back now and I do think it was worth the wait. Would I do it again? Maybe once a year. 

We got there at 5:20 p.m. (20 minutes after opening) and there was already a 3.5 hour wait. Well, we stuck it out and three hours later we were stuffing our faces with five different kinds of pizza. My favorite, although they were all delicious, was Biancoverde and the close second was Rosa. 

The wait time they give you is not an exaggeration, so come prepared with friends to talk to, parched to drink wine, or with a book to read.
