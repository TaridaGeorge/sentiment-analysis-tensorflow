Cool little sports bar. It's never really busy, but never empty.. kinda weird. They have great specials including a beer of the month- 2.50 a pint. This month (August) is Sierra Nevada. 

The food is surprisingly good. They have the 2nd best wings (oregano's being #1) and good deep dish pizza too. I was very surprised. 

Ambiance sucks tho. Don't expect too much.  It embraces the look of a dive bar and kind of depressing setting. 

I still give it 5 stars cause it's a fun place to hang out with friends.
