What's to say that hasn't been said....this place ROCKS!  Bev-- what?
Exactly.  BTW, I found my true love here.  Cheap and good.  Angeline Pinot Noir, the $15 bottle.  Un Effing Believable.  A weeknight staple in my mini cellar.  And a big thank you to the very knowledgeable employees who introduced me to it, and the cute Peter Sarsgaard lookalike who works there.  Sorry we never got to imbibe together.

Cheers!
