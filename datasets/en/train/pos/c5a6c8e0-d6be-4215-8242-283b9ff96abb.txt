This used to be the highly rated Dragon Island but, I'm told by Jolene, our server/cashier  that the owner moved to Tempe or Mesa and sold the business to Big Heng.  According to the staff,  Big Heng kept all the cooks and staff so the food is the same as Dragon Island.  I went on their second day of opening.  I was treated to a egg drop soup which was very good.  I had also Mongolian Beef which was very good.  Service, provided by Jolene, was excellent.  I'll go back this weekend and try something else to see if it's routinely good.  Will bring my wife.  At this point, I'd highly rate Big Heng on Glendale.Ave.
