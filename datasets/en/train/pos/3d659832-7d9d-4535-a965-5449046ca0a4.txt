My favorite pizza place in Phoenix, and maybe anywhere.  I've been here several times and never been disappointed.  Plus, they offer a free economics lesson on handling high demand and low supply.  You can either raise the price, or ration the goods.  Prices are reasonable here, but you have to wait.  But the waiting can be pleasant at the bar next door, with a comfortable seat on the porch, a glass of wine and some olives to nibble on.  Really, this is all about the pizza, and primarily about the crust, thin, charred, with just a little chew.
