The theater seats are awesome!  The have a little recline to them and its hard not to bounce during the movies.  I recommend sitting in the front half of the theater.  We followed the crowd to the back and middle and sat down.  We both looked at each other and quickly decided we were really far from the screen.  So we moved up front and it was way better.

The location is near tons of awesome restaurants and a little shopping too.
