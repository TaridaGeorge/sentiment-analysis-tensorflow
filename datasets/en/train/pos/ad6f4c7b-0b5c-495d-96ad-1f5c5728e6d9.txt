Absolutely great. My sister gave me a pipe for my birthday and the guys here helped me pick out a nice first tobacco and let me ask all the questions I wanted. Great place to go and just look around and hang out. The guys just sit around and watch TV. Every time I go in I learn something new. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves a good smoke. And if you are a pipe smoker, pick up an ounce of Mike's Blend!
