Zinc Bistro is a must  if you visit Kirland Common, this restaurant is no stranger to awards and recognition. 
Why I love it,
Four and a half Stars, So close to Five.  I worked at Trio in Chicago and really enjoyed learning about French fine dinning.  Notice how many tables are served and how much detail is given to service and especially to each dish.  Most Fine dinning French restaurants are very small but Zink takes on an enormous challenge to satisfy each customer.  I really like the flat iorn steak and the wine selection is sure to please those who enjoy French wines.  I tend to order the Chateauneuf Du Pape.

Dessert,
If you like chocolate order the Souffle and make sure you order it 1/2 before your ready.
