I like this place, alot. It's classy, spacious, and the food is excellent. I didn't know what to expect when I decided on the Bento Box for lunch. Everything was fresh and delicious. Salmon, grilled asparagus, mixed green salad, with spring onion soup. It was filling, but I was stuffed. Ummmm, I want more. I have been to the one in Chicago, but that was a long time ago. The next time I go, I think i'll try the key lime pie. Our waitress was a little forgetful, but that did not take away from the experience one bit.
