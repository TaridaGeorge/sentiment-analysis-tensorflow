Hands down the most AMAZING dining experience in my life!!!!   From the first bite to the last, which was about 18 courses later, every morsel of food was extremely well thought out and artistically presented. Not only was each dish a visual adventure but the intense taste made each course a new "favorite!" While everything was truly spectacular, I must say the scallops and the pork belly were the 2 BEST bites of food I have ever had in my life!!!!    Equally impressive as the food was the service. Each member of the staff was fully educated in every ingredient in every dish and became part of the dining experience. Hats off to Amy and Kevin and thank you for an edible adventure we will never forget!!!!!
