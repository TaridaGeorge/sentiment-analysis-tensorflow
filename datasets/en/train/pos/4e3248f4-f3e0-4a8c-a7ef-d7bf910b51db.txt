shhhhhhh!!!!!!, this place is hummmm........ lame!!.......especially on Thursday nights with their amazing jazz band is playing, every week it seems harder to reserve a seat.( that is my only complaint) the word is out.
      Perfect, a wine list for days and an in house all star jazz band!
the staff are very attentive and do very well considering the vast wine list. 
great seating and long bar, designed to look like a speak easy, the lay out is great. Super cool date spot.
