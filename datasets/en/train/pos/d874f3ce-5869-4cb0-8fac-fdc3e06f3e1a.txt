I love this place. The review about them being angry I've never seen. 
They were some of the nicest people I've met. When I said something about wanting more vegetarian options the reply was "we'll make it work! just let us know." There is no Alfredo on the menu, but the waiter guaranteed that it'd be no problem for them to make. The 4 formaggi pizza was fantastic. The spaghetti is great, so is the cal-zone. Everything on the menu is served with good sized portions, enough so that I have leftovers. Which is awesome as I am the queen of leftovers. 
I highly recommend this place and if you want something not on the menu ask, they are more than willing to accommodate.
