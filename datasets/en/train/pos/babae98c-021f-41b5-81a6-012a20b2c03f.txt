I absolutely love what they are doing at Nobuo. We came first for restaurant week and then again last month with family in town. 

The dining style is like Asian tapas, so you can try small tastes of a variety of food, and wash it down with Japanese beer, sake or cocktails.

The finesse and technique applied to the food is remarkable. The textures, layering of flavors and eye for presentation have only been equaled in my AZ dining experience at Binkley's, and that was at 2-3x the price.
