After driving here from Chicago with all my clothes crammed in boxes and suitcases so that they'd fit a sedan, a lot of my suits, dresses, and other pieces needed to be taken to the dry cleaners. After looking on Yelp,  I decided to take my clothes here. they had great reviews, were cheap, and offering a Yelp deal for first time customers. 

I haven't taken my clothes anywhere else since I've moved here a year ago and I even dropped off expensive curtains that I had gotten from my grandma and they did a great job on those and it wasn't expensive to do. This place is about 20 minutes from where I live but it's definitely worth it and I haven't had a bad experience yet.
