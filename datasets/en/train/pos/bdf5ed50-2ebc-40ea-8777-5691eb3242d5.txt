Amazing Cuisine + Atmosphere makes me give this place an A++... went last night, and got to try a dessert dish the Head Chef prepared with berries from N.Rim AZ, that he had picked himself - unbelievable.

The burgers and Pork Chile Verde are both absolutely amazing and brunch on Sundays with live jazz makes me want to go back more often to see what's next - it seems like they've always got a new menu item with local AZ produce, or some other cool event going on...
