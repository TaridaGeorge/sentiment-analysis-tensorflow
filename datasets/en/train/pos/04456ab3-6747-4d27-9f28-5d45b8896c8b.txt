As far as fast Japanese food at lunch this is as good as it gets.  They have a different Bento Box lunch special everyday.  The box comes with plenty to eat, including Miso Soup which arrives shortly after ordering.  The meal includes sushi, salad, rice, chicken (teriyaki or such), gyoza, some type of fried fish and an orange.  For about $8-$10 it's hard to find a better deal.  I would highly recommend CherryBlossom for those looking for a Japanese meal.  It is small, quiet and a little hard to see from the street, which makes it a unique place with low traffic, but high quality.
