Nice cafe tucked away in a housing community. A few friends & I stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning and it wasn't very crowded at all. The place had a home-y vibe, with couches and books lying around. I got the San Diegan omelet, which was good, but a bit pricey. I also got one of their red velvet cupcakes, as I had seen that they were featured on Cupcake Wars. The frosting of the cupcake was perfect! The cake itself was moist, but it had a weird flavor to it, that I'm not sure was accidental or on purpose. I think if I had tried a different flavor, it would have been ok.
