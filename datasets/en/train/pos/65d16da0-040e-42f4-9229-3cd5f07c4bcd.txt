Walked in for a glass of red during happy hour.  I noticed a rather interesting Pinor Noir from the Russian River Valley, Picket Fence. I order up. The aroma and a sip suggest a romantic wine, gentle with a good dose of berry flavor and a touch of spice. I'm happy and only 5 dollars. 

It's quiet in the afternoon. Quiet before the storm I'm guessing. I walk onto a large patio to sit. Really this house is very large. When this place is busy it must be a lot of fun. This is a reasonable and beautiful wine bar to bring a lovely gal. And as you might guess this is a great place for a gal, on her own to go have a glass.
