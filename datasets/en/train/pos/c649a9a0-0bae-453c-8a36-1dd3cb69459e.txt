For a city saturated with Little Cesar's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's this place is a welcomed site. I've always had great service and really, really good pizza.  I'm not generally a spinach fan, but their spinach pizza (award winning) has to be the best around.  It would have to take a lot to dethrone this place as my favorite pizza joint.  Their cheesy garlic bread is also pretty good.
