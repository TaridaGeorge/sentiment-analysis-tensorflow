Yup, it's actually really nice here! My behemoths always get a good sniff on here and just get exhausted. There are regulars here, too, which is kinda fun. It's like cheers, but... um, with dogs, instead of, you know, people. *ahem*

The park itself gets a 5, though I will say this:

Last time I went, some obnoxious poodle owner took her sensitive little flower of a bitch (haha, get it? It's not really profanity!!!) into the big dog run and my boxer basically treated it as he treats all others; LIKE A BOXER. The woman had the audacity to call me and my dog names, me, irresponsible, my dog a mongrel! What a bitch (ok, THAT was profanity).
