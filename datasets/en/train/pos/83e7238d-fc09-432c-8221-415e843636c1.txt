I finally tried Switch for lunch today (after frequenting Fez forever - it was hard to tear myself away!).  WOW WOW WOW!  I am so excited to have a new menu full of fun, flavorful meals to try!  I had the Apricot BBQ chicken sandwich; my friend tried it and almost took it away from me!  Great prices, excellent selection and fun atmosphere.  Tables are a little close together but other than that I can't wait to go back!
