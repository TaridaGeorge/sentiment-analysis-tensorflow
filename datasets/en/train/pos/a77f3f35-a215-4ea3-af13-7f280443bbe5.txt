Belly Rubz is the best!  They have a nice facility both indoors and outside.  Dogs are supervised at all times and separated by large and small size.

For grooming, they do a very professional job...and your dog gets to stay and play all day!  For boarding, they have nice large private kennels.  We feel very comfortable leaving our pup there as they really take care of him.

The best part of all is the staff!!!  Everyone there truly loves animals and cares for your dog as if it was their own.

Oh, and they sell high quality dog food at great prices!  Couldn't say enough about this place.
