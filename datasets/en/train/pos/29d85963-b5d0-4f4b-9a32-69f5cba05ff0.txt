This lovely restaurant will make you smile. The service here is outstanding, the food is amazing and the beverage service perfect. 
People welcome you when you come in, the bar is very inviting and Eddie, the bartender is quite the character. He really makes precise and perfect cocktails and I like it here. 
I had the hummus and chicken - simple dish that was made extraordinary.  
I will dine in this great establishment as often as I can.
