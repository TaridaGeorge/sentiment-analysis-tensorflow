Om nom nom....butternut squash ravioli!!! Yes please, I'll take 2! Not only is the pasta cooked to perfection but the tomato cream sauce is a perfect compliment to the sweetness of the ravioli filling. Darius (the sweet, charming, knowledgeable owner) made me feel like family during my time at La Torretta.  He even offered to pair wine with each course which made me feel like I was at a 5 star 5 diamond restaurant.  

After spending 2 months in Italy and eating as much food as one person possibly could, I know good Italian food.  When I feel a pain in my gut for Spaghetti Bolognese, I now find comfort knowing La Torretta is right down the street waiting to give me my fix!
