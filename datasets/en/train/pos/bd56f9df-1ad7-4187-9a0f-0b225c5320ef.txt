If you're afraid of a sticky floor, or domestic beers, or leather couches, this is not the venue for you. However, if you're not a princess, and you like to play pool, listen to some Classic Rock on the jukebox and try to punch a speed bag whilst enjoying a $3 dollar beer...then welcome, my friend.

My very fun co-workers and I took over the lounge area on the left side as you walk into the courtyard. The staff were all great, even though we kept their arses hustlin' beers over to us from across the way. We took all the leather couches and rearranged them into our own living room the way we wanted to and they couldn't have cared less.

If you're here on a Friday after lunch and you hear some rowdiness coming from the pool tables...that'll be us.
