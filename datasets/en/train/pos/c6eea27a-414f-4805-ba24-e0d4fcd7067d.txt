I'm not a smoker.  But my visitors are.  
We were used to driving all the way up to SRPMIC for cheaper smokes until we found this shop - WAY closer!  Much more than carton cigarettes - loose tobacco, supplies, cigars ...

Nicer shop!  Great prices!  No sales tax!  And a drive through (although was not open at the time we visited) ... worth the trip.
