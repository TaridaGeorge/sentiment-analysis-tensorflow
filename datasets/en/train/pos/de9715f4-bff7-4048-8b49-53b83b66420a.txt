This is by far the best pizza in the valley.  I've been to Cibo, Gramaldi's, and Pizzeria Bianco and while I love Cibo, this place tops it.  I ordered take out - thin crust with sausage, onions and fresh black olives.  It was ready in 20 minutes as promised.  They only use fresh ingredients, nothing canned and trust me you can tell.  That makes this our new go to pizzeria.
