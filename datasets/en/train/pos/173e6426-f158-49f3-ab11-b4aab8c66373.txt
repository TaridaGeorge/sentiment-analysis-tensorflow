Hooray!  A real coffee house, family owned and run, beautifully decorated and displaying art by local artists. Internet is offered as is a big screen tv. and the couches and chairs are comfy enough to sink in for awhile. 
Jim and his wife are outgoing and friendly- it's evident that they aim to please and to make you feel right at home. Music is offered on the weekends and pastries, sandwiches and teas abound. A good place to relax and meet  people and chill. 

I hope folks can breakout out of the franchise mindset and give themselves a new experience as well as a treat. I'll be back.
