Oops sorry for the late review, didn't know there was a thread set up for it. \
I went to the Sunday Event and it was amazing, i don't think i've had that much fun in a while.  You will have a chance to try out all the up and coming restaurant in the valley, the big dogs and the chiwauwaus.  I strongly suggest anyone who enjoys food or just eating in general should try to attend this event next year.
