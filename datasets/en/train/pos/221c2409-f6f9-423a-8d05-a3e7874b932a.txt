We've gone here quite a few times and every time its great! My hubby loves the beer and we always get burgers because they're just that good. Prices are moderate; roughly $11.00 per person for food, throw in a few more dollars for a beer. It can be pretty loud on a weekend night but hey, its not only a bar, its brewery! Atmosphere is fun and service is always friendly.
