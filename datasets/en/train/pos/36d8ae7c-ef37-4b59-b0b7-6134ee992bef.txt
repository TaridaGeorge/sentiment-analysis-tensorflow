I've been dying to come here for such a long time now that when I finally got the chance, I was super excited. Don't know the name of the employee but he's tall and has curly hair, super awesome nice guy. Told him it was my first time and that I love coffee. Never really got the name of the coffee but on the cup it's written as the initial HM and I know it has something similar to nutella in it. And I've got to say, curly hair man, your suggestion on that drink was right on the dot. It was PERFECTION!
Definitely coming here every time I'm in AZ
