I recently moved closer to this area and have been wanting to give Luci's a try.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted by two super friendly barista's, Bryant and Emily. Being my first time here, they were both really awesome helping me pick out what I wanted to eat and drink. This place is really cute and has a lot of awesome food and beverage options. I ordered the Naughty Nurse and an iced latte with almond milk! (really awesome that they offer almond milk...so tired of soy) . It's a nice mix of coffee shop and grocer.  They offer a lot of healthier options, organic/gluten-free/vegetarian and so on.  I highly recommend!
