Best "bird's eye view" of Phoenix and the east valley, short of using a helicopter or airplane, is the top of South Mountain. Just head south on Central Ave. (it dead ends at South Mountain Park). The gates are open from 5am until 7pm. Sunset and sunrise are lovely from the top of the mountain. Bring a camera and lots of water. This view always wows out-of-town visitors.
Warning: the road up the side of the mountain is a narrow, winding one lane each way. It looks like they gave someone a six pack of beer and a grader and told them to figure a way to make a road up the mountain.
