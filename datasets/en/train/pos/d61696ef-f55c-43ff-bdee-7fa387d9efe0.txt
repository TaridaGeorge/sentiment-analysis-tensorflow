One of the best pizza places in town IMO (I'm not a fan of the Grimaldis chain). My faovrite dish is the ham and salami calzone. And like another reviewer said, great crushed iced - it really does make a difference. Food did take a long time and usually when I'm in the area I don't have that much time top stop in - really need to remember to call ahead to order take out.
