A really busy happening place.  OMG i had the best chicken strips EVER here.  make sure you order them.  The fries that come with it too....... heaven.

The beer is good... I had 3 kinds.  But none of them truly wowed me... but they were all tasty.  I think I liked the oatmeal stout the best.

Even with how busy it was, we found seats.  The bathroom was clean and there wasn't a line.

A really awesome place and good vibe.  I'd go back.
