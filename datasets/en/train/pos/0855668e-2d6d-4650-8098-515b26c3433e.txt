Dr. Oliver has been our family vet for years.  He is incredible!  He spends a long time explaining all options and always goes over costs in detail even before a simple exam.  They are conscious of the economic climate and have many solutions to lessen the impact on your wallet while still giving the best possible care. We have French Bulldogs, Boxer and Boston Terriers and has been our number once source in picking out new breeders.  He loves his clients and is so compassionate and caring. We can't rave enough about the staff and Dr. Oliver.  We drive from Scottsdale to Augusta Ranch, they are that good!
