This place is AWESOME! This is definitely one of my favorite breweries in Arizona. The beer is reasonably priced  and is very, very tasty. It's a good place to grab a meal, hit up happy hour or before a spring training game.

Anytime I have family in town I take them here and have never had any complaints about the Beer or food. The nachos are HUGE and are very good. This is a must when I go because they are just too good!
