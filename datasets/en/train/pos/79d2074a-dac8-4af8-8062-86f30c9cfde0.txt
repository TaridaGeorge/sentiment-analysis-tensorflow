I don't normally write reviews for places like Dunkin Donuts....only if something truly awful or truly exceptional happens there.

My friends, something truly exceptional happened at this DD.  They serve hot chocolate out of the machine.  

For those that don't know this is the most wonderful, chocolatel-y, hot chocolate you could ever want.  Its so good.  I've tried several DDs in the Valley and most of them don't carry it at all, and one made it with steamed milk all fancy like.  This is the real deal.....the moment that chocolate-y goodness went down my throat I was in heaven.  

Their donuts did look small but I was there for one reason and one reason only.....and now I know where to go to get my fix.
