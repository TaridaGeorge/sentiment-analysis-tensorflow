LOVED this place! Great small plates for sharing made it easy to try so many different types of food offered there! It was great to be able to feed three girls off three small plates! I love the area that it's in and how they are trying to revive it. Such an expansive restaurant with cool outdoor seating and two bar locations. 

Good prices on beer and food as well. Service was great and our server was the bartender as well. Really enjoyed the whole experience and the nachos were a table favorite!
