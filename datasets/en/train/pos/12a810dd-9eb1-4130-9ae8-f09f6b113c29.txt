My wife and I love this place. Best pizza in AZ! To start, the people here are amazing! The two owners Lee and Jerry are great! It's a family run place. All their kids and their friends work there and they ALL make you feel like family! Ive never had a bad meal, slice or experience. This has become one of weekend destinations for us and I'm sure to take all my friends here. Try the white pizza! Forget Venezia's, NYPD or any other place, YOU WON"T GET A BETTER SLICE ANYWHERE!!!
