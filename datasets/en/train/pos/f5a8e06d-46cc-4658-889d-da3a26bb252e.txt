Golden Spoon is so much better than all the self-serve frozen yogurt shops in the valley.  It's the original of the modern "fro-yo" craze in the valley, and remains the best.

Not only is the yogurt more flavorful and more solid, but you also get a lot more for your money.  Golden Spoon charges by the size, not the ounce, and the employees are very generous about the amount they pour into your cup.  They have no problem letting you sample flavors, and they mix however many you like.  And unlike the self-serve places, the yogurt doesn't look like a giant glob in an oversized bowl by the time you sit down to eat it.

The only negative is that you may be dealing with a line during busy hours as you wait for the employees. 

And yes, the plastic spoons are colored gold.
