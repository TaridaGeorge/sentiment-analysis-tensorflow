We love this place ..the short rib tacos are really yummy and half price during happy hour. 
I also have started eating Brussels sprouts here super tasty try them they will convert you..
We have sat at the bar both visits. Jason and Rico have both been great! 
I love how you can sit outside and yet be at the bar at the same time..
This is my new fav spot.. And if you need treats to take home the market place is great!!
