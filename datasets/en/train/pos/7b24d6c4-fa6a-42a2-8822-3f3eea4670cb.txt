OMG, the ambiance is cozy and authentic. Best of all is the delicious food; I am in love with the Tom Yum soup, the fried rice...everything indeed. The staff are always pleasant & attentive and the cook there really knows what she is doing as it shows in the food. I respect that I can taste fresh veggies (which they are generous with). They also take time to work on food plate presentation. Very satisfied and happy they are in the west part of Goodyear.
