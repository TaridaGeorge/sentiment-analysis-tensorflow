So, I have to admit that I once threw up in the Pita Jungle bathroom, but it was not Pita Jungle's fault - it was definitely something I ate the night before.  It certainly made for a memorable first date experience with my now husband, and we have been back many many times.

Oh, how I love Pita Jungle.  I haven't tried anything that I wouldn't have again in a heartbeat - currently I am hooked on the Potato Pizza.  yummy!

Their breakfast options are wonderful - definitely try it on a lazy Sunday morning.  There is usually no wait.

The ambiance is fantastic, casual and arty, with a little bit of crunchy granola thrown in.

A++ for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike.  

Eat hummus and pita.  Try falafel.  Try anything on the menu, because it is all good.
