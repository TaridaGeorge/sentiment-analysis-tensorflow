Their drinks, their food, and their service - all 5 stars.

I have only ever been for brunch, but each time has been delicious. Their brunch specials are always unique and delightful and the service has always been good.

The decor is quite a bit like Ticoz, which is nice, and it's really an atmosphere where any sort of attire is acceptable. Wear your jeans and cute tank, or your LBD and sky-high heels, you'll fit in either way.
