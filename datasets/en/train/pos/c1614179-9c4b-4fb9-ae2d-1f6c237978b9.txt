With a vast majority of Starbucks locations in this world, you pretty much know what you are going to get.  What sets one Starbucks apart from another is the staff, and the staff at this location is top notch.  Always friendly, always in a good mood, and always there to make sure you get your caffeinated beverage ASAP.  Aside from my crack addiction-like need for multiple shots of espresso daily, the friendly faces of these baristas make my morning each and every day.
