This place hits the spot across the board!  Excellent service, delicious food with ample portions and overall cool ambiance!  

From the host stand to the servers to the bartenders to the manager on staff, everyone was delightful, helpful and accommodating without being pushy, annoying or interrupting our convo.

Amazing happy hour menu, lovely craft beers on tap, extensive wine list and they make a mean martini!

I love the adaptive re-use of an old service station and how that's incorporated into the overall vibe of the place and the retro brand.  Great job there, Kitchen 56!

Next time I'm I must try their famous burgers (my table-mates raved like religious zealots over them!) and I need to check out the patio for some solid "hang out" time. I mean, that's why we live in the desert, right?

I'll definitely be back and with a pack of friends!
