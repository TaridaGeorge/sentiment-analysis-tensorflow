Staying at the nearby Westin Kierland.  Shuttle service provided to Stingray.  The shuttle driver recommended Stingray sushi over the other nearby sushi restaurants.  We concur.  The sushi was excellent.  Went during happy hour.  The prices were great.  The atmosphere is upscale chic, and the service attentive and polite.
