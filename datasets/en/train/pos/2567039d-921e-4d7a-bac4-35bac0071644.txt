These guys are awesome.  I just purchased my first road bike here.  They couldn't have been more helpful.  It's clear that they not only wanted my business, but that they wanted me to walk out of there absolutely satisfied with my purchase.  They really helped alot and actually gave me a great deal on a bike.  I went to almost every bike shop in town, spoke to alot of different folks who where all really good at what they do and nice enough- but in the end i went with landis cyclery  because I liked the vibe best.  I highly recommend their store as well as service shop
