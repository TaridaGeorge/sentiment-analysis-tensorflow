Okay, here goes... A lot of people on Yelp leave incredible reviews if you read them, but only give 4 stars. I read one that said "this place is incredible" and only gave 4 stars. I'm sorry but 4 stars is good, 5 stars is incredible. As a business owner my self I am emploring everyone who reads this to always put 5 stars if you even think a place is just "pretty good" just to help make up for the "liars and exaggerators" that give a business 1 star. Why is yelp so full of liars and exaggerators? Because of the name YELP.  Anyway HOUSE OF YANG is incredible it is my new favorite delivery Chinese Food!
