So amazingly delicious.  Every time I go there I have to get the, of course, chicken and waffles!!  And my boyfriend and I share a side of home fries which are just, the potatoes are crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and seasoned to perfection!  Someday I will branch out and try their other menu items, I'm sure you can't go wrong no matter what you order here!

Pro tip:  Make sure you bring your appetite!
