Most awesome little airport!!

I feel like I got in and out almost too quickly.. would have loved to lie on the grass and read.
Security line was short and my planes were on time.

3 main buildings
6 gates
2 food options
1 baggage conveyor belt

Parking is right outside, and you have to walk from the airplane to the gate.
Simple, clean, and efficient.... perhaps what the SJ Mineta was many moons ago.
