Delicious food, excellent service, strong cocktails, and appropriate wine choices. I had the 8 oz filet with garlic mashed potatoes and spinach salad, with a side of asparagus. All dishes at our table were cooked perfectly, including the scallops (which can be so hit-or-miss sometimes). Our server was excellent as was her busser. Timing, knowledge of the food, personality, and wine recommendations were all spot-on. You get more than what you pay for at Durant's.
