This company really knows how to give great customer service.  Not to mention they have a great way to market themselves and create customer loyalty.  Here's why:

I had to bring my car in with a flat tire. I had a slow leak.   When I came back to get my car, they had fixed the leak, and rotated my tires.  Then to find there were was not a charge for this.  Nice!  

About two weeks later I got a MASSIVE piece of medal in my tire.  It was not repairable that was obvious.   Where do you think I took it?  Discount tire.  They took care of me and replace my tired.   No doubt I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking to get work done on their tires.
