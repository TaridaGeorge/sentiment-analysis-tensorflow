Einstein Bagels prices are pretty reasonable. & I love the customer service at this Einstein bagels. Everyone who works there seems to enjoy their job and their interaction with the customers exemplifies this. You can walk into this Einstein in an okay mood & walk out in a great mood. Their energy is contagious. Because of the customer service at Rural & Ray Einstein some of my days have been more enjoyable! PS I love the Tasty Turkey.
