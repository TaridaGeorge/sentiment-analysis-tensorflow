i love this place for the slices of pizza i have been coming here for over 5 years but never really tried the pasta or any other dishes,  i favor this pizza over any other place such as  NYPD pizza,  Barros pizza, dominoes, streets of new york, Bounos, and i LOVE their garlic knots seemed to be made in the store with high quality ingredients , i went to NYPD the other day and you can tell that the garlic knots come frozen and they were tasteless and over baked, the hot wings are also very good i think they use franks red hot sauce which i love.  once again i never tried the dishes but the slices are the best in the valley no doubt
