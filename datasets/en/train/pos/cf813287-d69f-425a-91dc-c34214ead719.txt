I am moving them up to 5 stars with this update.

They are pretty much the best breakfast place on this side of town now.  The speed with which they get the orders out is pretty amazing. I thought it might have just been a weekday thing, but I have been several times on the weekend and they are just as speedy.  The owners when they are there always check on you and ask how your meal is going? The food and coffee are outstanding with a very reasonable price.  What more could you ask for? Just make sure to pick up your silverware and napkins on the way to the table :)

Try:
- Green Chile Corn Quiche 
- French Toast ( Awesome )
- Mochas
- Eggs Benedict Florentine
- Breads
