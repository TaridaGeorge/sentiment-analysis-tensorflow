My fiance and I were looking on Yelp to find a good affordable haircut with the option of a nice barber shave. He has hair that grows so fast and there is only so much I can do with 12 dollar trimmers. Rich's shop is only a couple minutes from our house and is in my old neighborhood. As soon as we walked in we were greeted like old friends of Richards. We all had small talk about our upcoming bundle of joy, and Richard talked to us about his family. Actually one of his "sons" came in for a bit and hung out. Very funny guy! 

The military cut he gave my fiance is PERFECT. He's not in the service but prefers that cut to any other kind, especially during the hot summer months. 

For a fade and razor the price was 16.00 usd. That is a STEAL!
