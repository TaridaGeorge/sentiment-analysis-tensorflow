Since my last review we have dined here several times and enjoyed it every time. The food and service just seem to get better every visit. Our last meal here a few days ago was another memorable one. 

It was a hot day but since the misters were on we sat out on the patio and managed to stay nice and cool throughout our meal. 

My husband had the meatball sandwich which was delicious! The same sumptuous meatballs they serve with their spaghetti dish - a big favorite of mine.

I tried the 'not your typical' chicken lasagna which was also very tasty....lots and lots of spinach and mushrooms.

For dessert they did not have what I ordered so they bought our desserts for us! We were very impressed by that.

As always a great experience : )
