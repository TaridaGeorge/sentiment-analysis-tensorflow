Went here on a Saturday afternoon on a whim. Played a little shuffleboard and met some awesome regulars who made us feel really welcome. Too bad it's not closer to home - I would go more often. Definitely not your typical Snotsdale bar. If you don't like divey and dirty, don't go. Reminded me of Captain Tony's in Key West.
