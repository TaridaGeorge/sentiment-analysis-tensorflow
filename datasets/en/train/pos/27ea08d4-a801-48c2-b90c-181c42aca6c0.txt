All I can say is WOW! I have not found filafel this good since moving back home to az. They have all the traditional favorites, boba ganoush (which is EXCELLENT) humos, fattoush, tahini, salads and pretty much everything else. the grocery is stocked full of amazing things.. sauces and spreads, 'pickled' veggies of all kinds , exotic jams, jellies and honies, breads, meats and cheeses, candies, pastries, even found my beloved persian cucumbers :} they also carry a vast assortment of spices and marinades. i LOVE this place. The owner is very nice. I ordered a filafel (they have the GOOD kind, nice and FRESH and green inside like theyre SUPPOSED to be) wrap with sides of humus and boba and it was perfect even down to the nice ripe tomatoes. AND the prices are decent. I highly recomend this place
