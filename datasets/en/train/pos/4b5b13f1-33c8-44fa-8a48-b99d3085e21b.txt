This place is awesome!!! i wish we had one here in Rancho Cucamonga, CA !!!! I guess I will just come here when I visit my parents move here in Surprise. The staff was awesome. We were here in early May. The manager made sure my husband had a gluten free diet as the doc perscribed. She was so awesome. They came around maybe 6 or 7 times to make sure all was well since the 1st round didnt go so well. They went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. plus the food was so delicious!! I told my parents about the place and now they come here now. Best in the area!!!!!!So sad you are not in SO CAL :(
