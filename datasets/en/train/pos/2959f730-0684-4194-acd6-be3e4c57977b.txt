I'm in love, where have you been all my life?  No wonder you're called Charming Charlie's...you've charmed the pants right off this girl.

Since I've found this amazing, wondrous place I've been in there at least once a week, I can't get enough.  I don't have enough time in my schedule to allow me to stay at this place for as long as I need to be there.  I have never walked out of here empty handed and it's a great place to purchase a gift for any female. 

Each room has a themed color full of accessories including bags, shoes, watches, jewelry, dresses and tops.  The jewelry is more unique then the stuff you'll find at For Love 21.  Super cute sandals for summertime, I've already bought 3 pairs from here.  

If you need me I'll be here.
