Wow, outstanding.

Had the eggplant parm sandwich - (half - it was a HUGE half), and it was SO delicious.  The cheese was melted just perfectly.

My boyfriend had the Il Purista - w/o the meat since I'm a vegetarian so we could share - so fresh and so tasty.

We also shared the artichoke salad, and gorgonzola stuffed green olives. .... Amazing.

I can't wait to go back - like, maybe for a second lunch in 30 minutes.
