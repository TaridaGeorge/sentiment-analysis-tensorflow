Five reasons I like The Art of Soup:

The moxie: Soup, in Arizona!?! The idea is so crazy... it works! My favorite soup is the red pepper gazpacho. It will be refreshing when the summertime comes.

The atmospere: This is where you want to go if you are looking for comfort food and relaxation.

The integrity: They change the menu every week because it depends on what veggies are in season! Every thing is very simple, yet full of flavor.  

The Soup Flight: Your choice of three different 4oz. tastes of the day's soup, it is perfect for the incredibly indecisive people such as myself.

The accommodation: They have a no noodle option for their noodle soups for all the gluten-free people out there. And they always have AT LEAST one vegan/vegetarian option.
