I went here with a friend immediately upon arrival at the airport.  It's a charming place, and the proprietors really seem to know what they are doing.  Though I wasn't hungry (had eaten on the plane) all the food looked wonderful.  Had a latte that was great.  This is a great place to practice your French as there are people who show up who speak French, as well as the owners.  The owners are very friendly and professional and it's a lovely, classy atmosphere with convenient parking in the Gainey Shops.  

I plan to patronize Chez Vous frequently because I am moving to the area soon.
