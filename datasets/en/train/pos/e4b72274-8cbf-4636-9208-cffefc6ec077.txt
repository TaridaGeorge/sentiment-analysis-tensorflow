This place really embodies it's name - a world market. The gourmet food items, the housewares, and decor selections touch on all areas of the globe and does so seamelessly, so it's not a cluster f@%k that gives you a headache. I love their candles, the little trial sizes of random gourmet foods (a mini bottle of aged balsamic? so cute!) and one of my favorite wines was discovered here first. Norton's Malbec. It's $8 and fabulous. They also have a "reserva" for like $14 but the cheaper one is a better "bang for your buck."
