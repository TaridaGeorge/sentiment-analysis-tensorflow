Hip atmosphere, great food, good portion sizes, and fantastic service.

My drink was never empty for long.  There was a mixup with our fondue, so it was comped without us having to ask.

The fondue was fantastic.  My wife had the pork and beans and she loved it.  The collard greens were tender and cooked to take on the flavor of the pork.  I had the baby back ribs which were tender and had a great smokey flavor without being too sweet.

We finished our meal with a peanut butter cup.  The mouse was so sweet that the gelato almost tasted bitter!  A fantastic dessert, like nothing I've ever had.  I will try the hot chocolate cake next.

We left satisfied, but not painfully full.
