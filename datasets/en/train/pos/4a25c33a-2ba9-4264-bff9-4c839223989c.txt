I stumble upon this place by acident,my husband had a meeting in Tolleson and I had time to kill- I think this place just opened because everything was kept in place, very organized and clean- The prices are really cheap, $20 for a basic pedi that lasted for more than 45 minutes, the tech took his time and wasn't trying to upsell me, like how other salons are. There basic pedi inculdes a lotion massage and a hot stone massage afterwards and hot towels :) This is the best place for your money- I live in Gilbert and wish that this salon was in Gilbert :) Credit card accepts, but bring cash to tip.
