I went to Canyon Falls Salon and Spa in Scottsdale to get my hair done and saw a brochure offering fat burning  B-12, shots, Lipodissolve, Botox, Dysport and fillers like Restylane and Radiesse. Michele Hunter Aesthetics is located on the Spa wing of the salon. I needed to get my lines erased and some energy. Michele Hunter RN was professional and informative. I purchased a B-12 shot and did Dysport. I loved the results and the price was great. I will be back in 4 months.
