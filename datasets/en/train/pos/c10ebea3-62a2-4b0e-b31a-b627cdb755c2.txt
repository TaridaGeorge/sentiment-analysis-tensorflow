I like PHX airport.

I find it easy to get through and logically laid out.
Baggage is simple and I like that you can be picked up at each of the 4 Terminals instead of having to take a train to a main one.

I wish they had a few better eateries, but, hey, it's an airport.
(Is there some kind of law that requires airports to provide shitty, over-priced food?)

Overall, an easy place to navigate.
