What a surprise.  Who would have thought a place like this would be found in Gila Bend?   Crazy good pizza.  My 5 star rating is for the pizza only.  I did not have anything else, but everything else looked great that my family was having.  Service was great, place was clean and the staff was super friendly.  I will make sure and go back to this place on my trips to San Diego and recommend it highly for anyone else in the area or driving through.
