Love this place! They've got great food and ambience - just a perfect place to sit outside, grab one of their honey lattes, and anything to nosh on. Love the Tammie Coe offerings! Favorite salad here, their Nicoise. Favorite sandwich, their Croque Madame. Favorite breakfast, their Birchemuesli. Also love the little knick-knacks they've got goin' on everywhere, just adds to the funness. Pet peeve - ocassionally coffee is not consistent, does get ridiculously crowded - and parking's a real hassle. But if you're in walking distance, then you're all set!
