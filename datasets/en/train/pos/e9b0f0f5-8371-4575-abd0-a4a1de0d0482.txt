The last shop I went to rounded off my oil drain plug, so after putting off my oil change as long as I could (shame on me!). I did some searching on yelp I found Tempe Auto Repair which had some great reviews so I was sold! Walked in and the owner Bill greeted us. Took care of us and fixed the problem. Tempe Auto Repair is friendly, honest, well priced. Will definitely bring my car back and so should you!
