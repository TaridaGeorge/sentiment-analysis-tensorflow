I really like it here. Go with my friend and have a really nice experience. The staff is friendly and incredible nice to us. I would recommend the Bun Bo Hue, Pho Dac Biet, and the beef with rice (I forget how to say it name). I haven't visit the restroom yet but I will be. Hope it doesn't let me expectation down. I will be come back, hungry for more.

PS: I think the 3 bean desert is okay since there is many place offer a good ones. The use of kidney bean kill the flavor, making it crunch and not soft at all. Guess I am used to soft bean.
