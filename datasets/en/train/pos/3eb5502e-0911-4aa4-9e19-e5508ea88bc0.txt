FnB is that rare restaurant that poses the most difficult of all reviewer dilemmas.  Try to keep it a secret, hoping to always get a last-minute table,  or, let the world know, serving the greater good of diners everywhere. Well, being an altruistic person -   I ate dinner at FnB Friday night, my 4th time. Fresh, local ingredients. Inventive but accessible recipes.  Perfect execution.  Lovely service.  I've eaten my way through most of the menu and can't find fault with a single item.  Of particular note, the panna cotta with mulberries and kumquats is sublime.  Don't even think of sharing it.  This dish is everything a dessert should be.  A little bit of heaven.  Reserve well ahead of time and sit at the bar if you can, and watch the food being prepared.    Try a vegetable that you don't think you like - FnB will change your mind.
