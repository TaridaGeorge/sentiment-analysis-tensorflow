I went to Dozo because of the descriptions left on Yelp and I was not disapointed.  We passed two other Japanese places on the way and when I pulled up and saw the building facade, I was worried that we had made a mistake.  Then, we walked in and all was perfect.  Good food, good sushi, great service.  We celebrated a B-day and had the time of our lives!
