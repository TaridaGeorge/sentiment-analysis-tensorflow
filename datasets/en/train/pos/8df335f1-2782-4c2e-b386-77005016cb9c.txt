Skeptical at first because there were no real reviews on them.

When I think it was Scott who came in, who was very friendly and professional. He gave us an energy assessment. Showed us what needed to be done. He didn't recommend anything or try to up sell on items, even when I asked him about adding a 2nd A/C unit to the house or an upgrade in insulation which he said it really wouldn't be worth it.

All the workers came in, acted professional and did a good job.

I didn't want to write this review till I received by rebate check from SRP as I was skeptical on the rebate which was about almost half back. It came so now I can write this...ahahaha..

Overall: I am extremely happy with the level of service I received from them and would recommend them.
