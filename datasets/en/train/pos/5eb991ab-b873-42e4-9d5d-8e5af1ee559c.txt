Just moved to Phoenix from Ca and have not been able to find a good burger anywhere! Finally I came to yelp and found this place. Thank God because the burgers here are AMAZING!!!!!! I love the inside of the place too it was very comfortable also. My husband and son ordered the #1 and I got the #4 the fries are also amazing too. Oh and you have to try the Bargs vanilla cherry soda, yummy!! Highly recommend and cant wait to go back. :)
