The restaurant is clean and beautiful. Dinner was wonderful. We tried 4 of their VEGETARIAN dishes and they were DELICIOUS!!! Desert was yummy as well, I ended up buying some Che Thai to bring home for my family. The service was top notch, both the waiter and the hostess was very friendly and courteous. I will definitely come back again with my vegetarian friends. 

From the meat-eaters in our group, I hear the food is excellent as well.
