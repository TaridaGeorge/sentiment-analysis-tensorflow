I must say Fate was the only positive thing I gained from an otherwise awful date. The food was fantastic. I had the green chicken curry. It had the perfect mixture of spices and it was not too spicy for a curry dish. I wasn't  expecting the curry sauce to be creamy. The sauce had a light green split pee hue, but despite the odd color the flavor was amazing. The meals were fairly priced. I believe my dinner was around the same price as my first drink...$10.00-$12.00. I enjoyed the artistic ambiance. The staff was polite and our food and drinks were delivered to us promptly. I have read other reviews about the hostess's being rude...luckily I haven't experienced that. Even if I had e negative staff experience I would still recommend Fate for the food alone.
