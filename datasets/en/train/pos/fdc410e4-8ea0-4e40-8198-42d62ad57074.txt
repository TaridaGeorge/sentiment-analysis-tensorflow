I love this movie theater!  I've been to the Fork and DIne twice now. The seats are comfy and the service is quick and friendly.The food is good but its best to go early if you want a meal since eating in the dark is a bit tricky and messy. Also, I really like that you can reserve tickets so no more lines when going to a movie on opening night. Its the best place to see a movie in the valley!
