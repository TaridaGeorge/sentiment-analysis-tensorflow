If you anticipate the wait at Matt's Big Breakfast, you'll have nothing to complain about. Put in your name, go get a coffee from Jobot, and relax. The staff is friendly and doesn't seem stressed about getting people in and out, and once you're seated and order your food, it comes out super quick. And it is fantastic. Hashbrowns have never been so glorious. Thank you Matt's, for a delicious place to start the day.
