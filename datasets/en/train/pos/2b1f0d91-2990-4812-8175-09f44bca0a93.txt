I'm so bummed there's not a Jersey Mike's in Tucson, but everytime I drive up to Phoenix and need a quick meal, Jersey Mike's is where I go.  I love how fresh the ingredients are - the ingredients are much more high quality than Subway or Eegees.  That's the main reason I love it - the amazingly fresh ingredients.  Otherwise it's your typical sub sandwich place.
