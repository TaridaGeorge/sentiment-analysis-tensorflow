Best burger in the valley! They recommend getting your burger served medium rare, for me this is fine but many prefer their burgers to be cooked more. Simply delicious, and the french fries are addicting. I always get the mixed basket of fries, half regular, half sweet potato. They give u a plate of ketchup and their house aioli sauce for dipping. The tables are very close to each other and the place gets packed, so privacy isn't really something your going to get. They do have a patio so you can sit outside. I prefer sitting at the bar if you can get a seat. They have a lot of beers on tap, try a beer flight
