Never eaten here, but have partaken in the drinks several times. 

Kazimierz is one of the coolest, most chill places that you will find. Great place to hang out with a couple of friends and have a glass of wine or two. 

They share a wine list with Cowboy Ciao, so it's as extensive of a list as you will find. They also offer a handful of unique beer options, if you're in the mood for a brewski instead.

Chill place along with an amazing wine list gives Kazimierz five stars.
