Hands down the best spa I have visited in the state and perhaps the nation. 

Massages were amazing.

Drinks and brunch were amazing.

Staff went out of their way to take care of our every need.

Went at 11 am to relax for the day and stayed until 5pm which is unheard of for me at a spa once the initial massage has taken place, but this place kept me going all afternoon with the plunge pool, sauna and steam. Also, the pool and spa hot tube outside were amazing. I honestly cannot say enough about AJi and its wonderful staff.

I will return
