I had a root canal done yesterday by Dr. Hardy.  He was extremely professional.  Also, I felt that he was very trustworthy.  He explained to me in detail what I needed and why.  We also looked at 2 other teeth that my dentist recommended me to get root canals and Dr. Hardy told me that he didn't think it was necessary.  I highly recommend them.  I was also very impressed with Pam who assisted Dr. Hardy.  She was very kind and concerned with how I was doing.
