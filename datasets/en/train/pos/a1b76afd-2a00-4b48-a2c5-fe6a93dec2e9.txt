I really like Harkins Theaters, especially the one at superstitions. This is my go-to movie theater. They've got comfortable seats, decent prices, great concession stand, and a lot of screens. The customer service here is always great too. I've never had anyone give me attitude or help me out when I asked a question. The facilities (even the bathrooms) are clean and inviting. 

Tip: if you like to watch movies regularly, get the loyalty cup or the t-shirt as you can get $1 soft drink refills and free medium popcorn every time you go to Harkins. It's a great deal and will pay for it self if you go at least 4-5 times a year.
