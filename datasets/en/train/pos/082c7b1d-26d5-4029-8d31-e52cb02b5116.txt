The Sail Inn Returns.  Every once in awhile, a step "backwards" is actually a step in the right direction.  Tempe just took a big step backwards, back towards a decent live music scene again.  Downtown still has a long way to go, but man-oh-man the new and improved Sail Inn is better than ever.  As for upgrades since the grand re-opening, the venue still has the indoor / outdoor stages, and they polished most of the edges without losing any character.  Weekend crowds are strong and a great mix of live-music lovers, and the groups sound super-tight, especially under the back-patio band shell.  Keep this one going strong, Tempe!
