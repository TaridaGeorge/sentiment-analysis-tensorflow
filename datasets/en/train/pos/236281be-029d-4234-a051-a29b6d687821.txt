Best Breakfast you can get in chandler. Its excellent and its owned by a family. Its a family place and they take special interest in making sure the kids eat well. 

My wife and I have eaten here many many times and you need to get there early to so you don't wait, anytime past 9:30 and your looking at a wait. Its not a up to date eats, it looks like something out of the 60's and its charming. 

Its right next door to a adult video store but that itself has a bit of humor for the window show and all the morman dads and moms raising eye brows as they would never visit such a place. 

Remember people you need to spend money downtown to keep downtown alive.
