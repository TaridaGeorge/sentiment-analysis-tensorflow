I'm a big fan of this location.  They always have the best fruit and vegetables.  I have gotten 4 pints of strawberries in the last 2 weeks and they have all been great; nothing moldy or icky.  

The meat counter is quality.  I appreciate the honest help of the people behind the counter.  My husband and I were told to try the swordfish and it was just as great as they gentleman said it would be.

If you want to shop in peace, go on Sunday night at 9pm.  It's super quiet.
