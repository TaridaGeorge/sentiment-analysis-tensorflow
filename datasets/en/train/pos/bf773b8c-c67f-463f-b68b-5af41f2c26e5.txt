This was my second  visit and I got to take two of my newbies to the place.  We were seated promptly indoors, and the staff was very friendly.  I ordered a blood orange mojito and it was excellent and quite large-just the way a cocktail should be.  I ordered the chicken which was excellent and the two sides I had were the stuffing and beans.  It was sooo good.  We felt no pressure in turning over the table as they do in some restaurants.  I tried my friends mashed potatoes and they were so good.  He cleaned his plate and raved about it and he eats like a bird so I know he like it.  Can't wait to try a new selection and for the next Groupon.
