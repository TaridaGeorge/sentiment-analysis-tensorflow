This is one of the best airports I have ever used! The best part is that is is my home airport. It is one of the busiest, and biggest airports in the world. It is serviced by all of the major carriers such as US Airway (Hub), Southwest (hub) Delta, American, Cont., United, Jet Blue, Air Tran, Hawaiian, and several more! The site offers FREE WiFi, plenty of top notch placed to grab a bite, or sit down for a meal. It was voted the "Friendliest" airports in America too. I can not say enough good things about this airport. Traveling is difficult enough, but this airports makes it a little better.
