My husband and I come here every other week  for the all you can eat sushi. The owner knows us and treats us very well! The guy who makes the sushi on Saturdays is really nice too and his sushi is good. We sit at the sushi bar and the service is always fast. They have a good variety of sushi for 20 bucks!  The reason I give it 5 stars is because for all you can eat sushi for the price its really as good as it gets.  No its not the best sushi in the world but its not trying too be. Its just good sushi for a good value!
