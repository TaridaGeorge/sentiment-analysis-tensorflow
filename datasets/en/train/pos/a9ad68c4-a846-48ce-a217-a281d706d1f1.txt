We first went to the Avondale location many years ago and the food was great. I worked on 16th Street & Indian School at the time so the Thomas location made sense to stop in for dinner after work. We have also dined at the Scottsdale location & all three are great!!  The food is always fresh, the macaroni salad is great & it comes on a bed of steamed cabbage. The Chicken Katsu is delicious, tender & juicy on the inside & crunchy on the outside. We also love that the portion sizes are large enough to share with our kids not having to order additional meals.  Love Ono & always stop when in the area!
