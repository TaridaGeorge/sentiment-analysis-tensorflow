HTC is the cleanest, quickest, coolest piercing place I've been in a while! Matt greeted us right away and got me set up with Andy, who is probably the most efficient piercer I've ever dealt with! He quickly walked me through all the steps, and next thing I knew I had a perfectly placed nose ring! He made it so easy and uncomplicated that you don't even have time to feel nervous! 
HTC also has an AWESOME selection of jewelry, especially gauges, and they are priced pretty moderately, and is top quality!
Go here. Don't think. Just do it. Now.
