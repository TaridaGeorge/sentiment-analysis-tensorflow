I decided to use this company for my husband's birthday night and am so glad I did! There was a group of us going out for the night around to different venues in Scottsdale and didn't want to walk, pay for cabs, or drive.  My husband and all of our friends loved it!  The vehicle was awesome and we felt as though we were riding in style!  They gave us a good price and it was worth every penny.  My birthday is coming up and we are planning on using this company again for my birthday! =)
