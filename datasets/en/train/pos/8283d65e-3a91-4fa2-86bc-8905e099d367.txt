Very divey - in the most fantastic way possible. Cheap beer, friendly staff, hilariously diverse clientle, bar shuffleboard! 

I only hung out here only off nights (hello Tuesdays!) and have made out way too many times in the posh smoking lounge.

Oh to be young again (they served me when I was 18...)  ;)
