Best Greek food I had in Arizona and excellent entertainment.

The dolma's were the best I've had, their version of Babaganoush was very good and they had many lamb-based dishes.

The entertainment was great. Live music, belly dancing, greek-style fun, broken plates, and dancing.

Since I had the sampler plate I can tell you that if you're vegan, vegetarian or any other wacko thing like that, you might not enjoy the food here (Greek Lasagna?....really?) Also, the chicken was no good but I don't really like chicken anyway.
