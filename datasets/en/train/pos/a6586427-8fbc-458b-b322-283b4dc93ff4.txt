I'm being dead serious when I say that Lenny's is has the best burgers in Arizona. My favorites are the Mexican burger and Pastrami burger. My hubby loves the Cowboy burger. Here's the thing, I don't like hamburgers, they are boring and have never been a choice of mine. But then we moved down the street from Lenny's and I figured I'd give them a try. Now it's our weekly treat. They're shakes are too die for so don't forget to get one! So many flavors to choose from. Eat at Lenny's, you won't be disappointed I promise you!
