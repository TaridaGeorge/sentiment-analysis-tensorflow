Everything we tried was excellent. If you want a GREAT surprise, get the chicken lollipops. They are their version of regular wings but they're oh so different. I wasn't wild about the sliders but the chicken and grilled cheese sandwiches were amazing! The waiter accidentally made a mistake on my order, which wasn't a big deal, but he still saw to it that I got a free drink! We've been driving by for awhile and bottom line is I'm so glad we finally stopped!
