Jackrabbit Supper Club, Scottsdale's newest swanky place-to-be, has a crowd to be envied. With the perfect mix of beautiful people, great music and flowing alcohol, Jackrabbit's nights are becoming better and better with time. And on the hour, every hour, Jackrabbit presents a sexy burlesque show, featuring Arizona's hottest ecdysiasts (you'll have to check out jackrabbitaz.com to find out what those are). The girls are endearingly known as White Chocolate, Dallas, Charlie, Loo Loo and Sophie; and this is far from amateur hour. JR also has a band that mixes things up from time to time, in between the musical stylings of resident DJ DJ Mikyl, who has mixed at places such as SIX as well. To learn more about JR's history, bottle service, menu and more, check out JackrabbitAZ.com, a sultry website with lots of info. One of the best club experiences of my life!
