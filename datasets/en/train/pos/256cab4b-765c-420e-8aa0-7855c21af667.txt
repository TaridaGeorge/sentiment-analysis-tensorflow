I adore Maizie's. Good burgers.. and drinks. Sit at the bar and you will be well taken care of. The last time I was there, I had a watermelon vodka spritzer.. ONE.. ONE..and I was done. The bartender is always so nice..happy.. and recommends what she has had and likes. THAT is a plus to me. Laid back and trendy. Good date spot..or friends hanging spot.
