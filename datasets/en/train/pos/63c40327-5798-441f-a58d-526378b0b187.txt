My boyfriend and I had bought a groupon for this place since it sounded like a good place to check out. Boy did it exceed our expectations for a great lunch! We had a little bit of everything and was extremely impressed with the menu items. The waitress we had was very knowledgeable and had some really great food suggestions. Was here for a late lunch, so it was really quiet, which is something I enjoy very much. Will be coming here again and bringing a few friends to enjoy it with too!
