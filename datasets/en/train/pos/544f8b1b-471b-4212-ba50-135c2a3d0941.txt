My Puppies Love this Place! 

When Banana was a little one she had a big problem peeing on anyone she came across. Wag and Wash accepted Banana with open arms. And always had a mop and broom available when it was due for her nail appointment. She has always been happy with the specialists assigned to clip her nails or give her a good brushing.

Now that Banana has a sister they enjoy Wag and Wash together. And now that the selection of dog food and dog toys has grown they can roam the store for hours, grabbing one of every toy from each bin! 

The Birthday Cakes are always a fun treat for any Pooch. If the Posh Cakes are not for you there are a variety of freshly baked snacks available to choose from.

Thanks Guys! We Love the Improvements!
