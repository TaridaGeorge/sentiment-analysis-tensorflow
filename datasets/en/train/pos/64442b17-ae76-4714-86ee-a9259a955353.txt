I'm upgrading them to 5 stars. Had a HELL of a time downing Goulets and other wonderful concoctions made up by our gracious bartender, 'Chele who took great care of us artfully mixing alcoholic wonders for us. I am sad to hear that she's leaving because you could not ask for a better bartender.

Throw in some great food (Swedish Meatballs, Soft Pretzel Sticks, Sliders) and an appearance by "Mob Wives" for some fake reality, I think I've found my bar in Scottsdale.

My head and liver regretted it the next morning, but it was a great time!
