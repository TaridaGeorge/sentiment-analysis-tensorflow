My wife and I as well as several of our friends drive from Ahwatukee on a regular basis to dine at Flo's on Thompson Peak and Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd. 25 miles isn't too far for this food. We've been eating here since the 90's and have always been pleased. I discovered it when I worked in the area and used to stand in line for lunch, it was so busy. Our favorites: Lemon Pepper Chicken with extra lemon wedges and the Kung Pow although I can't think of anything I wouldn't order.
