Brought to you by the owners of Ticoz, Switch is fantastic! I've only been there once but that one time was enough to make me want to go back. as testimonial, let me just say that I never clean my plate. There's always something left. I usually get full and have to stop eating. here, I cleaned my plate. I was practically licking the plate! I had the pork chops with cheddar cheese grits and veggies. I don't like grits... these were GONE. The veggies were asparagus and baby carrots, cooked perfectly. The chops were done to perfection, which is rare. Too often you get dry lumps of meat on your plate that taste like cardboard. Not so with these sweet chili glazed chops! Sheer perfection! My friend had the macaroni and cheese. Again, delicious! 

I'm ready to go back for seconds!
