I'm gonna make this short and sweet - go here and order the Italian Sub.   What's better than italian cold cuts and cheese on fresh baked bread dripping with oil and herbs? That's rhetorical, there are things, but they're not getting discussed at the dinner table. 

Super nice people, Creminelli wild boar salami, awesome Italian sandwich, small selection of Italian staples, this is what you'll find at Niccoli's.  And most likely me.

I swear I'm going to eat something else off the menu, but that day is not today.
