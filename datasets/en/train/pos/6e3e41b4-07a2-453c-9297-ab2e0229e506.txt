More Beer!!!
That's right, they got rid of the Microbrew they had, Bottoms Up, and now have Fat Tire on draft and are getting another beer on draft soon.  They also carry Blue Moon now (thank God!) and a half dozen or so other popular beers they haven't carried in a long time.
They also have daily kitchen specials they are doing a little better job of promoting and, so far, they've been really good.  Still a great place to go, still lots of fun.....now with more beer!
