Hands down...the best Pho in the valley. My GF and I ate here today for the first time and loved it. The owners came out to greet us and welcome us to their establishment for the first time. She explained how the beef broth is simmered for 24 hours and the chicken broth simmers for 12. What a great selling point. The Pho was great. It was fresh and the broth was amazing. Crisp clean taste with crisp clean flavors. The portions are large and we have plenty to take home. We will definitely be back.
