Chicken shawerma...

Sorry, I may have gotten a little distracted there.

Every time I think of Haji Baba I think of three things: their chicken shawerma plate (which is to die for, as in, I would throw myself in the path of a bullet if it meant I could get some), their delicious lemonade, and the store that's attached to the restaurant which always has new discoveries.

I don't get to go here that often since it's a little far away, and until recently the light rail construction traffic made getting there a pain. But when I do I get that chicken shawerma and I tell myself I can eat all of it. Then I eat half of it and box the rest of it up and have a delicious lunch the next day.

I hope this place never closes. NEVER.
