Oh goodness does this place ROCK with their coffees and drinks. Oh my, oh my!  They have a good selection of cakes, pastries, salads, paninis, sandwiches, etc if you're looking to grab a bite here. Einstein is also known as 'Noah's Bagels' in the West Coast and having had tried 'Noah's', I knew Einstein would be greaaat! 

I was feeling adventurous and ordered their mudslide smoothie. I got to choose a cookie from their cookie basket to add into the smoothie. It was creamy, rich and totally worth $5! I skipped the whipped cream, as it was already pretty rich for what it was. 

Our cashier guy was very friendly, too and an excellent barista who made an excellent drink! Kudos to Einstein's!
