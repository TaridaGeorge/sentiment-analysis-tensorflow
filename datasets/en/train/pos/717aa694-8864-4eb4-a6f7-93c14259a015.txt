I was visiting a friend in AZ and despite some other friend's protestations to go to Sushi Roku we decided on Roka Akor instead.  What a great decision!  Both vegetarians and non-vegetarians were amazed at how good this place is!  If you are vegetarian and find yourself in the deserts of AZ you can't go wrong with Roka.

Great informative service too!
