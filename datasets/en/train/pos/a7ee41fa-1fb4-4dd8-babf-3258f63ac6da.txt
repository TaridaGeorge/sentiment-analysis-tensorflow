I had a great experience with Flores, as easy and pleasant as having your air conditioner go out can be.  Miguel answered my call and was available to come out right away.  He went straight to work and repaired my AC within an hour or so, and the bill was shockingly reasonable.  I was prepared to have to haggle about upsells and extra charges, but there was no need.  I'm very glad I read these reviews and made the call, if I ever have future heating/air troubles, Flores will be the place I use.
