I recently moved to area and was having trouble finding great sushi. Pure is kind of hidden in a shopping center, but I'm so glad I found it! The decor is nice and you definitely get the first impression that this is a clean, quality restaurant. The sushi is top notch. I particularly love the Dragon Roll and the Pure Vegas Roll. The fish is fresh and the sushi chefs are friendly. I feel totally at ease as a solo diner at the sushi bar. My only complaint is that the waitstaff is less than attentive, but the food more than makes up for it.
