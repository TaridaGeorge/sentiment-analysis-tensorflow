I recently moved to Phoenix, I love this mountain.  The view is amazing.  There are people of all fitness levels, you can go at your own pace.  Echo is the more difficult side however if you workout at all, you will be fine.  I've also seen a few children on the echo side.  

To get there, simply take the 101 to McDonald.  Parking is not bad, just wait in line and you'll be parking within 10 minutes.  Have fun!
