Great little diner, divey little place with amazing food and I always love our waiter or waitress.  "you want some more coffee sugar??" haha anyways I love coming here for a easy breakfast, you have to try the german pancakes, it takes 20 mins for them to bake so tell them when they take your drink orders and then by the time everyone else's' orders come out it's ready!  I've never had anything other than breakfast here so I think I'll have to give that a try in the future.
