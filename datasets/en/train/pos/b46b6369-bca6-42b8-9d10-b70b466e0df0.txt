Hands down one of the best restaurants in Phoenix.  We were ecstatic to hear of this opening as we were frequent diners at Postinos.  Everything we have ordered has been fabulous.  Their specialty cocktails are a perfect blend.  They always have different beer selection that is wonder.  Their service is top notch!  

If you are looking for some home cooking and great service give Windsor a try!
