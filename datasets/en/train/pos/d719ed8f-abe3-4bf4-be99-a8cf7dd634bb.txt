HTC is the only place I would trust with any piercing more complicated than a lobe piercing. I've gotten 3 cartilage piercings done there, two of which needed to be replaced with a longer barbell a month in due to swelling (Unfortunately my cartilage is prone to swelling. It wasn't any fault of the piercing job). The staff at HTC took care of them for me without charge. Both the piercers and the front desk staff were extremely helpful and patient, even when I call them only hours after leaving the store with a silly paranoid question.

The whole process is done very professionally in a clean environment. They make sure you're well informed before they pierce you and always make sure you're okay after it's done. :)
