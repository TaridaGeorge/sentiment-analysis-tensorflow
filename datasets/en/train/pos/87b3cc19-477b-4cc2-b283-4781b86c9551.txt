Tiki!  Tiki! 

Hula's is my happy place.  Delicious food that's fresh and flavorful.  Excellent service, and the signature drinks, Dr Funk, The Painkiller, and others are fantastic, no matter the season.  The Poke appetizer is my favorite, but everything I've at Hula's has been inspiring.  

If you're really nice, they MAY even turn on your favorite sports game in the bar just for you!  

Hula's... we love you!
