Amazing.
Me and my fiancee's favorite restaurant.  Probably the only place I would spend 36 dollars for a side of mash potatoes. The drinks were amazing and strong and plentiful.  We had our drinks on top of the grand piano until our table was ready.  It was such a beautiful atmosphere / ambiance.

I had the filet and my fiance had the bone in ribeye.  (she wanted to give her spoiled dog the bone.)  My mouth is watering as I type this.  Both were cooked to perfection.  

Warm Butter Cake.  Get that for dessert.  Great with dessert wine if your inclined to imbibe more.

Mastro's nailed both things we love.  We've been to Mastro's Ocean Club several times and now the Steakhouse.  This one is my fave and I will be back for more.
