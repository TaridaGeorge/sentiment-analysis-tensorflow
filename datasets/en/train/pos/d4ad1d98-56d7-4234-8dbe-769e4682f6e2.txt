Had a superb facial this afternoon.  The products used are perfect for anyone concerned about what is put on their skin.  No perfumes or harsh, toxic chemicals.  Amber creates a soothing environment, where you can truly relax.  She also understands that conversation should only be sporadic which allows you to let the world fall away.  If you are looking for a dedicated aesthetist who is truly passionate about what she does, in a friendly, welcoming, intimate environment, this is the place for you ? Don't miss it!
