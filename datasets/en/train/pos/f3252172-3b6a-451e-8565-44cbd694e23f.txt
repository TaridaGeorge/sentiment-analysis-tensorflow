I met Doug and Heidi when they hosted the 2009 Get Your PHX Christmas party.  My first comment upon walking in the store was, "This looks like my parents' living room!"  And in those two sentences you have what Phoenix Metro Retro is:  an awesome midcentury modern design store, and a community center for the Melrose District.  PMR is always hosting lectures, get-togethers over and above their stated business intent, and for those who enjoy this genre of furniture and accessories, it's the first place to go when you're looking for just the right piece.  Because if it is, it will also be the last.  Be sure to join their Facebook page so you can be apprised of the latest social goings-on, which tend to ramp up during the winter months.
