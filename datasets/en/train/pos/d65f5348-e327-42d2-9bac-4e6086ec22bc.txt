I've been meaning to write this review for a long time.  Someone started a talk thread about the lack of health care reviews on Yelp and that was the prompting I needed.

Dr. Madder and his staff have been my only dental health care professionals since moving to Arizona.   They are friendly, professional and make going to the dentist a nearly pleasant experience.

I won't go so far as to say I look forward to going to the dentist but it is certainly a stress free visit with these folks.

Dr. Madder, Tish and the rest of the staff take the time to make sure you are comfortable and they explain everything as they go-from procedures right through billing.

Consider this a Jim W endorsement of Dr. Madder's dental practice.
