WOW!! A real honest hard working a/c company! I'm a realtor and have worked with many a/c people before & I think this is the best and most reasonable I have ever seen. 
My a/c went out at 4pm on a Saturday, I called and Miguel (the owner) picked up. I told him what happened and he asked where I live.  It was on the way back to the shop so instead of just saying they'll help me tomorrow, they extended their work day and fixed my a/c problem for a VERY good price. Even checked my freon for me and didn't try to up-sell or do anything other than what needed repair. 
I will recommend this company to all my clients & family & friends. Well done Flores A/c!
