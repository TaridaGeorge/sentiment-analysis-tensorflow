I'm going to defy the norm here:

Westgate is superb.  No, it's not pretentious like some other areas of Phoenix (not that there aren't wanna-bee's).  It's were normal people come to have a good time.

The highlight may be the Center itself, where parents take their kids to enjoy a run through the water fountains.  Nearby, you have tons of restaurants and a choice movie theater that will deliver for friends, couples, and families.  There are so many options to choose from, in fact, it'd take too long to state them all.

Fortunately, there's a website for that: http://westgatecitycenter.com/

Other standouts include the Yardhouse and the Coyotes stadium.

So, expect good things: plenty of choices, cleanliness, and a decent community of people coming together for a good time.
