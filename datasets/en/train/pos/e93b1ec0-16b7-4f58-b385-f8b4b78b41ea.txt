My girlfriend and I went here for her first trip to a sushi bar, and we were not disappointed.  Everyone there was very friendly and talkative, and Alan even helped us pick a roll based on our personal tastes.

The atmosphere was inviting and intimate, unlike many of the sushi bars I've been to in the valley.

The Crazy roll and Big and Spicy roll were very delicious and we plan on going back very soon!
