I have to say, this place is quite a gem.  It is good enough for me to make the haul from Phoenix to the northland for lunch on the weekends.  I had the "sloppy joes" but it was not like anything my mom ever made (in a good way).  The fries are outstanding.  I had lunch with 8 other people, and they were all equally as pleased.  Service was great. Wine was excellent.  The setting was laid-back and comfortable.  I am really looking forward to going back.
