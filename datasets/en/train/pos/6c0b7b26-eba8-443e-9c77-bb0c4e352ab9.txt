I decided to try this place because I had a Groupon. Blowouts for me are hit and miss since I have kind of tricky hair. I must say, my stylist did a fabulous job! Best blowout I've ever had. My hair was full and bouncy 3 days later! The whole experience was relaxing (great scalp massage!) and I felt very pampered. Great customer service too from the moment I walked in until I left. I loved the beverage service when I was greeted too. Very classy. Phenomenal place. I will definitely return!
