If you like good food, nice people, and really good food then you have to goto DD's. I heart Double D's too and you will once you eat here. I had the Caprese with Salami and Orzo salad with a Dad's Orange Soda. Perfect.

They gots tons of salads and take home dishes. One huge cheese case and another for the desserts. They also have spices, wine, and beers. The best beers are the ones in the cans BTW

Apparently they will be opening a kiosk at the airport in a bit with some other local restaurants. Good food at the airport.
