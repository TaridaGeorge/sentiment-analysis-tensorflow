Everything on the menu is worth trying! 

Not everything is organic or natural, but they have a decent selection and use pretty good ingredients.  I really seek out good organic spots, hard to find, True Food is pretty good.

My Top Picks:
Beverage: Medicine Man Elixir
Salad: Greek Chopped w/ Chicken
Sandwich: Columbia River Salmon w/ lime & avocado
Entree:  Spaghetti Squash Casserole
Sides:  Farro!!  (It's awesome, sweet with dates.) 

Usually busy around lunch, call ahead and put your name on the list!  But even if you don't, there's plenty of room, and they turn tables quick, so you can get in and out in under an hour if you need to.  

They are the official catering restaurant of the Phx Suns.  They must like it, because i was there for lunch this Friday and Grant Hill walked in.  

Good spot for lunch in the Biltmore!
