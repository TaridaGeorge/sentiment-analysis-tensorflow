BEST steak in town hands down!  Great crowd, live music, professional servers, wonderful menu.  The LOBSTER mashed potatoes are a MUST TRY on the menu!! I had one martini and couldn't finish the second because the first one did enough damage :)  housemade whipped cream with dessert literally made me dance in my chair.  Fantastic, fun place to go on a date~!!
