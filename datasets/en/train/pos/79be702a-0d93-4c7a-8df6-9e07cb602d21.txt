Played here last week and really enjoyed it.  Beautiful course in outstanding condition.  Great facilities and great service.  People were really nice.  Course presents a lot of good challenges.  Signature hole is #18 and it is beautiful with water along the left, narrow par 5 downhill, looking into the Westin Hotel.  Great course and experience.  Will play there again.
