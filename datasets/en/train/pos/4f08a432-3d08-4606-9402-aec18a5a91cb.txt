I have just as much fun shopping here for my house as I do shopping for shoes! They have so much to choose from such as artificial flowers,  scrapbook supplies, lamps, candles, frames, furniture show pieces, fabric, and tons of holiday items. What is always great is that their sale prices are amazing and some section is always on sale, but even if it wasn't their prices are pretty reasonable. The store is bright and very tidy. My only sadface comment is that I wish their store was open on Sunday, but I respect the businesses decision to observe the Sabbath.
