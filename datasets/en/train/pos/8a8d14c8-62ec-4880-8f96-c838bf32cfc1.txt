I was on my way to the airport to go back home, so I stopped by this lovely place for breakfast. Before D'Lish, I had never thought to try make quinoa in the morning as I would oatmeal. It was so unique and delicious, as was the amazing egg sandwich and coffee. The guys were incredibly nice and friendly. I wish this was in Austin!
