Great yoga studio!  Tish is an amazing yoga instructor!  I always feel safe and comfortable practicing in her class.  She does not hesitate to come over and fix your positions (which I absolutely love, because hey, who goes to yoga to hurt themselves?).  I also feel completely unjudged and free to modify positions to best suit me.  I also love that Tish will stay and talk to you after class about how you did and what she noticed without feeling like I am being rushed out - amazing!  I always leave this studio feeling great and excited for my next class.
