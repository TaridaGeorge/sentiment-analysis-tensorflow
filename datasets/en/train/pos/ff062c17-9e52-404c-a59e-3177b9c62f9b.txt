You wan customer service? They go above and beyond. We started getting my young daughter flute lessons here and had them inspect her used flute. The person who did their repairs was out sick and they had someone else do repairs that was filling in. During her next lesson the teacher was not happy with the repairs and we had them loom at it again. They apologized, gave us a free loaner and made a lot more repairs and did not charge us. Really happy with their service and will be a long term customer.
