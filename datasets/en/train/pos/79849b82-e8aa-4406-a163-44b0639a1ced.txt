It was freezing in PHX. OK, well for a bay area guy going to the desert it was cold! We were looking for a lunch place in old scottsdale and found this place. We were so happy. A cozy, friendly place with lovely, warm service. 
The food was good for what it is. They also do karaoke at night which we missed. We'll be back the next time for that.

If you happen to be there, definitely try it out!!!
