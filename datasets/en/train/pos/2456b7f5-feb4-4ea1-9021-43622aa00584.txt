They just made my 5 star list.  Today Home Depot hosted a birthday party for my 7 year old.  They let us use the conference room, and provided some building sets, tools and paint for the kids to build projects.  The kids had a blast, and it was perhaps one of the best kids parties I have been to in a while.  Thank you Home Depot for making my kids day special.
