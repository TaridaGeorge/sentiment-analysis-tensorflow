Was greeted like "Family" the minute I opened the door with a hearty, enthusiastic welcome from I'm guessing the man himself Pino. What a hell of a guy! Super friendly. My pizza was fuhgetta 'bout it delicious and perfectly made. Extra thin crust was expertly charred with just the right amount of tangy, authentic, home-made sauce and really, really tasty combination of just enough cheese and toppings to satisfy but not choke. LOVE THIS PLACE, LOVE PINO, and LOVE THE PIZZA! Made me feel like we've known each other all of our lives! Grazie Pino!
