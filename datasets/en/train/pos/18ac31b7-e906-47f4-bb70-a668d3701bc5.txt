Wow!!!!!!!! This is the best pizza on Earth (we went back and forth for a while between Bianco and Cibo and we finally decided on Cibo)if you like fresh ,simple ingredients and great crust instead of salty ,over topped ,greasy chain restaurant pizzas. 
We have been going for years and between our friends we tried everything on the menu. I  keep having the margherita and it is amazing.The sauce is just right,the fresh mozzarella is to die for, the the fresh basil leaves on top and the crust send me in culinary haven.
The prices are good for the quality ingredients ,atmosphere and service.
This is the pizza you dream off and can't wait to go back!!
It is wonderful to see Phoenix developing its downtown area to satisfy some of our needs to  dine in more unique,quaint  and  urban settings.
