I believe of all the frozen yogurt shops that are popping up everywhere this one is my favorite.  To bad I used to live close and now have to drive so far to eat here.  I like that they offer waffle cones to serve your yogurt in.  My favorite flavor is Taro.  I try samples of the other flavors but tend to fill up with only that one.  I top it with a small amount of mochi and lots of popping boba balls.  Yum!  Even my kids can't get enough of the Lychee boba balls.  We will up and tend to spend $3 per yogurt.
