Recently I found myself in the MAC store, hoping to get inspired for a new "look". I decided to leave it to a professional, and thus I was given an appointment with a makeup artist. I believer her name is Yeldis, and she is fabulous! Yeldis has a very good eye for color palettes that compliment all kinds of skin tones, and she showed me how to use products that were new to me. Also, I learned that MAC has a "recycle your containers" program where you bring in your empty containers and they give you an eyeshadow or lip color for every six containers you bring in. Looks like I will be back!
