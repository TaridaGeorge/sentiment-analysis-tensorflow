This place just gets better and better.  Stopped in last night with a friend.  They were packed but we were able to score a couple of great seats at the bar.

I started out with the brussels sprouts. Roasted and served with pancetta and shaved manchego to create a fantastic appetizer.  If our moms had cooked them like this we would have loved brussels sprouts even as finicky kids.

Instead of an main entree I ordered the rock shrimp enchiladas.  Simply delicious!  

At Katie's suggestion we tried the sweet potato pie which was a special that night.  It was wonderful and had a nice flaky, buttery crust.

This place is really hitting on all cylinders.  Get in here as often as you can!!!
