If you like jalape√±o in your drink, michelada or a Paloma,  you're in the right spot. Started at the bar and the bartenders were excellent!  It's an indoor/outdoor bar, nice when the weather is great. Great Tequila selection. 

Had the Calabaza empanadas with side of rice and Mexican corn. Food was yummy and so were the black beans. Service was friendly. 

Would definitely return, cool spot.
