I've grocery shopped, bought/eaten lunch, bought a latter, bought/eaten dinner, drank and finished up a story using their free WiFi at this Whole Foods.
In fact, I did three of those things yesterday.

I absolutely love this place. The workers are friendly and extremely knowledgeable, everyone communicates very well and they seem to really enjoy what they do. It's not often a grocery store makes an impression on me, but this one definitely did.

I even drive down here from downtown Phoenix a few times a month to meet with friends and close down the bar, which they've reserved for us (along with special menu items and discounted drinks) every time we've asked in advance. Many restaurants aren't this good at handling large groups, but this group is great.

I can't recommend this place enough.
