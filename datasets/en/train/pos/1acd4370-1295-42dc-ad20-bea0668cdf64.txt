I had the Chicken Mint salad and it was a wonderful balance of flavors, spice and heat, highlighted by mint.  Refreshing and tasty, hot and bright.  A touch of spice producing some heat, but well balanced and flavorful. The salad was a full meal but it was a hot day in the 90's so I also had the standard Iced Tea which was flavored with peach.  Service was prompt and my tea never went empty...all four times.
$8 for the salad, $2 for the tea.  I'd return and try other dishes, very nice.
