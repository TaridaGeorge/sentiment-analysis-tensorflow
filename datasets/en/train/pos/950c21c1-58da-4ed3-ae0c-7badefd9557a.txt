Best yogurt place in S. Chandler.  Tried Fresco and Golden Spoon, but neither compare to this.  Friendly service, bright open spaces, and clean everything.

Cost model is simple: get what you want (dozen different flavors, cone/cup, toppings, and fresh fruit on top) then it's $0.38/oz.

Hint: there's even free WiFi and a Mac for customers to surf online (or write their yelp review).  Shhhh...
