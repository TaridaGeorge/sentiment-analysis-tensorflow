What an amazing out of the way find! Have been here several times (won't review a good Restaurant unless I have been to it twice) and have NOT been disappointed in the least.

Sandwiches are a trademark and I have had several that are all unique and delicious. Bigger appetite, have dinner here. Not fancy (no white linen) but the food will wow! Even something as simple as a "Mixed Grill" was uniquely prepared and delicious. Soups are also a specialty and if the soup is great - they've got me! Great it is.

A fair distance for most to travel, but worth the drive out. Check for open hours as they can be strange.
