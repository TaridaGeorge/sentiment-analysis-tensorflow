My first experience with The Bikini was after a shoot in PHX. The crew rattled on for an hour about The Bikini and we all finally went. I'm Glad. This is one of those places that I've heard alot about and couldn't wait to stop and have a brew. It did not disappoint either. It is the, umm, hipster, artfag, freaks and geeks place? If your clothes rarely match by accident or design, this is your place. A typical dive bar with some great local art adorning the walls, kickass jukebox and a pool table. Now that I've also finally been to First Friday, it seems the two go hand in hand. I love when I get to go there. It's not in my regular bar list, but only because I'm in TempE and hate to drive, let alone drink and drive.
