OMG, or should I say OMFG. I paid 95 dollars for a battery and 20 for them to put it in, then I found out Sears sells batterys for 40..But it was raining, my roomate was home to jumpstart my car, then follow me up there in his car and we got it all taken care of like 20 minutes...and these really cute young guys worked there and they loved my dog. I just love dog people. Stay the *&%* away from Big O Tires down the street and check the reviews first. This place is high priced for some things but consistent service at every location I have ever been to.
