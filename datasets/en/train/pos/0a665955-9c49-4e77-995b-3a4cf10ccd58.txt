I eat here religiously. Not only do they offer a wide variety (more than JuJuBeri, actually), but they have good prices, television, a decent amount of seating and a ton of offers. You can get coupons through text messages! Bombness! and yes, I have used them. Only problem is, they're hidden in a lonely little corner of west gate :(
