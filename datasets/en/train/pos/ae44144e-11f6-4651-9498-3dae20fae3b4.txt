I love Greek, but I'm on a budget. This is definately budget food! I mean, there's no tip because it's fast food. They prepare it fresh, but serve it expendiently. They have good Tahini sauce. They have good lamb. You can get a side of falafel that tastes really good for $3 and share with everyone. Their pitas are filling. They have food that crosses over into Middle Eastern. Good variety on the menu. I used to go to the Pita Jungle or the way more expensive My Big Fat Greek restaurant three miles west, but for the food and prices, this place hits the spot. Opa!
