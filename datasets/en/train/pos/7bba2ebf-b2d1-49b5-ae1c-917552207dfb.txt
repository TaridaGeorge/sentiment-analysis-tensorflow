Have been here a handful of times with my Hubby for lunch. I would have never given this place a 2nd look, but its literally a 2 minute drive from my work so I thought why not? Glad I did because Pizza A Metro is the bomb!!

We have tried a variety of dishes but our 2 favs have to be the Penne alla Vodka & the Capricciosa pizza, so freakin delish!! Oh & their salads are pretty yummy too. The bread they give you is tasty as well.

We hadn't been here in a few months but on our most recent trip this past Wednesday, it seemed to be under new ownership. Sad-I really loved the spunky, lil Italian dude with pretty blue eyes!

If you have never been, give it a try, you won't regret it! :)
