When you go, get the Thai sticks as an appetizer!
What I really love about this place?  The races!  While I don't gamble, it's rare to go to a clean, classy place and see races.  
The menu is vast.  I like the hummus platter:  surrounded by slices of cucumber and other fresh veggies.  The hummus has a bit of a kick, which is how I make it when I actually have the time.
My servers are always super-friendly and have an awesome sense of humor!
Service is quick, too!
