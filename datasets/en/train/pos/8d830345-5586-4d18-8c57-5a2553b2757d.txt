Awesome warehouse conveniently located at the junction of Loop 101 & Loop 202 south of the Chandler Fashion Center.  Shopping here is always good, many samples usually available, and employees are always very helpful & friendly.  I love coming here for the restaurant because you can't beat lunch of a hot dog & soda for $1.50.  Plus the restaurant has several other delicious items to choose & the hot dogs are some of the best anywhere.  Just remember Costco Wholesale only takes cash, checks, debit, & American Express.  No other credit cards.  =)
