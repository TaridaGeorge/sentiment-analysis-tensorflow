WOWEEEE!! What a dinner experience. EVERYTHING from service, food, and  ambiance was exceptional! I had the sea bass, which they are well known for and I was definitely not disappointed! We also ordered several sides including mushrooms, asparagus, and of course the seafood tower... HOLY OHH EMMM GEEE!!! Amazing!!! If you really want to indulge you must try the famous butter cake...I could feel my butt getting bigger, but it was absolutely worth the 10 miles I had to run after!

Dinner is lavish and expect to pay for it....but you wont be disappointed!
