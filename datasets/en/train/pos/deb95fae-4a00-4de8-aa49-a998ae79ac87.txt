I used to eat at the Chuckbox when I went to school at ASU and loved it. Years later and after living in Texas and California, I still haven't found a burger that compares to it.

That is, as long as you accept it for what it is: a straight, non-fancy-pants burger on a charcoal grill. The way a burger should be. If you want a fauxbe-beef burger with truffle oil and scallions, you're in the wrong place. If you're easily put off by being shouted at while you dilly-dally about what kind of cheese you want, you're also in the wrong place. 

And, while you while you wait for your burger by the grill, you can pass the time by trying to decipher the code of little swords and cups that identifies an order. It's pretty complex.
