I love the Q and Brew. The drinks are very reasonably priced. The bartenders are always friendly. 50 cent pool games or you can play by the hour. This place has terrible lighting. I think they have their pool league nights on either Tuesday or Thursdays. I forget. 

Parking lot is kind of sketchy. Bums and junkies kind of doing their weird thing running around every once in a while. The patio is pretty big. Best baseball coin game. I've wasted maybe 10 dollars worth of quarters on that thing in one session. I'm terrible at pool, but this place is always great. Oh and the jukebox sucks. worst music ever.
