Friendly, fun, and chill.

This place is just great. As a recent transplant to Tempe I was afraid that it was all strip-Malls and beige. I couldn't bring myself to submit to drinking the slop the Seattle based place serves, then a friend told me about Cartel.

I have a particular coffee drink need that is usually only met in New Zealand or Australia (a flat white). Seth makes a flat white to rival anything at home. The beans are delicious, and being there when they are roasting is amazing!

My only disappointment is that I can't walk there easily!
