More than a top notch chocolatier/bakery, this is a great place for a sit-down dessert and coffee. Everyone is super friendly,knowledgeable
and truly cares about their product. Christene (the baker's daughter) not only was schooled in Europe, but she imports her chocolate from there too. If you like your desserts and candy with layers of flavor and texture, this is the place for you!!!
