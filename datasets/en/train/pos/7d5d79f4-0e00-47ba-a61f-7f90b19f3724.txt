The food was excellent, the wine selection was excellent, & the service was EXCELLENT!  

I had a scavenger hunt going for my boyfriend the night I went, because he LOVES their dessert, and the entire staff was VERY willing to help me out.  The server brought the present/next clue out with the dessert.  Everyone from the guy who answered the phone to take the reservation to the hostess to the server were very friendly and offered excellent customer service.  

The food was delicious - we had a cheese & meat appetizer, with a sausage, mushroom, & mozzarella pizza, followed by the Dolce for dessert.  Everything was fantastic, but that Dolce was TO DIE FOR.  YUM!  

Highly recommend this place. : )
