YUM. That really sums it up. we went here last night after having received a gift certificate for a wedding gift. We were so impressed with the food, and my husband actually uttered the words, "I don't want this to end." We started with sangria and fondue which were both fantastic. My entree was the smart chicken and hubs had the pork tenderloin. Both  were unbelievably good and our server was wonderful. It's rare to have all the components of a nice meal come together so perfectly, and this is definitely worth the money!
