J'adore Liberty Market.  For breakfast, you have to try the smoked salmon plate.  Lunch, try the caprese sandwich.  The bread is a little too toasty, and can irritate the roof of my mouth..otherwise, it is so good!  For dinner, try the special.  For a snack, try a scone and the ca phe.  If you have a chance to attend a community dinner, DO IT!  They are so good and a great value.  Support local restaurants!
