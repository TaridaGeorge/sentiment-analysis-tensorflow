Quite possibly the best (and consistently so) service in phoenix...for the prices. Amazing!!
The servers are always happy and smiling - they are quick and my glass is never empty
The food is always equally amazing...wonderfully hot and steaming and the flavor is superb
hard combination in todays chain restaurant monopoly
