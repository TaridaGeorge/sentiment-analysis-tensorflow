Really this place doesn't need another great review. All I will say is that I miss this place. This was a regular place for my husband and I for four years. Funny considering its called Four Peaks. Okay, enough of that. 
Overall, great beer (although selection never changes), great food, and a excellent atmosphere if you can get a spot outside. Personally I'll wait to be seated so I can enjoy the wonderful AZ afternoons and nights. I don't think I'm alone.
