Fabulous customer service!  My BFF and I spent the weekend there to celebrate our bdays and the must have overheard us talking about it because they sent wine to our room that same night!  

And... talk about the spa!  Spa Avania was the most peaceful and serene place to spend the weekend!  Even if you are not getting a service, it's only $20 to just hang out and use the steam/sauna...  Total deal!  

We had the best time there!  Awesome architecture and amazing pools!  Worth every penny!
