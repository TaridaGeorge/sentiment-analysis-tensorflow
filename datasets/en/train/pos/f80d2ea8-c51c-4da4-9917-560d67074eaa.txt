Our evfn (east valley friday nights) group landed at RT O'Sullivans last Friday evening and it was fantastic!  We'd arranged to have a separate area for our social group, so though the TVs were on they weren't so loud we couldn't hear each other speak. 

The waitress (as far as I know) kept up with everyone's needs and the food was really good.  

My only issue is they only have pear cider. I prefer a hard apple cider like Strongbow and there were no choices.

We were treated so well I'm sure we'll be back again.
