For the price this is the creme de la creme of Chines Buffet's.  Okay, not because of it's asthetics ... but the food is always fresh.  They keep it loaded up.  The price is THE best.  

It's a smaller buffet, but with better quality.  And the price is low.  
Lastly --- the price is great --- the food tastes better!
