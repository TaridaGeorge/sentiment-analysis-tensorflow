I take my 9 month old to Hubbard and we LOVE it! I feel so comfortable with the staff and it not only teaches him how to be comfortable with the water, but also teaches my husband and me how to take what he learns and apply it at home in the tub or even in the pool. The staff makes it fun with games and songs and the parents learn the right words to prepare babies to hold their breath when going under water. I think swim lessons are a must for kids here in AZ since almost everyone has a pool. And it's so great to see their progress!
