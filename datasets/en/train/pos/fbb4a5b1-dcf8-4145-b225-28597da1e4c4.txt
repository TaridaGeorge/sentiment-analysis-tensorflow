I totally agree with Stevey  P - the best thing about Heritage Square is that it preserves the past while still celebrating modern culture. Yes, you can see beautifully-restored Victorian homes and imagine how things used to be, but you can also have some of the country's best pizza at Pizzeria Bianco, down a pint at Rose & Crown, or take part in celebrations of different cultures and social groups. We walked around here for the first time this past Friday, when it was deathly hot out, but I look forward to cooler weather, when my husband and I can come here and sit one of of the gorgeous, shaded benches and just take in the scene.
