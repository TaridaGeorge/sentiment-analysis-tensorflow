Locals, you should be thankful for In-N-Out!!! I travel back and forth from Philly and I always make this a mandatory stop.  It's just the best you can get and it's cheap.  Get your burger Animal Style!  It's the only way I go.  Ask for your fries well-done.  And you can even bring your vegetarian friends: they can order a grilled cheese off of the secret menu.  The grilled cheese is essentially the cheeseburger without the meat: special sauce, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions (if you so choose).  It's what my girlfriend orders.  No other fast food chain can hold a candle to In-N-Out.  Only problem is that my cholesterol is off the charts now...  But me thinks that's a small price to pay for such good food.  :)
