Been here recently and it looks like there have been a few changes to a couple dishes.  First, it looks like they are no longer using the HUGE shrimps in their dishes.  Rather they have swapped then our for smaller shrimp and reduced the price.  Also, the sticky rice and custard now comes is the shape of an heart (and is yellow) but lost a bit on the side of texture and sweetness.  Nonetheless this is still one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the Tempe/Chandler area and is a must try for any Thai food lover!
