I feel very fortunate that I live across the street from this Ahwatukee pizza bistro.  They make wonderful pies, I take out from here once a week.  The waitrons are attentive and the pizza is ready in 20 minutes.

I recommend the Hawaiian (ham, pepperoni, and pineapple),  the Flaumbay (pepperoni, green bell peppers, garlic, and pineapple), or the RASPOTLE (chicken, roasted red bell peppers, raspberry chipotle sauce, and a choice of feta or goat cheese/no mozzarella cheese).  The crust is thin, but sweet and chewy.  They make a wonderful tomato sauce, that adds to the taste of the fresh veggies and meat.
