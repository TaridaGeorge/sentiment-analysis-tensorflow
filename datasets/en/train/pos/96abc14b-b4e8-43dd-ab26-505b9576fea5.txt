I ordered a dozen brownies as a birthday gift and had it shipped to California. The brownies arrived in an insulated, chilled container and arrived exactly on the day I requested. 

Each brownie came individually wrapped, which was nice. I was worried they would come open and they wouldn't keep for very long. Every time a new brownie is open I have to sneak a nibble! They have all been so yummy. The caramel one has been my fave so far but I am DYING to try the raspberry one and the mint one. I might have to sneak them out of the refrigerator. 

They include a coupon for your next order in the box and I will definitely be placing another order!
