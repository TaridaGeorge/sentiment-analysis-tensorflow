I'm a huge fan of Lo-Lo's... Best vegetarian option has to be The CJ's (number 14 I believe - 1 waffle, 1 egg, and a small bowl of grits). And when I'm being a "bad vegetarian" I can get a southern style chicken leg as a side order. Seriously amazing grits & the southern style chicken with the waffle just can't be beat (especially if you "accidentally" get a little syrup on the perfectly seasoned chicken).
