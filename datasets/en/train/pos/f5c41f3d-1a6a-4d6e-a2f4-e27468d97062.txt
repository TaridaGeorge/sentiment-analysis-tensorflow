There are very few places that come up in conversation where people unanimously start to try to yell over each other to say how good it is. Every time someone mentions tuck shop, voices raise, and you hear "I HAD THE TIMES MAC N CHEESE AND WOW!!" or "I HAD CHICKEN AND WAFFLES AND OH MY!" or my personal favorite "VOVO REALLY IS SPECIAL AND I LOVE HIS FOOD, IT'S FULL OF RAZZMATAZZ" I love the space, the old house, the location, the simple non overwhelming menu. It is the perfect place for date night, on any night, even Tuesday nights where weirdos like myself can go. The wait can be long sometimes, but it is totally worth it.
