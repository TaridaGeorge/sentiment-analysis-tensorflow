This place is absolutely amazing.  Of the top five meals I've had in my life, this place gets a spot. Starting out, the cocktails are amazing. Thomas and Richie Mo behind the bar consistently deliver some of the most innovative and tasty concoctions in town. The appetizers are to die for. My girlfriend dreams about the pork belly pastrami and the chopped salad is second to none.  Then there are the entrees. Hoo boy. The duck leg is some of the finest around, and their nightly specials can't be touched. Top it off the service is all around amazing. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. You won't be disappointed.
