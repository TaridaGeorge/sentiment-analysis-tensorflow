This is the best hole-in-the-wall Mexican establishment I have found in Arizona. With Mexican food I generally believe that there is an inverse relationship between taste and price, Bisteces is an excellent example of this phenomenon. Bisteces serves yummy authentic Mexican food in a cute environment with hand painted walls. I will also say that the bathroom is one of the cleanest public restrooms I have visited. Although probably not worth a long drive, I will definitely return to Bisteces.
