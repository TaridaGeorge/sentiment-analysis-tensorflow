I had two trials before coming across Stephanie, both of which were not what I was looking for, for my wedding day. Stephanie was highly recommended by Bare Escentuals (my favorite makeup). After my trial with her I was so excited and knew she was my perfect fit! She was punctual, professional and very sweet. She is very talented and has a brilliant eye for playing up natural beauty! She even took on my mother last minute and did a beautiful job on all of my bridesmaids! I felt so beautiful and am so thankful to Stephanie for something I will always remember.

I would hire her again and you should too!
