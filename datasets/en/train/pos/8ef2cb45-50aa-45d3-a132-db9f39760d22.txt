LOVE this place ~ IF I had to only choose one resturant to order from this one might be my top choice.  It's so clean, with healthy food and good, fast, friendly service.  They have the BEST salads!  

One of my farovite personal treats is to ride my bike to Wildflower Bread Company and have their delicious coffee and a Bearclaw pastry. (Yeah, I know it sounds anti-productive to ride a bike to eat a pastry ~ but it's better than driving to eat pastry!)  

They have a very nice outside eating area, too.  I often go here by myself just to enjoy the beautiful Arizona weather, nice people and great food.  I always feel blessed when I leave.  They seemed blessed as well ~ they always seem to have a full house.  Blessings to them.  : ) KC
