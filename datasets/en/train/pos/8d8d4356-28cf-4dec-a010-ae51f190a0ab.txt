Sometimes you just want a good burger and fantastic service.  Is that so much to ask?!  Burger a little pricey, but so perfectly cooked.

The service was so friendly, attentive and helpful.  It was my first time in the tempe/pheonix/scottsdale area and my server Jasmine was incredibly helpful in giving me ideas on what to do.

Brian the manager was fantastic in making sure we were well taken care of and everything was spot on.  

And their happy hour is fantastic!  Home run, and great first meal in AZ.
