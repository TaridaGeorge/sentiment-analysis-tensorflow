After hours of research on internet I chose this shop based on a reference from a friend of a friend.  This was my first tattoo and prior to getting to the shop I was extremely nervous.  However as soon as I saw the drawing that Dan Mattingly had done of my tattoo I was put at ease immediately.  Dan is an amazing artist and I am absolutely thrilled with my tattoo.  I have gotten many compliments in the few days that I have had it and will be going back to Dan again in the future.
