I truly love this place. I work in the area and I frequent it often. It is great for lunch. Love the Chicke Avocado sandwich. And it is convenient for happy hour. The TV's are nice and viewable. I typically am always seated at the bar. 
 Casey has to be my favorite bartender. She is so cute! All of them are good though. Never have to wait for  a drink.
