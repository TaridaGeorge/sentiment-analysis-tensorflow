I have seen may barbers over the years and Tony is the only barber I know in Arizona that can do the "Classic Scissor Cut".  If you are looking for a real classic cut then you need to see Tony.  Tony does other styles but I think that people need to experience Tony's "Classic Scissor Cut".  Are you still reading this review.....GO!!!
