I attended our high school graduation (I'm an English teacher) at the nearby US Airways Center. We walked over to Coach & Willies afterwards to be treated to a meal and two drinks by our school owner and principal. 

Service was fast...no complaints. My whiskey blackened steak wrap was yummy. The two free beers (paid for by the school principal/owner), even better.
