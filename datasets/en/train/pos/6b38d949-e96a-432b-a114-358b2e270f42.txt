This place is always a stop when i am out in AZ.  Loves it!!!!!!!!!! Great burger, great fries, not too expensive, usually pretty quick.  I only wish they had in-n-out where i live.   I like to stick  with the double double and fries.  My gf likes to get her fries well done.  Its a nice option if you like them extra crispy, but regular tastes fine to me.
