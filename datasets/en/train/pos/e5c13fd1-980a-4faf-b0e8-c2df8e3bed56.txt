If Helena Rubenstein was alive today, she would have a cot in the back room of MAC Cosmetics.  MAC has raised cosmetics to an art.  The colors are intense and varied, the product range in the tiny store can keep a shopper busy for hours.... Sales staff are well trained in their line.  They have seasonal specials ranging from new limited edition colors to perfume.  Make an appointment for make up application which is free with the purchase of $50 in product.
