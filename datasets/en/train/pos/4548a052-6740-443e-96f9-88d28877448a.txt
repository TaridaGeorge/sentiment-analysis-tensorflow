Enjoy getting the special deal they have on Mondays or Tuesdays where you can buy one pizza and get the second half off. Their pizzas are cooked just right and the crust isn't too thick or too thin. Also, their pizza is even enjoyable later on when you nuke it in the microwave. 

The staff was friendly and made sure everything was ok just enough and they were not annoying at all.
