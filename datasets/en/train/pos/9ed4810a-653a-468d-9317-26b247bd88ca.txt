I was surprised that they have such a great happy hour, they call it Aloha hour.  But come early because it gets packed.

The chocolate souffle is a MUST every single time I go to Roy's.  Order it early because it takes them a little while to make the oozing cakes of goodness.

I could live off of their souffle!  Can't wait to come back for more!
