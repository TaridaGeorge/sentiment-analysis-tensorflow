This vegan restaurant is simply amazing.  You would be hard pressed to not realize the meatless products you are eating are not made with, well, meat.  I have never had a bad meal here, and would recommend it to anyone.  You should definitely try the buffalo wings and the fries.

If you stop in, the Tsoynami lives up to its grand reputation.
