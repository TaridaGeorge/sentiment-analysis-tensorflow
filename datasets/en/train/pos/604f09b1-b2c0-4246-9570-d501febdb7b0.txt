I love Kohl's!  They have a really great marketing scheme which always keeps you coming back- even if you can see right thru it.  Mark items up and then put them on "sale."  But with email coupons, mailers, and Kohl's cash- I'm always coming in here.  It's my one stop shop for everything except for groceries.
