One of the truly authentic Middle Eastern restaurants in the Phoenix area. The Lamb dishes are spectacular... tasty and tender served always over a bed of rice flavored with the natural meat juices and oodles of toasted almonds. They also have a fish of the day special that is simply to die for. A taste of the Hummous B'tahini or the Akras Kibbe will transport you to the City of Beirut because they are so authentically prepared. The salads are light and the Fatoosh is a treat for the palate. One note: if you are not a garlic lover, they will gladly offer a substitute for the garnish that accompanies most plates. Portions are generous and the prices moderate. This place is a winner!
