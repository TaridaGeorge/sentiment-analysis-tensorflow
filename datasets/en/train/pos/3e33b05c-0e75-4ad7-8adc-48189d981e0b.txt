so happy to have found a great, reasonably priced shoe repair shop in Scottsdale.  Boris did a wonderful job resurrecting 3 pairs of my favorite boots.  He does quality work and turns it around quickly.  He even called twice to let me know my boots were ready.  

I tried another shop in Scottsdale that claims to have won "Best of Phoenix" awards but was disappointed by the quality of work and shocked by their prices - paid $117 to have 5 pairs of shoes resoled and that was with a 25% off coupon...   Boris Shoe Repair is a bit of a drive for me, but now I won't go anywhere else!
