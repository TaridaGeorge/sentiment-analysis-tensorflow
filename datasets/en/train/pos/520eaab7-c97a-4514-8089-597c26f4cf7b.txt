I first went to Salon Sandoval several years ago and then I strayed, I tried other place, including other Aveda Salon's, but my hair was a mess.  I just wore it in a pony tail day in and day out hoping some miracle would happen and then I remembered back to when I loved my hair and loved getting it done.  I immediately booked my appointment, I haven't regretted it one bit.  My hair is healthy and fun and once again I love it.  I see Kelly and I recommend her, I also drive my happy booty to the Phoenix location!
