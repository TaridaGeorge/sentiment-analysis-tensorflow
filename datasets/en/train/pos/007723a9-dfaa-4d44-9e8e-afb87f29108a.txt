Its hard to put into words what makes Postino so enjoyable.  The bruschetta/sandwhiches/salads are great, the wine is great, the staff is great, and the building is great.

But Postino is even better than the sum of its parts.  The view out of the big open garage doors is relaxing and chill, the staff has a cool Urban Outfitters-type vibe, and.... my favorite...

$5 wine before 5pm (or $5 pitchers)!!!  Three out of every four Sundays my wife and I are there around 4, sharing a bittersweet moment reminiscing about the weekend that passed and discussing the work week to come.

Yesterday she said "I wish we could find a Postino on every vacation we take."    I think that sums it up - I always feel like I'm relaxed on a little vacation when I'm at Postino.
