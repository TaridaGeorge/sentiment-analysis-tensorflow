You know, this was one of my favorite Pei Wei experiences... they got the food out fast even though it was lunch time and they were pretty busy. The service was also great on top of that. The lady we ordered from even gave us the "To Go" cups rather than the hard plastic ones, which I always have to request at other locations. She did it before I even had a chance to ask! She said that she was psychic ;)

Their iced tea was delicious, as usual. The food was also great, but no better or worse than other locations. I really don't like to review chain restaurants like this, but this particular location stood out a bit from the rest.
