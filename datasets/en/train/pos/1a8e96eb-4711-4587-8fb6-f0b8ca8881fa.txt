Dont let the interior (with its card tables and fake grape vines wrapped in blue Xmas lights) fool you. The food here was great!  Last time through Gila Bend we ate at the space ship place. Won't make that mistake again. The "gourmet pizza" with house made mozzarella was really tasty - very fresh tomato-y and good crust. The waitress said she gets the Penne Boscialo when she eats here - ham, mushrooms, meat sauce mixed with Alfredo - so I got that and it was great!  My husband got the wings and said they were good but "not that spicy". We will be back!
