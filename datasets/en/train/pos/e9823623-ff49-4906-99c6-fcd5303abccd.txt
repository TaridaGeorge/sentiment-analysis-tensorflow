The very best breakfast in town. VERY big portion and the atmosphere is great, farmhouse kitchen table. Five stars for every aspect of my first trip there. I promise you will not regret it. If you go on the weekend you will wait in line to get in, but they have a patio that you might get in faster if you are willing to sit outside. When you write your name on the list put next to is Patio and you will get seated faster.
