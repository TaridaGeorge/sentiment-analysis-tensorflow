I was reading Jessica's review here.  The staff may prefer to speak Spanish, but they are Vietnamese!  In any event, I brought in some work & what I got here was a fast 2-day turnaround time & top quality tailoring for 20-33% less money than I was paying at Brothers for the same thing.

Woohoo!  ¡Tan bueno como se pone!"  (Tot nhu nó duoc!)    :-))
