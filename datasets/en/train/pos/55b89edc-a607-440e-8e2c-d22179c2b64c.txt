Fantastic Find! We both had great salads for lunch - Calamari salad for one, Pear & Goat Cheese salad for the other - and they were superb. Bread and dipping oil were also good. Service was excellent, although slow (but it WAS during Lunch Rush). Sophisticated atmosphere without  being "urban pretentious." Tables are close enough together that you'd better watch what you say if you don't want to be overheard. Check out their weekday Breakfast offerings, too - they look good. We highly recommend, and plan to go again soon.
