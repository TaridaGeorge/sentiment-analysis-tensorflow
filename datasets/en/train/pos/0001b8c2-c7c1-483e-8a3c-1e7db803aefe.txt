Lucky Strike has lunch and a game of bowling for only $10.  The menu has recently changed for lunch, and the grilled cheese sandwich wasn't very good, however, I had such a good time taking an hour for lunch with friends, that this is still a 5 star review.  

Lucky Strike is most famous for its nightlife, but I prefer lunch for pricing and It wasn't very busy.  So we didn't have any problem getting any lanes for lunch.  

I am headed there again this week to show friends new to the valley.  I will trying the chicken sandwich, since it looked the best.
