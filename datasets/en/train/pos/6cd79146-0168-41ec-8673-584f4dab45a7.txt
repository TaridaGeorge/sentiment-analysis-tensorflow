first time i've ever taken anything to a dry cleaner. and i didn't get anything cleaned. however, the gentleman i spoke with was good enough to inform me that the feathers that were on a promo costume i was needing cleaned for the following day might not make it through the cleaning process. so five stars for truth in service and not just taking someone's cash even if you can't do the job. he also gave me suggestions on how i might be able to go about cleaning the garment myself which he didn't have to do. next time i need a dry cleaner again, i know where i'll be going.
