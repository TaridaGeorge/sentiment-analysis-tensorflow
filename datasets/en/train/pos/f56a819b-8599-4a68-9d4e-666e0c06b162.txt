$12 haircut. SERIOUS.

Who the hell cares if it's a student? They've already had a good amount of training under their belt, they're supervised, and this dollar amount includes cut, shampoo, and blow dry. (Though, I will say, my last hair dresser reminded me of many a douchebag hipster I've met in my years, but that's okay, because it's $12 effing dollars).

Pretty sure it's the best damn deal in town.
