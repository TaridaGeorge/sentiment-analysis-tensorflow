I LOVE SMASHBURGER!
Their burgers and fries are simply the best! I've eaten at several around the valley and they have all been consistent with each other in food quality and kind service. The food is always fresh, the fries always done to perfections (sweet potato & regular). I'm definitely hook. 
I take my teen boys wherever they want to go for their birthday dinner and this is usually their choice. I don't complain because it's so inexpensive compared to the places they use to request before Smashburger opened.
