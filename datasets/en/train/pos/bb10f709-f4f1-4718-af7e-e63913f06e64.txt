Absolutely the freshest groceries in town.  In our crazy fast paced world, these simple pre-made meals are a healthier option than the frozen variety.  My roomie converted me.  

They also carry a lot of organix type products.  Some of the items are rarely on sale like your typical Cheetos.  However, they do have coupons pretty much every week for anywhere from $3-$6 off your bill.  

Lastly, the staff is super friendly.
