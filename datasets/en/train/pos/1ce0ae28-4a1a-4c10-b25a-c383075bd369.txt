I have had some of my best meals in Arizona here. The menu changes frequently but the chef has a great way of creating wonderful flavor combinations. The waitstaff is very knowledgable and ready to offer suggestions, without being pushy (of course I'm a sucker for waiters who talk cheese to me). It's a fun lunch place to take guests visiting from out of town. It's also one of my favorite date places.
