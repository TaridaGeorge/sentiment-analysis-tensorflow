Wow! Great coffee, Great Ambiance. Coming from Seattle, I always wanted for find a good coffeehouse in Phoenix and this one is the best  I have found so far! It was busy but the coffee made was perfect, the lattes are fantastic. How cool is that they have old fashioned typewriters! 
IT's easy to get to and lots of parking. The food was a little bit on the pricier side but really yummy. Will definitely be a go to place! They also serve freshly made cocktails , got to try those one of these days.
