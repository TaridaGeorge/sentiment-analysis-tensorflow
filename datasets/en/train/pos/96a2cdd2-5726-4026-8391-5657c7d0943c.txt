Dear Mr. Fez,

Please offer your restaurant skills to other establishments in the Valley, they desperately need your help.  Perhaps you could write a book on how to make your food, service, and restaurant atmosphere not suck.  I'm sure you'd have to include many pictures and only use small words because most other restaurateurs are feeble minded.

This world is not fair. There is only one FEZ but 10,000 crappy chain restaurants, all of which suck.

Please keep doing what you do and hopefully it will rub off on a few other places in Arizona.

Thank you,

Satisfied Costumer.
