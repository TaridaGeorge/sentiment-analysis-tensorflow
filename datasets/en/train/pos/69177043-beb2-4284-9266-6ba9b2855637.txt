I've been a client of Kristi for about 4yrs now and she has helped me tremendously. I've been struggling with neck and shoulder problems from 7yrs of practicing dental hygiene and without Kristi the pain would have been unbearable. I now own my own buisness providing permanent makeup and use Kristi for preventative therapy. Kristi's message helps keep me healthy and able to provided the best service possible to my clients. Kristi is knowledgeable in providing clients with there own individual regimen, from gentle pressure to deep tissue pressure. Kristi truly has healing hands!
