Squaw is the easier of the two tough Phoenix city hikes.  I say this because parking has always been easier for me (I park in the little lot just before the gate to the park) and because you never have to use your hands, so you can just carry a bottle of water without worrying about it getting in the way later.  That said, you need strong legs for this or else you will feel the pain and burn.  Lots of people enjoy running up or down, but I'd watch out if you have bad knees or ankles.  I have bad ankles, so I hike down swiftly, but avoid the run.  Just like Camelback, there are incredible views from the top which make the toil worth it.
