This is my favorite breakfast place in the valley.  I used to go to the Scottsdale location more, but now I generally go to this location, because it is DOG FRIENDLY!  Yay!

The food is of the same consistent quality of the Scottsdale restaurant.  Same menu, same great protein pancakes, etc.  I recommend the half-and-half (see further description in my review of the Scottsdale location)

I don't find this one to be as busy as the Scottsdale location, but there can be a wait on weekends.  But I've found the servers and ownership to be very helpful, in particular when we have brought dogs.

Because this locaiton is dog friendly, it gets an extra star pushing it to 5 stars!
