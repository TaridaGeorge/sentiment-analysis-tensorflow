My neighborhood Hardware Store.  Man, could they be more helpful or attentive?!  I feel like I've walked onto the Pleasantville Movie Set every time I walk in the store!  

Very helpful, courtious, pleasant (O there's that word again) days-gone-by service, lemme tell ya!

Even if I just want and purchase a light bulb, they make you feel like you dropped a grand.  (VIP)

where eles do you actually get that???
