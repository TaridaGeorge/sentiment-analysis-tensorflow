Same Day Service! Donny from Swimming Pool Butler saved my swamp of a pool after that crazy dust storm. He was very friendly, located close to my house and fast. My pump wasn't working. I had done the backwash a couple times and cleaned the filter and nothing. By the time I had Donny come over the pool was a green muddy mess. BTW I am a renter and know that the pool equipment is old, but was not looking to spend a fortune to fix it. $80 later and I have a clean, swim-able pool again:) Oh almost forgot. He will answer your questions via phone. He is very personable and friendly.
