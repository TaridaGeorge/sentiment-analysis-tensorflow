The main branch of the Chandler Public Library System is pretty big.  What makes this so awesome is that it's not full of a bunch of filler garbage but a lot of cool and new stuff.  There are non-cool/older items, but there are some things I've found that seem too recent to be in a library or a little hipper than I'd imagine would be in a public library.

The only thing I would change is the way they determine what DVD's go in the "children's section" upstairs.  I didn't even know they had DVD's up there and when I went  I found a ton of movies that I wanted to see and would never have guessed would be in a section for kids.
