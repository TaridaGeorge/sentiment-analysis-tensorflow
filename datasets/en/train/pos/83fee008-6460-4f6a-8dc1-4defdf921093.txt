OMG-I have found a place I like better than Cold Stone! Went there for the first time and the cashier noticed we looked lost. He explained everything and told us we could sample ALL the yogurt, and I did! I didn't have to wait for someone to give me my sample I got it myself. I sampled all that sounded good. The Dulce de Leche was Awessome. Some of the other yogurts I had was coconut, cookies and cream, and cheescake. All soo yummy. So I got a mix of yogurt and then I got to the toppings and aww man more decisions. They had a lot  candy, chocolate bars, cereal, fruit toppings to choose from. Anyhow love that you can make your own and get as much or little you want. Oh yeah did I mention it's healthy.  Love you Yogurtini!!!
