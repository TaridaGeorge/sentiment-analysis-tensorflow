I LOVE LOVE LOVE  The Keg...my boyfriend and I come here as often as we can to enjoy amazing food, awesome service and a great patio.  You can never go wrong with the Orange Martini..everything we have ever eaten has been fantastic - from the salads to the steaks.  The boyfriends favorite - the baseball cut steak.  I am a lobster fan myself, but anything you get well certainly be great.

The service is also outstanding.  We were here a few weeks ago to celebrate his birthday and our anniversary and the manager brought out champagne and a free desert. It was a very nice touch that made our night special. They have certainly earned our repeat business!

Oh, the weeknight happy hour specials are also great!!
