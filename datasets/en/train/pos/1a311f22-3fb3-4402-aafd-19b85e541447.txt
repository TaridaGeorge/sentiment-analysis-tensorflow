This place is, quite simply, amazing.  To start, the atmosphere is excellent, especially in front of the Robata grill, and is very upscale without being pretentious or snotty.  The drink selection is great, and unique: I had several of their "shochu infusions," and I would recommend them, especially the honey and the apple.  We shared several entrees over the course of the evening, including the blackened tomato salad, marinated pork chop, yuzu miso black cod, baked green tea custard, and the Raspberries and Lychee.  All were delicious, and I was surprised by how much I loved the cod.  In general, I tend to steer clear of fish entrees (not really a fan), but the black cod was possibly the best thing I've ever eaten.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone.
