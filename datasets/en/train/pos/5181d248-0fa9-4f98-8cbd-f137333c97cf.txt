Wow...  Never had a bad experience at this place. always fresh and well prepared. Their daily specials are always a hit with my group. If they have, please do try their White Tuna (toro and/or regular cut). it is THE BEST white tuna I've had...  

Their regular menu has not changed for a LOOOOOOONG time, so even though they are good, they are "usual/average" Japanese dishes, and not too spectacular. so go to Sakana for their FRESH Sushi and AWESOME specials.
