Went there last night for dinner. I am going to say that the dinner they made us was probably the best thing I have eaten in Phoenix in twenty years. The flavors in that dish were unbelievable.The service was great.
The vibe was great. The music was great. I was stunned and speechless after the second bite and sat there in a semi-coma the rest of the meal. Finally, somebody gets it completely right. A little hard to find, but well worth it and the place was packed with people who knew it as well. If there was a sixth star, this place gets it. Thanks again for a beautiful dinner and we will be back. No doubt. My highest rating and deserving of it!!!
