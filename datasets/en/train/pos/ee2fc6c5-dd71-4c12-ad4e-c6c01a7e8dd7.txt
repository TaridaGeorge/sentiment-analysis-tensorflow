I used to work at this place a long time ago, and went back recently.  The food is as good as ever, the service is fantastic, the prices are reasonable, and the owner is hot.  What more could you want?  I highly recommend the turkey, the prime rib, and the spareribs.  i'm not a rib eater, and the spare ribs are the best I've ever had...you won't be sorry, I promise!
