I made a promise to myself in 2011, I was going to have more time for myself, my family. One thing that took away a lot of my weekends and evenings, was cleaning my house. I know, pick up after yourself and this wouldn't be an issue! But, its more than that and that is where Marie stepped in. She is incredible, she gets done in 2 hours what it takes 6 hours for me to do. She mops, vaccumns, picks up, dusts the tops of my bookcase and cleans my windows. My house has never looked so good and I've never been so thrilled to show it off. Best money I've ever spent! 2011 is looking great for me!
