I've been going to Dr. Miller for over 5 years.  He is hands down the greatest dentist I have ever had.  He is knowledgeable, experienced, technologically advanced and compassionate.  Everybody who works in his office is very caring and friendly.  I confidently and highly recommend Dr. James Miller.
