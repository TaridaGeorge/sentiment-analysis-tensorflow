This place is the Wal-Mart of pho!! (but thankfully you don't see any www.peopleofwalmart.com customers)  Believe me.  You get a big sized bowl of Pho at a bargain price.  

I live near Desert Ridge in north Phoenix and I don't even think twice about driving down to Mesa to eat at Pho Nhat.  

The experience: 

Like other pho places, they don't pride themselves on interior design, street appeal, etc... they just do what they do best, make great pho.  The building  used to be an old Taco Bell shop and inside, they serve great tasting broth, your body doesn't feel like crap after eating there or even drinking all of the broth, and you come out of there with almost enough savings to go out and buy yourself some boba drinks or at least pay for extra fuel it takes to get there from north Phoenix.
