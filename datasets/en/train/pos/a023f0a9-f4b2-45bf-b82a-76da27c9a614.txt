This place was amazing.  The house sausage was awesome, the chopped salad was one of the best thing I ever ate.  We had scallops and pork and both dishes were yummy.  The chef brought out the bread pudding with bacon which was to die for. If we ever come back to Scottsdale, we'd defininitely come back.  Everyone was so nice and attentive.
