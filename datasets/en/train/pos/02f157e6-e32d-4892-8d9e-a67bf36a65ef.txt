No reviews?! For shame, Phoenix!!

Mamma Toledo's is wonderful. I can sit here all day and make jokes about loving her pie, but I'm going to try to be mature. That being said, I love her pie. The key lime is my absolute favorite so far, and I've gotten it the past two times that I've seen her; love, love, love it!

Mamma herself is wonderful as well! She's a fun and beautiful woman (that's her on her truck, people), and my girlfriend makes fun of me a lot for my shameless crush on her. What can I say...? I know an awesome lady when I see her, and the fact that she's one hell of a baker...? Oh my!

Now, since she sells out of pies all the time, I know she's getting business. BUT, she deserves more, dammit! Go eat some pie!
