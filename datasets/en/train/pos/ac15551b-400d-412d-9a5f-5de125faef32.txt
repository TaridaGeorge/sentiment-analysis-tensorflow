We go every morning when the weather is good.  Be prepared to have your butt kicked without the chance of falling down and hurting yourself.  You might be tempted to turn around half way your first time but the hardest part is at the begining.  Awesome Urban Hike! 

(Your kids will probably make it half way unless theyre experienced hikers.  My 5 lb chihuahua made it about that far before needing water)
