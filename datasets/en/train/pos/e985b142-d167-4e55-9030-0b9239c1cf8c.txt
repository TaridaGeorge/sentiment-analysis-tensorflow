Its impossible to top the service and courtesy these guys render.  I'd never even dream of going anywhere else for my S320 or 300TE.

Straight-up, no gimmick quotes on their parts and labor.  NEVER any upselling.  Good speed and very fair prices, and they're comfortable with every platform (W123, W124, W220, etc.) you could throw at them.

Two fellas in particular make this place hum in perfect tune....Kenny the Owner, and Edis, the preeminent mechanic.  If you talk to either of these guys, you know you're in good hands!
