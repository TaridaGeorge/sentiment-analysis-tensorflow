This place is fabulous!  I love the vintage clothing and purses.  I could not get over the amazing handmade jewelry!  It was so well merchandised and so perfect!  The owner was there and was so sweet and nice!  I will be back and hopefully make a great purchase.  It is awesome to see local designers in this cute little boutique!
