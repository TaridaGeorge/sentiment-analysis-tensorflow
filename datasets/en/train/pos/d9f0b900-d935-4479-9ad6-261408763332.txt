You gotta try this place for sushi and ask for the underground menu!!  and save room for dessert, try their ice cream rolls!  My little picky sister who doesn't eat fish loves this place and she will actually eat sushi here.  Try the "volcano roll" its very tasty.  Their salads, rice and noodle bowls are awesome too.
