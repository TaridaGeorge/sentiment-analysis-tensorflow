Always fresh, always good. I especially love the themed months for changing menu items. After the salad bar I stock up on soup-- 6 delicious varieties-- and pasta. At the end of my meal there's always room for the dessert bar.

I am usually able to find a newspaper coupon to offset the moderately high price of my meal, and so I wind up with an absolutely great deal. I would recommend Sweet Tomatoes to anyone looking for healthy foods, hearty soups and free dessert.
