I have been to Corbin's twice now and have plans to go back in the future. It is everything that I look for in a restaurant/bar in that the staff is professional, the atmosphere is comfortable/chic, and the prices are reasonable. The first time we sat on the patio a couple months ago with amazing service along with the manager/owner? stopping by to see how everything was. During a recent visit on Sunday, the restaurant was not very busy when we arrived, but the entire place filled up during the time we were there. Our bartender was helpful in giving recommendations, made a great apple martini, and had a great personality. We had the ahi tuna app, which was a great snack with drinks. I would definitely recommend Corbin's as it's a great place to relax to have a couple drinks and/or dinner.
