Family owned and operated restaurant with mom and pop charm. I went here for dinner and enjoyed their food very much. We ordered the shrimp in coconut sauce as an appetizer. The dish came with crushed and fried plantain on the side and was absolutely delish! For dinner we ordered the Tamale Sampler and the Carne Asada, both were wonderful and full of flavor. Since I had read the Yelp reviews prior to going I could not resist trying their desserts. The CoconutFlan was super tasty and now is one of my favorites. The service was great and reminded me of European style service. I will definitely eat here again!
