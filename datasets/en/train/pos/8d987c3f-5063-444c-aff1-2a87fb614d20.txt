This place is great if your looking for a nice middleastern meal, and also mid-eastern atmosphere, it has taken off since oasis moved, and they have revamped the place, i would highly recommend it, its very authentic, and if your looking for "Halal" "Kocher" food they have it as well! 
The owners are lebanese and cook in true lebanese fashion! 

You can also sit down and enjoy tea and a nice Shisha *Hooka*
