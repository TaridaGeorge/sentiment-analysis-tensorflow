We had a great lunch here today. Used our free lunch punch card and because it was my husbands birthday, the dessert was free too! Love the Delmonico steak and rice, it's very good. If you like your steak med rare, just ask for a thicker cut and it will turn out perfect. 

Very nice employees who really do a good job at making your visit pleasant.
