Absolutely loved this place.  What a find.  Thank you Yelp reviewers.  Terrific flavors without the oversized platter full of forgettable sauce/gravy covering everything!  Each item stands by itself with unique sauce/flavoring.  My favorite test of a Mexican menu  is the basic cheese & onion enchilada, and theirs is definitely a home run!   This will be a "must stop" every time I visit Phoenix.
