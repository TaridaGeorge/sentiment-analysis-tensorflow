Great overall experience - staff was great, decor/environment was nice (although kind of cavernous, possibly b/c of how empty the place was when we got there) service could have been a little faster but it was fine.  

Food - YUM.  Side note: this place has a killer burger.  Like, I thought I was in Delux.  I munched on it, as a less-adventuresome dining companion ordered it and was unable to finish it, and really enjoyed it.  I think everyone really enjoyed their meals, and I know I can't wait to get back and try what I missed!
