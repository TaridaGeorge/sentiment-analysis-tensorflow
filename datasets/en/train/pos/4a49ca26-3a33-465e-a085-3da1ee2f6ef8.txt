Dr. Bruce Okun has been my dentist since I was 12... 20 years later I would like to say that he is just as great. In addition to his great work he added his daughter Dr. Amy to his practice and she is a gem! They entire staff is caring, gentle and they can even get my husband to go to the denist. (A feat in itself) I must also tell you about my 4 year old daughter asking to return to Dr. Amy because she was "soooo nice" she treated my daughter like her own!
