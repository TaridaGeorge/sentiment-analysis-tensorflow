Just wanted to send a shout out for the guys at this location....because I noticed it wasn't on the yelp page here....so now it is. Hey yelpers the guys at this place are totally awesome....and if you go there and give them your business you will be real glad you did. They are fairly new in this area....and they may get overlooked at times because the are in a shopping area right off cactus road near the Wal-mart.....but trust me they do good work....and the customer service is top notch. So if you are having car problems or just need an oil change....give these guys a shot. Eat, Drink, and Be Merry my Friends!!!!
