I love Pho!  I could eat it everyday and maybe I will as I want to loose 50lbs this year and I think eating soup just may be my new diet plan.  I have always had friendly service here and not sure why others have noted that the service is not friendly.   I always get the 2A which is a  good sized bowl of beef broth soup with beef slices, noodles and veg on the side.  I also order the hot tea.  All this for a grand total of $4.50 plus tax.
