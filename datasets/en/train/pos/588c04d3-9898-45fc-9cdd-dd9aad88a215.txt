The food cannot be beat here and the choices are outstanding. I always struggle with what I'm going to order whenever I attend. 

The salsa was delicious, main courses were hot, crisp, and cheesy in all the right places. Margaritas were tasty too! Biggest problem is I want to keep eating the food because it tastes so good, even though I'm full.
