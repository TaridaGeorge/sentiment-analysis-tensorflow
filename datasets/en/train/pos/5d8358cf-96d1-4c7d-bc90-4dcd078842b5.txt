Wow what a place!! nice decor and the staff was pleasant and had great suggestions. Took the time to explain their menu and unlike damn strbks I could actually hear what she said and didn't have to YELL my order!! So relaxing this place. The whole experience is better than any and their macadamia, walnut I think muffins are to die for!! My wife had the cinnamon roll  and it was enough for a family. Hurry and go there or better yet right next to the theatre before the movie.
