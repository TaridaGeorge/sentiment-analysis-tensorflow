I love The Parking Spot. A secure place to park my car with covered parking. It costs $10 a day, sometimes it costs $7.50 or $8.00 a day depending on the coupon you use. You can get coupons on-line or in the magazines in front of you on the airplane.

I love the convenience of charging my credit card via my Parking Spot card which also keeps track of my points to earn free parking. The buses are always operating and you don't have to wait long to get picked up. This is definitely a bonus when it's 110 degrees outside. You can always call the office when you arrive and they will specifically call the drivers and let you know that you are waiting for a pickup.

You get picked-up and dropped-off right in front of your car.
