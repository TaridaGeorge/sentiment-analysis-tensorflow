This bakery is very charming and has amazing pastries. I usually get the Empanada de queso and the Empanada de mango (only .60 each!). They have the best, best, best empanadas I've ever had!

I've only had pastries but I can't wait to try the burritos and tamales because I've heard nothing but good things about them.
