I love this gym.  I decided to go to this gym because of its daycare.  They have a separate section for infants and only allow four babies per caregiver.  In addition to that they have tons of classes and a lot of different activities including rock climbing.  I love their indoor and outdoor pools.  I really appreciated that they don't do the hard sell when you go check out the gym.  Goodbye LAFitness!
