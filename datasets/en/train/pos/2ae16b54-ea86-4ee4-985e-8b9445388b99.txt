I was so impressed with Crudo! The quality of the ingredients is absolutely top-notch, the combinations of flavors are very innovative and the atmosphere is very cool.

My initial concern was that the portion sizes may be too small for my husband, who refers to those places that serve a tiny portion on a huge dish as "foo-foo." But Crudo is certainly not a "foo-foo" restaurant. The portions were perfect and absolutely worth the price. We also appreciated that not all the dishes were truly "crudo." I enjoy the raw food thing, but I know not all guys are into it. 

The Squid Ink Risotto was absolutely one of our favorite. I thought the presentation and the flavors where excellent
