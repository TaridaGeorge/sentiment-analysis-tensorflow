Still in love with this place! My fiance and I come here as often as we can, can't come as often as we'd like or we'd each be about 15 lbs heavier though. The burgers are top notch! My fiance loves the italian beef, which I had before and thought it was good although the burgers are amazing so I don't like to go astray and get something different. Customer service is still awesome, and the prices are extremely reasonable. My fiance and I have since brought many friends here who have all been back to enjoy this place without us. Will continue coming back whenever we are too lazy to grill our own burgers! Love the fresh ingredients inside, and I seriously have dreams about the Lobby special sauce they put on the burger. Those fries dipped into the Lobby sauce is ridiculously good. Mmmm!
