This Yogurtland is so so so much better than the one on Rural and the 202, despite its shitty parking, frightening proximity to the soft porn whorehouse American Apparel, and totally disinterested staff. A-MAZ-ING. Maybe it was the tart blueberry that did me in. The product just seemed fresher and of higher quality here.

My only beef is minor: tip jars? Really? For doing absolutely nothing? No.
