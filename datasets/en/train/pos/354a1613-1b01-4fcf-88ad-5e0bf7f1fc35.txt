Durant's is clas-sy.  I had heard that they had big comfortable booths and fancy meals, but I was still impressed.  We stopped in around 11.30 one night, just for a drink (two other places we tried before it were closed).  It was very quiet with just a few other patrons.  We received great service from the bartender, and will definitely be going back.  Maybe for dinner next time - I'll have the mashed potatoes (aka the vegetarian special).  :)
