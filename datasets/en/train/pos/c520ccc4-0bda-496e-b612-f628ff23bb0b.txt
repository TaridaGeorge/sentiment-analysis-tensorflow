Stopped in the store for the first time today and I am officially hooked! What I loved the most is that you can buy mini bags and try an array of flavors. So far my favorite is the Pizza flavored popcorn. My son loved the Green Apple flavored popcorn. All of the flavors are delicious and so fresh! I have friends with birthdays coming up and they will all be receiving some of this gourmet popcorn as their gifts. 

Not only does everything taste great, but the store is so clean and cute. They have vintage candy and sodas, and all of the themed popcorn tins you can think of. You all need to try this store and you will be hooked too!
