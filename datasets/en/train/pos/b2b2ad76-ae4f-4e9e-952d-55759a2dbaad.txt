The Deli happens to be one of the best restaurants my wife and I both enjoy.  Food is fresh and service is excellent.  Both Brandon and Sarah  provide excellent and very friendly service.  I not sure why the other reviewers care where their tips go. People can make mistakes on orders you don't make very clear, is it possible your perfect???? Sometimes friendly conversation with the servers adds to the atmosphere. Dennys has a booth for you. Reviewers who don't like the outdoor  water fountain for their kids to play in might try McDonalds, they have an excellent kids menu and wonderful playground....not many flavors flirting with each other..not sure what that means. Highly recommend the food and service...its country, very simple and still provides gourmet menu...
