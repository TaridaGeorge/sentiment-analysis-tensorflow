I have been coming to Diana's nail salon since she opened this location. I have never had a bad experience! 

For my wedding, Diana had blocked off the back half of the salon for me, my mom & my bridal party. They really gave us the 5 star treatment!

They accept appointments as well as walk ins, they rarely turn anyone away, even 30 minutes before they close. There are about 10 spa pedicure stations and 10 manicure stations as well. They use the "worry free" piping system so you don't have to question the cleanliness of the spa chairs. Another plus is there is no "nail salon smell" which tends to make me nauseous. 

All around, a great place to go; and I have since 2001.
