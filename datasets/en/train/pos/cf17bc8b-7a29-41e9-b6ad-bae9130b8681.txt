I love this place.  I have only been there twice and both times were great.  It gets pretty busy in there but the service is still quick and efficient.  I am all about the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, but their french toast is good too.  Bacon could be crispier, but I guess that is more of a personal taste thing.  I will definitely be dining here again.
