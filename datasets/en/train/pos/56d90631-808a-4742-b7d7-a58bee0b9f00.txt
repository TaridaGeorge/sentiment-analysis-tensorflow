My dear friend and I went to Season's 52 for lunch.  Ken was our server and he made the whole experience especially wonderful.  Great food, comfy booth and very pretty surroundings.  If you go, ask for Ken.  He is personality plus and he will make sure you enjoy every minute of your dining experience.  I love the menu and its variety of choices to suit various dietary preferences.
