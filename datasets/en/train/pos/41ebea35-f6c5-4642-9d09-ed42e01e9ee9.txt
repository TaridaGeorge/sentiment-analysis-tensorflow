Not sure how yelp works, but I already posted a favorable review for this place, but it has disappeared!!!

El Pollo Supremo is one is favorite places to eat.  The menu is simple, but what they do with what they offer is unbelievable.  The chicken is outstandiing, the beef succulent, and the side perfect.

Bring cash, and enjoy what hey have to offer.
