Does it get any better? This has been an ASU/AZ institution since it's inception. Great for a quick dine and and/or liquid lunch, or the quick drive by to pick up a growler of kilt lifter. Definitely a conversation starter if you walk around the party with a growler of high gravity brew. I highly recommend taking the tour and checking out the brewing process, it's interesting to know that they strip down the water and add salt, etc, to the mix to get just the right tasting water; a crucial ingredient. They can simulate the water found in all the great beer-making locales around the world, from Dublin and back. This brew will make you homesick should you ever leave; ask my bro....
