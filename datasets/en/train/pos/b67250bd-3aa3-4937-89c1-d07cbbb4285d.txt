This place is as good as it gets!!! I agree with the below comments, it's a sweet BBQ. But still the BEST I've ever had. I always get the salad with the chicken, no need for dressing, his wonderful bbq sauce is all you'll need. And their fries have the wonderful dry rub on them that makes you have a hard time not eating them all! Not only is the food great, but the owner is SO personable. We half come back just for him! 

While you are there, buy some of his BBQ sauce!!!! It's not advertised so you have to ask, I think it's $5 for 2 squeeze bottles. Totally worth it! And try some of their beer on tap! All around a wonderful experience and I would recommend this place to anyone who loves award winning BBQ.
