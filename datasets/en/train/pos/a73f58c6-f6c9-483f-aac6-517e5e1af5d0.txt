Found this place on "around me" and we fell in love with it! The food was fantastic and our waiter, Willie, was awesome. I'm going back again on Sunday! Fresh, organic foods, and the flavors are incredible. I had the Baja omelet which consisted of grilled chicken, bacon, onions, and chili's. So good! And the homemade salsa was out of the world!!!
