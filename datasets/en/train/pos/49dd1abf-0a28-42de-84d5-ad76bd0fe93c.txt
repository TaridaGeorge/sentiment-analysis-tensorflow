This is the best Einsteins I've been to!! It's clean, the staff are friendly, and it has a GREAT outdoor seating area. Paul, the owner, is friendly and goes out of his way to make sure we're happy. He remembers us when we come in - it's a big company run with a small, family business feel. I've made this my breakfast spot because I know that I'll be treated well!!
