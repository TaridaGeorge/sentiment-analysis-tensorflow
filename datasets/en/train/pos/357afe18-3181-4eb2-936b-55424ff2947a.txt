FnB is an excellent restaurant, and more so because of the owner and staff's attitude and intent to provide a very intimate dinner.  My date and I arrived late after a very busy day of trapeze training, and were graciously seated at the bar, and treated to a very enjoyable conversation about the food, desired taste, origin of the ingredients, and the owners background.  The chef made the most spendid meal, in front of us, and then stopped every so often to ask about or talk about the meal.  Great place, give it one of my highest recommendations.  Go for the food, go for the mood, whatever, just go.
