FAST FOOD & PERSIAN FOOD ARE USUALLY NOT SYNONOMYS! 
As A Persian Food Aficionado, I have had Kabob all over the world... 
I love Persian Food! "No!" I love good Persian food! 
Well the first few times I was walking into The Subway restaurant next door to this place I peeked, but was very hesitant to walk in! Well thanks to my buddy I finally tried it. I must say I was pleasantly surprised! The Kabobs: Kubiedeh, Barg (the cuts of fillet), and Chicken Kabob are all tasty, and the daily dishes are all very authentic & tasty.  The ambiance is standard fast food restaurant, the staff is very friendly & greets you when you walk in, and answer any questions you may have.
So if you want to skip McDonalds and Subway and go Mediterranean,  Zaytoon Kabob is a great choice for the real Middle Eastern dining experience!
