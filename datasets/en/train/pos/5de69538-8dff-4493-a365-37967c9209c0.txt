I eat at TC Eggingtons at least once a month if not more.  My office is across the street and it is one of my favorite places to go if I am eating lunch out.  I have not had anything on the menu that has not been amazing.  They are always willing to make slight alterations in the way they prepare something to help me with any crazy diet I am on. I highly recommend TC Eggingtons for brunch or just an everyday breakfast or lunch.
