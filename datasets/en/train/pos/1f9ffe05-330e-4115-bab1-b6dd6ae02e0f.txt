I LOVE LIFE TIME!!  It's always clean  plenty of machines to work out  on  that are in working order!  HUGH VARIETY  of classes to take and keep you from getting bored.  My kids LOVE it too and ask when we are going to the gym.  They also have the rock climbing wall, basketball and Squash courts and outdoor and indoor pool with life guard and a water slide at both.  The out doors  and indoors have a lap pool as well .  The inside has 2 extra large jacuzzi  and of course your steam room and saunas. I personally love the locker rooms they are so nice to shower and get ready in they provide everything you could think of ( just like a 5 star hotel!! )  This place keeps me motivated You Gotta try the Zumba class and Strictly strength class!!!
