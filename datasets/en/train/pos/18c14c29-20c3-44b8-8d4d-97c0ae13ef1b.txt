I have been going to this spot since I was a kid. It is almost "comfort" food for me!

I have always had great service, and the food has been very good, too. It is great for a "fast food" type place. Great for groups, and not too pricey. I definitely suggest this place to anyone. Everyone that I have recommended Someburros to, has loved it!
