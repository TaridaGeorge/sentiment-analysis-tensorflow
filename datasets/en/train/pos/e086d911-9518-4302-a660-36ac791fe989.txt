Love this place! You go in and 30mins  and $35 later  (unless you buy four and its $25 which I do!) your hair looks amazing and you feel pampered and ready to go out. They also do makeup and I can tell you that their facials are the best in town!  Trust me- I am one picky customer and they never disappoint.
