Hell yes... I only found this place because I was going into Changing Hands for a new book and saw MUSIC in giant letters two doors over.  Since I'm always looking for indie music stores, I checked it out.  Walked out with 4 used CDs for like $17.  This is the type of place I love stumbling across.  With my first experience there working out so well and its proximity to Changing Hands (and a bar in between those two, not sure of the name, but I will definitely be checking it out) I'll be returning frequently.

Staff is very cool, good selection of vinyl, and the best prices on used discs anywhere I've seen (better than Zia's).
