Yes! Wow, I finally made it to Pizzeria Bianco after having it bookmarked for a couple years.
The good part now is that they are open for lunch, so the line isn't quite as long and they take RESERVATIONS! I made a res for 10 about 3 weeks out, and while it was very crowded in there with 10 people, it was well worth it.
The setting is adorable; Heritage Square, to me, is perfect downtown Phoenix. The old house is super cute, as is the bar next door. Bonus points because you can walk to the ballpark and other downtown sites.
The menu and wine/beer lists are small, but carefully-selected and unique.
The pizza has an excellent crust with delicious, local-where-possible ingredients.
I highly recommend Pizzeria Bianco for visitors and locals!
