All of my baking needs are met whenever I am baking a cake for someone. If you are building a custom cake, this is the place to start. No matter what kind of cake you are making they will have the supplies for it. I made a NIN cake for my boyfriend awhile back and I needed cake paint, cake stands, and doilies. If you are not sure of where to look they will make suggestions for you. 

The only bummer about the place is that they close so dang early. So just make sure you get here during the early part of the day.
