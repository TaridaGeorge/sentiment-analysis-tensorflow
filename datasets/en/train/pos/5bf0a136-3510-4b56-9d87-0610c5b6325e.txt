I love this place!  Since moving to Phoenix I miss my favorite Kosher bakeries and am so happy to have found Karsh's.  They have the best Challah bread I've had since I moved here, I love their egg bagels, and the rolls are delicious.  Next time I'm going to try the rye bread.

Their butter cookies are melt in your mouth delicious and the rugelach and decos were delicious.  I was so happy to find an apple strudel like my great grandmother used to make, that even though this place is a drive from me (I'm in E Mesa) I will definitely be making more trips here in the future.
