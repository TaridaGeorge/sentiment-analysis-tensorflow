My BFF (best friend forever), the architect from LA, was visiting for the weekend and is a huge fan of FLW (frank lloyd wright) so we decided to get girly enjoy the flw decor and architecture and have a ladies brunch at Wright's. Although the menu is a little pricey it's definitely worth it because you order from the alacarte menu and you get the salad/seafood/appetizer/dessert buffet for free.  

I think I got the steak and eggs and it was $32 and she got the salmon for $30. The seafood at the buffet included crab claws, mussels, clams, lox. There was also a caprese salad (mozzarella and tomato), prosciutto, salami, and other cold meats. 

Everything was very satisfying but tried to hold back on getting "thirds" because it just didn't seem like the place where you pigged out.
