I can't say enough positive things about Amenzone.  I've been working out here since August of last year and in that time, my stamina, strength, and energy have increased immensely--beyond what I could've possibly expected or anticipated.

If you like mirrors, weights, and chatting/texting in a gym, Amenzone is not for you.  If you're serious about getting fit--mind and body--and you're up for a challenge, Amenzone is definitely for you.

This is, bar none, the best workout I've ever done.  And I'm in the best shape I've ever been in.

Come and try a class--I've got a guest pass with your name on it :o)
