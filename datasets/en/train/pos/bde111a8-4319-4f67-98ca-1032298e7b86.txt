I am so glad this place opened in Surprise! My mom and I went to Saigon Kitchen for lunch and this place is very good! The prices are great and the waiter is very friendly. We had the pork spring rolls which were super light and fresh. My mom had the chicken curry and I had the short ribs. Both were excellent. They give you scallion broth, rice, and salad to go with the entree. The portions were just right. This place is great and I will definitely come back for more.
