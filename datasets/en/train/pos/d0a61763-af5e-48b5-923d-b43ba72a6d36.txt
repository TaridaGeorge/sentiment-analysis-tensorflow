The carpet in one of the rooms of my old house looked awful after an occupant with a big dog (and who wasn't all that cleanly herself) moved out.  My girlfriend called a few places and ended up going with Kiwi since they not only offered a low price, but they have a good guarantee and an awesome loyalty program.

After the first call, Kiwi will return anytime and lower some of the fees.  They did an awesome job, and the carpet in the room looked as good as new.  So when we moved out, we had Kiwi come back to touch up that room, and clean up the rest.  All of the carpets looked great.
