This is probably one of the best yogurt joints in town.  They have the best tart flavors that aren't super sweet, creamy and milky like some places.  HUGE fruit and topping selection too!  My favorite is the blueberry pomegranate acai tart flavor, but they rarely have it...It is soooo good!  The place is super cute with flat screen tv and cyber looking decor.  We bring our dogs and eat yogurt outside on the patio.  They have dog yogurt too, our dogs just don't care for it...they are picky eaters.
