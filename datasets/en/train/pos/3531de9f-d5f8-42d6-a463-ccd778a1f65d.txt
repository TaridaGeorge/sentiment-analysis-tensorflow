Sanctuary is a great place to stay--awesome views, delicious food, friendly staff--exquisite service overall. Not to mention, Beyonce and JayZ honeymooned here! That's when you know you're at a great place; celebrities choose to go there for their honeymoon! 
I saw on their Facebook page that you can win a romantic getaway right now. It includes champagne, chocolate-covered strawberries and a rose-petal turndown. It sounds like such an awesome experience and a great night for romance...and what's even better is that it's FREE!
