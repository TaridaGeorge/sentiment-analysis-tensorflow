I was meeting some high school friends after a long time and we decided to go for Thai food. The ambience was good and the food was good too. I ordered the Buddha Deligh (fried tofu). Loved it .Got the yellow curry which was awesome too. Would definitely recommend this place if you are in the area and want to eat thai food.
