I was here for a work conference but it was a vacation for me.  The place is amazing.  It has really clean and nice rooms, the view is amazing.  Everything is very open and the place has everything you need.  You don't really need to leave this place.  I was hesitant about the restaurants located inside the hotel but the Sushi restaurant near the lobby is really good and not that expensive and the SWB bistro is also pretty good.  The swimming pools are nice, the water slides are fun, the tennis courts are nice, the fitness center, golf course are all really nice.  I would highly recommend coming to this place.
