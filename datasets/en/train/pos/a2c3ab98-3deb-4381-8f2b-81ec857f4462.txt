My daughter and I love this place! Whenever we are shopping at Kierkland Commons we stop here for lunch.  You order at the counter and your food is brought out to you.  We like to sit outside and people-watch whenever we can.  It's a great location.  My favorite is the Corner Chopped Salad ~ I get it everytime and it is amazing.  

My daughter gets the classic grilled cheese and a cup of tomato soup.  Perfection!  Friendly service, delicious good.  Highly recommend.
