I definitely have to say this one of my cheap favorite restaurant around.  I can spent $6 (including tip) and get a decent size plate of DELICIOUS hummus and a pita.  I would have to say this beats going to some fatty hamburger joint.  So all those people that are sick of eating MD's try this joint.
Pita jungle is a relaxed restaurant atmosphere to come chill with your friends.  The employees are friendly, food is great, and several cute waitresses =).
