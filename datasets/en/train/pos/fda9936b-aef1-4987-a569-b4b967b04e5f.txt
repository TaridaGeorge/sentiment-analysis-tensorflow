Penzey's is the kind of place that is an antidote for having a horrible day.  It is hard to be angry, annoyed, and depressed when surrounded by a hundred different cool spices to wander around and check out.

The cinnamon selection alone is ridiculously cool... being the droll Americans we are, we're all used to the same kind.  Also standouts: the chili seasoning collections and the meat and fish rubs.

Even if you're not a budding chef, this is a great place to explore for a few minutes, and there are plenty of idiot-proof spices that would work wonders in simple meals.  It will definitely have you inspired!
