Located inside the Talking Stick Resort, this cigar and martini lounge offers a wide range of seating indoors and outdoors.  There are a couple flat screens scattered throughout and a fully stocked bar. 
You can bring your own stogie to smoke as long as you purchase a drink (alcoholic or non) at the bar.  They do sell a small variety of good cigars located in the in wall humidor.  
The atmosphere is relaxing, and they offer live music after 6 pm.  The bartender was friendly the day we went.
BTW, there are a variety of wonderful restaurants to try in the casino/resort area.  There is a casual cafe, a buffet, a sushi place, a deli, a fine dining place on the 15th floor, and soon there will be a jazz club.
