Many of the businesses in this area of the city are converted houses and Made is what started it all. It is my understanding that they got the idea of buying dilapidated houses, fixing them up real nice, and turning them into neat little shops, restaurants, and bars. Kudos indeed!

Made itself sells unique books, hand-made and other cool cards, cool artist-made jewelry, some artist-made and small label clothing, and art from local artists. The people who work there also know the area really well, and are more than happy to suggest other businesses in the area.
