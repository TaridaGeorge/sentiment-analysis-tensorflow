We had our scooter and lift serviced this morning and the restaurant was in the same shopping center.  This was our 3rd time there and it was awesome as always.  Good service, fresh food and yummy fluffy pancakes.  I tend to be a pancake snob and can not stand heavy thick pancakes, these were light and fluffy.  My husband had the breakfast skillet of steak, eggs and potatoes.  He loved it.   There menu said their soups are all made from scratch daily, but we have not been there for anything but breakfast.
