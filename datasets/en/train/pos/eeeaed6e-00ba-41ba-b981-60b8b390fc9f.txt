Pharmacist is SO FUNNY! He always brightens my day and brings comedic relief to a dull task (picking up prescriptions). 

I don't do much of my grocery shopping at Albertson's since I try and purchase mostly sustainable foods, but their french bread is DELICIOUS! I could seriously eat a whole loaf in one sitting. The management is accommodating. I did once get hit on and stalked throughout the store by one of their creepy bag people. I think he might have been a little "out there" though, so it was more humorous than anything.
