The pizza crust is perfect and the roasted tomatoes on the Margherita compliment so well.  Pair this with a glass (or two) of the Penelope Sanchez red and will you be a happy camper.

The real star here may be the bowl of clams.  You'll find yourself mopping up that broth with their bread as long as your stomach has room.

Their staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  They are passionate about the beverage offerings and it really rounds out an excellent experience.
