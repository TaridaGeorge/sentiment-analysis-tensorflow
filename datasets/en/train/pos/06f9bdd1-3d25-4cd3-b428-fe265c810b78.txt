The best candy store I have ever been to.  I can't wait to bring everyone that visits me to this store.  It is like sweet tooth heaven.  My five year old couldn't pick her chin up off the floor when we walked in the door.  My three kids and I spent $18 on our first trip and we could have easily spent way way way more than that.  YUM!
