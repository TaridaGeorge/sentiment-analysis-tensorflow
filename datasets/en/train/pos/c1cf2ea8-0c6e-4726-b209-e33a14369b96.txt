Haven't had a bad meal here yet. The salads are large. Large enough to share or have half and save half for later or lunch the next day. My favorite is the Thai chicken. My husband and son are addicted to the focaccia deluxe sandwich. They love the Parmesan pesto spread that have on it. I bring home a tub of the spread (sold sep) and a bag of the toasted bread for dipping when I have company. The baked goods are also excellent. All fresh and baked on premises. My favorite is the butterscotch ranger cookie. Darn. Shouldn't have told you. Now they will be out when I go!
