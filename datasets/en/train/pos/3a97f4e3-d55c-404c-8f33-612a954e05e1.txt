My boyfriend buys me one at least once a month..sometimes we even get them at the farmer's market in Scottsdale. I have had the: orange, lavender, root beer and salted caramel flavors. Salted caramel or lavender..can't decide which one is better...guess I'll have to keep eating till i figure it out!
