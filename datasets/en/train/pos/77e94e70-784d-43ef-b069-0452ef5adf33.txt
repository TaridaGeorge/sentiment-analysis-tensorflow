I don't know how this only has 3  1/2 stars, but this is bay far the BEST breakfast place in town. There pancakes are amazing, and that  is all coming from a person who does not like pancakes or breakfast food at all.  Everything I have ever eaten here is AMAZING!  There is normally a wait to get it, which I normally hate, but I love this food so much I do not mind.  I would recommend this place to anyone who wants the best breakfast food in Arizona!
