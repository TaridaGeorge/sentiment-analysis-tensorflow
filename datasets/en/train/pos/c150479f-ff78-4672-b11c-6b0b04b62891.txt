Been here twice now and I really like this place!  Great healthy choices for lunch and it is not that expensive.  Both times I have come I have had the My Sherry A'more it is grilled chicken, white onions, button mushrooms, and fresh baby spinach sauteed in a robust sherry sauce, with diced roma tomatoes, jasmine rice, and feta cheese wrapped in a tomato basil tortilla... YUMMY!  This is going to be one of my regular lunch places now.  Also they have a strawberry lemonade that I am sipping right now that is so refreshing!
