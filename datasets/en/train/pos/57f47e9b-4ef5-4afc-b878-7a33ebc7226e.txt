Honestly a great rec center. They have an awesome gym, the prices are really good for family packs, and the parks surrounding the center are beautiful and well-maintained. 

My 4 year old daughter goes to Apples to Zebras preschool and Club Pee Wee as well. She loves her classes and they are actually helping her get ready for school. She has "homework" each week and loves going each day. I highly recommend this for parents wanting to prep their kiddos for school. Unlike the Chandler Community Center Apples to Zebras program, this one actually has a decent curriculum. Although, the other program is great as well if you are wanting a daycare type environment instead of preschool.

The staff is always friendly and knowledgeable and registering for classes online is super easy.
