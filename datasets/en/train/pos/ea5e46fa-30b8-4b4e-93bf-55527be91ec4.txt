One of the best pizzas I've ever eaten. I don't give 5 stars but this place is the BUSINESS. The cook was drinking espresso and watching Good Fellas when we came in. Chicago style deep dish was incredibly hardy and the pizza sauce was explosive - layered with very tastey Italian sausage and different parmesan cheeses. Crust was firm enough to eat with hands, despite being loaded. I love garlic & you need to as the sauce is super garlicy good. My wife isn't into Chicago style so we also ordered the thin crust pizza. It was exceptionally good as well. Super thin crust was firm - we did the Margarit with basil and tomatoes - lite and delicious. I can't recommend this place enough. It costs a bit more but there are leftovers a'plenty and the quality is unsurpassed.
