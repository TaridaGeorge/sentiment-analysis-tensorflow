Damn good gelato.  the best I've ever had and its 1/3rd the fat of normal gelato...don't know how they do it, but it absolutely ROCKS!!!  Love this place and the staff is the absolute BEST and FRIENDLIEST.  the other restaurants nearby should send their wait staff over to Frost for lessons in Customer Service.
