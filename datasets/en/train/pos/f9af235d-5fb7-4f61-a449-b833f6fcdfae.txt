The first time we ate here, we went with a friend of executive chef Beau MacMillan and got special treatment.  We were served four different dishes of the most exquisitely prepared fish I'd ever eaten, followed by desserts that were to die for. 

The next time we ate at sunset, and the views of Paradise Valley as the sun is setting are stunning.  The prices are comparable to other high-end restaurants, but the view and atmosphere here can't be beat.  They can accommodate a gluten free diet, too.  Always a bonus when my family comes to town.

The food is always fresh and flavorful and Beau Mac is an engaging and entertaining chef to talk with.  I always have fun at Elements, and look forward to going again for the next special occasion or family visit.
