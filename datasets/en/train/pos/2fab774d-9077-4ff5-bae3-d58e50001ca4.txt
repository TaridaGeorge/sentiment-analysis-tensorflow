Well I try to stop writing reviews on businesses that are chains and even though Trader Joe's is a small chain in the west. I have to say I like their products and prices, but what go my attention is the incredible cleanliness of this store! It got a big WOW from my scanners and I guess I just had to say something! Thanks for the apples too! They  were great. Keep it up Joe! Clean as it gets is how I rate this one!
