From the husband (native Chicagoan):  "I've not had pizza this good west of St. Louis." That said, he had some notes, but who cares? If you are in Phoenix and looking for good Chicago pizza, try Spinato's. I had the "half and half, double meat and cheese antipasto salad," which was excellent. We also ordered a spinach and sausage thin crust pizza--also excellent. Also, they delivered to the Hilton Squaw Peak hotel on 16th St.
