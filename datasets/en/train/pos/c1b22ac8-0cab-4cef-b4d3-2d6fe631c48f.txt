I like eating alone. Love it. Why? Two reasons: I'm an only child and I can appreciate, sometimes, a solitary existence, and two, because I can have whatever I want. What do I want when I want what I want? In n Out. Those crazy religious zealouts have a menu even a vegetarian like me can feel embarrassed that my mouth is watering for... 

What do I get? Same thing every time: Grilled cheese and Animal fries and a small drink. How much is it? $6.43. How much do I love it? THIS MUCH!!! What are animal fries? They're these beautiful, cheese covered, sauced enriched sliced potato children. Good god.
