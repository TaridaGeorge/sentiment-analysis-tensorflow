if this is your first time order from the items highlighted on the menu.  I was in PHX for one night and went based on yelp reviews.  My father and I ordered from the featured items (to DIE for Ahi Tuna sandwich and sweetpotato fries for me) and the others in our party did not.  We were munching away totally happy not to be eating at yet another identikit chain joint while they miserably played with their food.
