Apple/Mac RULES!!.....PCs are BOAT ANCHORS!!
These stores are great. I love the layout and ease of use. I've owned ipods, iphone, Macbook pros, Imacs, etc. Any problems I ever encounter with their products are always taken care of with genius bar appointments!! Also, I always buy Applecare. It is worth the extra money when you need it. Although lately... I must say I am currently having a sleep problem (not disabled) with my macbook pro that they aren't able to pinpoint just yet. Hopefully, they will soon get it fixed. It's under Applecare for another year so I am not that concerned. Apple has never let me down. I am not an Apple schill. I just give credit where credit is due.
