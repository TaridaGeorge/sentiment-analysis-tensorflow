I love eating my veggies here.  I always load my plate up with the eggplant, asparagus, spinach and whatever else looks like fun - usually some sort of pasta salad.  I love the way the eggplant is prepared. Grilled & seasoned and Mmmmmm!  This is definitely the ideal place if you like to eat (meatless) like me.  I usually skip the gelato, but I have tried it before and it's... gelato.
Maybe Andy Pappas isn't for everyone, but I sure as heck dig him.  He's 100% entertaining and his wife is a total sweetheart.
