My friends and I loved it! Sooo over the top from the moist towellette, free mint, free refills, comfy seats with footrests and super helpful servers. Our only mistake was eating dinner before the movie --PLEASE whatever you do--go with an empty stomach or at least be ready to eat dessert to get the full experience!
