I am a big fan of Ticoz. I've been going there for a few years and have tried quite a few items - and have never been disappointed. I recommend the Street Tacos - my favorite is the shrimp. The Street Tacos entrée comes with pinto beans and rice (well worth it) or you can get just the tacos in the bar during happy hour for about half the price.   Their calamari is awesome - especially with the spicy jalapeño lime sauce on the side. Sunday brunch has been excellent, and the mimosas are great. 
Inside, it has a modern decor and they have a really nice patio out back. 
I've introduced a bunch of people to this place and they all loved it too. I've never had a bad experience.
