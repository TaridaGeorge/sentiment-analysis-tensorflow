Golden China isn't the fanciest Chinese restaurant in the West Valley, but they are friendliest.  They're so friendly, the first time my wife and I ate there, we started laughing.  Plus, their food is always hot and delicious.  Their prices are very reasonable, even for dinner.  

My favorite dish is their Sesame Chicken, and my wife and daughter share the Sweet and Sour Chicken with the sauce on the side.  I like the Hot and Sour Soup too.

Also, they have a table where you can leave your business cards and brochures.  I think that's friendly too.
