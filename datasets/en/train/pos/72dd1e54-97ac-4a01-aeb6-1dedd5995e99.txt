My family and I are always thinking "where should we go to dinner tonight?" - and we always end up at the Village Tavern for several reasons: 1. Consistently amazing food and service, 2. Diverse menu (and we have a lot of picky eaters in my familiy!, 3. Happy Hour specials, 4. Fun bar atmosphere (great to just grab a glass of wine and a snack), 5. Fun monthly wine specials

Some of my favorites: Smoked salmon appetizer (I usually do this as my dinner it's so good), Turkey Burger, Pork Loin
