My husband brought me here.  Here after he had been a couple times and he knew exactly what we were going to have...the 20" cheese steak with sweet peppers, hot peppers and mushrooms.  We of course split it.  It was awesome.  One of the best cheese steaks I have ever had.  It doesn't seem to be that busy in the evening, which is when we went.  That was nice, we didn't have to stand in line and got our food right away.  This place is nice change from the usual.
