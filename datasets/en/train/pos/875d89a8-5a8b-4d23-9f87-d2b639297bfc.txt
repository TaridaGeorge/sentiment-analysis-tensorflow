I planned my reception myself and used A-Z for a big part of my site- ranging from the chairs to the generator to glasses and tables. The staff there, Becky Rodgers, in particular, was a joy to work with- very responsive and helpful (which was great as my order changed a lot of times). She made sure my order was right and worked closely with me to ensure everything was perfect. They delivered and picked up everything exactly as promised and were very professional and fast. They also have tons to choose from and will help you make the best choice for your money. Pricing was competitive too. Highly recommend!
