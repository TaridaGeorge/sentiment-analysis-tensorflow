Had the Dutch Freeze today. Perfect for a 106 degree day. I had tried this drive-thru coffee establishment when they first opened and liked the hot hazelnut brewed coffee, so I thought I would give the iced coffee a try. Glad I did. Hot or cold, these are awesome coffees for less than Starbucks (and without the bitter Starbucks taste). 
What really pushed this up to the five star realm was the very friendly, smiling young lady who served me. She seemed genuinely glad to see me and made a perfect product. Keep up the great work Dutch Bros!
