Even when the Coffee Plantation was there, the Biltmore FP was not a place to get a decent coffee. Then, with even the lackluster  Plantation gone, mall employees and visitors alike were left with only Borders and Paradise (*shudders*).

Royal is such a wonderful and welcome addition to the Biltmore area. The use of the lobby space leading into the Red Door Spa is very clever, and the coffee bar and seating area itself are typical of Haye's talent for mixing design and functionality. It is the real deal and I look forward to drinking gallons of their delicious brews over the coming years.  

Roast on, Royal.
