This is by far the most beautiful Chinese buffet in town. 

I went on a Wednesday night, it wasn't as busy as Pacific Seafood Buffet and Lin's. The interior design was great, even if it's packed, you won't bump into other customers at food court.

Food tasted really good, service was wonderful, tables were clean. They have all the dishes I like.

Plenty of seating with a room for big group. Unlike other Chinese buffet, it's pretty inside. You will find some dishes that are not available at most buffet.

This place is now become my most favorite buffet.
