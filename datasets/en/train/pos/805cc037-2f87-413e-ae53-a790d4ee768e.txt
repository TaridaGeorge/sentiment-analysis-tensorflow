My sister and I stopped by for Happy Hour last night. I fell a little more in love. 1/2 price margaritas, mojitos, and sangria. Awesome deals on appetizers. We split the gaucummus, which was a good size (although a little more pita would have been nice). Sister recently turned 21 so she had to try as much as possible...she had a blood orange margarita, mojito, and the watermelon sangria. I stuck to sangria. She loved the margarita and said it was fresh, the mojito was a little too sweet and light on the alcohol (21 and she's already a connoisseur). The sangria was definitely tasty. 5 drinks and appetizer came out for $28 after tip. It's an amazing deal. Bonus is that the staff are incredibly awesome. 

I officially pink sparkly heart Ticoz.
