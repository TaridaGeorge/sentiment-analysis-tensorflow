Every time I come to Arrowhead Mall I eat at this place! They are always friendly and fast. Plus the food always seems very fresh. They don't skimp on the feta or veggies in their Greek salad which is always my complaint for Greek places. The jalapeno hummus is delicious and a must have when you come here.
