We have been taking our dog Oreo to White Tanks since it opened... he was even present for their open house costume party.  :) The staff is always friendly... we love Jeremiah and Rachel! The doctors are also very friendly, compassionate and thorough. The prices are competitive and well worth it. We even buy all Oreo's food, snacks and dental care products there. It is comforting to know that our "baby" is getting the best care possible. We will continue taking Oreo and any other pet who joins our family to White Tanks.
