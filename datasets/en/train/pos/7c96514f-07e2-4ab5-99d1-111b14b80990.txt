The food is so good and unique. Yay for midwest food making it to AZ. The place is always busy and the food is always hot and fresh. Butter burgers can be greay but really fresh and delicious! Crinkle fries and fried cheese curds are the perfect side and don't forget frozen custard! Really any kind is great but my favorite is their turtle sudae. Love that more locations are finally opening!
