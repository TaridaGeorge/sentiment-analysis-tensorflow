YUM! I'm a big fan of their Bellagio restaurant and then they made this place, and some days on my lunch break I can't even decide which one to go to now! It's even open for breakfast now so I can take my kids on weekends. The menu is really vast which I like since I can be indecisive, but I love their lettuce wraps and sandwiches. Definitely a keeper for this area, I love that it is a local business, too. You won't be disappointed here!
