Awesome, awesome, awesome!!! The food was wonderful, the staff was cool (maybe a little absent minded), great beer selection.  The only negative I can think of is it is small and kind of a pain to find, but defiantly worth it once you do.  There were so many things on the menu I still want to try.  

The green fennel and veggie hash were both great, but the prize goes to the Jalape√±o pecan pancakes.
