The best of the best in the greater Scottsdale area. 

Try the "Tasting Menu".  Razz will ask you about allergies and dislikes and then just start bring you course after course till you tell him to stop. 

Four or five courses and they will have to roll you out the door. I've done this on 6 or 7 different visits now, never had a duplicate item and never had anything that wasn't absolutely outstanding.
