I run past my Church when I run along the Canal so I thought I should review this beautiful place of worship. As a member of the Catholic and Greek Orthodox Faith, I'm very proud to attend Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Cathedral. I always feel such a spiritual connection as soon I walk in. The greeters always make me feel at home with their welcome smiles. This Church by far has the best Members/Congregation. 

Xristos Anesti celebrations always bring me to the verge of joyous tears so if you're a person of Faith and want to try something different, I highly recommend their Easter Celebration services.
