All I had here was a pizza, but that was enough for me to give this place 5 stars, b/c it's one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  =)

Concept is easy: You pick your size & pay for the toppings you want. 
I had mushrooms, basil, pepperoni, and fresh tomatoes on mine.

I can't wait to go back & try some of the other toppings. Maybe tomorrow!
