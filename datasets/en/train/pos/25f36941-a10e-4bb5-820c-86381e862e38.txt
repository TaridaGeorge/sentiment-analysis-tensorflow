What a delightful little sandwich/salad shop.  We found Urban Picnic by accident.  I ordered the Italian Chpped Salad and it was HUGE and delicious!  I certainly could not eat it all.  My friend ordered the tuna sandwich and said it was by far the most "to die for" tuna she had ever eaten.  The venue is small, but the food is delicious, fresh,  and the staff is very friendly.
