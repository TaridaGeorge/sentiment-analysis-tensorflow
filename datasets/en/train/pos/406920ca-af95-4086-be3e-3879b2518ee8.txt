Now this Harkins theater has a Cine Capri theater as well. What is Cine Capri you ask.....well it is like an IMAX....just not as big...and lacks some of the great IMAX audio. However it is a great experience and it is very historic. I saw Transformers here and man it was almost like being at an IMAX theater. The seats were very comfortable.....the theater was large....and the ambience was suburb. This theater has a lot of history and it is on display throughout the lobby area.....I encourage everyone to go and check it out. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!
