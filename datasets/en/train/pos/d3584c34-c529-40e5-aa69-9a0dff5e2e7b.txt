One of the things I miss the most since moving away from Arizona is my Sunday night tradition of ordering take-out from Nick's. It simply can't be beat. The minestrone is the best I ever had, the NY style pizza is fantastic and the bolognese sauce over your choice of pasta is outstanding. Even the salads are good (try the Greek). If you want rich, try the gnocchi in gorgonzola sauce. This place is a treasure.
