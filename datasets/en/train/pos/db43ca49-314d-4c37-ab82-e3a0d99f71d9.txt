Pilates has been a wonderful addition to my work outs. The instructors are very well trained and help you along every step of the way. They are not only great instructors but they are wonderful women that are alot of fun to be around! 
I have never enjoyed working out but nowI look forward to my 2 classes every week and just dont feel like my week was complete when I dont have both classes. Try out Maximum Pilates, it is a wonderful place with really great people.
