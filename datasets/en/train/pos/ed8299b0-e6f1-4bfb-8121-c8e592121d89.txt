The original downtown "power" restaurant.  I could start a cult based solely on their bread with the garlic-leek-butter drizzled on top.  Everything on the menu is tasty, but don't expect Mastro's style steaks, great quality, just more of an old school broiler style.  Don't miss the "debris" as an app, delightful little skewers of grilled beef and veggies (they make a perfect lunch as well).  The red velvet walls, red leather booths and throwback waitstaff only add to the authentic Rat Pack feel.  Growing up in AZ every great story involving local politics seemingly involved the bar here.  Truly a local treasure.
