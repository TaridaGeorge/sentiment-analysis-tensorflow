The best coffee cafe I've ever been to, ever.  I love this place.  The decor and ambiance is top notch.  The food is good and breakfast comes out quickly.  All the different areas are unique and one has a projection screen.  Fresh squeezed juice is a nice touch.  Serves alcohol.  I could go on and on and on but I'd give Lux six stars if I could; and this is saying a lot considering that I have an east coast bias.  Lux would kick the ass of any of the hipster coffee shops in Manhattan or Williamsburg any day.
