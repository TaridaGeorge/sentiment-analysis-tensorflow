I have been going to Alex since April of 07 and every cut I have had is awesome!  My hair always looks great the day I walk out and even when return for a trim/cut- which isn't always the normal 6-8 weeks.  The color she uses is great too and lasts through so many washes.  I thoroughly enjoy getting my hair done by Alex, would recommend her all day and regreted going to someone else while she was on maternity leave; I should have just waited :)
