Understated decor matches simple flavorful dishes. Great service and new bar area could prove popular. Not for hearty eaters but still proves satisfying.

All dishes were inspiring: home made mozzarella, raw fish, and gnocchi. Every dish offered new insights into refreshing favors.

Quite glad they are in the Arcadia hood.
