Super, super nice guy. All he did was a tune-up on my AC but from what I can tell he runs a great business. He was running a little bit late because he got my address wrong (my fault, I didn't tell him Tempe and he assumed I was in Phx) so he knocked 30 dollars off of my service call fee. The 30% off was totally unprompted and he really didn't have to do that. I actually tried to refuse the discount but he insisted. He talked to me for a while about my make/model of AC unit and told me it was in great shape. He also gave me a great consultation on a new unit for my stupid condo I'm underwater on. I'll def call him when I need a new AC for that place. 

Anyway, great business. Mr Flores is awesome IMO.
