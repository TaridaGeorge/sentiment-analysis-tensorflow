I love this place.  I am completely biased, and you should consider this review totally biased.  I love the people, I love the food, I love everything about it.  That said...

Every plate of everything is delicious, and if you get it 'Thai Hot', expect to sweat.  They offer mild, medium, hot, and thai hot.  They don't openly tell people about 'Thai Hot' because it's serious business, and you will have digestive problems the next day as a result, I promise.

Either way, everything is delicious and wonderful.  The staff are enormously friendly and know me by name.  The place is nicely decorated, and it is great for a first date.  Check it out and enjoy, but be careful during lunch as it can get busy and have a wait.
