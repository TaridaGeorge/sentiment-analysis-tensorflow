Beautiful location.  We had a nice time walking through the gardens and touring the property.  The staff is incredibly friendly.  We stayed in the Octilla, but didn't do the executive lounge, there were too many time places to eat and drink.  The rooms were gorgeous and spacious.  There was a pool and hot tub closer to our building but spent most of the second day at the Cabana Club which is closer to the spa.  Drinks here are weak and probably not worth it.  But the hot tub is large and the waterfall slide is another fun option.
We enjoyed the happy hour at Frank and Albert, $5 martini's.  My favorite was the Apple Spice (nothing like those sickly sweet green appletini's).  We sat near the fire pits in the main garden area.  Dinner at Wright's was amazing and I recommend it.
