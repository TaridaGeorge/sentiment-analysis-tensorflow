We stopped by Su Vino on a Friday around noon. We were the only ones there which made us a little leary but it turned out to be a great thing. One of the owners actually waited on us. My wife and I each did a tasting which appears to be a bit expensive at first (5 1 ounce glasses for $10) but after sampling 5, more actually as we shared, and talking with Maureen for about a half hour and learning all about their wines and how they started the business it was well worth it. The kicker was  when our bill came (we bought 6 bottles) we found that they waived both tasting fees AND the cost of the three glasses we bought while chatting. We plan on returning some time in the future and doing a bottling session and making our own labels.
