I LOVE this place! 

I've shopped in just about every section. I've gotten EOs at a great price. Homepathic remedies/treatments. My favorite Egyptian musk and amber oils to wear and incense & candles. 

I like the vegetables & fruits I've gotten from there as well as the health drinks. They offer more meat substitutes than I've seen anywhere else. I've been happy with EVERYTHING they offer. 

The staff is very friendly and always smiling making it a pleasure to go in over and over again.
