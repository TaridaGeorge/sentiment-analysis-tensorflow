Seriously, the BEST time I've ever had a Benihana's!  DANIEL is a Hibachi Chef there, ASK FOR HIM if you can.  He is seriously HYSTERICAL and everything was cooked perfectly.  The Shrimp, Lobster, Scallop, Meat was all cooked perfectly.  Not over done which is RARE for Benihana, some of the chef's have an issue with time management and things either get left on too long, or not enough.  Well, not this time.  I asked him where he studied the culinary arts, he said back to me, "I laid Granite counter tops before this, ma'am, a top chef came from San Diego and trained me for 3 months straight."  I was very impressed that he picked this up in just 3 months, he was obviously meant to cook for a living!  

Remember, ask for DANIEL.....
