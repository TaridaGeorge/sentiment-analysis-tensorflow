This is the best hotel I've ever stayed at. Ever. And I've stayed at plenty of nice and random hotels. The rooms are beautiful, the bathrooms are unreal/nice, the lighting in the rooms is pretty, the decor is incredible, the pool is perfect, the restaurants have great happy hour, the parking is free if you find street parking, and it's a quiet place because not that many people have discovered this gem! So let's keep it our little secret. Please?
