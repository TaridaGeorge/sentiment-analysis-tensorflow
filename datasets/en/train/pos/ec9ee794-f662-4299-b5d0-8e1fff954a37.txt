This is my very first review on Yelp. I'm been an active user and decided to share my secret favorite place - Eden's Grill.

Looking for the finest Mediterranean food in the valley?  Eden's Grill is the place to go. Consider the Gyros, Chicken and Beef Kebab combination for two.  It's our favorite dish, since it allows us to have it all. Did I mention the rice? Covered in golden raisins and almonds- WOW. 

Ended the evening Nehren's Wedding Cake for dessert. I dislike cake, but I'm still thinking about how good it was. Try it.
