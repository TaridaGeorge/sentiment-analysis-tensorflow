this place was awesome! me and a friend were first timers, but i have heard many good things. we arrived around 12:30p right around lunch rush. it was pretty packed but we waited probably not more then 2 minutes for a table. our waitress was super nice, and the food came out pretty fast too.

i had the royale with cheese, and my friend had the shepards pie. both awesome. cant wait to go back to try some new stuff. good beer selection, and pretty well priced for everything. on top of all that the great staff/service all and all a great experience. glad i finally got to try it.
