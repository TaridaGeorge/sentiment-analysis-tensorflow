This place alone makes me wish I lived in Phoenix.

Living in LA there are a zillion vegan restaurants, but nothing quite like this.  My husband and I spent two days in Phoenix, and ate at Green both days (actually we tried both Green locations - Phoenix and Scottsdale) and have been craving it ever since. 

We tried various menu items; the spicy buffalo "wings", the "no-harm parm", "crab puffs", the "green burger" and the "coconut curry bowl" - each was AWESOME! We also had to splurge and eat lots of 'nami soy soft-serve ice cream! OMG! 

Thinking I might drive to Phoenix this weekend, just to eat at Green!
