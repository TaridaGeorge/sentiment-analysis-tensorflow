WOW!! I am fully shocked by them... I'll admit and say that the win hasn't fully sunk in yet. I mean I knew they were going to be good, but not THIS good!  I've only been a fan since Boldin came to Az, but what atmosphere it has brought to the valley, and I really didn't believe that the 'Cards would make it to a championship game before the SUNS!! but hey, being a fan - i'll take it!! Fitzgerald is the man hands down. Glad they had some luck combimed with the hard work and it has paid off!! I am looking forward to the years to come!!
