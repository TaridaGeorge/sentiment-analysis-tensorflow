The market rocks. I go here almost every weekend for fresh produce to cook during the week. They are adding more every week. Love the specialty cooking salts. The hummus is great and the pita chips even better. My only knock is whoever runs the facebook page sends WWAAAAYYYYY too many posts. I'm borderline ready to hide them on FB.
