As far as a restaurant goes, this is all you can ask for.  The menu is excellent.  The food is tasty, unique, and fresh.  The drinks are interesting, and the martinis come with the extra in a glass on ice (my kind of drink).  Other than the funky Scottsdale crowd (not going to elaborate - because it's not their fault), our large group was treated quite well.  Some of the dishes that I really liked were the Pollo Colonial, the scallops, and the brussel sprouts.  Can't wait to go back.
