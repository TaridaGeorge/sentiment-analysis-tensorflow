Dr. Castilla is hands down the best OB/gyn I have ever been to. She takes time with you and I never feel as though she is rushing through my appointments. She guided me through my pregnancy beautifully and ended up inducing me early because of a complication. She monitored my baby's growth very carefully throughout my pregnancy and for that I am eternally grateful. I hate to think what would have happened if I didn't have Dr. Castilla's expertise and care. She makes you feel very comfortable and I feel like I can talk to her about anything. I will continue to go to Dr. Castilla and I hope to have her as my OB for my next pregnancy. I drive from Gilbert to her office in north Scottsdale for her because she is worth it!
