Ohhhhh this place is a chocolate lovers dream! A co-worker gave me a sample of the 80% dark chocolate bark and I was hooked!!!! Now I've stopped by every other week to get my fix! Help! I'm addicted! I have several food intolerances including soy and dairy and trying to find a good quality dark chocolate without those two ingredients is challenging (yes there are some bars at Whole Foods but the quality can't even compare). The amazing thing about this dark chocolate is the flavor that blooms in your mouth as you eat it, it's almost a floral taste. It's amazing. I love it!
All the pastries look delicious but I can't eat them, so I can't honestly review them.
Please stop in and support this local business, it's truly a gem!
