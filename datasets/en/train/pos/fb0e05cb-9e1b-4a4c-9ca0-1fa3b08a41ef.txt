Way to go Bob Sikora!   I used to work for Bob at Bobby McGee's during the 80's and early 90's.  Bob has always been a top notch operator with high standards.  Tough guy to work for...but he is a restaurant genius!  Bob has always loved BBQ and he went to school and found the best recipes from the south.   I ate here way back in 2005 and anytime I am back in Phoenix this is a must do for BBQ!  This as good as it gets!!!
