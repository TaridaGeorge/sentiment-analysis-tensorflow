I love going to this place in Downtown Phoenix! It's been getting packed during the weekends, but its always a fun place to go. My friends and I enjoy dancing and they have 2 different scenes here. The downstairs is more HipHop and the upstairs is more Electro/Dance. We enjoy coming here on Fridays when Sticky Fingers plays! If you go before 10PM its free other than that its 10$ to get in. Good times!
