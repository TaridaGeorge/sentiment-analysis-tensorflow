I love this place and go there like a regular. It is not a typical sushi bar. My gf hates sushi and one side of their menu is dedicated to the "non sushi" person. It is a very stylish upscale but not pricey place. All the waitresses are super cool and quite sexy too. I see lots of families there and the regulars really are regular..whether at the bar or table they have a great selection of imported beer. maybe I think of it as a neighborhood sushi place.
