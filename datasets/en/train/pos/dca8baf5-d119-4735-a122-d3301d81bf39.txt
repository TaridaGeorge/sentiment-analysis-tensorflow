Cute store, great selection, friendly staff,  reasonable pricing. This is probally the best scrapbook store in Arizona. I have to say the scrap booking convention was an awesome experience. Paper Vineyard has the next best closest selection to the scrap book convention.... Thank you for the 20 for 30 deal, can honestly say I got alot of goodies for my money. :) 

If you are into scrap booking I highly recomend checking this place out.
