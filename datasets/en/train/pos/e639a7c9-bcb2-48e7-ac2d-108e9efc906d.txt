I believe this place lives up to all the hype it has received.  It's a well know fact that it's beyond busy, so whining about it isn't permissible.  You can chill in the little house next to it or in the front and booze it up a bit before you dine.  

The place is the real deal though.  It's all done by Bianco, the ingredients are fresh and some local.  The attention to detail and quality is superb.  The flave, well it is monumental.  All the listed pizzas are legit Italian style or artfully put together.  

I wasn't surprised one bit that it was the Bomby McBomb.
