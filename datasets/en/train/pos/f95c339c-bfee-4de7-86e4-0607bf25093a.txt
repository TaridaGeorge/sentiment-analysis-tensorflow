They make my Manolo Blahnik's purr - nuff said!!
I have risked my shoe collection at many local repair shops - but he is an honest, hard-working man who knows quality. They are reasonably priced and turn-around times are quick!
Located on the NW corner of Scottsdale Rd and Thunderbird in the strip mall a couple doors down from Enterprise Car Rental.
