Walk into the huge humidor (I've lived in smaller apartments) at Casa Fuma and you may think you have died and gone to heaven.

It's overwhelming. But just ask the  proprietor, Cliff Coen, for help. He's a nice guy, and really knows his smokes.

I suppose people come in, buy a single cigar, a box, or some accessories and leave, but the ultimate coolness of Casa Fuma won't be absorbed unless you hang out. They've got comfy couches, free WiFi, and flat screen TVs. Even an outside patio. The place has a Cheers-like atmosphere with lots of regulars, but first-timers (such as myself) are greeted warmly and made to feel right at home.

They have lots of events, from "Movie night" to visits with cigar makers and company executives, and an informative web site.

This was my first visit to Casa Fuma; it will not be my last.
