If you want to buy local, grass-fed, good quality meats you have found the place to do so! Keep an eye on their facebook page for weekly specials and events, too!

Don't be surprised when you drive to the shop though, it's not in a great end of town. The shop itself is very small, but they carry a pretty good variety considering how tiny they are. I think my fiance was a little sticker-shocked since we are accustomed to paying normal grocery store prices for normal, low quality meat... but it's worth the extra money if you are able to afford the good stuff!
