You have to try their Fondue if you go here. Pretzels are fresh, soft, and the cheese is amazing. Their fried chicken tastes good, but is a huge portion. My favorite entree here is their rainbow trout. It is seasoned well and a huge portion.
I am not a fan of a lot of their specialty drinks. I've had better mixed drinks elsewhere.
Ambiance is nice, but can get very loud certain nights.
