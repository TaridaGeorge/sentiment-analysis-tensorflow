This Starbucks is just great! The baristas and all workers alike have a very professional sense about them. They work fast and efficiently. The atmosphere is cool due to the furniture and the way they have their merchandise and their customization bar arranged together. During the summer, they run misters for the outdoor seating. Great place.
