Of course I wish the prices were a little lower (I think I even say this at McDonald's), but the food was very tasty and I felt like the meal was a fresher, healthier version of what I might have gotten for the same price elsewhere.  The person who took my order was patient and bubbly.  The music and atmosphere was awesome; nothing like it in the neighborhood.  Five stars.
