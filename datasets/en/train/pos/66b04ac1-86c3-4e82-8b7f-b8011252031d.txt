Hard for me to put words together for this place other than it was truly amazing!  Hands down probably the best JW Marriott Resort that I have been to.  The grounds were beautiful, the accommodations were amazing, the golf course was awesome and the restaurants were incredible.

At first thought the on site eatery (BLT Steakhouse) was an another normal place and boy was I wrong.  This in fact was probably the best food I have ever eaten and ended up eating there 2 of 3 nights during our stay.  

We will be back 100% without a doubt and cannot wait for our next return trip to the JW in Scottsdale!
