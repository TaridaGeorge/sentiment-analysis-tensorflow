*Burgers are the best*

Our first visit to Lobby's was amazing(read below),so we decided to go again.

!BUT!

On the second visit, the place was relatively empty, handful of people, yet everyone there seemed to have mix ups and problems with their orders.
 
And sure of course we were no exception. How hard is it to put bacon in a burger? 

It was still a good burger don't get me wrong, but if someone can't get a handful of orders right?.... Come on.....

We would have told her our order was wrong except it was takeout. We didn't realise till we got home.

Hopefully the next time the staff will be a bit more attentive to orders. 
It helps the whole wanting to go back again and again :)
