I like this store a lot! They really go the extra mile to make it nice.          Very similar to Sprouts. I don't know if they are owned by the same people or not .  They give you 10cents off your bill for everyone of your forever bags that you bring in. That is the best deal i know of. Plus, they even have coffee out if you would like a sample. While shopping.     They have a deli which only provides Boar's Head. Which is a very good thing. No additves and GMO in it.   they will cut your meat and cheese any thickness you like and they put paper inbetween each slice. Which is a wonderful thing.   They even have Organic wine for a very good price.    Very many good things at this store , and well worth the visit.
