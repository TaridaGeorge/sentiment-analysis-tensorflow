This Subway has to have the friendliest staff I have ever met.  They even compensate your sandwiches for little things.  For example, I may only ask for 2 cheese slices, and they will give a little extra meat to make up for it.  They always load it with ton of fresh veggies.  The establishment is well-kept and clean whenever I have gone.  The Subway night deal ended at the end of 2010, and it is now only limited to a few sandwiches.  I wasn't aware of this change, but I still the regular deal for my Veggie Patty sandwich.  Subway is a healthy choice, and I come here often.
