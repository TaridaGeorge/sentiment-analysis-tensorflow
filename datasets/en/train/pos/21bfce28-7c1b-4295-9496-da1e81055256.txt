This is one of the most unique restaurants we have been to.  The menu is so diverse and has many items that were so unique.  Try the Veggie Weggie--nothing like it anywhere.  And there service is quick and friendly.  We arrived for lunch ten minutes before they were to opened and were sitting with 4 other groups waiting for 11.  They noticed us waiting and opened early so we would not be waiting.  Nice touch.  You can't find these places anywhere back east or in Calif., so if you are traveling, treat yourself before u leave town.
