There's nothing I can say about FnB that hasn't been said already, so I won't even try.  I can only add that the 5 star ratings are legit and nowhere near an overstatement.  You are NOT going to find better food in the valley, prepared as lovingly, with such attentive service.  

FnB does everything right and if you haven't been you're missing one of the finest points of the valley dining scene.  Stop reading and make a reservation now - while you still can - or CAN YOU?  

Too late, it's too popular!
