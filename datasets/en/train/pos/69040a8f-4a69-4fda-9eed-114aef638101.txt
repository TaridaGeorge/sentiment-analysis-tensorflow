Great place. Tasty food and a cool atmosphere, and with the weekday happy hour from 11am to 6pm your bill will make you almost as happy as the food. I've tried most of the happy hour appetizers and they're all cooked (or raw) to perfection. Glad to see a quality restaurant in this troubled location. 

I give the place 5 stars despite the service which can be spotty at times, but I understand it's a brand new restaurant so they'll eventually work out the kinks. Still: servers need to be a little less familiar, a little more professional with guests...and even though it's an Italian place and very friendly, the repeated touching of guests' shoulders/backs when talking to them is a little offputting. Other than that minor hiccup, I highly recommend this place.
