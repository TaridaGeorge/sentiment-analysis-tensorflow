If it weren't for this place being practically right next door to me, my car would never get washed. Ever since Clean Freak moved right next door to me though, I have been taking advantage of their super-cheap membership!! I only pay $17 a month (their most expensive package) and I get unlimited detailed car washes, free vacuums, a little Armor-All wipe, and air fresheners! I wash my car here almost every other day and I have no complaints.
