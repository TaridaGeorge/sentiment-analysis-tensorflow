Nothing beats a #1 with grilled onions, no tomatoes, well done french fries and a pink lemonade. I've been known to eat here twice to three times a week and find absolutely nothing wrong with that.
There's magic in those delicious burgers, just one bite and you are instantly transported to a world of savory goodness unmatched anywhere else on this little blue marble we call Earth.
