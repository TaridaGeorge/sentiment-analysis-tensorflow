A friend let me borrow his bike and I realized I had no idea how to get the front wheel off. It was completely different from any other fork, I had seen, which is kind of important when you get a flat on trail. I brought it into Rage and Pete showed me how to take it off, without making me feel like a total tool, which is excellent customer service, even IF they were laughing at me after I left. I've never had a bad experience at Rage.
