Great location and even better food and service. Located in the heart of North Central Phoenix and easily accessible if your at the Biltmore or uptown area, you'll find this spacious restaurant a true delight.  Follow them on Twitter and tweet about your experiences, favorite dishes, compliments, etc and you might even get a free meal for the effort.  Try the Breakfast Burrito, as I did and you'll not need another meal for at least 4-5 hrs.  www.Twitter.com/thegoodegg
