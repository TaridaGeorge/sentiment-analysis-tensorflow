I have to echo the reviews I've read and the experience I had at the store! Wow! I met the owner Bonnie when I did a radio show with Jan D'Atrie and the Secret should be out! I loved the lay out, the prices, the unique lines of gifts, decore, dishes, kids items, unusual and beautiful-leave-me-without-speech-items. They're really awesome! Well worth the trip!
