Love Mo and the team, sat at the bar last Wednesday. Didn't order just let them make us sashimi and sushi, fish is incredible, rolls very creative, beer cold, saki warm

Not too pricey but well worth for the quality
Sometimes I wish they were always packed but then  I wouldn't get a seat at the bar

Go and support, best sushi in AZ
