I personally installed some new struts on my wife's HHR and needed to get it aligned afterwards. I looked online and found a coupon for $59 alignment and oil change.
They deducted $15 for the oil change since it was just done.
$45 alignment, good clean work, no upsell on garbage that I didn't need.
Pretty happy all in all.
Nice guys, quick turn around.
