why is it that you can live somewhere for 3 years and then find the BEST place EVER right before you're moving...so was my fate with this AWESOME place in arizona...

postino's is awesome...the wine selection is good, the atmosphere is charming and delightful, and the food is amazing, delicious, and so very reasonably priced!!! the bruschetta is PHENOMENAL and the sampler plate lets you pick and choose which ones you want...(GET THEM ALL!!!!)...

seriously, one of the best places in PHX to get drinks, food, and quality times with good friends!
