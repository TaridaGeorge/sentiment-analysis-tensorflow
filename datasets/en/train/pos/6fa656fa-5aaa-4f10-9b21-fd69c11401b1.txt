Stayed here on New Years Eve -- and for the money, I don't think it gets better than Aloft.  The lobby and pool area are chic and trendy, but not cold or unfriendly.  Staff is nice.  The room was fantastic.  Well laid out - I was impressed with the thoughtfulness of the design of the room, it seemed like Starwood really thought about how guests would use a hotel room and freshly interpreted the room in a modern, comfortable manner.
