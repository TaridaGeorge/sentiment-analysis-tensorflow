Genius Bar always teaches me something I don't know about my itouch. My battery life wasn't lasting at all - somehow I had turned on my bluetooth, also had at least 100 apps running at the same time, and he got my hotmail working - fast, good, friendly. Amazing. Never had a unamazing time here - just book at appointment on line and they'll never be more than 5 min late. Love this store...;)
