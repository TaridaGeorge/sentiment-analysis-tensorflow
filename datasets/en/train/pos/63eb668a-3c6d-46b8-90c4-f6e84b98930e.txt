Wonderful, Chinese food in Peoria, albeit slightly Americanized.  I'm absolutely, completely stoked.  This is exactly what I've been begging for over the past few years.

The staff is wonderful, the restaurant is cute, and I'm absolutely jazzed by this addition to the neighborhood.  This definitely deserves an extensive, well thought out review, but instead all I can say is go here.  Now.

The best part?  They deliver.  I'm in hot and sour soup heaven and don't have to leave my front porch.  The delivery is worth five stars on its own. Great food just happens to be a side benefit.
