By far my favorite restaurant in valley. Deliciously spicey. A bit pricey if you're picking and choosing items but they're complete meals are a pretty good bang for the buck. 

Not actually sure about the service as I've only gotten takeout but if its any where close to the quality of food, then it must be awesome.
