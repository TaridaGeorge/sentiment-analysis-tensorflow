Had a really great meal here!  I think the secret if you're on a date, is to split everything.  That way you get smaller portions, but can try more things.  We split the taggliatelle with braised beef, and the corvina with risotto.  Both were spot on.  The service was also very good.  Although we skipped dessert, I still think $100 tip included was a great value because of the upscale diner atmosphere, the Kierland location, and the decently priced drinks.  I can't wait to try the pizza next time!
