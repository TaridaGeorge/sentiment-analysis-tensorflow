Don't be fooled by the name, it's just not a great place to go for great steaks. All of their food is fabulous. so if you are  someone who appreciates food, wine and ambiance,  Modern provides the perfect mix. 

Happy is hour is a great value and the bar area is busy with a great crowd as well as happy hour specials. It's worth overlooking that it's in a mall.
