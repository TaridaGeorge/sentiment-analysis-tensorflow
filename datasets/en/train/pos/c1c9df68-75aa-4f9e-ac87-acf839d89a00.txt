One of the cleanest, nicest, well decorated restaurants. I think it is specialized in steaks, and since I am not steaks fan I went with the a burger. I am glad I did, it is one of the best burgers I had in my LIFE, specially with the wood fired bread (try the BLT burger). I highly recommend this place.
