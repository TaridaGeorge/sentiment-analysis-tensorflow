Absolutely love this neighborhood joint!  The happy hour is great-buy one get one free appetizers,$5.00 drafts. (Yes, please!) I love the tot-chos, tator-tots done like nachos, so good. I have had the burgers, the signature one, the blue cheese one and the chili cheese one. All were cooked perfectly and they are hugely delicious. I have always found the service to be great and the staff to be very friendly. The atmosphere is expected for a burger/sports place. TV's placed everywhere for optimal sports watching views, I do wish they had buzz-time trivia but that's just a personal preference.  I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great beer selection, great food and a great neighborhood experience.
