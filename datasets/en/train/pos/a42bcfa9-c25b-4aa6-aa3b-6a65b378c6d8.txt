All I gotta say is... Oh hell yes!! The waffle was sweet but not too sweet and the chicken breast was moist and wonderfully flavorful!  But the combination is fantastic!! My husband says Roscoe's doesn't even compare to Lo-Lo's...  Oh and to top it off I had the mac n cheese and a tub of kool-aid!! This place is the ONLY reason I would ever come back to Phoenix!! I am pleasantly stuffed!! Thanks Lo-Lo's!!
