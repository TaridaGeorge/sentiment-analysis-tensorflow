A friend referred me to Soutwest Customer Firearms and I was pleasantly surprised to see their selection.  Everyone was super helpful without being pushy.  More importantly they were knowledgeable about guns and firearms with most of the guys being prior military.  I would highly recommend that if you are in the market for a firearm or knife that you check them out. Ask for Jon.
