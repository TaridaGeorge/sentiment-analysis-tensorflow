Scottsdale Children Group is the best in town!  They truly care about their patients. We have been here quite a few times(unfortunately) and they are professional. Dr. Lichtsinn is our doctor and she is great at what she does. I recommend this practice anyone looking for a great pediatrician. They have two locations in town and all their doctors have been awarded "best doctors", "top doctors-ranking az, "America's top pedetricans", etc.- Im sure you get the point:)
