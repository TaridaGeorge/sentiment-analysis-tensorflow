I come from a very long line of amazing German cooks. 
Bavarian is the only place I have found that holds a candle to moms cooking. The food is very authentic and super tasty. The specials are always great. I prefer to sit in the bar area instead of the dining room. 
I sometimes just stop by here for a great German beer. The clientele is very diverse, but there are definitely a lot of regulars. 
Don't let the exterior fool you. This place is good. Hope to see you there. 

Prost!!
