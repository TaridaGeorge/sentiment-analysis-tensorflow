Love this location, my family and I have movie night every week and we always order pizza from here, ive never had a problem with anything, the wings are good,the mozzarella stickes are yummy with their marinara sauce, the veggie pizza is amazing! I love the cheese,the pepperoni,everything really and its quick for pick-up always 15-20 mins and is always ready when I get there!
