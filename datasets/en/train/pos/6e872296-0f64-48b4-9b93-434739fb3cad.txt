The Sunday BBQ was incredible.  $49 was a steal for your choice of NY strip, chicken or salmon + sides + a buffet featuring salads, soups, kobe beef sliders, lobster rolls and a chilled seafood spread + a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies.

if they make this happen again next summer, I'd consider a trip back to Scottsdale just for this.
