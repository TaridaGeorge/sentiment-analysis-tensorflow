Head out at happy hour and try all of their happy hour appetizers. I love the sesame seed ahi tuna. 
Their hamburgers are delicious and so are the salads. I go up about once a week and pig out and have some big beers. I recommend this over any other restaurant in the area if you're looking for a romantic and tasty meal.
