LARGE beer selection and a delicious, eclectic menu.  Staff is friendly and knows the menu as well as the tap selection.  One of my favorite spots in the valley.  Great standing daily specials.

Great for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, although if you're going for lunch on a weekday, chances are you won't be able to sample any of the beers :(
