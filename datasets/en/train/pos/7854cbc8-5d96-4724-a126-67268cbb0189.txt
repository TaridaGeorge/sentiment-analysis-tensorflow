I'm doing something I don't usually do, but I'm changing my rating from four to five stars.  I've been here at least a dozen times since I first wrote my review, and I started thinking to myself "there's got to be a reason I keep coming back so often..."

The reason is simple.  The food is fresh, fast, and delicious.  The portions are good, and the spices and ingredients are perfect for the dishes they serve.  The prices are also killer: six bucks for a sandwich, fries, and drink, or six bucks for two sandwiches.  You can't beat that.

For a quick casual meal, this is a great option.  There are other places closer to my house, but I still drive the extra five minutes to come here.  The food is great, healthy, and very satisfying.
