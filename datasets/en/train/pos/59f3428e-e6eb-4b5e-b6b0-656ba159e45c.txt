In the Sunday, June 19th, AZ Republic they listed FEZ as one of the Top 10 Spots for "Yum on a Bun!"

How could you not want to just jump on your tractor, in your Beemer, on your tricycle, in your 'YO' truck, on Hi Ho Silver, or whatever your mode of transport is and rush on down to Central Avenue for a juicy half-pound Angus beef burger? Add some cinnamon-spiced pear, feta cheese, crisp onions and a really wonderful BBQ sauce  . . . .ahhhh . . . mouth watering goodness! 

One of the Top 10? I don't think so . . . it is the TOP ONE!
