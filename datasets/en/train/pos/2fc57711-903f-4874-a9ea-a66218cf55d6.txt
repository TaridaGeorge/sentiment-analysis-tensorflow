I love me some ice cream; it's my favorite dessert. The fact that Golden Spoon serves up frozen yogurt makes it that much better. I had heard about Golden Spoon but had never been to one. They have about 10 flavors of frozen yogurt that they usually rotate flavors in and out of as well as 30+ toppings to mix and match in.

Prices are good, lots of different sizes of cups to choose from, and they even do a stamp card where your 8th visit is free. This has become my families favorite place to get dessert. It's close, it's cheap, and it's frozen yogurt. Win!
