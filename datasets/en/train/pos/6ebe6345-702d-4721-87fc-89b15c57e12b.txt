The pastries are what bring me here time and time again.  My butt isn't happy about that but my tummy sure is! 

Cranberry nut muffins.  So good.  Pistachio muffins..yum!  I also love the almond horns but I don't ever see them at this location.  The Macaroons are delicious too.  I think the bigger AJs have more "in house" specials...like the one over on Ray rd used to have pizza fridays....I never saw that at this one.

The staff is super friendly!  The produce is perfect...

The prices are hit or miss....sometimes stuff is cheaper here than like Albertson's and sometimes it's double the price.  

The deserts here are by far better than any bakery or cup cake shop in town.  If you ever need a cake or whatever I would say go here rather than anywhere else.
