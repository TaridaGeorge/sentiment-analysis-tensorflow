Being from the Chicagoland area I find it hard to find really good pizza in Arizona, but Ray's is an outstanding exception.

Ray's serves great New York style pizza! That is enough for me, although my fiance also loves their wings, fried zucchini and fried mushrooms, so every time we go we always end up with tons of leftovers.

The price can be a little expensive, but we find it to be worth it as the food is just so good!
