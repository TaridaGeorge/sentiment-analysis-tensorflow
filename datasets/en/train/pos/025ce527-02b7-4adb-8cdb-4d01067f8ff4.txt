The way a grocery store should be!
Trader Joe's is really the only grocery store I like to go to these days. Trader Joe's in general does a great job at bringing healthy options to they customers. What I love about this location is that the Gilbert Farmers Market is just down the street. So I usually get what I can at the Market and then finish my shopping at this Trader Joe's.
The customer service has always been great as well! The employees actually know the answers to my questions, are always friendly and even have a joke or two up their sleeves.

One of my favorite things here is the 'Nothing but Bananas Flattened'. If you like bananas, you will love this! Cheap, all natural and a great night snack for when you feel the need for a treat.
