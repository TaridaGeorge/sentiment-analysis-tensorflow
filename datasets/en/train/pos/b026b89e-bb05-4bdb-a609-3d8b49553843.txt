Gold Bar was a great find. Quite tucked away it seems to draw a very mellow and friendly crowd.  

What I really like about the place is that it feels like an old world cafe. It's not "alternative" or corporate. Its a cozy, yet soulful cafe with a crowd that ranges from high schoolers to seniors. The coffee, teas, and Italian sodas have treated me well there as have the cool (and often attractive) people behind the counter. Although I've never been there for the live music, that too is a plus. 

My one complaint was that the place was only open until 8pm, which totally goes against the whole notion of what a cafe is supposed to be! I see now that they've rectified this and are now open until 11. Bravo.
