HOT POT!

Last time I went to Fresh Mint, I ordered the Hot Pot, my new favorite. I tried a few other things on the menu since my first visit, all were delicious, but nothing was as good as the Hot Pot.

We started with the Pho, which apparently is pronounced "phu'uh", making my first review even funnier. I had no clue.
I progessed on to the Hot Pot (I may have already mentioned its deliciousness) and even got as far as dessert. The cake was magnificent. From what I heard, the mango tapioca was less fantastic. An allergy to mango kept me from trying that one.

I have and will continue to go back to Fresh Mint. This is the best fake meat in Phoenix and one of the best restaurants all around.
