A cozy little dive with cheap beer and bartenders who know what's up.

This isn't the type of place you would take mom to for a holiday drink. 
Dingy, dark and mysterious because you never know what your gonna get.. perhaps the bartender will be wearing a Mickey Mouse sweater and playing crosswords? Maybe drunken men in there late 40's will be stumbling about playing pool? 

If you love to people watch and have a few good, cheap beers with your pals, check this spot out. It might just be your new favorite dive!
