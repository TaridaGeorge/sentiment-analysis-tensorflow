Rage has become my "go to" bike shop in the Valley of the Sun.

Real simple kids:
- They know their shit.
- They get your parts in fast.
- They can true badly built wheels.
- They call you when they say they will.

I'm very pleased that I found Rage. Its a haul to get to Scottsdale from downtown Phoenix, but its worth it every time. I see me dropping some coin in there this winter. New Yetis, here I come!
