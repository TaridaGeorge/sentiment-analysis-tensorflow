Fairytale Brownies are phenomenal and easily the most decadent production brownie in that money can buy. I love the innovation and variety and there is more love and inspiration than a million Grannies can bake. This bakery is immaculate and is a solid quality obsessed operation that is a source of pride for the community in Phoenix. They do great community interaction and really strive to create a soulful and delicious product that is beloved by millions of chocoholics. I find it amusing to read the few haters on the blogs, because that is not close to the typical reaction of countless fans..dare I say fanatics! You will not find a better chocolate gift than Fairytale Brownies at the Holidays or that special occasion.
If you have not tried the new chocolate -enrobed truffles I highly suggest them.
