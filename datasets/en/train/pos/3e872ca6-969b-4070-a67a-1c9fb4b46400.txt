This place makes the best burger in Phoenix and the price is very reasonable. I'm also very found of their hot and spicy chicken sandwich. My only complaint is that some of their new staff members just aren't as sharp as the old schoolers. I've been a loyal chuckbox customer since 2002 and I really miss some of the old faces. That said, you still can't beat the burgers...or the price.
