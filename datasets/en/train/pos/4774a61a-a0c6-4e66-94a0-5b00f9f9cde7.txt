Crimpers Salon is definitely the best salon in the valley!!! I have been going to various salons over the years trying to find one I LOVE, then I received a coupon in the mail for Crimpers and decided to try it out.  When I left Crimpers, this was the first time I had ever walked out of a salon not completely hating my hair!  My experience at Crimpers was so nice, the Salon is very clean and the staff is incredibly friendly.  I would request Frank-- he was very nice and did a fabulous job with my hair. (the owner of the salon)   I am planning to go back to the salon again this week to get my hair done again.  I highly, highly recommend Crimpers!
