The first time I went here, I was living at some apartments just down the road at Papago park.  I had only lived in Phoenix a couple years and where I come from there wasnt much in the way of BBQ so I didnt know anything about it other than I've had ribs before.  

I walked up to the counter and a very large black man hears me say "Uhh, I'd like to get a rack of beef ribs please".  
He barks back "Boy, you dont want no beef ribs.  What you want is pork ribs"
Being the skinny half Korean kid I was, all I could say was "Yes sir"

I'll tell ya, that changed my life.  Pork ribs, especially the ones from Honey Bear, make beef ribs taste like a McDonalds McRib sandwich.
