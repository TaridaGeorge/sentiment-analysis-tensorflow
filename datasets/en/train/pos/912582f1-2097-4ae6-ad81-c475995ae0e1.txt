Very friendly folks, I used to feel that one had to get all dressed up to go there, but being as how I live right behind the place, I don't feel like getting all dressed up to get my morning fix, so I go in in sweats and a tshirt and no one says anything lol. Great Velvet, awesome homemade whipped cream, great experience! Oh, and guys it's cheaper than Starbucks, and way way way better, so give it a try!
