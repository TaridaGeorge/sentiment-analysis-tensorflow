All of the positive reviews of Good Guys Electric are accurate. I called on a Saturday and got a return call the same day. We agreed on a day and time for Mike to do the work. Mike called when he was on the way, showed up when he said he would and did a great job. He asked appropriate questions and answered everything I asked. I will definitely call Good Guys again when I need electrical work.
