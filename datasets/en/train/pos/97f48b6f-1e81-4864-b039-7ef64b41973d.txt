Thank you yelp!  I placed an order with Rachel after 1pm and wanted it delivered that day.  She made it happen!  Also, she OFFERED to email me a picture of the arrangement that she made to send to a friend of mine.  It was fresh and beautiful!  Typically & unfortunately  you are clueless about what the person actually receives vs what you intended to send--not with this florist.  I also got an email from her letting me know that my friend was not home and she left a note on her door and delivered it to the leasing office.  She wanted to be sure that she did get it.  Not only is she one fantastic florist, but Rachel will go out of her way to be sure the delivery gets where it needs to be.  

Highly recommend this florist & will not hesitate to use her again!!
