Family run, locally owned, professional jewelers. They brought my Nixon watch back from the dead (it was seriously scratched and scuffed) and it now gleams more than when I first bought it. They tore down the entire watch to buff and polish every possible surface - only $50. Very friendly and upbeat people - great to do business with.
