I've been to several Bikram Yoga studios and this one is my absolute favorite!! The atmosphere is so friendly and inviting. The whole studio is the most beautiful I've seen and I think the teachers are great! There hasn't been anyone there that I didn't like. I've been diagnosed with scoliosis growing up, and nothing has drastically improved it or healed it better than bikram yoga!!! I highly recommend this place!!
