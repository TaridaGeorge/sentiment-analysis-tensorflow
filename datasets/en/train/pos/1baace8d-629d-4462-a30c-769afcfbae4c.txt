I went to get my right tragus pierced, and they were very nice. The piercer (I think CJ. He has his ears stretched out rather large, and I think stretched nose piercings, too.) was super nice and tolerant of my slightly-nervous perky chatter. He called me "hon" a lot, which, originally being from Texas, I totally dug. I will definitely go back to get my left tragus pierced, and whatever else I feel like getting poked.
