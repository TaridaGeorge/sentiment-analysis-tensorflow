One of my my favorite salads is at the White Chocolate Grill. The Filet Mingon Cobb Salad is FANTABULOUS and DELICIOUS!! Their seasonal Pumpkin Cheesecake is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten and wish they had it all year (except I would gain a few pounds). Their other food is also very tasty, great service and ambiance! 
Not a place for groups though, they only have booths...  highly recommend you try White Chocolate Grill though... It's fabulous!
