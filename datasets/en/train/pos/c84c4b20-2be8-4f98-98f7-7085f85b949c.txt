I like Heather P's review.  Holy deliciousness indeed.

I ordered the genoa from here last week.  I started out a bit crabby because several employees walked by me without acknowleding that I was standing in front of the "order here" sign.  But any annoyance immediately disappeared upon my first bite of my sandwich.  They were out of their normal bread so they offered me ciabatta.  I would never order it different, the bread, cream cheese and meat was a perfect combination.  It just might be on my top 10 sandwiches of all time list.

Their patio was pretty crowded since apparently they have live music quite often, so I ended up eating upstairs.  It was actually much cooler upstairs than downstairs so I highly recommend it on hot days.
