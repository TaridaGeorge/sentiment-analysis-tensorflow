We have been using Carpet Medic for many years and they are hands down the best.  You need to be able to trust your carpet cleaner / flood restoration people that they will take care, and be a good value.   The Carpet Medic people have absolutely earned our trust.  "Lock the door on your way out when you are done"  I know when I get home I will find the place safe and excellently cleaned.
