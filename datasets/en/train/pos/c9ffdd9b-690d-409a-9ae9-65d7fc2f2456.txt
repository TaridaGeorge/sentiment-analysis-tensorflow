Another great dinner at Sushi Eye! My boyfriend and I love the freshness of the fish and the creative rolls. Make sure to try the Atkins roll; instead of rice it is wrapped in cucumber and it is delish! This has been our go-to sushi place for about 3 years now and it never disappoints. Check it out!
