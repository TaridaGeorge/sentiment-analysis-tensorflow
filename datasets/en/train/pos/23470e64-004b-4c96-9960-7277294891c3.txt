This is your go to breakfast/brunch in the Ahwatukee/Tempe area.  They make their own bagels, quite the selection and cheap!

This has got to be the best bang for your buck and good quality ingredients to match.

Everything is great here and wide selection of not only breakfast but lunch. 

If this is your first visit I would recommend the Apple Smoked Sausage Scramble (they WILL do egg whites on anything for you).  The Breakfast Burrito or for heartier meals... check out their pancakes and biscuits and gravy.

My favorite bagel:  Cinnamon  Sugar or the Raisin with a bunch of Peanut butter spread on top.

Enjoy!
