This museum has come a long way from it's humble beginings in Phx. I remember when I was a kid in the 80's my trips to the museum were always followed up by visiting the adjacent Central Phx Public Library where I spent a lot of my youth pouring over any subject that I wanted. My parents never kept me out of the adult sections. They thoguht if I could read it that's all that mattered. I loved the museum & library & still do. Now a member of the museum I realize just how very much the Phx Art Museum has to do all year long. Great place to be & lose yourself in the art. Tip - Become a member to support the Arts in Phx.
