Walk into Poppa Maize and the first thing that hits you is the wonderful smells.  The second thing is the array of popcorn flavors, everything from tradional buttered to coffee flavored.  There are seasonal flavors (the candy cane popcorn was delish) and old standby's.  The owners are locals who work hard to please there customers and it shows.  My personal favorite is the old standby caramel corn, with the coffee and peanut butter chocolate vying for second place.  My husband loves the chipotle cheese.  The butter pecan is also to die for.  Basically, they are all wonderful.   Give it a try, you will be hooked.
