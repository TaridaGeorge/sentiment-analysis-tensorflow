I LOVE THIS PLACE! Kicks the crap out of Pizzeria Bianco :)

My boyfriend and I go to this place at LEAST twice a month, sometimes more with his family in tow.

The pizza is always fresh with the perfect amount of coal-crispness to the crust and the cannolis are to DIE FOR. SERIOUSLY.

Highly reccommend :)
