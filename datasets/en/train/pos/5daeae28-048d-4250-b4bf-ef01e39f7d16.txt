After reading the review be Jessica P. I decided to give Sorensen's a call, and I was very happy with the results. My heat went out, so I gave them a call and Brian came out a few hours later. He was very efficient and knowledgeable and was able to repair it. Even knowing he had other service calls to go on that night, he took the time to answer all my questions. He even went the extra mile and looked at my water heater for me after mentioning that the hot water didn't last long. I will definitely be calling them for all my ac and heating needs. I suggest giving them a call. BTW I am an actual client.
