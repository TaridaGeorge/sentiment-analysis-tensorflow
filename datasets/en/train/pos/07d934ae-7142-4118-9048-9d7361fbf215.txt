Ted's is not gourmet!  Leave the hoity toity at home.  But if you are looking for the best dog in town, Ted's is the spot.  I have been chowing on Ted's dog's for years!   They know how to cook those dogs, nice and dark, but not burned!  Condiments are added to your liking.  They seem to know just the right amount.  Fries are awesome.  Onion Rings, just the right amount of grease!  Brauts are good too....

Worth the wait.  If you hit it just right, there is no wait at all.  Either way, bring a smile, and an empty tummy!  It's gonna be good.
