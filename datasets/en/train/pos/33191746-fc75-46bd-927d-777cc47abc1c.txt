I was in an accident a few years ago and was told to see a chiropractor, which I was really hesitant to do. 

I was recommended to Health Coach and boy was it the best move I made. Their philosophy is to take a holistic approach to getting you healthy as quickly as possible. 

The staff is great and I felt comfortable putting my health in their hands.
