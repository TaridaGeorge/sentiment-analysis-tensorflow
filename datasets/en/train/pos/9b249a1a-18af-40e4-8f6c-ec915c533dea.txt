This classic steakhouse has won me over.  I have been on a few occasions, both special and random!  As mentioned in the other reviews the decor has not changed a bit.  It still boasts weird pictures hanging on the wall of some unnamed man (hmmm? Mr. Durant himself)!? I always opt for the bar area weather having dinner or not.  I'm not one for big dining rooms and don't mind eating at the bar, especially with the excellent service the bartender offers.  This is a favorite among my friends for birthdays, happy hours, and of course Valentine's Day! (with your friends or your significant other:)
My favorites on the menu: garlic mashed potatoes, fillet mignon, scallops, and all of the salads.  
Go, dine, enjoy it is worth the extra dollars:)
