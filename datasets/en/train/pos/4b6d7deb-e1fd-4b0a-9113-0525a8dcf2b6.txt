Sorry Nydia, I know you had a bad experience, but it is not representative of the experiences I have had at Scottsdale Cigars. Jimmy is a warm and freindly owner. He gets to know his customers and gives me various cigars to try, on a regular basis. I go out of my way to go to his shop knowing that I am supporting a local small business and a businessman who works there every day and goes out of his way to make sure his customers are happy.

Oh, and did I mention that they carry most all brands of cigars in a good-sized well humidified walk-in humidor?
