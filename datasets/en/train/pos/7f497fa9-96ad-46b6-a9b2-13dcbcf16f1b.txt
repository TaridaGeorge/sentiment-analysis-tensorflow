Had dinner here last night, and it was really busy for a weeknight. 

The wine, food, atmosphere, and staff were perfect. I am lucky to have such a gem of an Italian restaurant right in my backyard. We had the Salmon, Spinach Ravioli, and a "house recommended" glass of wine that we enjoyed so much we are ordering some online.
