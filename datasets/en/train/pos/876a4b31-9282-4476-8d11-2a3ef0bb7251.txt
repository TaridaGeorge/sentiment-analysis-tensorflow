Excellent store, great staff, and HUGE wealth of knowledge. Everyone who works here is super friendly, they order anythign you want, and carry a great selection of live and dry goods. My entire tank is stocked from this store. SASHA is a great person and has helped me to grow a beautiful tank over the last two years.
