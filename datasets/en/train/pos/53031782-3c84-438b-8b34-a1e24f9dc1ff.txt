This is an amazing shopping experience.

I liked this Fry's before the remodel.  I like it even more now.

The previous reviews highlight the wonderful things about this location, and additions since reopening.  

One of my favorite things they have here is grilled salmon in the area near the deli, ready to buy at around $10/lb.  Cooked that day, take it home, heat (or not) and serve over a salad.  I LOVE IT!  There are so  many other choices for that last-minute meal, less than going out to eat, still feeding the family healthy food.

There is such an amazing selection of services and foods, that one must visit to fully experience this luxury.

Employees are friendly and helpful.  

If you need to grab something fast for a party, a potluck or the like,  you will be a star with any number of ready to serve offerings here.
