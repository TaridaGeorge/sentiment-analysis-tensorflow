Putsy's has a great menu of sandwiches and salads, but they are known for their chicken and steak.  I go to lunch there at least a couple of times a week for the Caddyshack Basket (3 huge chicken fingers come with fries and toast and your choice of 2 sauces for dipping) - however, always looking for something good that's low-carb, I get the Caddyshack Basket with no fries or toast...instead I get a side of steak.  My favorite sauce is the Creamy Avocado...but there are so many good ones to choose from.  Get your drink in the To-Go cup and you can fill it up for $1 when you go back...

(Putsy's is in the space where the Heart Attack Grill used to be.)
