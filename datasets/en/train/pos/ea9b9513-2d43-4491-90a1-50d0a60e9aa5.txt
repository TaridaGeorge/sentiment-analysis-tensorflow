This has been a favorite spot for me since moving to the area a few months ago. Always order one of the green iced teas and I love how they make it just for me. Have stayed for hours inside and out (working on laptop) & never felt pressed to leave, Clients are a nice mix and seem to take their cue from the owner: gracious.
