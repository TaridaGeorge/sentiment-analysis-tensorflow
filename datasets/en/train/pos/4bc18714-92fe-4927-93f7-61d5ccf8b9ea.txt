I was referred to Robert and what a great referral it was.  Robert is a genuinely nice person and can carry on an intelligent conversation on most subjects.  He's also pretty quick witted and funny.  I tell you this, mind you, so you realize that if you choose to carry on a conversation during your session, the guy is cool.  Robert is very into yoga and healthy lifestyle to it fits his approach and therapy technique well.  Imagine a mid 40's gray haired Yoda and you have Robert.  Mix that in with a great massage therapist well versed in Eastern healing methods such as cupping and you get a kick ass session.  Thanks Robert!
