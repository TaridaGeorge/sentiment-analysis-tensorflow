I love this place!! it's good for groups or for intimate dates as well. I particularly loveeeeee the patio!! it's right on the waterfront with all the lights and fountains so this is one of my to-go places for romantic dates. their food's very good too and wine list isn't bad either.
I haven't had anything there that i was disappointed at. Definitely will be keep going back!
