My parents would stay here when they visited while I was a student at ASU.  It is less than 10 minutes away and is the best resort you can stay at that is within range of ASU.  While I was a student I would come to the AZ Grand pools to read or hang out by the fire pit at night.  When I go back to visit, I will try to stay here (if I can afford it on my budget).  Avoid Rustlers Roost, but stay here.
