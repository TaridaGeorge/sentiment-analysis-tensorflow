I ended up here on a Sunday because Teavana didn't open until 12pm. This place is way better than Teavana and reasonably priced. Holly was very helpful and gave great recommendations. I love that you can smell the small jars of tea yourself and don't have to wait for someone to do it for you. There are tons of tea accessories and gifts. Holly even gift wraps!!  I also like that she sends tea to the troops overseas and you can purchase a bag of tea and personalize your own message. I recommend going here if you are interested in drinking good quality tea and have any questions. I don't live close, but will make the trip to go here.I will definitely be back!!
