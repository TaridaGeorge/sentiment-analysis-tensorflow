When I go through nasty fights with a girlfriend, I go get a half of chicken salad and a works steak to make myself feel better! Its that kind of place for me! Joe and his family have been operating this place for all of the 32 years I have been here in Scottsdale. My sister and I would spend babysitting money on a pizza hogie once a week every summer. Great family, great food, great place. No frills interior, old school the whole way but perfect.
