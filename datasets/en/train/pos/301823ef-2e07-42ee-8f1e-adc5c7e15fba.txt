Keeping in mind the number of bad Yelp reviews, I was not going to visit this place. But there are not too many other options around, so I decided to take my chances.

It worked out very well: pan-fried sea bass was excellent! The service was fast, the place was very cozy. And not very expensive, too.

PS:

Chili-rubbed Iron Steak room service brought me a day earlier (I guess they deliver from Pointe In Tyme) was not very good.
