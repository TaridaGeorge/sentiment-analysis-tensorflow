Wow, 4 peaks is amazing!  My dad (who makes his own beer in Oregon and regularly attends  beer festivals to grade the brews) stopped here and told me I must go. I am from Portland and this place makes me feel at home. And the beer is awesome! There were 4 of us who ordered beer and I tried everyones and loved it. I had the hef,  the boyfriend had kilt lifter, and his 2 friends had the oatmeal stout. We ordered the ice cream pie and stoutmiso to share and they were amazing. My only complaint about this place is that it is abnormally too loud. They could turn down the music a few notches.
