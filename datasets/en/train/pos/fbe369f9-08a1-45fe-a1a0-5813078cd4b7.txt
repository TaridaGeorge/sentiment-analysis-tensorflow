Great food, both hot and cold.  Excellent service, my lemonade cup stayed full and we were checked on at just the right interval!  Wonderful atmosphere.  Cozy tables for 2 are set among shelves of wine, spices and perusable cookbooks.

My bowl of delicious gumbo and generously sized warm rumsauced bread pudding was just over $12, so affordable also.

We'll be back!
