This is an institution in the East Valley.  You can ask most people around, and they have been to one of the locations at least once.   I always get Alfredo the Dark when I go with shredded chicken on top, it has just enough of a kick and is very delicious.   And you definitely cannot leave without getting pazooki.  It would be a crime to do so!  You can get the cookie in chocolate chip, peanut butter, or macadamia nut and white chocolate chips.  I recommend the chocolate chip every time, the classic is always the best.

If you want the pizza be prepared to wait, they make it fresh when you order it so it could be a half hour or more.  If you're hungry in the meantime they have several wonderful salads and appetizers to choose from.  I personally love the wings.
