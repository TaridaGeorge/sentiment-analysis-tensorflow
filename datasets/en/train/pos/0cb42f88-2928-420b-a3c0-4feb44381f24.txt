I went this restaurant after reading from Yelp even tho it is kind of far from me. 
The food was good, but what I like more about this place was the atmosphere. 
It made me feel like I am in Vietnam. I liked that. Honestly I am not sure about the taste. I didn't feel really special but I liked it because I like Vietnamese food anyway!
