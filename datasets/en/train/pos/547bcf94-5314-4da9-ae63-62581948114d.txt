I hope my trainer doesn't see this...But I love sprinkles and I love all of the flavors that they have especially the dark chocolate and the red velvet.  I love them with a big glass of ice cold whole milk!  My dog even enjoys the pup cakes...twitter with them and get the password of the day and get a free one!  I love this place!
