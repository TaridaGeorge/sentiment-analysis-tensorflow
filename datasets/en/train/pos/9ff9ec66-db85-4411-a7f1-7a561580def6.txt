Kazimierz is a hidden gem in old town.  

I have been several times and every time it's been a great experience.  The atmosphere is great it's dark and there are couches to sit at and be comfortable.  

The food and wine are excellent and there are many options for both.  They have a huge selection of by the bottle wine for all price ranges and also you can buy a good selection by the glass.
