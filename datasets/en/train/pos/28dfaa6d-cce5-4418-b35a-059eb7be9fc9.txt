This is by far my favorite Fro-Yo joint in the area. I'd MUCH rather come to Yogurtology than drive another mile down the road and hit up Mojo.

Yogurtology always has a great selection of flavors and the people working are usually great. There is one guy - not sure if he is a manager or what - but every time my boyfriend and I are in there when he is, he talks to us a ton, always suggests fun new combos and really seems to value our opinion on the flavors and toppings available.

Yogurtology is always a fun experience and yummy treat.
