Our dog Gidget was crying in the middle of the night and didn't know what was wrong so we looked up this place cause it was right across the street from us and went. No one was there so we got right in and the staff was very nice and professional. We were in and out in an hour and Gidget was feeling doing fine. This place is open 24/7 and is for sure where we will always go for our emergency vet needs.
