I had difficulty finding a good dentist in central Phoenix until I found Dr. Woodbury. Despite having changed insurance plans a few times, I have not had to give up Dr. Woodbury as he accepts a good range of insurance plans. The entire office staff is really friendly and Dr. Woodbury has a very gentle touch - he even managed to make my husband not mind going to the dentist which is quite a feat! The office is always running on time as well which is big plus when you're fitting in dental visits around a work schedule.
