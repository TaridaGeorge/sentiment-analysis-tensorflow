I just moved to Gilbert from Snobsdale.  Yes I said Snobsdale!  I was pleasantly surprised by Blue 32!!!  This place would even do great is Snobsdale!!  (the people in Scottsdale are quite critical, hence one of the reasons I am in Gilbert raising my family now.)  This was so unexpected!  Great food, great decor, price was MUCH cheaper than comprable place in Scottsdale!  My wife couldn't believe it either.  PLeasantly surprised...I lived in gilbert from 1997-2003 and there was no decent eateries, sports bars or anything that was't a chain.  Glad to be back folks and I will be coming back to Blue 32 often!!  My 10 and 11 year old boys were even talking about our hot waitres...LOL!  GREAT SPOT!!
