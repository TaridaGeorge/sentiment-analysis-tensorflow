Ranch Market is one of the places that makes me happy about moving back to Arizona.  As others have said, the produce is generally outstanding.  Huge selection of products, cheap prices, and its just fun walking around an looking at the stuff.  Great tortillas and chips made fresh each day.  Then to top it all off, a huge selection of fresh salsas, aguas frescas and lots of quick, delicious food options in the "restaurant" part of the store.  As cheesy as it sounds, it really does make the trip to the grocery store put a smile on my face.
