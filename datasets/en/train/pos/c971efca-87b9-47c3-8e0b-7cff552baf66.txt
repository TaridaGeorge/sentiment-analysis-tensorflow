Never thought I would be one for Vietnamese food, but I have to tell you, I am soooo glad my wife and son talked me into it.  This place is an EASY five star review having been there several times and never being disappointed. 

Great flavors, great selections, and really really good service!  Well worth a trip if you are in the surprise area and want to try something fun and new!
