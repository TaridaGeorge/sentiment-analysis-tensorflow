This zoo is fantastic and one of the best we've been to.  There are some unique exhibits and the bighorn sheep living in their natural habitat is interesting.  I would not recommend going here in the summer though.  There are no inside exhibits with air conditioning, and not many concessions open either.  Any other season, go!
