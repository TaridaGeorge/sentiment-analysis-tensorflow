These guys (and gals) are awesome.  They have some of the best rates on servicing and inspecting equipment, and do a great job. They will even do up to two FREE tank fills per person per day (donation jar optional), and decent prices on gear.  They coordinate dives and give great general advice.  Take an extra moment to make sure you know how to get there.
