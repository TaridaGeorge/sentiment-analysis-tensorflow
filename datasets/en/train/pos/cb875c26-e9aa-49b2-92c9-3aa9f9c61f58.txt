This is our favorite pizza place! It's Tempe's best kept secret! Make a reservation because they are sure to be busy on Friday and Saturday nights. The four meat pizza is amazing! The sausage in made by the chef/owner and it's delicious. We bring all of our friends here and they all can't wait to return.
