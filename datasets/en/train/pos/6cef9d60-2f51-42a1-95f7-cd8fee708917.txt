I've been a patient of Dr. Lewis for a few years now, and I'm always very impressed with the staff's friendliness. The girls up front will often recognize me and call me by name, which I appreciate, and Dr. Lewis is a charmer.

I haven't worn contact lenses in years because I always hate how they felt in my eyes(I always needed weighted Toric lenses for Astigmatism), but the doctor explained that lenses have come a long way in comfort in recent years and he suggested I try them on again; we're going through a series of trial lenses to find the perfect fit, and he never makes me feel rushed or pressured.
