I really like this place for a quick and easy car wash. You can just drive up,use the machine. You can pay cash or credit.  You get a receipt and then proceed through the car wash, while you stay in the vehicle.  They give your tires a quick scrub and you are on your way. You just drive out when you are done. They do not dry the car on the quick washes but, to get the dust off it is excellent! Super reasonable @ $5.00 as well.
