I am not a big fan of Italian food that's not homemade, but I must say I love the food here. Seafood is always excellent! Also, my family hosted my grad school graduation dinner here for a party of 12 and the service was out of this world!!! They took such good care of us that I will always have fond memories of that night!!! It's not cheap, but the quality is well worth it. Parking is limited, but valet is complimentary.
