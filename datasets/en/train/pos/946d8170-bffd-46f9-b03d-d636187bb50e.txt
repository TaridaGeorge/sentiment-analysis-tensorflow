Yum! Yum! Yum!  I'm such a fan of Jamba Juice when I want a quick, healthy snack or lunch replacement.  You can get anything from a Jamba light drink to a thicker smoothie with yogurt and lots of extras.  

I stuck with the light Berry Fulfilling, because then I could get a larger size for equal calories of course!  It was delicious!  I got the Original size and it was huge.  Definitely plenty.  

They also have some healthy snacks (Clif Kids bars!) and is a fantastic option when you want something fast.  I think I'm craving another one today!
