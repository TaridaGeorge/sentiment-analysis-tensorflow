I love this place... too!   They have the best red curry pasty i have ever eaten.   I wish you had a place in north phoenix though as the drive is a bit far.   In addition to the pastys i really like all the sides such as the rutabaga, and the stilton soup.  Yum!   This place delivers on all counts.
