My boyfriend hunted down these tasty little chocolates for me on Valentine's Day. I have been wanting to try these local morsels for a while, especially since I recently became vegan. I believe they were a little on the pricey side... but completely worth it because a little goes a long way. We enjoyed the "Wei Relaxed" dark chocolate and the "All the Wei" dark chocolate collection which included chai, citrus, chili, espresso, and dark flavors. Check out the Wei of Chocolate Facebook page for a list of retailers that carry their products. Happy chocolate eating!
