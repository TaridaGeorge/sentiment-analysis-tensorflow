This place is great! I had my navel pierced here about 4 years ago and the staff was very professional and friendly. They autoclave all their instruments, meaning they're 100% sanitary, and they answer any questions you have. They also offer a 24-hour pager service in case you have an emergency. I'd go back, though I don't know what else I would get pierced. :-)
