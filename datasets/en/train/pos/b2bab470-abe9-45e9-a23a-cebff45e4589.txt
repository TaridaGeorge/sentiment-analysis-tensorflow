We here for my first time yesterday with my mother who has been several times and has nothing but good things to say. 

1. SERVICE - everyone is extremely friendly and helpful, down to the super friendly valet! 

2. The facility and grounds were so clean and smelled amazing. Great clean up crew :) 

3. The rooftop pool was AMAZING. The pool was not overly chlorinated and it felt like there was water softener which made it so nice to swim in. 

4. The whole experience was quiet and relaxing and my masseuse with Linda was great. She was friendly, considerate, and STRONG. :)
