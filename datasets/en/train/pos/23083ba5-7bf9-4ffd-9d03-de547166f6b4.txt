I don't understand why people are complaining about the credit card processing fee (50Â¢ on under $5) - the vendors are required to pay for transactions done by card, and a lot of little shops lose some money on single-item purchases. 

That said, the staff was very friendly and service was awesome for a 2-woman crew on a busy Sunday morning. 

If I lived out here it would be a no-brainer to make this my default coffee shop. I will be back whenever I'm in the neighborhood again.
