One word. STRAWBERRY!! I am addicted to them (but will never go to rehab) and can't wait for my next fix. Sometimes the frosting is a bit thick and I think I might go into sugar shock. I've tried coconut , yummy. Red velvet... blah. Overrated. Lemon, decent. But please, if Malibu Rum Barbie is saying try the Strawberry sensation, do it!!

As for parking, that's on the developer of that particular development. They had a triangular corner to work with and made the best of it. I enter through the light and park around back. My thighs appreciate the extra steps so I can indulge more often in the ritual which is Sprinkles.
