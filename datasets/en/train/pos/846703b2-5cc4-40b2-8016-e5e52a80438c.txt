So I had a pair of sunglasses that need some major tweaking (the kind of stuff I couldn't do myself), and these guys did it for free even though I was clear that I did not buy them there.  When I offered to pay something for their effort, they just asked that I keep them in mind when I buy in the future.  I will most definitely do that!!!
