This place is awesome!

I purchased a family membership here on the night Yelp had their event and I brought my son and daughter here. 

She made a cake and he made a necklace (I actually thought they would have reversed it but who knew!)

The staff was extremely helpful and polite the kids had a blast flexing their creative muscles and I didn't have to clean up the mess (YAY)

They have so many different options to choose from, jewelry making, ceramics, candles, soaps, cakes, glass wear etc. If you can't find something you are interested in here (if you are the craft type) you are nuts.

I am thinking about doing a girls night out here or something for my daughters next birthday.

Hands down this place is really really cool!
