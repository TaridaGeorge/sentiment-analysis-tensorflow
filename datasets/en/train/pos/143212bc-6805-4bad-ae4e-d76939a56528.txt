A gem for Chinese food when you're in Phoenix, man. It's authentic and even offers entertainment each and every evening: live piano! Yes, there's an American guy who plays from a book of songs each night. Feel free to tip him if you'd like; he plays well! 

The food's definitely good here. Our table had the Fu-Gwa (bitter melon) with beef, suculent lobster for $25, spinach with garlic, Soy Sauce Chicken and XO squid with lettuce. Good stuff! 

Staff's accomodating and there's a Western feel to this place. Welcoming environment indeed! Would definitely come back for seconds!
