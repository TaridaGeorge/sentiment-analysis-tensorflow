This is a picture perfect desert mountain park that has something for everybody. There is a short zero-hills trail that has some fun and informative information on the trees/plants/wildlife that inhabit the area. There is a very wide array of more challenging hikes and if you keep moving along seemingly endless paths options for different areas to explore. This place is easy to get to and has plenty of parking. I've gone 3 times so far after moving to the area and can't wait to take another path. This is the premier place in the valley to enjoy he unique experience and beauty of the Sonoran desert.
