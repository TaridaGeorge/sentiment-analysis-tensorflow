Well I have to say I was very impressed with this establishment.  Well run, nice staff, great new york style pizza.  Very good quality ingredients and very tasty sause.   All their pizzas come in your choice of three different  sauce styles (regular, white and pesto).  Not sure that I can say whether I like it better than florencia's, its just different.  But if you're into new york style pizza I've yet to find a better spot in phoenix.
