Changing Hands Bookstore is easily one of, if not my favorite bookstore anywhere in North America. 

The atmosphere once you walk in is welcoming. The staff is cool and friendly and they don't hover while you search through their many aisles. You can find books on any topic ranging from organic gardening to paganism to the best sellers. The prices on the new books aren't great, but their selection of used books makes up for it. All the books are in excellent condition and they have a huge selection of art related books near the back (at least it was in the back of the store last time I visited). 

They have a lot of in-store events, from discussions, book groups and author signings. 

It's a great place to hang out, read a book, smell incense, chat with other book lovers and just chill.
