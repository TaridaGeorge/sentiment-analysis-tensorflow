Maybe it's because I am from the east coast, but I don't see the love for In-N-Out burgers.  Since everyone is comparing them here is my 2 cents. Five Guys Burgers are hand formed and taste way more like beef than the thin tiny burgers at In-N-Out.  You can also get pretty much any topping you can think of at Five Guys.  The real stand out is the fries.  I recommend getting them with Cajun as that makes them truly amazing.  No matter what size fires you get they give you a ton of them.  More than enough to share. For what you get I don't see how Five Guys is really that more expensive than any of the other burger places around here.  A "regular" burger here is a double patty burger and very large.  I usually get a small burger and that's just fine.
