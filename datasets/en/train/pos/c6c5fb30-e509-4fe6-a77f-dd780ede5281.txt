Best Barbeque in the West Valley.  For take out or dine in it can't be beat.  I just ordered 10 lbs  for an outdoor party .  I called 30 minutes ahead and they had my order ready and waiting when I arrived.
Being from the south I know good BBQ and this is the closest I had since moving to AZ.  It's much better than Old El Paso BBQ.
They also have really good shrimp!
