As a Massage therapist I really need to get worked on to make up for all the massages I give.  Kristi is my go-to massage therapist.   With over 20 years of experience in the healing arts she's got amazing strength and sensitivity.   AND--she's a great listener--it's kind of like getting a counselor and therapist all in one shot.  It's the best hour of my week!  "
