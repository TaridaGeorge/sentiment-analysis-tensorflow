I have been going to Kristen for years and I think she is just fantastic!  I would never think of letting anyone else near my brows.  She takes tremendous time and care with something as simple as a brow wax and as involved as a facial.  Her location is not difficult to find and the space itself is relaxing and lovely.  Her prices are reasonable, especially when you consider her location and the whole "feel" of her space.  I have recommended, and continue to recommend her to everyone I know.
