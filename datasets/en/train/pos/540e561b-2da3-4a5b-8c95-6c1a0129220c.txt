Love this place. Its the best i've found in the Phoenix area (although I actually just ordered Yupha's so we will see). The chicken pad see ew (spelling?) was amazing, and they provided a large portion. Very fast (10-15 minute wait) pickup if you are ordering to go. My friend and I, felt that the 5/5 level of spicy was the way to go, and it was waay too intense. Every bite was painfully delicious, and honestly quite frustrating. I was sweating and kinda felt like I had just taken a bongload (of bammer). I had to shower my body after that meal, but overall it was delightful. I would just recommend sticking w/ a low level of spice, and I love me some spice.
