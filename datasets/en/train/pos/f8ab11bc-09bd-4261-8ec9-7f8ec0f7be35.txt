So last week before heading to Arizona some fellow yelpers and I were having a conversation about cheese curds. Most of us had seen "squeakers" on the foodie networks/shows or seen them at Trader Joe like places but our overall consensus was that they were virtually non existent in San Jose/ Central Coast (Santa Cruz). So imagine my surprise day one of our "Arizona UYE" trip we find Cheese Curds in Arizona at the Scottsdale Farmer's Market.... I cannot find cheese curds at my farmers markets back home... lucky bastards. 

So I immediately call Linda L with the exciting news and yes.. there are some Cheese Curds in our fridge which will being making the trip back home with us. They sell at select farmers markets as well as the address above. The plain cheddar was good.. the jalapeno curds were bomb!
