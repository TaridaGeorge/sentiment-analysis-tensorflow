Lombardo's Gelato is no longer in the Fiesta Mall.  They are in Arizona Mills Mall and Metro Center Mall.  Their gelato is absolutely amazing.  When they say that it is a certain flavor, you can guarantee that it will be that flavor.  It is all natural, no preservatives.  If you have an opportunity to be where they have a location, I highly recommend you trying a sample.  Try as many as you like, you will not be disappointed.  My favorite is the pink grapefruit, but coconut and pineapple are wonderful as well.
