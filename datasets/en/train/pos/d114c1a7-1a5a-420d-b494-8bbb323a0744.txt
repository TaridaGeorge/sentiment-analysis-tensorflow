I have been coming to Pizzeria Bianco for 8 years and I have never been impressed.  It is very quaint and rustic with the exposed brick walls, the service is great and many of the staff have been there all 8 years I have been going there and the food is really quite incredible.  We enjoyed the spiedini...they seriously melt in your mouth and two pizzas - yummy!  Their wine selection is nice and reasonably priced too!
