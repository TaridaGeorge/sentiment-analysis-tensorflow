The BEST fritters anywhere. Seriously! Apple is my favorite. I used to live in the neighborhood, then a crack-head jumped my wall and tried to steal my bike. I was so over living cheap and we moved. 

But as I sit here in Surprise in suburbia safeness and chain hell, craving a donut this morning, this location of Rainbow donuts is where I wish I could be. 

I also miss the sandwiches/Gyros from the Shell Station at Central and Dunlap-best Gyros too. But, I digress... 

Tried all the various donuts and loved them,but the fritters haunt me- cheap price was a bonus. For $5 we had Saturday morning covered for breakfast. Sigh, missing the donuts...
