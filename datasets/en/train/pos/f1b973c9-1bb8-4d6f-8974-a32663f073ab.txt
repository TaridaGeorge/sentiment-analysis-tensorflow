Great place!  I wish we had something like Delux in my neighborhood back in LA.  

Burger is as good as the one at Father's Office in Santa Monica, without the hassle and the attitude.  I love that they have a take out annex where you can get anything on the regular menu to go!

Definitely one of the jewels in Phoenix!
