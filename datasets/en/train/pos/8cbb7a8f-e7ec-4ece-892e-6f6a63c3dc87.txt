Five stars, because you can't give six. We had the sampler, ped gaeng daeng, and drunken noodles. Cooked perfectly and yummy. Portions are good sized, plan on lunch for the next day. Prices are good considering portions. Ambience is great; love the classical yoga like music. Definitely try the rasberry tea.
