One of my friends kept on talking to me about this place. Finally I had lunch there. I tried their quiche and it was delicious! not too heavy and a good combination of flavors. 

Service is friendly and they take good care of all. I tried one macaron and it was again a good mix of mint, chocolate and still not too sweet. Definitely I have to go a couple of times more.
