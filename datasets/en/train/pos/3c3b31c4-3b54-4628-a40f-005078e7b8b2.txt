What a wonderful place to stay!  We stayed almost a month this year, and cannot say enough great things about this resort.  The service is first-rate, and the beds are fantastic.  Great food, friendly, helpful staff.

From the reservations desk to concierges and housekeeping staff, every single employee there combined to make our time at The Phoenician very special.

I can't wait to go back!
