Very good beef panang curry.  It has a complex flavor and the price is right.  Other dishes are tasty too.  Don't let the outside appearance scare you; Inside is simple and clean.  Service is laid-back, so be prepared to stay a little bit longer than you might at some sit-down places, but they'll work with you if you let them know you can't stay long.
