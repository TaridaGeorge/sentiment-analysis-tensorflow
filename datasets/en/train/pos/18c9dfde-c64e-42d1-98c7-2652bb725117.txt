Had another delicious meal here again.  I had the schnitzel with creamy mushroom gravy, red cabbage and mashed potatoes.   My wife had the goulash with spaetzel and red cabbage.  
This place is kid freindly but doesn't really have a kids menu. Its best if you don't let your kids be picky about new foods.  Our kids had a chef's salad and a bratwurst dinner.  The restaurant is kind of hard to spot from the road but well worth finding it.
The restaurant really has a nice atmosphere with the German music playing in the background and nice decorations from Germany.
