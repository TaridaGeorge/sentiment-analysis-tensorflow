Excellent!  It is not easy to be a foodie and vegetarian, but that is what I am.  So when I heard this place had vegetarian Bun (my favorite Vietnamese dish ever), I was very skeptical.  The Bun was excellent, one of the best I have had, and I have had it in several different cities and states.  The service was great, I wish they had vegetarian Pho, but no chance on that one.  The waiter was very honest about what they could make vegetarian and what they could not.  We will be back for more dishes for sure!
