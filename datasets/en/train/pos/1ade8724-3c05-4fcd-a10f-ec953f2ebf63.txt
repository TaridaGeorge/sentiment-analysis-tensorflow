I almost didn't want to rate this because I don't want her to be super booked all the time and not be able to get in lol. I've been here twice and each time has made a WORLD of difference with my neck/back pain. I am never uncomfortable and she knows what she is doing. Most amazing deep tissue massages I have ever had and I will continue to return for as long as she is there.
