Wow, what a great venue! Absolutely love Crescent Ballroom. I saw CSS there last Tuesday, and everything about the event was top notch.

Crescent Ballroom is a decently sized venue. It was intimate enough to get close to the artists, but big enough to where you didn't feel like everyone was stepping on your toes. The bar and bartenders are great. The separate lounge area is very cool. Nice ambiance. Bathrooms were clean. All the employees were friendly. I'll definitely be back. I definitely would like to try the food too.
