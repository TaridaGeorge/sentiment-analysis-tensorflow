I've been looking for a neighbor hood bar to call it "my bar" for the longest time, ever since i moved back from california.  The bar tenders takes good care of their guests.  The enviroment is mgnificent, the crowd there is great too.  If you are looking for a good time, and drama free place, Fibber is the place to be.
