This is one of my favorite coffee spots in the Phoenix area. A quaint, little coffee bar in the back of Phoenix Public Market, this place offers coffee, pastries (while they last), and WiFi in a laid-back atmosphere in a single room filled with various works from local artists.

Free, covered parking is available in the lot to the west of the building. However, this lot is reserved after 2 pm on Wednesdays for the Open-Air Market.
