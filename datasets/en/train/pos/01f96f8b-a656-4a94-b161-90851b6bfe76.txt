We went here Saturday to celebrate a birthday. My friends had never heard of this restaurant and by the time we were ready to go we were all talking about coming here again. It is a nice old house turned restaurant. We were seated in a back room with only two other small groups. It was quiet and perfect. The food was absolutely amazing. We will definitely come back. I can't wait to use their outdoor patio (looked fun with a fireplace).
