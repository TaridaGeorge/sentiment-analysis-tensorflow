Clean, ambient, professional, healing refreshing and very affordable.
What else can be said?

I am a spa junkie and have been getting (on average) two massages per week, for the last 4 years.

After moving to old town Scottsdale a year ago, I was excited when I saw a new massage house opening near me.

I have been there 4 times now and have loved it every time!
The therapists are well trained, and professional
The ambiance is great, and the price is half as much as they should be charging.

I read a review left by Larry L. complain that he paid more the second time around. I guess he did not realize that they give a discount on your first time.

Without a doubt, this is my favorite massage studio in all of Scottsdale.
