I cannot fully describe the amount which I love this place.  I mean, it's literally around the corner from my house, so it gets extra awesomeness for being so close!

They make the best Pimms No 1 cup here.  I LOVE it.  I'm picky about how mine taste and here it is divine.  They also have housemade lemonade and ginger ale, which makes the world a better place as well.

John is awesome.  We love him.

They have weekly desserts which is awesome.  Always based on seasonaility.  

Also the menu just changed for the summer season.  We have yet to try the new items, but have heard from friends that it's amazing. 

LOVE LOVE LOVE
