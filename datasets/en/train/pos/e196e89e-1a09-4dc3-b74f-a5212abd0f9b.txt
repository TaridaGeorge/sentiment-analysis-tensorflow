I stopped in to this fine establishment for the first time since I have lived in Scottsdale and it was awesome. I have eaten at other J Alexanders before - and was always a fan - but this one rocked. 
I had the Steak Kebobs - and they are amazing. Perfectly seared and medium - pink yumminess. The cocktails were flowing and I had an awesome time. 
The people around me were all super social and even though I was dining alone at the bar - I met new friends fast.
