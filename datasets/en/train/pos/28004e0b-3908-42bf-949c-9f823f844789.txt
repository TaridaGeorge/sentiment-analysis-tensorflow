So New Years Day and we didn't want to make our own bkfast... I saw this place a week or two ago and we're always on the lookout for bkfast places.  We are early birds.  Quick Note : They don't open till 6am.

Once we got there and ordered I was shocked at the sizes!  Well worth the price.  DH got an omelet (pictured) and ended up taking half of it, the hash and the toast home for lunch.  I got 2 eggs..I'm not really the exciting bkfast person but love some scrambled eggs.  I was thrilled with this place.  Its close and good with options for everyone and a cute ambiance.
