For $5 you get at least an hour or two guided tour of an unusual and highly unique piece of Arizona history. There aren't a whole lot of 'local flavor' attractions in Phoenix, but what the city lacks in quantity it makes up in quality. Be sure to bring your camera because everywhere you turn there's another quirky piece of folk art in every hidden corner of this house making for great photo opportunities. The hours the castle is open for tours are sometimes sporadic, as the builder's daughter still lives there. So just call ahead and make sure you can come by - it's worth it!
