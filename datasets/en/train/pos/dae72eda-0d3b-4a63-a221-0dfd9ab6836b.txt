If you come here and don't get the freshly made pasta, you have made a serious mistake. The dish with the sausage and broccoli rabe is unbelievably good. The macaroni and cheese is wonderful and the Bolognese Ragu is so tasty. Try the suppli di Riso for a different experience, which are these rice balls with mozzarella and then fried.
