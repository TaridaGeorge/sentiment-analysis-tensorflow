Besides being a small place (which any small biz starts out in) this place is as close to the NJ and NYC pizza i love as it gets in az. I was lucky enough to do one of the owners wifes hair and she gave me a coupon for a serious slice to try it out and i have been going there ever since. It isnt easy to see from the street but its a great place and worth the money for sure. the serious slice combo for lunch is a great deal. Try the joe's sauce on your pizza you wont be sad if you like spicy stuff.

keep being amazing guys!
