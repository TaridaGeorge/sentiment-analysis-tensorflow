LOVE Lee Lee! Asian markets are so much fun, and this one's great because it's not freezing and doesn't stink ridiculously of fish. We got halfway through wandering the aisles and realized there was still half the store left - sooo big! And full of everything you could ever want. I got some premade age tofu (I didn't even know you could get this), masaman curry paste (minus shrimp sauce, since I'm a veggie person), sushinori and tons of other goodies. They also have a lovely little section of Asian decor type stuff and dishes!
