Veteran Automotive is a diamond in the rough! I have an import luxury suv that I needed some front suspension and brake work done on. I came in on a Friday afternoon as a walk-in and was pleasantly surprised to be told I could pick it up next day! Their rates are more than competitive, fair and they did several big extras for me that they did not charge me for. I can't stop telling people how great my experience was with you guys and I sure hope that my reviews will help encourage people to give you a shot FIRST! Thanks!!
