Yes, I'm giving them 5 stars. I know their prices are a little higher and people complain that it's more fusion than anything. I want to tell you why I love this place. 

Before Cyclo opened I used to go to the pho restaurant on Apache. I would get my customized fried rice-- chicken, shrimp, beef, eggs, and vegetables. They put a charred grilled pork right on top and I was in heaven. 

Justine worked at the Apache restaurant. What a character. I love her attitude mixed with charm. She has a good humor and fresh outlook on life. I always looked forward to her crazy stories. More importantly she gave great advice on how to deal with boys. Cyclo became my comfort food therapy sessions. And that is why Cyclo gets five stars.
