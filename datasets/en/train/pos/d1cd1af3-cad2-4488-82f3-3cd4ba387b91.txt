We were visiting from San Jose CA where there is an abundance of Indian restaurant ; however, the atmosphere, food and the prices were so great that I wish Little India was in our neighborhood. What made it more appealing was the attitude of Megha and all the ladies in the kitchen. As I am on a restricted diet Megha understood my needs and gave me honest suggestions as to what can be done with least amount of oil.
