Not a 5 star restaurant, but definitly a 5 star subway. It's amazing how efficient they operate during lunch rush (which is 12-15 people deep) consistently. If you're in the back of the line, you'll be out the door in 7 min. The food has always been fresh, and they ensure you get exactly what and how much you want. They even allow people to turn a foot long into 2 separate sandwiches (same base with different toppings) so cheap asses can save $1.50! You can text in orders which makes it more convenient to pick up mutiple sandwiches. Great job every time! If youre in a rush and want to get your subway on, go there!
