Sue and company have run an outstanding restaurant for 23 years in the east valley. Terrific Chinese cuisine, in a very pleasant sit down setting. You will not find better service at any restaurant, anywhere. Not sure what "pretty standard" Chinese food means; but compared to several other east valley Asian fares, including the major chains, this place is superior. 
Plus, if you're going to gamble on taking out Moo Shu, the dish that is typically created and rolled at your table, well, you takes your chances.

If you like the occasional fried delicacy, try the Golden Gate shrimp; love it!
