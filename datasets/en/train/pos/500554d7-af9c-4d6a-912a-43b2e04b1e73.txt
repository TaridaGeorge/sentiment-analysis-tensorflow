I have lived near this place for a few years and I have not had food this good since I lived in Germany. The decorations are a little bit over the top, but the food is as authentic as it gets!

Sauerbraten was excellent as was the JÃ¤gerschnitzel. The atmosphere was awesome. A lone accordionist played for about 45 minutes (started right after we got there and finished right before we left). The music the perfect accompaniment for dinner.

The prices are amazingly low and the portions are huge. I am looking forward to returning again very soon. I can't recommend this place enough!
