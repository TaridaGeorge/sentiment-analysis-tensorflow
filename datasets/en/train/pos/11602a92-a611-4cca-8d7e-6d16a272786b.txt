I've heard a couple of good comments about this pizza so I finally gave it a try. 

It's really good and convenient at a really fair price. I was reluctant to the "cook it yourself" approach but it's stupid-proof, it comes with directions and you can call them if something goes wrong (it didn't in my case :) 

It comes in a paper tray oven friendly and I intentionally overcooked it a little bit so it came out crunchy and with a great taste.

An instant favorite!
