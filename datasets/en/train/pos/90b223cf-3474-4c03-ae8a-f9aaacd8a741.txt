I have been a little deflated with a couple of my favorite boutiques disappearing right along with my mutual fund valuation. Then while hunting for auction items for ANLC, I  stumbled into Elan, fun, unique, perfect for goin' out in AZ casual style!  Lisa is georgous and creative, she even makes some of the great Jewelry they sell and can arrange one-of-a kind pieces!! Elan is worth an afternoon, check it out!!
