I love their regular menu, but their Sunday Brunch is the reason I head to Sierra Bonita. My favorite is the Buttermilk Chicken if its a regular night. If you go for brunch, please try the Atole Pinon Hotcakes. You will not be disappointed. They have a great sweetness without being overpowering. Perfect!
