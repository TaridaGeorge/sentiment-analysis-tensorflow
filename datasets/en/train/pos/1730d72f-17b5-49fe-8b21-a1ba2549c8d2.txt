Stayed here for a three night get away. We were on club level which made the hotel. I wouldn't stay unless it was on club level. They offered different food presentations in the morning, noon and night. Including all alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages.  We walked over to the upscale movie theater which included food and alcohol service on lounge seats, then we wandered on over to Mercbar or something like that. Highly recommended, had a fab little get away. The service at the Ritz is always impeccable. There is also a mall across the street nothing special but close by.
