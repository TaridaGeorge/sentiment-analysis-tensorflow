When I used to live in the Scottsdale ghetto, I was just around the corner from Prankster's.  Love love LOVED the place....cheap beer, friendly staff, TRIVIA!  What's not to like?

I did have one bad experience here though, but that was due solely to my accidentally double-booking and having 2 dates (one on each side of the bar) at Prankster's at the same time.  'm fairly certain I got caught early in the night, but was drunk enough I just kept denying!  Oopsies!
