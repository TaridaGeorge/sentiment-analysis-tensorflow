Oh man.  I love this place.  (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)

+ Open 24 hours on the weekends.  'Nough said.

+ Cheap, but flavorful, drinks.  I always like what I get here.  There is one guy who makes a mean vanilla latte, I have yet to get his name.

+ Food.  Good cakes and cookies.

-/+ I've found that a lot of high school kids like to loiter here (and they're loud).  But, hey, it's not XB's fault.

+ The people who work here know what they're doing.  They make sure to get your order right.  And they're always friendly.

+ They have musical guests every now and then... and it's usually good stuff.
