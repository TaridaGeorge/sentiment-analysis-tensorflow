This place serves the Phoenix area but has a small town feel once you step inside. It's a trendy cafe, a cute gourmet sandwich shop and relaxing chocolate shop all in one. There's couches and a TV if you want. They keep it off. They have games on a shelf and a game table. There's so much on the menu. The prices would be the same if you went to Starbucks (which I wouldn't). They have cheesecake on a stick and my husband got his favorite pineapple shake. The whole front of the shop is a window and it's nice to sit and watch the cars go by. My husband and I took the light rail into Phoenix just to go here. I had researched the place looking for a cool date and I found it. The coffee satisfies my "pink spot".
