I was first introduced to this place when I lived on the east coast and I loved it then and continue to love it. Phoenix is the perfect place to expand to. Their italian ice flavors are unique and just plain yummy. Recently my daughter tried the swedish fish and it tasted just like a swedish fish. My other daughter likes the honeydew melon. I like that they have seating because back east some of the places are just walk up windows. Everyone should check this place out during the summer especially. Awesome customer service too. Clean and inviting.
