If I lived in the area I would frequent this ice cream shop. 
It was suggested I give this place a try from fellow yelpers and I am glad I got here this past weekend. 
Like many places in Scottsdale the store is in a strip mall and it was a little hard to locate, but once we walked in I knew I would like whatever I choose. 
I selected the Salted Butter Caramel consisting of soft buttery caramel ribbons in creamy vanilla with a sprinkle of salt. It was SO GOOD! Definitely an adult flavor. 
It's a little on the pricey side, but as a sweet treat it was great.

I also liked that they are proud of their yelp reviews and had a sticker for yelp on their door.
