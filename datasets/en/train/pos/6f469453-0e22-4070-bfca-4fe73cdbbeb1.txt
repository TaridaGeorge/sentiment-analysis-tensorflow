I highly recommend Tina. My dog has been groomed by the same person for 9 years. She is an awesome groomer and loves my dog as if she's her own. She had to stop grooming so I started visiting groomers. I was so disappointed until I found Tina. She connected with my dog like my other groomer and made her look terrific. She followed all my directions and was so pleasant and spent so much time with her. She even came to visit her before her first grooming. I'm thrilled and relieved I found Tina!
