I think the Roaring Fork is the best Southwestern restaurant in the Valley. Not only for the outstanding cuisine, but also for the service. I've never spoken to an aloof idiot hostess on the phone, ever, and that's pretty much my job description (to speak with hostesses, not to deal with idiots... I'm a concierge). 

It's rich and delicious, and it happens to have the best burger in town. The bar features lots of delish micro-brews, and the service doesn't disappoint in this section, either. 

I'd far prefer going here than Richardson's or Rokerij any damn day of the week.
