Been looking for a good Italian restaurant and finally found one.  My wife and I went here for dinner on Sunday night.  Everything we had was excellent.  I recommend you come by and try it out.  I will be back for more.  Best Italian in town. The owner has been there for 30 years and does all the cooking.
