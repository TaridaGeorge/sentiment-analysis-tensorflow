Lived in AZ over 25 years, and driven by this place for a long time.  Went here to give the coney's a try.  (What can I say I am from Detroit, and I hit Lafayette every time I am back.)  Hands down the best coney I have had in Phoenix.  Fries were excellent.  Service was crisp.  All in all Jim's was a solid experience.  I will be back!
