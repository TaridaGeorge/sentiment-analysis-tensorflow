Anything Tracy touches turns to sweet gold. It's true. She has the chocolate touch. I could continue with sugar coated puns but that could take all night. Not only is Tracy herself as sweet as her treats, but her baked goods are freshly made and melt in my mouth. I've enjoyed her sweets from local spots such as Citizen Public House, Arcadia Farms Market Place, Smeeks and the Downtown Phoenix Public Market and she also offers made-to-order treats from her public kitchen. Her caramels and chocolates are delicious and her desserts are scrumptious. Are you a sassy sugar eater? Then try her bacon pecan brittle. It's savory meets sweet but in a good way. Mmmm. I plan on ordering several holiday treats from her this Christmas season and I like her sweets because they are reasonably priced as well.
