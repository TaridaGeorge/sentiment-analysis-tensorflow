My first visit to Chix I tried the works bowl with brown rice. The chicken was sweet and juicy while the beef was tender and flavorful. Drizzle on some the the Chix house sauce, and you have a meal that satisfies without leaving you stuffed at the end. My only complaint would be the anemic vegetables (bok choi, broccoli, and carrots) that came with the bowl. 

A satisfying meal near ASU for under $6. I'm in.
