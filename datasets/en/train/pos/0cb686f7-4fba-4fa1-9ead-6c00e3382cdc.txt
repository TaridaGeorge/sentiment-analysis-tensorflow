Um......I've been coming here since i was a child. I still love coming to this amazing establishment.  If its not business cards or trucker hats hanging from the ceiling that get your attention. Then its the amazing Chicken Fried Steak you can get there!!!!! If you have friends from Texas visiting Az. Definetly take them there......They will love it!!! hahha...
