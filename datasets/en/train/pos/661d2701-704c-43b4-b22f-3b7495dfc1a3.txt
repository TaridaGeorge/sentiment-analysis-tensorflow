The only Chick Fil A in NY is hidden in an NYU dorm, and let's face it, I don't have time to sneak into dorms, so I only get Chick-Fil-A when I travel.  How do they make the sandwiches so good?  Why are their waffle fries so delicious?  Why can't I have their oreo shakes all the time?  I love love this place.
