Excellent food and wonderful fast & friendly service.  I LOVED their Pho and "Nathan" makes the best iced Vienamese iced coffee.  The Pho is served piping hot, brimming to the rim with broth and noodles, with beef & shrimp - served with plenty of cilantro, basil, bean sprouts.  The condiment bottles need to be cleaned (the bottles were quite grimey), but for a 'Vietnamese Ma & Pop' -type diner - this one is the best.
