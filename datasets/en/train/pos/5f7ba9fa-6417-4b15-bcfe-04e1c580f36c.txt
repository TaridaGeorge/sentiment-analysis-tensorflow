This was my first time trying Ruth's Chris Steak House. I have always wanted to try the steaks at Ruth Chris. OMG I am such a fan!! My steak was cooked perfectly and very yummy. I really like the way they cook and server the steak. It wasn't dry and didn't need any steak sauce. The sides are huge. I think you really only need to order one or two side per table. The service was excellent and the wine list was good. I didn't find the prices of the wine to expensive. I ordered the New York strip. I would highly recommend getting your steak cooked med rear. This restaurant is perfect for a business meal or romantic evening. Service is brilliant!! Our waiter was Sean. He explained in detail how Ruth's Chris prepares and cooks their steaks. Ruth Chris is by far better than Morton's steak house.
