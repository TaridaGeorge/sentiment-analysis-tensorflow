What a great place!  I met a coworker here for breakfast a few weeks ago and had a great experience.  The employees were all super friendly, gave great recommendations and took good care of us.  The atmosphere is quaint and comfortable.  The food was excellent - great tea selection and delicious breakfast crepe!  I'll be back for sure!
