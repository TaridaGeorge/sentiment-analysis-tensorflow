This trip to AZ would not have been complete without our drunk shopping trip to the SFS. We began the spree at the Yardhouse..."spree" applies to both drinking and shopping. While sitting at the bar I often fantasize what it would be like to open all the taps and bathe beneath the beerfall...ahhhh refreshing!!! I had an assortment of IPAs and Forest and Brian drank snakebites. After becoming sufficiently tipsy we were off into the mall to continue the shopping part of the spree. It is so awesome that there are so many drinking options at the mall! Drunk shoppers=more money spent in the mall. There has been many a hungover morning when I woke up to bags full drunken purchases that I don't remember buying...glitter eye shadow, t-shirts with offensive sayings, sex toys...you get the picture. I have Forest to thank for many of those purchases!
