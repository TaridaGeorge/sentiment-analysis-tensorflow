Nadya is one of the nicest people you will ever meet.  Part of her personality is what kept me coming back.

Recently she altered a bridesmaids dress for my girlfriend and did a terrific job.  Flawless.  In years past, she has altered all of my "work attire."  I have since moved, but whenever I return home, if I ever need any work done I will bring it with.

Nadya, you are a wonderful person, and any recommendation I can send your way I will!
