Yum. Just Yum.

Ok I have to give you more than yum...I know. :) But let's start with YUM.

I have ordered from this company for several years now and the brownies never disappoint. Each brownie is individually packaged for freshness and they are the most moist, flavorful brownies I've had outside of my own kitchen. (And I make damn good brownies--but they don't travel well. LOL)

The thing I like best is that they offer sugar free treats too so even my diabetic friends can still enjoy these delicious brownies without worrying about their sugar skyrocketing. 

My favorite is the chocolate chip brownie but I'm also partial to the white chocolate and hell, even the original Plain Jane is really delicious too. 

Fairytale Brownies ships all over the country to share some this holiday season with those you love most too!
