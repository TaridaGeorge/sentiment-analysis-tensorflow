I love foot massages they are always so relaxing and takes away all the stress. The people are nice here and it's a quite atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone that is looking to relax. Foot Massages are a Chinese thing but you gotta try it I mean it feels so good after that and it makes you feel like your walking on air.
