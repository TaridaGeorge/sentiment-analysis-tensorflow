This place is by far way superior for their Bun Bo Hue than anywhere in the USA.  I have traveled all over the world (including Little Saigon in Westminister) and this place is still by far THE BEST (I have eaten at thousands of restaurants all over the world).  Can't say the same for their Pho (Da Vang and Phu Thanh has better Pho in my opinion in PHX).  It has been over there for 10 years now and it has endured the test of time.  No one that I know have complained about the quality of food there that I know of and I know Asian clients are the most difficult to please.  Lightening fast service no matter how busy they are.
