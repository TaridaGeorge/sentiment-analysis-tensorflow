I LOVE LOVE LOVE their pizza! For me it's all about their cheese...like nothing I've ever had. The sauce is just perfect, they dont overdo it. They are always super friendly when my husband and I stop by. They practically know us by now bc we stop by here so often, whether its picking up a whole pizza or grabbing a slice onthego. Their wings are a bit small but delicious. They pack on the buffalo sauce so they are all messy! Mmmm...finger lickin good!
