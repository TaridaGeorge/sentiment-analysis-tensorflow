The best authentic Chinese restaurant I have ever been to.  My wife and I went there thinking we could get some Dim Sum but when we got there they weren't serving it at that time.  We decided to try this place none the less.  

The menu was massive and had at least 100 different entrees.  Some of them familiar favorites such as General Tso's Chicken and other more traditional Chinese dishes such as shark fin soup.  You can tell this place is authentic by the atmosphere and the outstanding service that you receive from the staff.  

Be ready to eat is a piece of advice I would give to anyone thinking of going to China King because the portion sizes were very filling.  For true authentic Chinese food you need to go to the China King.
