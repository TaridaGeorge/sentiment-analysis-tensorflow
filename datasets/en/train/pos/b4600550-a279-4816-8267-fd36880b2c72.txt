Sorry, I can't help still calling this Coffee Talk, but no matter; everything but the name is the same. Coffee Talk, ahem, I mean The Bungalow is a funky arts-and-crafts inspired coffeehouse. Try the Green Tea smoothie or a cinnamon and pepper-spiced Mexican Hot Cocoa. Mmm!

I love this little gem, and really have nothing else to add to Mike W.'s exquisite review, except Amen Brutha!
