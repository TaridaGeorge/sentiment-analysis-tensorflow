I heart Sabas... seriously, they have the best gyros and lemon soup around. Everyone that I have brought here has loved it (with the exception of my dad, mr. meat and potatos). It's very casual, but I like it because it's authentic. Plus, I like to sit with the "view of the Mediterranean".. you'll know what I mean if you've been there.
