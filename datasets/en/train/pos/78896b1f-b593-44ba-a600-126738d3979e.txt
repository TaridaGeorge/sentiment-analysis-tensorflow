check mic, one-two..I am one mo fo' that loves her pho and this place is da bomb jus' so ya kno and the prices are super low! ( ya like that ish huh?!)

but for real there is nothing like a wonderful bowl of pho and this place has it. Wonderful soup with all the extra normal trimmings and its always more than i can eat in one sitting(leftovers are my lunch today ..hurry up 1pm!!)

Staff is friendly and service is quick. Also have tried the egg rolls which are very good and the b/f who is a short rib enthusiast says this place has the best ones he has yet to come across. so from pho to even mo'  Pho Van is spot on!
