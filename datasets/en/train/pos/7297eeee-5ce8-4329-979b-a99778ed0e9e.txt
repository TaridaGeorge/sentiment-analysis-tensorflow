I read some of review - I don't know what these people are from. Maybe Scottsdale. I like a hole in the wall place - they have awesome little fast food dishes that don't taste like fast food. it is way better than Kyoto Bowl. 

I love their sushi especially one that tastes like kimbap. try their pork bulgogi if you like spicy food. Obento is awesome too - I love their katsu (deep fried breaded pork). In this economy, I cannot afford scottsdale restaurant and I hate waiting. I stop by this place at least twice a month.
