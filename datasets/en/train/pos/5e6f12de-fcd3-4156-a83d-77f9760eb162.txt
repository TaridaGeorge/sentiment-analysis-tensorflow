My boyfriend and I were a littler nervous about finding good fresh seafood in Arizona.  We were extremely surprised with Wildfish.  The service was amazing to start off with.  But their food and menu was fantastic.  Everything that our party of 6 ordered was exactly what we ordered, how we asked for it, and tasty.  I would recommend this place for anyone looking for fresh fish in Arizona!
