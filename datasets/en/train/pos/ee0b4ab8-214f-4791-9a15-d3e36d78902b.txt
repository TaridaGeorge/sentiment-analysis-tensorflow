Seeking a sour on tap?  Me too!  And Taste of Tops is one of the only places I can find a sour on draft in this IPA-soaked land.  They have 24 rotating taps, always with great variety and top-notch beers -- and they are pretty good about updating their website with what's currently on tap, and chances are if what you want isn't on tap you can probably find it in a cold bottle.  Bartenders are friendly, helpful, and most importantly knowledgeable about beer.  Love this place!
