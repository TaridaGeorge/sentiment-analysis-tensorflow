This was the best espresso I've ever had in Phoenix.  It was sweet, not bitter, full of flavor and had a great aftertaste.  The beans were roasted lightly, just like I like my coffee.  Staff was friendly and accommodating.

My only complaint is that the music being played wasn't a style I like.  So what?  I'm here for the coffee.
