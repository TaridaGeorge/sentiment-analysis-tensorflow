Ooooooooooooo I so love it here. Wednesday night DJ was frickin awesome. The place kind of breaths sex. It has bleachers! Devil art on the wall. Super sweet green and red lasers. It's kinda goth, kinda sorta a little gay. Sure it's not everyones cup of tea. But I thought it original with a good vibe, good music, good decorations, great sound system, clean, and just the right amount of weird to make it absolutely fantastic.
