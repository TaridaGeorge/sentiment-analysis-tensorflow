Lees Sandwiches is one of my favorite places for lunch.   If you try it, be sure to get the BBQ Pork sandwich, and not one of the American sandwiches on the right hand side of the menu.   It's super cheap, fills you up, and is the strangest most wonderful flavor combination.  It's a huge baguette with pickled veges and meat, which tastes waay better than it sounds.  I think my brother said it's French-Vietnamese cuisine, which is a really interesting combo.   Also their spring rolls are light and awesome.

They also have a bunch of bizarre shakes, which are fun to try.  The  Avacado Shake is particularly good.
