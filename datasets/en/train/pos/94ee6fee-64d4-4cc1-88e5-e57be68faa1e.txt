Trying this place for the first time before I head into work... The Buffalo SmashChicken with Fried Pickles on the side. And of course a Kilt Lifter in a frozen MUG. Please Thank You.

The little wire trays my meal come in reminds me of a cleaner version of the way Corban's serves their burgers (minus the reused white napkin - I don't know about you but it is odd to me)

They have a sad little tip jar by the register that has tennis in it. The wait staff is cute. So tip the boys...
