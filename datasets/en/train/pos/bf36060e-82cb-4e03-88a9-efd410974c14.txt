So, this Phoenix institution is not gonna win any awards for its food.  There are a whole lotta other reasons why we go here.  It feels like your grandma's place and my kids love it.  I've been going there for nearly 40 years.  The food is dependable and tasty and the cost is very reasonable.  Know that you are always going to wait in the lobby, even if there are several table available.  It's a good tactic.
