This is my favorite "hero" place of all time.  Some like Subway's better, but the combination of bread, with their trademark sweet peppers make this the place for me.  Try their Blimpie Best or Blimpie Super if you like cold cut subs, but their hot subs are just as good...  I go here at least twice a month for lunch...
