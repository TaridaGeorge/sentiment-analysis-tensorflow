Reference Robert R.'s review for my full evening at Tuck Shop.

However, I just wanted to add antoher 5 star review under their belt as I, too, was detered by the unfavorable review left here and thought it was unfair.

If you're not filled up by the mac & cheese and a starter, you may have several stomachs you don't know about. I left STUFFED.
