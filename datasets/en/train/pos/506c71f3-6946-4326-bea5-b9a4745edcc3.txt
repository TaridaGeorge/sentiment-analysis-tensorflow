If you go anywhere for breakfast (or lunch) in Scottsdale, go here!!!

Our experience at Arcadia Farms was just wonderful: food, service, ambiance.  It was like we were eating NY brunch from Alice Water's garden, but didn't pay a lot for it.  My omelet was scrumptious, with yummy potatoes and eggs.  My friend had to guard her sandwich because it looked and smelled so yummy.  The wait staff was very helpful and attentive (even helping us find a few places for after our meal).  We had a wonderful meal there - thank you!

P.S. Not sure if they do this, but the outdoor area in the back looks perfect for a rehearsal dinner or a bridal/baby shower...
