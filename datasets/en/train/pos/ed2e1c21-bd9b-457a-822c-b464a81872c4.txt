Location was in front of Sleepy Dog Brewery and Saloon in Tempe, I had three different items from their menu.  A lumpia combo, Balut, and Lechon kawalki.(they add things to their menu sometimes)  Everything was awesome, the lumpia was fantastic, the lechon was so good after letting a buddy try some, he went and got his own.  It was a treat to find Balut as well.  I asked if they were serious and they were.. so I got one and it was good. If the Hey Joe truck is near by, I highly suggest you go and try a few things off their menu!
