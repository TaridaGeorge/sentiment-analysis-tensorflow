CHARLIES TACO STAND!!!!!

Charlies is one of the original Gay Bars in Phx. It is a great place to dance and hang with friends, great drink prices and they have a fun after hours. 

What I really love about Charlies is the taco stand outside. They are so addicting and will keep you coming back for more. Amazing prices on the food, great flavor on the tacos, burritos, quesadillas etc. They have great horchata too! The people that work the stand are the sweetest people. The guy in the trailer that chops the asada is a real cutie! I just go to Charlies sometimes just for the tacos. They are open really late and if you are out in down or midtown Phoenix I demand you to check them out.
