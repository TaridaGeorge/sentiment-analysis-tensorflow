What a great gift idea ... a basket full of products made in Arizona! I purchased a gift basket for a friend yesterday and it was delivered today. Actually, hand delivered by the owner. Now that's great service (granted my friend lives in the same area)! My friend called me right away to say how much she loved all the goodies. I'm sure I'll be purchasing more from ZonieBaskets.
