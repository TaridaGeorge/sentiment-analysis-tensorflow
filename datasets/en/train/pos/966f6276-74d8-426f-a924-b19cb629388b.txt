Le Chalet is most excellent.  Crepes of every possible species, good drinks, and a casual atmosphere.  With a Matterhorn in the bar

Or my favorite...Take a mace (you know that spiked ball think that knights in shining armor beat each other with) heat it up, and stick tenderloin onto the spikes, hanging over a bed of rice.  Sweet Jesus, the promised land has arrived!  

Or the raclette... Add fire to heat it until melting, slice off some gooey goodness onto a plate, add charcuterie, and you're in cheesy nirvana.

It's a beautiful thing
