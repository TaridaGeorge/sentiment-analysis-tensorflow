You haven't been to Haji's?  

What's wrong with you!   Don't look at the menu,  just get the Gyros DLX and whatever you feel like drinking.     Look at the negative reviews here, notice a trend?   They didn't get the Gyros DLX.     Yeah.  

This place gets 0 stars for the chicken shawerma (eh, shawerma sucks anywhere),  3 stars for whatever else,  and 84 stars for their gyros.
