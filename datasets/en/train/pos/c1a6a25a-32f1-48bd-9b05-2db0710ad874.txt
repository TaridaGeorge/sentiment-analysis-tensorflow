This is such an amazing park in Scottsdale, especially considering it's city ran. My little train fanatics loved it because there were, "choo-choo" signals, a tunnel and a cool Western themed park to play at after. The price was right; I spent $9 for myself and my family to ride the train and the carousel (my 2 year old was free).  We spent about 2 hours there, would have been more if the weather was nicer.  

This park also has a little general store where we picked up some ice cream cones and Icee's after our ride.  Beware of the Thomas section though!! :)
