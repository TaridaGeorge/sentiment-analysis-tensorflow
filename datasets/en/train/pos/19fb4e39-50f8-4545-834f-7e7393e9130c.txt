This place puts out some darn tasty grub at an affordable price, with a hip crowd and daily drink specials.

I've only been for lunch (2 or 3 times), but each meal has exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely recommend the bruschetta, where you get to pick 4 out of at least 9 different toppings, which all come on toasted bread.  If I recall, the tomato jam and sheep's milk was my favorite, but I also enjoyed the apple, fig and brie, as well as the roasted red pepper and goat cheese.  My wife had the tuna sandwich and salad, and even with just a half sandwich, I still had to help her finish it...bummer.

Be prepared to valet your car, as both locations have limited parking, but you definitely feel like a celebrity dining at Postinos!
