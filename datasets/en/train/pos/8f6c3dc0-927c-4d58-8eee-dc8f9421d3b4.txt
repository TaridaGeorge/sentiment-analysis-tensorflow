It was girls' lunch out day and we went to Royal Jasmine Thai.  There was a nice lunch menu for choices besides the regular menu.  The place is very clean.  We had a coupon for a free appetizer which was brought out prompty.  We also ordered an app of satay chicken.  It was delicious!  Our meals came with a cup of soup, egg roll, fried wonton, rice, and Everything was delicious.  We did question the potatoes in one of the meals that didn't seem to belong.  They don't have a soda fountain, but canned sodas.
I am looking forward to a return meal there!!!
