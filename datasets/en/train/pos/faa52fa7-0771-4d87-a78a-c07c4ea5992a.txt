I have had the pleasure of dining here on more than one occasion, every time I'm in Scottsdale, we find an elaborate excuse to come here... Oh, it's my birthday next month, or Oh we all haven't seen each other.

If you haven't been here - brace yourself for a great meal - always something new to try on the menu - the owners are AMAZING, and will even pour your wine into your mouth from their 3 foot long decanter (not on the menu)

Go here immediately!
