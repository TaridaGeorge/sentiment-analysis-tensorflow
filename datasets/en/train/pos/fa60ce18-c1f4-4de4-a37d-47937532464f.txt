They made the PERFECT ice cream cake for my daughter's birthday party.  For weeks she said she wanted a strawberry cake, with pooh and tigger and rainbows.... and that is exactly what she got!  She was thrilled, and everyone at the party said it was probably the best strawberry ice cream they had ever had.
