A Salvadorean friend recommended this place to us when she found out that we love papusas. I got  a massive plate of those crispy, delicious goodies and an even more massive cup of horchata, which could have been a meal in itself. Our server was super-friendly and patient--it took us forever to decide. We left stuffed and satisfied.
