This is as good as Thai food gets.  I haven't been to the other Thai Basil locations because the wife and I are just a hop, skip, and a jump away from this one. If we ever eat at other Thai restaurants she gets the pad thai thinking she'll get what Thai Basil gives her.  She is always disappointed.  There is no other pad thai outside of Thailand this good.  For me, I'm a massaman guy.  So good, it will make your head tingle!
