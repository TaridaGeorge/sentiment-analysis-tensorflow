A hidden treasure! It's decorated super cute and has a very comforting aura to it, from the cucumber water to the live music playing on the TV. The rooms are very nice, the products have wonderful smells and my aesthetician, Amanda, was very knowledgeable and gave a great facial. She listened to my needs, customized my facial, and made non-pushy recommendations of products to purchase. Great place!
