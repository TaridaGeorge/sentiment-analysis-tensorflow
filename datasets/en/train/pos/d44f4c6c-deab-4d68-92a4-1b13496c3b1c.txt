I am not huge on frozen desserts, but our family was out for the night and wanted a treat. I remembered seeing this little gem while at Safeway, so we headed down to see what it was about. 

We were in for a treat. The selection was stellar and each of us thoroughly enjoyed our dessert. Not a drop was left in a dish. I also like that it is connected with the coffee shop. 

We will definitely head back here on our next dessert outing.
