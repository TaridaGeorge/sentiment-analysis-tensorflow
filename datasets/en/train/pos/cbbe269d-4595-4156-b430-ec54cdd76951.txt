Nice small place with great service. I'm from the south and as a kid in a poor family Jowl Bacon was the best we could afford. I remember Mom cooking with it and the exceptional flavors from this little known fair. The meat shop is the only place in Phoenix that I found Jowl Bacon. The memories I've cooked up in the last month have been great. Thanks folks!!
