I had Lowell repair a few amps that died over the years. He gave an initial assessment and quick turnaround on my amps; a solid state and few tube amps. Very reasonable pricing, honesty(he doesn't try to add additional parts to the bill), and his love for his craft makes him my go to guy for all my amps(and pedals)!
