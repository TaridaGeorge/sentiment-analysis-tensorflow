I went looking for a kolache and discovered the kolaczki.... a little flakey pastry filled with fruit or cream cheese and dusted with powdered sugar. :-)

There were a LOT of pastries to choose from as well as a few aisles of Polish grocery items. I purchased a few kolaczkis and a few mini strudels. I'll be back to try more. It's a good thing they are not close or I'd try something new every day!
