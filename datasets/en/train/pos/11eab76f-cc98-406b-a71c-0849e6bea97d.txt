I live in California and I am a fairly new "Fro-yo" fan (I used to be all about Gelato). I recently visited the Yogurtini store in Tempe while visiting friends and it is BY FAR the best I've ever had. Their flavors are so creative and fun with so much to choose from- I could have stayed there all day!  My favorite is eggnoggin - maybe it's the holidays...but as a Celiac, I appreciate that they also specify which flavors contain gluten. Yogurtini, pleeeeease come to Southern California. I promise to be your best customer!
