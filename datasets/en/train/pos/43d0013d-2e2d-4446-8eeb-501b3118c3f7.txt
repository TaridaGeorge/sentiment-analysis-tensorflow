This is my favorite Asian grocery store and fish market in Phoenix. I come here and pick out my fish then do the rest of my shopping while they fillet them. They have a very good selection of fresh produce and various Asian specialty items.  This is definitely the place for lobster, you can get live Maine lobster here this week for under $10 a pound regardless of the size you want and they generally have them from just over a pound to about 5 pounds in stock. They also have live crabs, clams, shrimp, geoduck, and some live fish.
