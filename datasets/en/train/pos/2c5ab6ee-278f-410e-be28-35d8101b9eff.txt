Dr. Longwill and his staff are top notch. I have never felt more comfortable at a dentist's office than I do here. They are very friendly and are sure to explain everything thoroughly. I live about 45 minutes from the office and I don't mind the drive, they are worth it! Sarah at the front desk always brightens my day and that is saying something when one finds themselves at a dentist's office!
