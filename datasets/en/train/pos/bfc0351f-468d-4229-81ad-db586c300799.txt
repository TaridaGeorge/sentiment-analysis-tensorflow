All I can say is, "wow." 5 star food, 6 star location/scenery, just an incredible dining experience for a crisp, Sunday morning. Yes you have to get your own water/coffee and yes the service is a bit inconsistent. If you can't get past that, then I recommend Denny's. They're all over the place. If you can dig a relaxed pace in a very serene, almost bucolic setting in the middle of the desert with the best monte cristo I've ever had, then head over to Morning Glory. Can't wait to try the dinner restaurant.
