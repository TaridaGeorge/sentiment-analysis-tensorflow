I've been to a lot of cigar bars and this is my favorite by far.  Excellent place to have a smoke and spin some yarn.  Michael Jay, and Pete always have something to talk about.  Next door to an OTB if you want to have a smoke while you watch the ponies run as well.  

Great selection of Padron 1926 and 1964 which is tough to find sometimes.  His prices are not crazy and they have all the things you need to enjoy a good cigar. 

I would recommend this place to anyone.
