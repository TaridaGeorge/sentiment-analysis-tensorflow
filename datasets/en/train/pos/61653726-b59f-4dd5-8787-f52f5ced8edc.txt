This place does not need review number 100+ of course, but I had to put in my dollars worth which currently equals two cents post sub-prime debacle .I have eaten here many times, from solo to large group. My fave is the Wiseguy, followed closely by the verde, but I have sampled them all.

You have to give it up to a guy who is willing to go the extra mile to share his passion. Passion is what it is all about. I challenge any of the detractors to make your own dough and cheese, grow your own herbs, buy local when possible and stand in front of a death hot oven night after night, personally prepping and baking these atypical discs of distinction. 

So tone down your hype meter and taste a slice of Phoenix blown a kiss by CB. Not New York or Chicago, but PHOENIX.
