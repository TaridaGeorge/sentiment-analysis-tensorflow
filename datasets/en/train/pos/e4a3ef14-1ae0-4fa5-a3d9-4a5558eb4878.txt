Finally! A place that has live music, delicious cocktails and people my age!! I had tried to go to the clubs in Scottsdale...damn, too much indie music, head banging stuff and young people jumping up and down (not called dancing)! Big mistake... I have been looking for a great place to go and drink, dance have a nibble or two and this place is it!! Have been back a few times and will keep going back just to be able to go to a nightclub that I can relate to. I am 50+ and still love a good time!
