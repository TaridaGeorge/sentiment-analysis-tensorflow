James & Carrie were lifesavers!  The store where I initially bought my dress went out of business so they were gracious enough to reroute the dress to their store in Scottsdale.  James and Carrie are kind, sincere, and genuine business owners who helped make sure my wedding dress was perfect.  I would recommend this store to any bride looking for a special wedding dress experience.
