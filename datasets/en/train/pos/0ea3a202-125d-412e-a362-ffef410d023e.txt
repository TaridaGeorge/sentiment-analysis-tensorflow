Every time I'm in Scottsdale for business (which is often), I absolutely MUST come here. This place is awesome! Food is delcious and great service.

I would definitely recommend the butterfish tataki and serrano chili roll. DELISH! Their sashimi is always fresh and served beautifully.

If you're not in the mood for sushi, then the black cod is my go-to robata grill item. As for side veggies, you cannot go wrong with the sweet corn!

Happy eating!
