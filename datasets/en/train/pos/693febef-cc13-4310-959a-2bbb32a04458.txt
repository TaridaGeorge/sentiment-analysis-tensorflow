Echo Canyon is a fun hike and the views are amazing.  I like to go at night because you get to see amazing sunsets from the summit plus there are less people on the trail compared to early mornings.  

This hike isn't for the weak by any means it's a tough hike but not insane by any means.  There are plenty of places to stop for breaks and just make sure you bring plenty of water as you will need it. 

If you've never been on this hike I say for sure try it out you will love it.  Just make sure you have some good shoes with you so you don't roll your ankles.
