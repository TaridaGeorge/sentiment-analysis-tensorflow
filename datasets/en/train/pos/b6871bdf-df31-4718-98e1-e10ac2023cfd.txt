An enormous juicy seasoned all meat patty stacked high garnished with the freshest tomato, lettuce and onion with optional bacon, cheese and  a hot pepper on a toasted bun. It is served with fresh cut french fries. You can also substitute with their famous green chili macaroni and cheese. It is such a hit item on the happy hour menu, that they added it to the main dining room menu.  The bar fills up so fast so early so you still have the option to order the burger in the dining room.  If you get a chance to sit at the bar you can try the homemade beef jerky while you wait.
