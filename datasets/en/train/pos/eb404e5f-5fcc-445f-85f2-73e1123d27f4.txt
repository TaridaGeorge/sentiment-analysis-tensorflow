Friday at 4:30 p.m. was a lovely happy hour.  October weather made sitting outdoors perfect.  Great service.  Wonderful food and specialty drinks.  Like that they serve, beer, wine and spirits.  Food menu covers all tastes.  Savory and delish.  Had goat cheese - wonderful, house-made bread with salty olive oil - so good!  French onion burger - awesome!  I didn't love the salad dressing as it was sweet to me - maybe the pear made it too sweet.  The rest of the salad was really fresh and tasty.  Def. going back.  Pretty decor.
