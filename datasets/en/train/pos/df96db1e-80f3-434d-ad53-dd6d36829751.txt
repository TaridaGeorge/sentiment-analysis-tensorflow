Oh, Haji-Baba, I love you.
The chicken shawarma plate is ridiculous.
The hummus? Perfection!
Your pita bread? Heaven!

My review, however, is based on take-out. I never eat at Haji-Baba. To me, HB is a place to grab a cheap, delicious lunch and take it back to the office to snack on throughout the day. The plates are so huge, they end up being all I eat all day. 
And my god, I could eat HB every.single.day!
