Updating my review. Five stars Bitches!

A coworker told me to go check out their $2.99 sandwiches. Whoa. These are the most amazing things EVER.

You walk up to the deli, grab a little slip of paper, fill it out, hand it to the nice guy, and he will make a sandwich that will rock the very foundation of your life. My personal favorite is turkey on multigrain bread, with all the veggies, avocado (a buck extra), light mustard, and sprouts (of course). 

This sandwich alone makes this store worthy of a five star review. Stop reading this review and drive your ass to this store. NOW.
