Being from Philadelphia, finding a good Italian Hoagie can be tough. This is the best I've found in the Phoenix area.

Finding the right bread is often difficult but they've done a good job here. The quality of meats and the service provided directly from the owner put this place as a must visit.

I usually have the Italian Hoagie but their cheese steaks and meatball subs are great as well.
