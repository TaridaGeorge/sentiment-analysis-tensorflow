The water here is really great, I've yet to find a place that has filters that get the water as good as here.

I really enjoy their boba, at first they weren't the best with the boba being not sweet and chewy enough but they have gotten better with it over the past few months and this has become my favorite place to go to.  I'd recommend the Honeydew (tastes very refreshing).

The last time I went there my wife decided to get an ice cream after I had gotten a boba and water, instead of running the credit card, the owner just said to pay him back next time.  We are there so often that I definitely plan on doing just that.
