By far and near as well, in'n'out has the best fast food burgers around. There burger sauce is especially goo on the fries and you can even ask for chili peppers! Not a fan of animal style because I like fresh onions, but animal style fries are a meal in itself. Go crazy with those carbs, otherwise make mine a double-double!
