What a fun store!  They have a wide variety of southwestern themed items for inside and outside the home.  I go about once a month to just browse because they frequently get new items.  The prices are reasonable and the owners and employees have always been very friendly and helpful.  

My husband likes the furniture in their space next door too.  They have household furniture that has a serious southwestern theme, and then they have fun stuff like a wooden bar or beer chest with the Corona logo on it.  Looks like something you'd find at a beachy bar in Mexico.  Wish we had lots of money to just go crazy in this place.
