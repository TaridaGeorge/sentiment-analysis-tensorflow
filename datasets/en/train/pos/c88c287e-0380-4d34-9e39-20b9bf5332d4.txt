I am a sushi lover and this place does it just right! 
Not only are they extremely affordable but the happy hour is phenomenal! From 4-6 and 8:30-close their sushi rolls are about 2 bucks and saki bombers (ichiban beer and warm saki) for only 5 bucks! 

The cherry on top is definitely their A+ customer service. They are always friendly whether you are dining in or just taking out. 

I recommend this place as the #1 Japanese restaurant in Phoenix!
