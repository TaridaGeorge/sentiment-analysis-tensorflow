After just returning to the Valley of the Sun from San Francisco, it was great to find a really fantastic, fresh, Vietnamese fusion option! They mean fusion, so don't expect $3 Pho, but be happy to find a smorgasbord of spring roll options, as well as a pho for every eater in your group. 

We'll be back soon for their fantastic happy hour deals!
