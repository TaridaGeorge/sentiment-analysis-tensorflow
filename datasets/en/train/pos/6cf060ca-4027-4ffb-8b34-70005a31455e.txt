We went to Bertha's Cafe today after reading such great reviews, and it did not disappoint! The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon, but our service was prompt and we got our food within 10 minutes. 

I got the famous Asparagus and Havarti panini with ham, my husband got the Salami, Pesto and Goat Cheese sandwich with the pesto pasta salad. I tell ya, these folks have pesto DOWN--it is absolutely delicious and we enjoyed our meals greatly, and had plenty lefty over to take home! I also enjoyed the Watermelon Lemonade as a nice, refreshing drink on the very hot day!

We got a Candy Bar Brownie to go and it was equally delicious when we shared it much later that evening--brownie, topped with a light peanut butter frosting, chocolate and caramel drizzles and peanuts halves. Yum! 
Thumbs up to Bertha's!
