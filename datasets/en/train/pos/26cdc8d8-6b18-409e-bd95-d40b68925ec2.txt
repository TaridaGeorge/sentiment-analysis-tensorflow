Great park! Me and my boyfriend came here to have a picnic. Of course I referred to Yelp before making any decision on which park I should go to and this park popped up. At first I was hesitant because there weren't a lot of photos but the reviews were good. I was pleasantly surprised and happy that I did end up coming. 

The park is huge! They have a skate park, a volleyball area, and baseball areas. They also have a good trail to ride bikes or go walking. You can even go fishing! And the major plus is that this park is really clean!

There are a lot of picnic areas and places to grill. So if you are looking for a family outing or just a relaxing day this is your place!
