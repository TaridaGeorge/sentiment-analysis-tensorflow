Just got back from a quick trip to LGO, tummy is full and happily satisfied :)

Three of us arrived around 6pm, had no problem finding a parking spot, lucky! And we were seated immediately after walked in(people started waiting for tables around 6:15ish) Here are the items we shared:
+ half a dozen of baked chicken wings for app. (baked and grilled with point reyes blue cheese) - the sauce (buffalo?) was a bit too sour...
+ A Mushroom Party - yummmmyyy! the mushrooms are so fresh!
+ Fallen Angel - always great :)
+ Three glasses of LGO ice tea - I love their ice tea with a slice of orange inside, yes, not lemon, but orange!!

Total $44.40 excluding tip. (and some leftover for tomorrow's lunch :). A bit pricy but totally worth it! And great and attentive service!
