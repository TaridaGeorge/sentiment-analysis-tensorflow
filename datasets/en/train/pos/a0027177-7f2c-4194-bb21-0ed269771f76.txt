Really good food. I mean, like, really good. Their broasted chicken is insane. Try the spicy version. So juicy and flavorful, it's perfect. Is the crowd old? Sure. Is it a little "Scottsdale Boys Club"-ish. Yes. None of this matters when you're stuffing your face full of chicken. Very good service, too.
