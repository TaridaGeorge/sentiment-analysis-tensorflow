We went here for dinner....had dined here before; however, this time, we were fortunate enough to have a Groupon. I would dine there without it any day of the week. We love the byob...since that allows us to have a reallllly good bottle of wine ($9 corking fee - nice) with an excellent meal. Highly recommend it...best meal I've had out...probably since Binkley's and that's saying something!
