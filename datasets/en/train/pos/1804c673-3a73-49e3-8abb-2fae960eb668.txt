From home-made bread with a wonderful pimento dip, to the fantastic spumoni, this was a dining bargain. Reasonably priced, huge portions (we had enough to take home for two additional meals. Split a Walnut & Pear salad--it's an entire meal in itself! Then come back for dessert. I particularly enjoyed the Salciccio Pasta, consisting of sausage, peppers and onions in a superb red sauce on a bed of linguini. mmmmmm 

Great pianist on Friday and Saturday evenings, and an impressive wine list as well. Great date or family restaurant!
