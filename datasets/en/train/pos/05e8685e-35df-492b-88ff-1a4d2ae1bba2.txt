Anyone claiming that Phoenix still has a 'lame music scene' needs to take the crack pipe out of their mouth. Whether you're coming in for a show or just for a night to chill at the lounge, this place kicks ass. 

The staff is friendly, drinks are relatively cheap and strong (try the Honey Badger), and the sound is excellent. Heard Das Racist here a few nights ago and was impressed. Sean Watson spins here, too. The Scottsdale scene is dead and heading West, especially since the completion of the light rail. Venues like this are the icing on the cake.
