we celebrated my birthday all weekend.  we made the trek to bobby q on sunday. I ordered the brisket sandwich with mac and cheese and let me tell you about that mac & cheese..it was amazing. Mr H went with the chicken and brisket and for his sides: beans and potato salad.  
The food is sinfully delicious! I will NOT be coming here as often as I would like... I found it too indulgent. it is definitely a treat and worth trying! I love those little donuts they give you at the end!
