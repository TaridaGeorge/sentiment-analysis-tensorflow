I'll give a carryout spot 1 star for doing at least these two things:
1. Being located directly on my current route
2. Serving edible food

This place passed those simple requirements and then blew my socks off, so they get the other four stars too.  

Chow Main was great and not too greasy or heavy. Pho soup was exactly what I expected and the fried green beans were a nice finishing touch. 

I'm looking forward to working my way through the rest of the menu, from what I've read you can't go wrong.
