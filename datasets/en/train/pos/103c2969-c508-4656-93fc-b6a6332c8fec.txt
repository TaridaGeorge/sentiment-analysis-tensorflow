This lovely gem has some of the best biscuits I have seen outside of the deep south.  Buttery, rich, fluffy amazing warm biscuits.  They have this house made raspberry preserves that will make you swoon!

I had Huevos Rancheros with scrambled eggs on top.  Three layers of crunch corn shells were smothered in creamy refried beans with fresh pico and sour cream. The whole dish was dreamy and I could not wait to have more.  

My dining partner ordered pancakes.  WHOA!  They were amazingly moist inside, like cake, but the outside was perfectly crisp.  They must use a really hot griddle - which is key in pancake making.  

The service is great, the decor is adorable.  The restaurant is small with a lovely outdoor dining area - which is heaven in the winter. 

I recommend trying this lovely place.
