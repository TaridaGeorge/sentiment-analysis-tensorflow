Wild Horse Pass is a great getaway from the city and their Aji Spa is a welcome, serene setting.   I've been here many times and found the staff, the design and layout, the pools, the locker rooms - all to be exceptional!   Make it a point to go when it is warm enough outside to enjoy the pool & jacuzzi and then order food from the Aji Cafe, and yes, they serve alcohol!
