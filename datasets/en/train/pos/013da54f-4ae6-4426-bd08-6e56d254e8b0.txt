Look no more, this is the best Korean food in Phoenix! Great $5 lunch specials with tons and tons of food. Everything is fresh and expectionally tastey! My husband is a big fan of Korean food, so we come here quite often. This place is always crowded...hmmm I wonder why? Probably because it is so darn good. If you have never tried Korean good, then you have to try this place. I highly recommend the beef bulgogi. Plus if you are a bubble tea fan, they have a buy one and get the other half off special. One last thing, if you come for lunch be prepared for a longer wait time since it gets pretty busy.
