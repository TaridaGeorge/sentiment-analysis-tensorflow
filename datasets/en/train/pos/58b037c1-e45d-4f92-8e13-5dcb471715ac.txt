Delicious cake!  We did the almond infusion with a strawberry compote in between the layers, so yummy.  Amy and Kevin were awesome to work with, and lots of fun. They were more than willing to work with all our crazy ideas for designs and toppers and keep a sense of humor throughout, I'd highly recommend them!
