Another update: Sanctum's only open 3 nights a week now. Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. The drink prices vary night by night. Still one of the best true nightclubs in Phoenix. Their Funktion-One sound system costs more than a 3-Series BMW and sounds better than any other club in this city.

I always read the reviews on here and laugh. Some people just do not get it! If you want to hear shit top 40 music, head 10 miles East and douche it up.
