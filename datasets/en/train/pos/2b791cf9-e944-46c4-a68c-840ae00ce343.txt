Xtreme Bean Rules. Any bank-become-coffee-shop is a place for me.. 

We started hitting up XB back in '03 because it is open 24 hours on the weekend ... not to mention they give you double the size that you would get at Starbucks for less. Also like the idea that it is not a giant chain coffee shop. 

Great selections of coffees, teas (loose leaf), bakery items, frozen/blended drinks and Italian soda's. We LOVE the Carmel Royales.

They have tons of space to play games, and they even have some games and books in one of the back rooms. They also frequently have live bands or musicians performing and FREE WI-FI that works really well.
