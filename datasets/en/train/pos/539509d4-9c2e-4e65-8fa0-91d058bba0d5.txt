Augie I have to disagree with you .I don't believe it's a ghetto bar.We have only a few ghetto people that come in there.The rest is like you or me,It's a fun place to go and you are safe there maybe 3 mishaps in 25 years.Ask me how I know because I worked there for many years.Yea you get to rowdy and the bartender will calm you down.It is very safe for women to come along,some one will walk them out if they are scared.The bathrooms are cold in the winter and burning up in the summer.The owner is very cool and funny,it is by most people referred to as the toliet.Please go and try it out,great juke box is great.You will feel very much at home.Try it out and tell them RW sent you. It's a dive you will love it.
