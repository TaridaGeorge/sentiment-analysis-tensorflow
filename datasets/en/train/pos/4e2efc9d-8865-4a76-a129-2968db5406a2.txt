If Hello Kitty and her Sanrio gang were life-size, they would hang out here. They would all shout "KAWAII!!!" with their nubby appendages sporting peace signs as they filled the pastel colored dreamland of the JuJu Berri store front. The frozen yogurt, including toppings, is only 37 cents an ounce. 

They would grab either a green or pink JuJu Berri frozen yogurt tub and fill it with as many flavors that suited their fancy; piling on an assortment of fresh fruit, candy toppings like graham cracker, gummi bears and chocolate chips and garnishing with sprinkles and a sauce. 

Even Badtz-Maru's saucy and annoyed character would find joy in the bottom of a JuJu Berri tub.
