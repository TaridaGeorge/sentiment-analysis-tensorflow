Some of the best veggi/vegan food around & def the best here in AZ. Are you unsure of what meat substitutes are or taste like?  Green really nails it...& their fake 'chicken' is seriously some of the best Ive had across the country ---- try the OG Poo Boy sandwich, a spicy buffalo 'chicken' sandwich on a sub roll (so delicious) or I usually get the Ranchero Salad Buffalo wing style instead of BBQ.  Seriously I cant go there without getting the Buffalo anything!  Check out their new location in Phoenix on 7th st ---- with their dessert cafe next door, 'Nami' you can get fantastic vegan pastries, Soynami's (vegan version of Dairy Queens blizzard), cupcakes, coffee & more!!! SO GREAT! +++
