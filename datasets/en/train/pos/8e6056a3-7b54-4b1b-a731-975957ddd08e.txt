Definitely the best Italian market in Phoenix! They have anything you'd want from italian themed non-food items to an amazing selection of pastas, sauces, meats, cheeses, pastries, and breads.  I was craving some good italian food and this place did not dissapoint.  Amazing selection and very nice people.
