Great neighborhood coffee shop.  This place serves great coffee and food that is inviting for any person...meaning, you don't have to be a hipster to sit and enjoy a cup at this place.  Also the prices are much cheaper than the Starbucks down the road, and are of a much higher quality.  Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a place to study or grab a quick coffee on the go.  The lattes are great!
