LOVE LOVE LOVE this office!  During my high-risk pregnancy I spent a lot of time at this office and in the hospital.  Both Dr. Hahn and Dr. Spieker were fantastic, very knowledgable and easy to talk to.  I trust them completly as they did everything to ensure both myself and my baby were well taken care of.   I have since seen Dr. Cyr for a quick appointment whom is very sweet.
