our group always stays @ the legacy golf course, so this gem is by far a spot we will hit time and time again!  i had the monte cristo, and i will always have the monte cristo...for some reason the farm reminds me of sonoma county, specifically my aunt letizia's house in sonoma.  the coffee, the mimosas, the biscuits, and ambience are quality!  can't wait to be back to the farm & morning glory!  we'll have to try one of the other restaurants there next time too!
