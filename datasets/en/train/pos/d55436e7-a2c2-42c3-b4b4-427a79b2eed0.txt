One of my buddies said that this is a popular hangout in Texas and mentioned about the Happy Hour deals, so we went to try it out while we were in Scottsdale. It certainly was a pretty big "wow" for me when we got our orders. 

It is a bit of a weird setting, as the restaurant is attached to the mall, but that's not really the point. The bar is semi-dark with a good number of people (took us awhile to find a table). The "Happy Hour Specials" was what got my attention.  We ordered a variety of appetizers from sweet & sour chicken, sushi, dumplings, and 1/2 priced margaritas! I absolutely LOVED this place! 

It's a great place to take a break after shopping. My regular margarita on the rocks probably did some good deed after an exhausting day of shopping.
