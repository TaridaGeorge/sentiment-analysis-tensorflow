Huge fan...this might be my favorite bar in Scottsdale.  Cheap drinks, generous pours, low-key vibe, plenty of heaters on the patio, pretty damn good live music and minimal douche-baggery.  They don't have a huge bourbon selection but they do know how to make a solid manhattan.  I always order mine up and appreciate they've always had chilled martini glasses.  Last Saturday, whoever was singing was covering songs and doing a better job than some of the original artists in my opinion, so that's cool.  Did I mention it's cheap?  Great bar.  The only thing that would make it better if it were next door to Petite Maison.
