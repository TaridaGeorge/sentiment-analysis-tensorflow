This place is as good as it gets.  Food, staff, owner and beer is amazing.  I'm here as often as I can.  If someone is reading this and has never been to this place, trust us here, this place is amazing.  I had a buddy in town from Los Angeles a few months ago and he's a food and beer snob...we walked into this place and as we sat down at the bar he commented "you know that it's nearly impossible for this place to meet the expectation you have set by running your mouth about it, right?".  Within 10 minutes, he looked at me and said "damn you, I get it, this is a f'ing great place".
