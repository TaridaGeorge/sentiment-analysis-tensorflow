Whatever you think about Pottery Barn, you have to admit, they have the darned cutest stuff for kids. Toddlers, little girls, little boys, big kids, 'tweens, and teenagers -- all could find the ultimate room-of-their-dreams here (And I know, 'cuz I've got one of each of them).

Not that I could actually AFFORD anything here...

But it's fun to go in and dream.
