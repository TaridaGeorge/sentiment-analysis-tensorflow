My husband and I hosted our wedding rehearsal dinner here in April 2011 and it was an awesome location! There was plenty of room for tables, chairs, catered food and 60+ guests. Parking and restrooms were easily accessible and everything was set up perfectly. We got tons of compliments on our event and I know it was due to the venue, not my planning skills :-)

This venue is sophisticated and fun and offers amazing views of Tempe - it's truly unique. If you're sick of having events at hotel ballrooms or typical venues, check out Studio 5C - it's a gem.
