This is hands down one of the best parks for young kids (in the country)!!  Anyone who didn't give this place five stars hasn't visited enough other parks to realize just how special this place is!  I only wish I had a park like this where I lived!  

This place has it all: multiple play areas (including a large playground good for ages 3 and up), a running train, carousel, snack bar, picnic space, public facilities and ample parking!  

This park is a kids dream and a great place to spend your afternoon!
