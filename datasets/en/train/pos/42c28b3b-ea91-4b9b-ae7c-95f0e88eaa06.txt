i love this place!! best tom kah gai (coconut milk soup) ever. EVER. i have tried plenty of thai places, and not a single one comes close to being as fantastic as malee's soup. i moved out of state recently and every time i visit, malee's is one of my first stops. i will cry if they ever go out of business.
