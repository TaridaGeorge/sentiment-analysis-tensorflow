You know.. I have driven by this place for years and have never stopped. Our little guy was hungry and I was pleasantly surprised! The chicken pesto was fresh anf tastey, the staff SUPER friendly. The eggplant sandwich had fresh baked bread and eggplant.....great stuff! I will never do bk or mcdonalds again in gila bend!
