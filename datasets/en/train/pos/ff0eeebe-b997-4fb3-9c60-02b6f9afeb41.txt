greatest place.  despite it being in a bit of a sketchy neighborhood- we saw two women walking in the parking lot with laundry baskets on their heads - i thought i was in a nat geo special!  - and it being really, really small and dark - i like it. 
amazing vegetarian options - in fact, i think they have most of their regular options in vegetarian form.  and great beer on tap.  you don't mind waiting a while since it does take a while to bake these when you have a good beer to drink.  
they even have the pastys raw so you can take them home and cook them there.  
i highly recommend this place.   now all i ask is that you open one near desert ridge!!
also..like i said, have some time to spare, since it does take a while for them to bake the food.
