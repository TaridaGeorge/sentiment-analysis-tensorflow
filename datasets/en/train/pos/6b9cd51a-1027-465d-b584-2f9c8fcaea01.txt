I've been to plenty of dumps in my day, but this place is the shit!
Used to be they'd make you unload in the actual landfill. 

Well not anymore.
Thanks to modern technology, there's a drive-thru warehouse you dump in. (I think they 'borrowed' the concept from Jack in the Box)

Anyway, you'll love this place. 
Simply bring a copy of your water bill, show them a picture ID, and your girlfriends belongings will be forever a mystery.

Note: It does have a bit of an odor, but it's not as bad as the porta potty at work....the one where my ex-girlfriend said I got these crabs from.
