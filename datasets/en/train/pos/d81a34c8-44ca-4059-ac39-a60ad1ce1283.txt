LOVE this place... found it on localdines.com for half off (still on there if you want it!). 
This is a lot like Postinos if anyone has been there: similar bruschetta thats amazing, salads, sandwiches, and sangria!
There Sangria is wonderful... a little sweet, but very tasty. Service is always awesome too!
My husband and I got our localdines gift certificate $15 for $30 worth of food and spent $33 after splitting an appetizer, entree, dessert and I had a glass of sangria and he had a glass of wine. GREAT prices! You simply can't get anything better for a dinner under $20, great service, and live music!
