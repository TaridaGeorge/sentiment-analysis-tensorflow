Ok, went and got the TSoynami blizzard... loved it!  It is made with soy so the ice cream has a little bit of a nutty flavor.  Went a safe route and got the cookies and cream made with Newman's Os.  It was delicious!  They have a whole menu (front and back) of blizzard flavors, and you can customize if you want.  Best of all, my 6 year old said it was better than Dairy Queen.  Yeah!!!
