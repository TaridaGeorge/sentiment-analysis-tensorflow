By far the best pizza I've had outside of Italy. Great thin crust pizza pies made fresh with great ingredients what more could you ask for. They have real coal brick ovens which give the pizza that nice char and flavor you can't get at other places. Of all the Grimaldi/Patsy Grimaldi's locations in Arizona I think I like this one in Old Town the best just because of the environment and the fact its in Old Town Scottsdale. If you want great pizza I highly recommend
