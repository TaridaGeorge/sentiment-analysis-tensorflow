A '94 Rocket myself, I heard a good buzz about this place from folks in the old 'hood.  I brought my two little burger critics with me as well (ages 10 and 12).  Lots of soda to choose from, great hamburgers, and delicious fries.  It beats the heck out of a chain burger place in quality and character.  I even ordered the "Rocket Burger" which is a ridiculous three-patty monstrosity on a 10-inch sub roll.  I was embarrassed in front of my kids because I couldn't even finish my fries.  Rocket Burger has the makings to be a classic joint, legendary if they can match Capin' Bills longevity!
