Great place! My laptop had what looked like a dying videocard. Took it to RedSeven, turned out it was overheating (too much dust in a fan). They ran all the tests and cleaned up the fans. The laptop's been running like new ever since.
I can't believe they (like other places) didn't try to convince me that I need to replace a few hundred dollars worth of parts. Better than that, they refused to charge me for the repairs, so I had to beg them to take at least some money!
