Nearly full restaurant on my visit.  Very polite service.  They take their heat seriously, as the mint chutney was a sold 7 on a scale of 1-10.  Saag and Chana Masala were flavorful and good portions.  Plain Naan is the winner on the bread menu, for price and taste.  Didn't care for the garlic naan so much.

Restaurant is tucked behind two other restaurants, a Lamp Pizza place and a Bistro.  Easy to miss.

Prices are steep but that's the norm for this area.  Entrees include "premium" rice.  

Dinner only.
