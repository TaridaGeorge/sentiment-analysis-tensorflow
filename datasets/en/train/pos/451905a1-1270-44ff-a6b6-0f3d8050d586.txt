Called to set the appointment and spoke to the owner who was very nice and gave a great description of her services and what I could expect to pay including letting me know what it would cost if the job went longer than anticipated.

At the end of my job the owner showed up personally to make sure I was satisfied. I had one small concern that I shared with her and she addressed it immediately and fixed the issue on the spot.

Very happy with the work and the concern the owner had to stop by and make sure everything was satisfactory. 

Will definitely use Mr. Handyman of the West Valley again.
