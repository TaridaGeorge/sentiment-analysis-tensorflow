Bungalow was great! I will probably start going a couple times a month. The service was great. Everyone was friendly. Atmosphere was super cute, mellow, and classy. Happy hour is great. $2 domestic beers. They also have a "skinny girl" menu with tasty items/drinks. Food was yummy. Everything was perfect :)
