I was so sad when my favorite leather flip flops broke! I had them in my car for about two months before I realized that right next to the new fresh & easy on 40th and Camelback was a shoe repair.  I went in the guy said "no problem I can fix this" and said it would be ready the next day. 
I came back the next day and not only were they fixed to perfection they were polished and beautiful and looked new. 
I will definitely be going back! 
Oh and did I mention it was all done for $14.95, pretty good.
