I was at first creeped out when the bell man said, "Welcome to SANCTUARY."  Just the way he said it made the place seem like it could become a nightmare, but it's a true paradise. Stunning room, beautiful landscape, door to door service with golf carts. Awesome!

When I entered the room, they already had a cheese plate to welcome me and the temperature was just right! I wish I was there now...SANCTUARY!
