MY FAVORITE LUNCH PLACE!!!!

Funny enough my dad introduced me to the beauty that is Essence.

I could eat there every day of the week. 

The Greek Caesar salad is SO good. Sometimes I get it with Chicken. 

One Friday, we got there early enough for breakfast before work. I had the breakfast sandwich  and potato cake. The brioche bread is heavenly. MY sister had the french toast. Also heavenly. The banana-caramel sauce...mmm mmm mmm.

There is nothing that I Have tried here that is NOT good.

I am very picky about my spanakopita and tzatziki sauce. Essence def ranks among my favorites. I scour their weekly specials and make my lunch plans for the week depending on if Essence has a meal with tzatziki!

If you work in Tempe- this is a MUST for lunch!
