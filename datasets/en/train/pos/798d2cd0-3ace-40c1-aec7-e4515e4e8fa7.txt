Where else can you see pouters, pet a wallaby and eat roasted corn? The Fair is the bomb, as it were. My dear love and I went one afternoon. The weather was glorious, the crowds were light, and there was plenty to see and do. We spent a little while in the Body exhibit which is a little to much for me but others certainly seemed to like learning about the body including my dear love. I love the fair and we had a good time.
