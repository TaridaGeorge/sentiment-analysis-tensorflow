I dream about Pane Bianco's rustic loaves. 

On a weekend trip to Arizona I stumbled upon this joint. I bought a loaf of bread and gobbled it down in minutes. The next day I returned for another loaf. I couldn't get enough.

The bread: perfectly salty, with a crunchy crust, and fluffy crumb. 

I am now hunting for a comparable loaf in my hometown, Los Angeles.
