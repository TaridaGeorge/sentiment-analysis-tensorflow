This buffet is really good!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  At first you will think,,,oh no,,,there is not a huge buffet  of choices here but they are going for quality instead of quantity!!!!!!!  Everything I tried was super delicious and fresh,,,you could tell it had been made that day.  They have wonderful fresh-tossed salads with quality ingredients like spinach and fresh mango,,also a fabulous fresh pea salad.  Chilled shrimp that had been properly deveined meticulously with plenty of cocktail sauce to serve yourself.  I had the best fall-off-the bone beef ribs and some wonderful fish that was tender and flaky.  Also tried a wonderful Italian wedding soup!  The dessert was wonderful too, we shared a  wedding-type white cake that was moist and had lots of yummy icing and they had fresh oriental almond cookies that were homemade and fantastic!!!  Also ice cream with toppings.  We will definitely be going back to this buffet!!!!!!!!!!!
