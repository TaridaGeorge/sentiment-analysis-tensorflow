Great park area!  It's always clean and very well kept. We celebrated my son first birthday at one of the pavilions and all the kids had a blast. I was lucky that someone cancelled, apparently the pavilions book months in advance.  
The play area is completely covered, which is a necessity once  it starts getting hot.
