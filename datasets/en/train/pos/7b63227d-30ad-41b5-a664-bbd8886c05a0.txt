Really great variety of touristy-souvenirs, went during spring training, they have a shirt press in the back-left corner and I got to choose the color, size and the lady who helped me was very personable and touched up a bunch of designs on my shirt to make it look even better. Every store is basically the same in old scottsdale, but this one was really neat and not overpriced
