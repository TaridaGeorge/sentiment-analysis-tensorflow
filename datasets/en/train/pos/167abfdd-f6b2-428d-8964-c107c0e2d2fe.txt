We love Chick Fil A. It recently opened in Casa Grande, AZ. The place is spotless, the food is consistently good - like all Chick Fil As. Lots of attention to quality here, and the employees are super! Give it a try when traveling along I-10 between Tucson and Phoenix. It's just off the freeway at the Florence exit.
