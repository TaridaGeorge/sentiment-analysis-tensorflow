My favorite big place to see a concert! Its a small venue that is still able to capture the big acts (The Killers, Smashing Pumpkins). I also agree that there is not really a bad seat in the house, and its always nice and cool inside - especially in the summer! Its also pretty cool for a comedy show  (Dave Chappelle), and the Blue Collar Comedy Tour was filmed there. Now downtown just needs some better nightlife to accompany the venues down there! Oh also, something better than $8 beers please.. come on!
