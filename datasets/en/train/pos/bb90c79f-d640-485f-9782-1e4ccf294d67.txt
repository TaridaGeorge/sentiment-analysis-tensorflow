Went back after a couple of years and still loved it. We have been going to Malee's for over 12 years and love it every time. Love the Pineapple shrimp, the Mango fish and actually everything on the menu is fab. Great service. Great ambiance! Very romantic cozy setting oe even if you are with your family its great!
