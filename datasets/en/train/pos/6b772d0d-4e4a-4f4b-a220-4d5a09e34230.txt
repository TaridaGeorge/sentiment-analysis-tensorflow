Very kind staff, I was instantly greeted upon entering. Good pricing on their coffee drinks. Free wi-fi and a very relaxing environment inside. 

chatty staff interact with all patrons. You folks in mesa are lucky to have a place with good coffee AND good service. I live in Seattle, and while we have good coffee, we don't always have good service. the food looks amazing! I will have to come here when I am actually hungry sometime.
