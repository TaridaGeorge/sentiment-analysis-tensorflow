My maid of honor planned my bridal shower here and oh my god was it good.

This place is absolutely beautiful. It looks like it should be in NYC or LA.

They gave us a private dining room, the food was fantastic, the drinks were even better (the Retail Therapy martini is literally to die for), and they even gave us all seperate checks w/ no trouble.

I cant wait for it to cool down so we can take advantage of their patio!
