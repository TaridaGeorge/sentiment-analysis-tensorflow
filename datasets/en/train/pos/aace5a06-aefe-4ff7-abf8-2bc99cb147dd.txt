This gym is clean!

Its open feeling and has windows everywhere.

The staff is very friendly and knows your name.

The machines are new and not out dated. If your new to the work out scene the trainers are super friendly and are willing to teach. Its not overly crowded and because of the higher price there aren't a bunch of creepy people lurking around.

The theatre room is amazing!
