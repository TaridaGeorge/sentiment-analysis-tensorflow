Yes, I hiked! 

And yes, it was awesome...in all respects of that word. 

The industrious and uber-fit Miss Gabi K and her super dog Minnie swept us to Camelback for a mid-morning hike. Beautiful weather. Stunning views.  A brisk, yet accessible hike. I was huffin' and puffin', but hey...I blame the altitude. Or, perhaps it's just that I am not in good shape? I side with the former!  ;) 

It is just beautiful, and was such a fun, cool way to workout, see the scenery and enjoy the sunshine. Yeah, I sound all gurgly and happy...blame it on some actual vitamin D via the big hot dot. Ha! Yes, sun. Amazing. 

Oh, and we saw the San Francisco Giants doing some cross training. HOT. 

Bring water, solid shoes for climbing and a camera. For sure. 

Thanks Gabi!
