I honestly don't know how these guys can afford to compete against The Internet and WalMart et al, but they do. Probably by having cool staff, an eclectic collection (for a store this size), and a few other goodies that appeal to music lovers. You don't have to be ideologically driven to enjoy this place, and I've happily killed plenty of time just browsing through things. Sometimes special events happen in store (although that's more true of the other location), so talk with staff to keep up on whats up. If you have old CDs or records lying around, drop by to look around a get a few bucks out of your visit.
