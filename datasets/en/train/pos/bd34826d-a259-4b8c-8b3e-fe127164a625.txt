Our car failed emissions three times. DOh!

Finally we determined that we needed a new catalytic converter. I called Mad Hatter at 12:10 on a Saturday. They said they close at one pm, but if we got there quick they could do what we needed. They gave us a price quote.

We arrived at 12:20. They installed a new catalytic converter, we paid the quoted amount. We left at 12:40. 

How's that for all done, no fuss no muss? 

We passed our emissions test with flying colors. 

GOLD. Honest, fast, wonderful service! We love this Mad Hatter location!
