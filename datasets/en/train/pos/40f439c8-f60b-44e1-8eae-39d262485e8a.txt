WOW what a treat.  Elements is a spectacular restaurant.  you really get a hollywood vibe here.  And the accessional celebrity will be seen there.  Scarlet Johansson has been spotted there.  The menu is outstanding.  the drinks are also so good served from the Jade Bar.  the views are worth the price alone but do not overshadow the excellent food.  this is a hot trendy slick place to enjoy a delicious meal in the Scottsdale area.
