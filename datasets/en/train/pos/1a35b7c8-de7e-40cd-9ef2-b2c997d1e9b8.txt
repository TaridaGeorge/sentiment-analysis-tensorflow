I love coming here I think it's one of the hidden genes of the city. There are great restaurants. But mostly I love the scenery . They have done a wonderful job of creating a tranquil environment. I consider this a great place to change and be alone and read , snap I grew photos  for fun, and even a good place to prolong a date. As you walk into this amazing courtyard there  is a fountain, a lot of lit trees, flowers, benches, and soft modern contemporary music playing in the background. Bring a date here and all the work of ambiance is done for you.
