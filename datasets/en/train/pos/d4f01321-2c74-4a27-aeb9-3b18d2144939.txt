Dr. Cunningham has been our pediatrician since my twins were born. She visited the NICU to check them every morning since they were only 3 lbs when they were born. They are now almost 6 and my other son is 4 and everyone is happy and healthy. We have seen all of the doctors and NPs and I highly recommend everyone in the office. They are always friendly and helpful and we can usually get in immediately if we have to. There is never a long wait and they take their time and are very thorough. I recommend this office to all of my friends. You will not be disappointed.
