This place was great! After months of research, I finally found this hotel and on top of that got a great deal on their website! There were 5 of us girls and we stayed in the 2 bed/2 bath suite for $120/night! There was a full kitchenette and a pull out couch in the living room. Also, they have a complimentary buffet breakfast until 9am. Their food selection was really good, too. They also have a pool and a mini market in their lobby to purchase snacks, beverages and even beer. This hotel is conveniently located just a couple of minutes from Westgate Mall. You won't be sorry if you stayed here!
