This is by far the best Micro Brewery in the valley.  I doubt I'll every find a better beer.  All of their brews are fantastic, you can't go wrong with the Four Peaks selection.  Last night, we had a pitcher of the RJA IPA, which was wonderful, but for any first timers, I highly recommend the Kilt Lifter. The food is also top notch.  I've never had anything on menu that I didn't enjoy.

I also enjoyed that it wasn't very crowded.  I went on Saturday night at 7:15, just as the ASU game was about to kick off.  The place had a good crowd, but it wasn't packed.

The Tempe location is probably better overall.  But this is a very close second (and the parking isn't as big of a pain).
