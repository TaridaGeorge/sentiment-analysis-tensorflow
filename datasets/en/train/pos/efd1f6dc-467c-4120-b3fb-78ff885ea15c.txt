My family and I love this place!!!  The food is so tasty!  I love soup in the winter and salad in the summer so I can come here year round.... My favorite soup is the potato cream cheese and the broccoli cheese and you just can't go wrong with the Mediterranean Salad.  Among my favorites of soups and salad I also have to say that I have all wonderful experiences with all the different foods I've tried there.  The BLT with Avocado and Cheese, The Ham Sandwich and the Raviolis!!!  Okay I'm hungry again.
