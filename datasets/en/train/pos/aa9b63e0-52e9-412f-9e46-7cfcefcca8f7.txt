Best air brush i had ever had! Going to Bronzeology is an experience itself....From the location to Brenna herself! I felt as tho I was in a Harry Potter movie.. She was creating magic with her wand! It went on dry.. No streaking, blotches or blemishes.I couldnt believe how naturally dark i got.. .Still its been 1 week and i look like im Bronzed....Brenna I love you!
