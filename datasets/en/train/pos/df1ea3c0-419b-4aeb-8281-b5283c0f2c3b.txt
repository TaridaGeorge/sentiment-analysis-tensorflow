Ok, so iv been a Starbucks junkie for years....until i discovered dutch bros! This location is my favorite, although they are all good. My favorite thing about dutch is you can order ANY blended drink sugar AND fat free. You cant do that with any frappes at starbucks. You cant beat their customer service either, all the employees and incredibly nice and upbeat, always greeted with a smile! I once ordered a blended double coc coffee and it was too frothy for my liking so i stopped at the location in tempe since i was going that way to order a new one..they exchanged my drink, apologized and sent me off with a new drink at no charge. added bonus is the stamp cards, so if your an avid coffee drinker like me, you'll be saving some money to. Quick drive-through for on the go.
