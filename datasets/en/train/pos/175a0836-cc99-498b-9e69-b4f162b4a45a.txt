This place is a close to pizza perfection as I can imagine.  It's better than anything I have had in the US.  There may have been a couple places in Italy that I liked better, but I don't get there very often.  The pizza at Bianco is so good that I was ready to build a wood-fired oven in my backyard to try to replicate the pizza goodness.  But even with the oven, I'm not sure I could recreate what Chris Bianco is doing in downtown Phoenix.

As if the food weren't good enough, the actual restaurant and neighboring bar just have a great feel to them.  Don't worry about the wait and make a whole evening out of the experience.  As far as I am concerned, Pizzeria Bianco is the single best thing in Phoenix.
