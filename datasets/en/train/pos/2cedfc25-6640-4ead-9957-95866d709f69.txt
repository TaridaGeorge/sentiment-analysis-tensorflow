Unbelievable! This is not just any ice cream... Sweet Republic is ice cream utopia! A friend took me here after dinner to celebrate my birthday. I had the Turtle Sundae with Salted Caramel Ice Cream and Salted Caramel Sauce. It was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I cannot wait to go back and try other things on the menu. I now have a serious Salted Caramel obsession because of this place!
