I have to admit this place is definitely one of the best Chinese restaurants I have eaten at in a long time. Cheap lunch special, tons of food..... can't get any better than that. I had the sweet and sour chicken and it was soooooo good. I barely put a dent in my plate because there was so much food. Definitely coming back.
