I had a great time here before BlackEyePea's concert with all the radio stands and bands/dj's performing, always a real lively atmosphere and before Superbowl was real fun too and before Kenny Chesney was fun also...I like how there is always stuff going on outside, events and promotional games, stands. Once a couple years ago on Christmas week they had snow, real snow and also about 10-15 christmas trees all decorated different, one was purple with all purple ornaments...they were all stunning.
