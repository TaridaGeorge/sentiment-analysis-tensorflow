Laissez les bon temps manger!

As a Southern transplant in California, I take what I can get for Cajun & Creole food.  Burl Ives & I made a point of stopping here on our trip to Phoenix.  The garden and interior felt like a combo of the French Quarter and the Blue Bayou at Disneyland.  It was pretty dark inside, which must be nice on hot sunny days.  I had crawfish etoufee, which was excellent, with dirty rice and fried crawfish.  The fried stuff wasn't so good but it was better dipped in etoufee sauce.  Burl Ives had fried catfish, also excellent.  

The food is a little heavy for lunch but the restaurant itself isn't quite nice enough for a date dinner, especially being wedged against the freeway in between discount hotels and a TGIF's.  I'd take the family.
