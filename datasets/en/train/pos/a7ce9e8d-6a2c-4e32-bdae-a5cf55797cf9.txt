My wife and I have been searching for the best Eggs Benedict in the valley when we found this little place of pure delight. If you ever wanted to travel the World and taste Bennies, save your money because the best from around the globe are right here! They have seven amazing variations on the menu, including, of course, the Traditional which will be the best you have ever had! The combination of fresh ingredients and their homemade Hollandaise Sauce, is just to die for!
Don't think that they stop at seven Bennies, no, always ask if they have a special! For example, the French Benedict is out of this World!
