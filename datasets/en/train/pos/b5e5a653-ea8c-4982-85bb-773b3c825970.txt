Sochu House serves the best Thai food I have had in a long time. To start we had the truffle edamame which was my main reason for going. I haven't seen this dish since vacationing in Hawaii and it was rediculously good.

For an entree I had this creamy coconut tofu dish which was savory and equally as tasty as the edamame. They have taken Thai to a new level with their Neo-Asian Fusion cooking.

We sat in the dining room, but I can't wait to go back to this place for Happy Hour. The lighting and decor in the bar area creates an extemely intimate and romantic setting for a date or chatting with friends.
