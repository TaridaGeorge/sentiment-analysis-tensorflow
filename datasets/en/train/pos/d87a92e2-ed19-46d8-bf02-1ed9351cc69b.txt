I am so happy I discovered this place.  My husband and I stayed here Dec. 25 to the 28th and found the suite to be very comfortable.  It had all the amenities one could wish for.  I love that it is located so close to shopping and restaurants.  The breakfast every morning was a wonderful perk.  My husband and I will definitely be back!
