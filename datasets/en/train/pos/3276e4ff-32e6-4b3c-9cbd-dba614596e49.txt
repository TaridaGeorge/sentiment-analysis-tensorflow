We went  here to see about having a band made to match my engagement ring.  After briefly looking at my ring they brought up some concerns they saw with it.  Then started asking more detailed questions about it.  If you look at a previous review of mine you will see more of the issues. 
Like others have said they are very friendly, no pressure to buy, and really seem to enjoy helping people find what is a good match for them.
We will only use them for our future purchases.
