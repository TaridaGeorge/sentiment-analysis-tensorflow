I've never considered myself a connoisseur of gelato. I've had it once or twice and never been bowled over. until i had Frost gelato. It's a heavenly flavor explosion in my mouth. I combined 2 flavors into a delicious mixture that tasted like creme brulee. But sampling all the other flavors was just as great! they have such a wide selection and deciding was really the toughest part. Their Bellini and strawberries and champagne sorbet was also to die for. They were creamy and rich, but contain no dairy! How do they do that?! I recommend trying a frost bite while you're there as well. A small dollop of gelato surrounded by chocolate. What could be better? I'm so excited the Frost is open in the Valley, i just wish they had more locations than just Gilbert. It's a far drive for me, but totally worth it!
