Awesome boutique! The selection is amazing...lots of jeans, tops, and dresses.  The styles range from casual to dressy and there are a variety of price points.  It's one of those stores where you really need to go through every rack, but it's fun because each item just gets better and better. Plus the store is organized very well, so it's not overwhelming as some other stores can be.  I loved how there were so many Diane Von Furstenburg dresses...I will most definitely be back for those! I was on a mission for party dresses today, and unfortunately didn't find any I was in love with at Twist. I did find a handful of other stuff I could have bought, but I restrained myself.  I will be stopping in Twist next time I am up at Fashion Square because the clothes and prices were right up my alley.
