Was so skeptical after reading all the reviews and I was ready to gnaw off my arm after waiting the requisite 2 hours for a table, but once we finally ate, it was all worth it. 

Fact is, I dare you to eat this pizza and then try to think of a pizza that you've had that was better. The crust was perfect, the ingredients were fresher than fresh, and for as long as you wait for a table, the food comes out surprisingly fast!  

The Margherita is good (I wish I had added mushrooms), the Rosa is GREAT!  The Biancoverde was also really good but probably my least fav of the three (that's like saying it was the ugliest supermodel on the runway). 

Only regret is that I didn't order more pizzas...
