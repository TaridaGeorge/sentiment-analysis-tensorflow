How have i not reviewed Tessios yet?!

We live in the neighborhood, so we frequently get sandwiches or a pie delivered. Some Tessios Faves: their white pie, a pie w/ italian sausage, their antipasta salad, and their ham and cheese sandwich (be sure to ask for italian dressing on the side). 

Theyre quick and reliable and oh so delicious.
