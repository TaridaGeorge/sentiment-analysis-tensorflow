Great food. Same owners as Bandara.

Spinach dip delicious and rich. Will make you full.

Veggie burger is delicious. What a pleasant surprise! Add some bacon and you'll be in heaven. 

Ribs are finger licking good.

Fries are super thin and fun to eat. Cole slaw is pretty good too.

If you get a tea, make sure you take out the tea bag after 2-3 min. They put too much tea in the pot, and by the time you drink your 3rd cup, it's bitter and over seeped.
