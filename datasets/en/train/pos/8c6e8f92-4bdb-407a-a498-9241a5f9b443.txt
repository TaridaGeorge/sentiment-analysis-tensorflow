We came here on the George & Dragon Toga Pub Crawl and Carly's was not only generous enough to extend happy hour to us, but they did so with a smile.

We had several drinks here in a great atmosphere.  We did not try the food on this particular trip, but we WILL be back based on the courteous service alone.

I heard several people discussing their amazing cheese plate, so that will be on my To Do List for sure.
