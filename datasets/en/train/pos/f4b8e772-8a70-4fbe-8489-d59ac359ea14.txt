This restaurant has wonderful pizza, but what is better is their cheese plates!  They have wonderful combinations of cheese (generous portions too) bread (fresh baked of course), honey, jam or chutney, fruit and nuts.  The wines are good and very reasonably priced.  Great atmosphere and service this is a place I often recommend to my friends!
