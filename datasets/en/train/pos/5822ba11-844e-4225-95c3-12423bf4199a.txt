Went back to Fez last night after taking a several week hiatus, and all I kept thinking over and over again was what the hell is wrong with me??  Why would I ever take a break from such a delicious and fabulous place?!

Went after the heartbreaking Suns loss, convinced that I could not be cheered up, and somehow Fez managed to do the trick.  Not sure whether it was one of the 5 reverse happy hour specials we ordered (chicken phyllo packets, bruschetta, 2 orders of fez fries, and lettuce wraps, what we were hungry!!) that did the trick, could've been the two-for-one drink specials after paying $9 for every beer at the game, or it may have been our fantastic waitress Sarah who snapped us out of it.

Either way, everything was spectacular and Fez just got bumped to a 5 star.
