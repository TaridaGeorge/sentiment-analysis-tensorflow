This is my favorite place to work at as of recently. I've always loved Paradise's menu, but there's something about the way this particular location is laid out that makes it my favorite. Get a California Turkey and the Fire Roasted Tomato soup (or the black bean vegetarian), take your laptop, get on the free wifi and get the booth with the outlet.
Unless I'm there. I swear, if I see you in my booth, there WILL be trouble.
