I have now visited Herb n' Flavors several times. I love supporting local businesses who have sustainable practices. This place uses local farms for their produce, safe from GMO's and pesticides. So, I was already a fan before I walked in! Everything I have tried has been delicious, and the owner is such a cool guy- always so friendly to the customers. The food always tastes so fresh, and full of flavor! They have a little something for everyone. I am a gluten free vegan and my husband has no dietary restrictions. We always both leave happy. I definitely recommend this place. I would like to see their business continue to grow and stick around for a long time! :)
