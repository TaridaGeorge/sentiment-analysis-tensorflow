My girlfriend & I met here for coffee today (2-3-12).  This place feels like home. The coffee was really good! The owner & her staff are lovely, sweet gals. My friend had breakfast, which looked & tasted great.  So I ordered a sandwich.  As we were enjoying our coffee, the owner brought us a 'sample' plate of several different salads.  What a smart idea.  They were all really tasty; so was my hummus wrap, by the way. We're coming back.  Did I mention that I loved this place?
