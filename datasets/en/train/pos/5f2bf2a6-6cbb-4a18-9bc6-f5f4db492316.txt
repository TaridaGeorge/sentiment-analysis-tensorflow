My father made his first trip to AZ a couple of weeks ago, so I jumped on the chance to visit the Desert Botanical Gardens. It was amazing!  I have never seen so many different cacti or desert wild flowers.  Everything was blooming and simply radiant.

The butterfly exhibit was definitely a favorite, not just because I am a girl, but because you were able to get so close.  MY PICTURES ARE AMAZING!  

If you are planning to make a trip, I would suggest going early.  Starting in May I believe they open at 7am, and I would try to be there at 7am.  This place is massive, and you're in the desert... so yeah.

I took well over 300 pictures in the few hours we were there.  I will try to post some pictures here, but if you're interested in seeing more hit me up.
