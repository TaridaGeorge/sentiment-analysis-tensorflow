This place is adorable, and the tables they have inside are filled almost every morning I stop in here. 

The bagels are the best I have had in the state of Arizona!

I used to frequent Kokibelli, however our office has recently moved and I needed to find a new bagel place.

It seems to be the only one in the area. 

They offer Breakfast sandwiches as well as Lunch Sandwiches..Pitas and salads as well..

The service is great!

Make sure to visit this place if you are in the area! 

It is well worth the stop!

I will be adding their menu as soon as our scanner is hooked up!
