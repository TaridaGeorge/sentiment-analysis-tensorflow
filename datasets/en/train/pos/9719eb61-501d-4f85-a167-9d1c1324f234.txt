The Staff is All-Star... they ROCK! Jac, who is the greatest groomer I know, is why I came to White Tanks; to follow her. I will not trust anyone else with my furbaby for his grooming. I stay and bring him for other visits because of the rest of the staff. I'm sorry I don't know everyone's name yet...but I've had the sweetest people assist me. Kendra's sweet, joyful voice starts the visit off and always smiling as soon as Frank comes through the door. They do what they can to get him in...even when I wait until the last minute to schedule him:-)! Dr Nichole was so kind and gentle for his first vaccines with her and put me at ease during the vist. I highly recommend White Tanks Animal Hospital! Go Team!!!!
