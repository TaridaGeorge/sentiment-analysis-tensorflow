This vegan place is two things - simply delicious and totally casual.  They also rigidly adhere to their stated closing times - so you need to get there well before.

We  eat there at least once a month and with all the guests we've brought and our wanderings around the menu can state nothing is bad.  Of course you'll develop your own favorites.
