This is the greatest watch repair shop I have ever been to in my entire life. Have had the same Rolex watch since high school. The watch and I have been to repair shops in Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta. When I arrived at the shop, it was closed. They weren't open that day. However, the owner was there and so he agreed to look at my watches. Already, a great customer service experience. He fixed a digital watch, had me set it, and before I could even finish he was done with the clasp on my Rolex. There was no charge on the Rolex. Really? It's my favorite watch; I would have paid anything. This guy is fast, honest, and affordable.
