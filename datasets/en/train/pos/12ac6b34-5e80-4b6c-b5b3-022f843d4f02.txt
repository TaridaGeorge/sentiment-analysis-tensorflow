Paletas Betty sells fantastic paletas (ice cream bars) that are completely homemade, and delicious. I tried their fresa con crema and it was delightful. Full of strawberries and perfectly sweetened, it was extremely tasty. 

They change their menu frequently, and that's a bit of a concern since there are already about 9 flavors I'm dying to try. Friendly, $2.75 a pop, and each one includes a sticker, which is fun.

I dig that these are light and made with sugar and real fruit and spices and stuff, so they don't taste artificial or syrupy or anything like that. They're a good size for a snack, but that's not to say it's going to become a healthy habit for me to munch through a few of these every week, especially considering they're a stone's throw from my office...
