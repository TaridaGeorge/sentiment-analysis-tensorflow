Why review a gas station, you say?? If you have to ask yourself this question, you have clearly never experienced the pure bliss of the QT. I purchased my truck to 2005, and it has never had a tank of anything by QT gas in it unless I'm out of town. Prices run a couple cents cheaper than the other guys, and you get the added benefit of being able to partake of the beverage selection, which puts all other convenience stores to shame.

There are few days of my life when I can't be found with a QT fountain cup in hand. Add to that the fact that the QT doesn't take on the faint odor of vagrancy that tends to plague other stores in Phoenix *cough* Circle K *cough*, and you have yourself a winner. QT 4 Life!
