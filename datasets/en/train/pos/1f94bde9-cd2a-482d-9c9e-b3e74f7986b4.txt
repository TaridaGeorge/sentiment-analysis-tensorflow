I could not be happier with my stay here. 
They really did go above and beyond to make our stay for a bachelorette party memorable, they even sent a bottle of complimentary champagne to our room :)
We had a cabana at the pool during the day which we really enjoyed. We got moved around a few times and everyone working seemed a little bit confused but once we got settled it- it was awesome!
We went back to the bar by the pool before going out for the night and we were served by Bethanie. She was the best!
I would definitely recommend this as a place to stay and i will be staying here again!
