This is the best burger in Phoenix.

No frills, just a great, great open-flame char-broiled burger.  A double cheese, that's what they call 1/2 pounder, with fries and a large drink was a shade under $7.  This burger is better than Smashed, Freddies, even Zin.  This is just a great cheeseburger.

Seriously.  GO THERE NOW!  CLOSED SUNDAYS.  BUT GO THERE NOW!
