I visit Laveen Nail and Day Spa several times a month, everyone knows me by name, they remember my picky requirements for my pedicure and my nails, they always treat me like I am the most important customer.  I highly recommend that you sign up for the e-mail specials, the savings pay for themselves!  

I have tried all the salon's in the Laveen area and I will tell you that Andy and his staff knock it out of the ball park for me every time!
