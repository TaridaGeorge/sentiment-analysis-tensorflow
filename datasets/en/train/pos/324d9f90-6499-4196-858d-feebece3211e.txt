When it comes to any repair shop, we have all heard or had horror stories.  This place was great.  I had 3 tires replaced and asked them to check my brakes as they were squeeling a bit.  I had previously called several other places for tire quotes, and they came in at the best price.

What really impressed me was that they said I did not need new brakes yet!  I complained about the squeeling, and was sure I needed replacement.  I was told the pads still had 40% on them and could hold off for a while.  The squeeling was just from brake dust most likely from cheaper pads.

My wait time was estimated at about 30 min, and it was more like 50, but anyone that honest is hard to find, and must be recommended.
