Just one word to describe my first experience at Shimogamo (note I said my first as I will return for an encore) AWESOME! The sashimi was fresh. The unagi was delicious and the cut rolls were heavenly. 

Tightwads beware...this place is pricey but oh so worth it. I normally spend about $60 for two on sushi. This place hit us for $96 bucks and that includes only two small bottles of Kirin...
