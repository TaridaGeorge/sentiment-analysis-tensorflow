Ordered the Red Velvet to take to a party and it was perfect. Moist, delicious, balanced out exquisitely by the cream cheese frosting, everything a red velvet cake should be. They have other tempting flavors but those will have to wait for another day. Dangerous that they have mini ones, it'll be way too easy to talk myself into those when I have a craving!
