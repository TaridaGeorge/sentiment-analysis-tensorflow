I went there with a problem in my back that was preventing me from being able to run.  I was skeptical at first after hearing several bad PT experiences from other runners.  I was very impressed with Foothills.  From the pleasant front desk staff, to the knowledgeable therapists and assistants everything there has been top flight.  I am still rehabbing my back and hip (the real source of my pain) but I am finally able to run again after 10 months of inability to train and have even signed up with their marathon training program after training for my last 5 marathons by myself. 
In summary, if you are having structural problems and need therapy you cant go wrong with Foothills.
