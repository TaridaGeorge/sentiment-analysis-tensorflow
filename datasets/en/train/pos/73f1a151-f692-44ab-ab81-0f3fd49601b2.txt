8:45 Saturday morning and they are lined up outside and filling the inside bench. Luckily I am alone. I mosey in and secure the end seat at the counter. There are benefits to breakfast alone on occasion. OK, full stack of 49ers, some bacon and a couple of scrambled eggs please. I have eaten here probably 40 times over the past fifteen to twenty years. Yes, I would have found it convenient to use a credit card once or twice. I would also have enjoyed a soda refill on occasion. But the food is absolutely top notch. The pancakes are the best and the lovely waitress who served me today, who has been there forever, could not have been nicer. I waddled out of there happy as the proverbial clam.  To those who leave un-clamlike I say,  so sorry you are such an unhappy person.
