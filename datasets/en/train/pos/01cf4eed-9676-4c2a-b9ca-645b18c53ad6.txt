Melinda has been a part of my dog, Tanner's, life since I adopted him a couple months ago.  We are currently in her Basic Manners class and he has become the leave it pro!  She always has answers to my questions and great tips that I am confident will help Tanner grow from the energetic puppy that he is into a perfectly behaved dog.  She is truly passionate about dogs and I highly recommend Pawsitive Partners if you love your dog as much as I love mine!
