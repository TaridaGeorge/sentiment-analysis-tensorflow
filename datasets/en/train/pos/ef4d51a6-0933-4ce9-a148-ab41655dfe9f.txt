CALLING ALL (authentic) CHICAGO STYLE DEEP-DISH PIZZA LOVERS!!

Seriously, yum.  If I'm ever hungry for a little taste of Chicago, hubub and I immidiately think Little Sicily.  
Quaint little place, order at the counter, delivered to the candle lit table type joint.  Also BYOB,  We've seen people with big coolers full of beer, and wine bottles.  We were never charged a cork fee, so I'm not sure they have one. 
The owner, as well as staff, knows everyone and is super accomodating and friendly.
Deep dish is always perfect.  Quality ingredients, everything home made.
Salads are always fresh.  Italian beefs made to order (I like mine soaked with an extra side of soak)
