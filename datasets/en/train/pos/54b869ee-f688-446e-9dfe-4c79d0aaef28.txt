Gotta love Lucy's! And I do! Great selection of wines, yummy snacks and "bar pies" - really, where else can you go for a $100 wine and pizza? I say that a bit sarcastically - as I always get a bit ahead of myself and pick out a great wine because really, life is to short to drink bad wine!  My husband rolls his eyes when I suggest Lucy's cause I am not a cheap date there, but he likes it too. He even threw a surprise bday party for me there, recently - and it was all perfect. The back patio is super when the weather is nice, and they have cozy couches inside, or a table if you prefer. Check it out, it's fun!
