Best yogurt in the south Chandler area. Worth the drive (or walk in our case) down Alma School. My husband and I have tried all of the other places in the area and have always left a little disappointed, not with this place. So glad it's finally open. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The flavors are amazing...you will want to try them all. Root Beer is awesome, but so is the coffee and dulce de leche. Good luck choosing! Toppings are great also and there is plenty to choose from. They have hot fudge...need I say more?
