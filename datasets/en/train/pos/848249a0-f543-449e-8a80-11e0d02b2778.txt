Been here a few times, and haven't been disappointed at all!   

Servers have always been friendly; this past time there, the GM (I'm assuming) came by when we were done and took our plates.it was actually a busy Friday lunch crowd, so nice to see their attentiveness to their guests as well those waiting for a table.

I am in love with their Brussels Sprouts and Pancetta Pasta Dish, it has some spice in it as well, but it's basically brussels, pancetta, pasta in olive oil and Parmesan..yummy..

The bread served is yummy, I think it's better than Olive Garden's! And it's served with olive oil and balsamic , great way to start the meal. 

They do have an happy hour special, that's next, but it's not over priced for a good plate of pasta, salads, or pizzas..so enjoy!!
