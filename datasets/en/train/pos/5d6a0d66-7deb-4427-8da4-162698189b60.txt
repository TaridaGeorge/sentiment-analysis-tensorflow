This place is absolutely legendary.  Best chili dogs on the planet -- amazing meaty dogs, toasted buttered bread bun, gloriously greasy chili.  Even the fries are perfect.

I have to take issue with another reviewer's claim that the other menu items aren't any good.  The sliders are almost appallingly greasy but taste like pure heaven.  Even the marinara chicken sandwich is delicious.

There's a fantastic backstory to this place, too.  Dave has somehow kept the Dog House open ever since the complex sold off to greedy hotel developers without making him a fair deal.  The entire strip is vacant now except for Dave's -- and thank God this place is still standing.

Ted's is nothing compared to this.  Dave's will change your life.
