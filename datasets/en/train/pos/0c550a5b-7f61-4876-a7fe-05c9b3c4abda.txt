Had to give this place FIVE stars because it is IDEAL for a pre-game and post-game hang out.

It could basically be considered part of the ball park, it is that close. I got the Chicago dog... because the Cubbies were in town! Came out super fast and they even remembered the Celery Salt! A small detail that is usually overlooked by many restaurants.

Negatives, not a lot of options besides the standard beer and mixed drinks. No frozen Margs. No Mojitos... but whatever! I was able to get those drinks at Chase Field (def creep into the Club level at the Stadium- that's where the full-bar is kept secret!).

After the game its a full-blown beer garden with happy people talkin' smack in their huge outdoor seating area.

I will be going HERE before and hopefully after each game at Chase Field.
