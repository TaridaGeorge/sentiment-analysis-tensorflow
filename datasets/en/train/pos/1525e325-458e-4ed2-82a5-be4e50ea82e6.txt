Wally's is fab. The decoration is like a classy den with some memorabilia and Americana, but nothing overbearing or tacky. Very casual and convenient, the bartenders are very friendly, and the place is seemingly run by people all very comfortable and familiar with each other (something I really like). Great beers on tap, some super wines, and the food is above average (lots of variety... think Village Tavern with an edge). It's popular with Arcadia residents, but is still politely tucked away, so you rarely have to worry about the crowds. They also stay open until everyone leaves, so getting a big party in late may not be a problem.
