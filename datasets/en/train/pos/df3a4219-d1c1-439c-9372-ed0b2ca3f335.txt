Tried this place for the first time last week and was very impressed with food quality for the price and service.  I fell in love with the patio!  Went back this morning and sat inside for a different perspective.  Great atmosphere; comfy, cozy, welcoming. The staff was equally consistent with wonderful customer service and the food was on the money again!  Would definitely make this my regular stop on my mornings of mommy respite.
