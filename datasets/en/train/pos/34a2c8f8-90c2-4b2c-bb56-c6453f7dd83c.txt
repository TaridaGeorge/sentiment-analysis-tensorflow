My family stayed here for a week and found it to be a very comfortable and very inexpensive ($53 per night with a AAA discount)  place to stay while a loved one was in the hospital down the street.

The folks here couldn't have been more friendly and the coffee 24/7 was a huge plus along with free New York Times and WSJs everyday.  We ate at the pub on campus a few times and the food was fine. 

If you are looking for a 4-star hotel, this is not it but it is a great place to stay if you are on a budget and want someplace clean, friendly and quiet.
