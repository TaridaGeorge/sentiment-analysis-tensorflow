I'm a New Yorker. I'll always be a New Yorker. And that menas I'm serious about pizza. All of that said, I'm serious about Grimaldi's. This is one of my favorite locations for dough, cheese and other stick-to-your gut goodness. The bar ain't bad either. The place is always crowded (expect to rub elbows with anyone sitting next to you) but the crowd only adds to the festive atmosphere. From the dining room, you can see the pizza being made and marvel as the servers navigate the maze of tables. Prices are decent and if you sign up for e-mail alerts, you'll be treated to small perks like the occassional coupon or discount on your birthday.
