OK, I don't know if just because one of the items on the menu is perfection, a restaurant deserves 5 stars. I've been back several times...err, weekly. I have a standing Tuesday "Hot dogs & Burgers" date with my 2 year old:) The burgers are outstanding! Juicy and flavorful. I always add bacon, cheese and giardinera (sp?) and it's so good! Lobby and his crew are very nice too. I may have to start doing our date bimonthly because my waist (and probably my arteries) are suffering!
