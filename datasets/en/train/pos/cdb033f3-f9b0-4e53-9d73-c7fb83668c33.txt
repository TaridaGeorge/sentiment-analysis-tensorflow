Me and my husband just moved from Seattle moved on Bell rd. Kept seeing this restaurant ... Pulled it up on Yelp and decided to try it.... I ordered the Carolina Ribs, he worded the fried chicken, also had the fried Zucchini ..... By far the Best BBQ I have tasted in a Long time.... The fried chicken is off the hook.. Portion sizes were great huge.... MY HUSBAND AND I ARE NOW GOING TO BE REGULARS...... WE WERE DEFINITELY SATISFIED! !!
