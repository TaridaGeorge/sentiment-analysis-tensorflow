I never thought I would give a chain restaraunt 5 stars, but I work close to work.  I find myself going to Cousins because its priced well and usually before I am done paying for my sandwich, its already made for me.  The owner and her employees are always very friendly unlike the zit faced morons at Jack in the box, Subway or other chains.  The italian sub on italian bread is 10x better than any Subway sub.  well there ya go, take it or leave it, if you want a very quick place to grab a sando for under $6 go here!  Visit me if you are looking for a new car or truck at Centennial Leasing and sales and ask for Gary!  My inventory is at www.autobrokeraz.com
