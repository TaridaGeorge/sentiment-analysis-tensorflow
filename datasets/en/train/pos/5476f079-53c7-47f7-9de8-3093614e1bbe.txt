They have beer, it's exceptionally good beer, and they brew it on the premise so they're not going to run out.  It's an even better bar to go hang out at during the ASU off-season.

Oh, and bejesus, their Arizona Chicken Rolls are phenomenal!  Wish they'd give a little more for what they charge for them but that's not going to stop me from ordering them.  These are deliciously spicy and no idea what that white sauce is I dip them in but it's good (insert that's what she said here)
