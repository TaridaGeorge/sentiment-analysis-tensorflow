If I remember correctly, all my times at the Windsor I would regale with utter pleasing song and dance. This is by far one of the stores I keep in my monthly rotation . 

I usually visit during the HH time. Just cause it makes sense, due to there extended HH times it makes it very easy to visit during those time where my scheduled needs to be flexible.    

The 5 times I have visited it was enjoyable. I cant say even think of a con worthy of noting. 

Well Done Windsor.

NOte: If you are reading  a grip of reviews, I am sure you noticed the parking here is for the diligent and patient. Good luck trying to find a parking spot in the parking lot. 
This only adds to the persevered intimacy and inclusiveness.
