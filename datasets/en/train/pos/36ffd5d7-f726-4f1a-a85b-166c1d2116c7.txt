My favorite sub in AZ is "Ike's Presidential"  the bread is crusty then soft, the BBQ mustard is AmAzInG.  The pizza slices are reminiscent of the pizza parlors in my New Jersey hometown.  $5.00 for 2 slices with a drink may be the best bargain n town.  These are real N.Y. pizzas, so if you want to impress at your next party, think Redendo's. I have used them to cater several parties and was a hit each time.
