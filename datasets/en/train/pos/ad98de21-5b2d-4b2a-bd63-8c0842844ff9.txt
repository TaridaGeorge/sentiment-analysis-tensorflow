I have been a member of the credit union since 1986. I have had basic accounts, car loans, and other loans and have gotten the best interest rates around. Never have had a problem. Service is great too. I am always asked when I go in (which is rare) if I need an extra check register. That is really nice because I usually do! Then they give me 2!
