Had the shwarma chicken gyro with the curry pasta salad. It was delicious! Friendly staff, free WiFi, clean facility/restrooms, good price...what more could you ask for!

If you are the kind of person who puts ranch dressing on everything they eat, this probably isn't your place - I'm sure you will find a fast food place down the road where your mac-rib sandwich was mass produced out of a stamp machine.
