Best french macarons I've had outside of Paris, and I really mean it.  Since going to Paris 2 years ago, I've been on a quest.  They are always super fresh, that's why they sell out of them on a regular basis.  I really love the blueberry, raspberry and vanilla.  Well actually, I loved all 6 flavors they had.  They are small and inexpensive.  About $1.60 each.  There are only a couple of other places that make them here in the Phoenix area, and they are overpriced and never fresh.  

The cupcakes are fabulous too.  I love the salted carmel vanilla and lemon the best.  

The store is very charming and the staff is always nice!
