I have  been going to this Spa for almost 14 years. I can honestly say that I have NEVER had a bad experience here. I always get my hair done, eyebrows and nails done here. The staff is wonderful and super friendly. They are also very well trained and educated. They do a great job keeping up with the trends and keeping their customers happy. My two older sisters actually fly out from NYC everytime they need a touch up or want a change in their hair color. 
I actually brought my entire bridal party here to get there hair done and the staff was excellent. They started on time and got us out on schedule. I truly reccomend this place to anyone looking for a new salon or spa. They are awesome!
