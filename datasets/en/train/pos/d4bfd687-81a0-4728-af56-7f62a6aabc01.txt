I'm a big fan of the pizza here. I LOVE it. I tried a salad and it wasn't for me. The waitress was really cool about offering me something else but I just wanted to stick w/ the pizza. Then the manager came over and offered us a free desert. I thought that was a super class act. I would have given 5 stars for the pizza anyway, but that earned them star # 6 in my book.
