If I could close my eyes and eat with chopsticks w/out stabbing myself, I could pretend this was dinner while on vacation... 

The waitress was gracious, immediately sharing recommendations when she learned it was our first visit.. and continued to help us thru as we ordered addtl dishes later.

The dishes were visually presented such as in a high end restaurant and I don't think pricing is out of line at all for this style of food (Japanese IS expensive).  The garlic miso clams in risotto was so clever in presentation and extremely rich and savory (cilantro alert!).  We just enjoyed our meal from beginning to end.
