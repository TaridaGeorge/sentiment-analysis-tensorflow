I used to work right around the corner from Palee's Crown. As a result I had lunch there at least once a week for a couple years. Great lunch special. Easily on par with or better than your favorite Thai place in the valley. None of that dry Pad Thai served in tinfoil with with white rice you might find in Scottsdale. This is true home cooked Thai from a very friendly family owned business. They aren't afraid to make it hot either.
