This is my 2nd time living in Phoenix and this is one of my favorite restaurants.  The food is amazing, the staff is very friendly and the owner goes out of his way to accommodate his patrons.  I'm from the St. Louis area so it's great to be able to go here and watch STL Cardinals baseball.  It's not a sports bar, but instead a nice, sit-down restaurant with a great bar area.  Steak, toasted raviolis, etc., it's all amazing.
