This is a great little place that opened up in an old buffalo wild wings space.  They have a GREAT selection of beers, good wings, good access to tvs/sports and good customer service.  My friend is a beer aficionado and so the extensive selection of draught beers in a small venue like this is awesome. PLUS - you can create your own beer sampler for $5!  Seriously, does it get better than that?!  Why yes! It does!  Wednesdays all pints are $3 and boneless wings are $0.59/a piece. I'm officially fan!  The only downside right now is the heavy construction in front of the place and the lack of an official sign (come on guys - let's get rid of the BWW sign and get yours UP THERE), but it's definitely worth overlooking those two issues.
