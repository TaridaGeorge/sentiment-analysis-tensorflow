Went for the first time today and had the asian vegetable sandwich. The bread is fresh baked on site. Very european. Crunchy freshness on the outside and fluffy white on the inside. The kimchi was homemade and combined with jalepenos and crunchy vermacelli noodles. AMAZING. I also tried a bite of the pork - delicious!!!! Will definitely be back for the anchovie sandwich. I washed it down with the sweet goodness of vietnamese coffee.
