My second time here and once again not disappointed. Sat on the patio this time since it was a beautiful Spring day! My sister and I split the grilled romaine salad and ham and cheese sandwich. Service was great and it was just such a nice experience. Take a few minutes to walk around the grounds. Can't wait to come back!
