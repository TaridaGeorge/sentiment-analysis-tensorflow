Excellent service for a great price. I had my machine completely cleaned and tuned up for $50. He explained some things to me to help keep it running smoothly and gave a warranty on the tension fix he did. He said if I had any more problems I could bring it back in and he'd adjust it, no charge. 

Very fast turn around.
