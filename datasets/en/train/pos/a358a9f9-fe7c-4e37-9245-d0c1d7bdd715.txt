I found my stylist--I LOVE RODNEY!
Just moved out to Scottsdale from Boston and desperately needed some pampering.  I went to get my hair cut and colored by Rodney at Jo Paris.  He was a lot of fun and not to mention did an INCREDIBLE job on my color.  He understood that I am petrified of having my hair cut, or even trimmed for that matter.  He took just enough off that I didn't have a heart attack.  I will be seeing him again in the first week of MAY and I CANNOT WAIT! GO SEE RODNEY IF YOU WANT TO LOOK DROP DEAD GORGEOUS...or else you won't be noticed. xoxo
