This location has an excellant manager, Janet. I was blown away by the service I recieved because a) it was a special order and b) it was to be picked up 2.5 hours BEFORE they were open. She and her staff were already in perfect uniform and  in high spirits. She had a happy smile on, and was so cheerful! I will go here more often with my son, even though I wish they had the gates like Chuck E Cheese. She made me think that if she is in such a genuinely good mood, her staff is probably top notch. A good work environment makes it easier to do you job well. I look forward to going back!
