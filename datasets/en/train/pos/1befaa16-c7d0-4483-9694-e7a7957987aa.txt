I go to Tiny's often, and still loving it!  I'm amazed at some of the comments on here saying the food is only "par" or just ok.  You people can keep right on going to the chain restaurants with the frozen, shredded hash browns, and cheap tasting meats, but for those of us that want real cooking, sticking to Tiny's! All complainers move on!
