Sens is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in this entire city.  The staff is great, the food is amazing, and the drinks are the best (Pinko Nu Hana, or something along those lines, in the Saketini drink menu is the best cocktail EVER.  EVER.).  Personal favorite food item:  bacon wrapped lychee wrapped bacon.  You must try at least once, although I'm sure it will result in you having it many times after...!!

In the numerous times I've been here, I've only ever had 1 dish I didn't like, it was the beef wrapped in grape leaves. Don't remember the name, but 1 item out of ALL is definitely nothing to sneer at.  

I bring everyone I know here, and every person I bring is equally impressed.  That reminds me, I haven't been yet this month... I know where I'm having dinner tonight :)
