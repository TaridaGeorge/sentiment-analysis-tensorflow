Best sandwich I have ever had!!  

I've been back a few times and always get their signature sandwich, the Bobbie.  Fresh shredded turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, mayo on very fresh tasty bread.  Fantastic!  I've also tried the Italian Grilled Meats and it was delicious, but not quite as good as the Bobbie.  I'd like to try some of their other sandwiches but I just can't not order my favorite.

 A small sandwich is enough for a meal, the medium for 2 and large 20" is definitely enough for 3-4 people.  They'll cut the sandwich in 1/2, 1/3's or even 1/4's without any problem.

The service is friendly and fast.  You can see them make your sandwich fresh and they do not skimp on the fillings.  

Love this place and glad it's only 10 minutes from home.  Yum!!
