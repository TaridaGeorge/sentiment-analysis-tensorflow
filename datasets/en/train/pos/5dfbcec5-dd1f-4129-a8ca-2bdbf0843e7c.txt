If it's a Saturday night, then it's likely you'll find me at Copper Blues. With 64 beers on tap, ranging from locals to domestics to seasonals, there's a brew for everybody! They even carry Red Bridge in the bottle, which is great for us Gluten-Free'ers! There are cover bands every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday night, and you never quite know what you're going to get! 

The food is amazing! If you're a mac 'n cheese fan, you would be amiss not to experience this dish. They're also happy to make minor substitutions to swap out pita bread with corn chips for us gluten sensitive people. So while many items on the menu may not be gluten-free friendly, the staff seems happy to substitute.

You can always find a table inside or outside, and the service is always great.
