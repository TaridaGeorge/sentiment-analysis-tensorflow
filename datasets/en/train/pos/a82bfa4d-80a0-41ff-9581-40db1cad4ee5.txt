This was my first half marathon, as well as the farthest distance I ran prior to the date (01-15-12). What a postive first experience for me. I absolutely loved the course. How neat to run through three cities. The view in general, and the change of scenery from desert to city to town lake was very interesting! I felt like security did a great job, there were plenty of aid stations with so many wonderful volunteers, and an amazing number of cheer leaders. After just this one event, I was so inspired that I decided I wanted to reach for the goal of earning the Super Six medal, for 6 rock n roll events in a calendar year.  I will definitely run in this series for years to come!
