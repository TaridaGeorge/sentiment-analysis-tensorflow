I enjoy this place so much it gives me happy feet!
I was looking for a burger place that wasn't fast food near my house one day & stumbled upon this tasty establishment. I walked in to see a very clean & very inviting dining room. They have a wide range of foods from hamburgers, wings, fried zuchini, cheese fries, & so much more. They just recently added steakburgers which I can't wait to try. The bacon cheeseburger is so good it makes my stomach smile. Maybe I'm crushing so hard on this place because I just ate there tonight but do yourself a favor & eat here if your around 91st ave & Thomas. Enjoy!
