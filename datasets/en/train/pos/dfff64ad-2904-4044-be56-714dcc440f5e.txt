It's hot outside...you're sweating.  You very possibly could be on the verge of road rage...What do you do? You go to Angelo's, that's what!

I don't know about you, but gelato always puts me in a good mood and this place is no exception. They have sooo many delicious items to choose from that it can be hard to decide on one thing.  They offer gelato (my personal fave), italian ice (a close runner up), sorbettos and much more. 

They have reasonable prices too!  Oh and for those looking for sugar free stuff, they have sugar-free italian ice. Molto bene!
