I decided to try this Tarbell's after reading all the great reviews and it didn't hurt to hear about the owner winning on Iron Chef. I have to say this was a wonderful meal.
I had the Scotch beef and my wife had the salmon, great flavor and quality. The service was very good, our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations on what to order. Very glad that we chose this place while in Phoenix.
