Norm R and I went to this spot the other day and I loved it. Mountain tops are one of my favorite type of places to visit in any given area that have them. The view is AwEsOmE. My 2nd favorite place in this park is the mini ghost town at the bottom with a building labeled "This Is Scorpion Gulch" allot of fun 4 the nature lovers, hikers and bicyclists. Go see 4 yourself.
