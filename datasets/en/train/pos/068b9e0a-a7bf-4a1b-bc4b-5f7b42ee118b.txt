Let's go DBacks!  It is great to have a local team we can believe in!  (The Cards do not cut it.)

Games here are generally pretty good, although the security staff could be a bit more friendly when going through the gates.  I think they are all amped up and ready to step on someones neck or something.  Oh well, at least the games are fun!
