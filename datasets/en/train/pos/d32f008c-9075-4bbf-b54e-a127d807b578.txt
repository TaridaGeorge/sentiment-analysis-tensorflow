We were fortunate to dine at La Stalla last night while visiting my mom in Chandler, AZ.   The lasagna is to die for, as is the Tiramisu.  I ordered the sweet potato ravioli in gorgonzola sauce, and it was delicioso.  The bread was yummy too!  Ingredients were fresh and top notch - no canned veggies here.

Chef Ivan Ruiz is extremely dedicated to his craft, and puts together a wonderfully diverse menu.  Owner, Paul, is friendly and welcoming and creates a great atmosphere for his customers.  Service was great.

We'll be leaving AZ soon, and can't wait to return for another 5 star meal at La Stalla.  Try it . . . you'll like it:)
