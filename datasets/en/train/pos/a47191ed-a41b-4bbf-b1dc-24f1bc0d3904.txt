Just visited the Phoenix area for Thanksgiving and had to make a repeat stop at Haji-Baba. The food here is sooo good and sooo reasonably priced and with big portions! I had the chicken shwarma salad. Huge portion of chicken over rice and lettuce with a tasty unique house dressing. Went with a party of 8 and everyone loved their food.  I wish this place were in LA area where I live!
