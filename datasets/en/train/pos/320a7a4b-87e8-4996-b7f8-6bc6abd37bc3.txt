Very friendly and quick service, and gave me an alternative to fix my window which fell down and wouldn't roll back up.  Something I could afford, even though my window won't roll down anymore.  I'll take it.   Even topped off my brake fluid without asking, as it was low, and didn't charge me for that.  Thanks, Bumper to Bumper, I'll be back, hopefully not anytime soon.
