i live within walking distance of this buffalo exchange. i walked there last month because i was bored and had nothing to do and wanted to check it out. i had never been to a BE before. i love it!!!!! i got two pairs of shorts, two shirts, a vest, and a purse for $70! the most expensive thing was the purse for $20. the shorts were $7-8 and shirts $5-10. it's amazing!! i love the vintage look and they have a very large selection. all the employees have super cute styles and are nice. they aren't extremely attentive but honestly i would rather be left alone so that i can shop! love it there. awesome jewelry also!
