Been here multiple times and the food is always good!  Generous salads, burgers, pasta, desserts, even the house wines are quality.  Nice for groups as you can still hear each other at a table but not so quiet that you feel everyone is listening.  Service is just the right amount of attentiveness and they are able to answer questions which is something not often seen nowadays.
There is a back room for groups, have been there too and it is a nice meeting area away from the main restaurant so presentations are okay.
Parking is fantastic as the restaurant is located at the end of a strip mall.
Recommend.
