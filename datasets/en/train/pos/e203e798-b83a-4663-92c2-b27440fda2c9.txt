I have been here several times in the last 10 years.  Each time is as good as the last one.  The chicken, turkey and beef are excellent.  Not too salty, but tasty.  The sides (especially the cole slaw and potato salad) are simply delicious.

The root beer is brewed on the premises and is worth the trip alone.
