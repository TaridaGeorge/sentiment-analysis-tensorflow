When I first moved into my apartment a few years ago, the "onsite laundry facilities" were... not precisely as represented. The machines ate quarters, left laundry sudsy and gross, and I'm pretty sure were actually portals to another, more dangerous universe where laundry goes to fight alien archvillains. But Ginny's saved the day more than once. The laundromat part was convenient, clean and inviting, and their laundry service was reliable and affordable. I just recommended it to a friend whose machine died (I now luckily live in a complex with in-unit washer and dryer. Civilization!) and it's been at least a year since I was there, but I have weirdly fond memories of this place. I think there's something in dryer sheet chemicals that induces cheerfulness.
