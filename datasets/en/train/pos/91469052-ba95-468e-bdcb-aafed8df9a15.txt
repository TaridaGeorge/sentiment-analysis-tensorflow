I really do enjoy this bar.  They have a great jukebox, pool table and tasty beers/liquor.  On one of my more memorable trips to Shady's I started with and Irish coffee...not wanting to get all jacked up on caffeine, I asked if the bartender had decaf.  He looked around and reported back with a no, but had a great idea: hot chocolate with whipped cream-flavored vodka!! Helllllo!  It was effing delicious.  

One downside about this joint is that I never feel hipster/rockabilly enough, but the bartenders are super chill so if you don't have side swept bangs, flannel, tons of tattoos or a big beard, don't fret...you're still welcome to join the party.
