Wow, I happened to find DD on Yelp last night while looking for some grub. I am sold on this place. They offer high quality heat and eat or ready to eat entree's, sides and deserts as well as wine and other beverages. The place is in a strip mall but it is much higher end inside than you would expect. The prices are reasonable and the food reheats easy, usually just a bit in the microwave, but they will gladly offer tips if you need them. They do have a few tables inside and you can order eat in, but mostly it is designed to take home or back to the office.

I am glad that there is a place like DD in Phoenix. Many others have tried but DD does it right with a huge variety of fresh items. I will be back.
