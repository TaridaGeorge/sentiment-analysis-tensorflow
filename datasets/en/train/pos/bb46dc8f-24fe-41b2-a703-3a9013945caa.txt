I'm not a Sox or Dodgers fan, but we like baseball and when taking an almost 2 year old to a baseball game, it helps when even the lawn isn't packed. We went to a Sox game today with friends and sat in the lawn and had a great time. No lines for restrooms, clean, great for kids. Just bring a blanket and sunscreen and enjoy. Parking is on premisis and free.
