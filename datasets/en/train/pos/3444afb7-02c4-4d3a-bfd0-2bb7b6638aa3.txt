I am so excited! My boyfriend and I have been saying for a while that what our neighborhood is missing is it's own frozen yogurt place. Today it seems as if our prayers had been answered. Not only is the location super convenient, the ambiance is at the same time cool and cozy. I would have come here even if the yogurt had been mediocre but the flavors I tried today were all absolutely delicious! (I had the caramel, the milk chocolate, and the cookies and cream) The toppings are of a nice variety and freshness as well! I know I will be a regular. I am just a little worried about the crowds, as I am sure this place will become a quick favorite for all who stop by.
