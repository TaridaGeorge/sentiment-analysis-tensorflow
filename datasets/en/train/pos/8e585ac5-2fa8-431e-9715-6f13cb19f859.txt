In short: Waited 2 1/2 hours for the best pizza I've ever had. The wine bar next door has $4 Hop Knots: highly recommended.

For the Value: 5 Big Fat Stars (my boyfriend & I spent $45 together for our whole meal)

Plan for next time: someone gets us on the list and we all hang out at my house (10 minutes away) having wine and appetizers, playing Apples to Apples while we wait. 'Twil be good times. =)
