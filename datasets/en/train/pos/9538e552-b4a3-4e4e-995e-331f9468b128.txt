I love this place! Nothing we had was bad! 

I took my boyfriend for his birthday in October. We sat at the bar because the restaurant was full on a Monday night! 
The beer selection was nice (needs more IPA) we shared a chorizo flatbread and the French onion burger both were to die for! 
I cannot wait to go back when I am in town a definite return date place!
