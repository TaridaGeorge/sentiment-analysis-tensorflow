I love Fresh and Easy.  I drive WAY to far for this store:)  I love the produce packs.  My husband inhales the restaurant style salsa!  The staff is friendly and helpful!  I enjoy shopping there-- totally worth the extra gas!

I generally get coupons in my e-mail.  The coupons and the generally fair prices combine to make F&E a super choice for budget at health concerns.
