5 stars for the wide open spaces! 

We all know that Starbuck's drinks are all standard, pretty much.
So when I look at stores I look for the outlets and the tables...I guess also the location.

When ever you go into a Starbucks, no matter what location you instantly feel your in a different place...the company's interior design gets me every time, the insistent Feng Shui is just so relaxing and productive. Or maybe its all in my head..ha!

I like this location because of the outlets and the tables...all very accommodating. 

I am purest so I don't mess with Carmel frapps or the peppermint mochas...tall coffee or black passion tea for me my coffee artisans of 16th st and BethHome....and let the caffeine pass through my veins...stirring my inner most career ambitions! 

l'chaim!
