I can't say enough good things about this place!  The selection is amazing.  They have a range that will satisfy most everyone's needs.  I enjoy most the opportunity to find old books at very reasonable prices.  I have been compiling a collection of my favorite children's books and never fail to find something unique when I go.

Throw in some fun and funky decor items and a Wildflower Bread Co. next door and you've got a serious winner!  I will never buy a book at B & N again.
