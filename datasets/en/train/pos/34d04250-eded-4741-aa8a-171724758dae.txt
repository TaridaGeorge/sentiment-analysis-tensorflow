OMG this restaurant almost made me swear off men. YES IT'S THAT GOOD! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Best grillers ever! I have only had the short ribs, beef and grilled chicken but it was enough to keep me going there about three times a week. You can EASILY share with someone.. yes it's that much meat (well, if you get the combo option or double meat option). Staff is quick and friendly. Parking kinda stinks but you get in and out so it's ok. I wish I wish I wish they were open more often (weekends and evenings) so I could have them for dinner! Next bbq I am having I am ordering from them and saying I cooked it :)
