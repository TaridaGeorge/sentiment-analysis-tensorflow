I've heard all the jokes..."Ethiopian food? I thought they didn't have food in Ethiopia?" Hilarious. Now go and try this place!

It's basically piles of meats (Wat) or veggies cooked slowly with lots of flavors and served on Injera, a sourdough-tasting spongy bread that resembles a large crepe. You tear off pieces and scoop up the forms of Wat or veggies. I cannot pick a favorite of the meats, although the Alicha Sega Wat is very good. I love the Misir Wat (lentils) and Gomen (collard greens - very garlic-y).

Save room for dessert. A little known fact, but they have some of the Valley's best Tiramisu. I happen to love their Tres Leches cake also. A smooth sweet finish to an otherwise spice-filled meal.
