Service with a smile is just the beginning to this local bagel shop.  I highly recommend getting a mixed topping bagel with tuna, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, and a slice of provolone cheese.  Dont pass up on getting a side of the tuna salad while you are at it.  This is by far the best bagel shop in the state.
