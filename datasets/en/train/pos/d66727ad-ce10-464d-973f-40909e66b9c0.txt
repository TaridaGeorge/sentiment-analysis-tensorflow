The Panang Curry is one of those meals that feels like you are home; really a life affirming meal.  One of those meals that makes you feel refreshed and happy to be alive to enjoy such a thing.

The food comes quickly and you are always provided plenty of refreshment.  Really, this place is a wonderful thing.  The only sad fact is that there isn't enough rice to sop up every remaining ounce of curry.  

Seriously, I think I might ask for more rice next time.
