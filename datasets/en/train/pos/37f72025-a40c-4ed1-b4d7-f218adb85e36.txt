I love this trail!!! With the nearby trails of Thunderbird Park always busy when the weather is great, I bring myself to this trail.

The trails are more challenging than Thunderbird also and longer!

Its hidden because at first, you see a park where they have soccer/football games going on and don't realize the trails behind the park leading to the mountain.  The view from the top is so great, you get to see lots of desert and cacti. 

If you haven't gone there yet, please do so because its such a hidden gem. I rarely see people on the trails there whenever I go.
