I love the concept of this pet market and enjoyed my visit. They specialize in natural, organic and holistic foods and toys. This is important to me as I want my pup to be playing with toys that are made from safe materials, and eating treats, etc that contain healthy ingredients. I don't buy my dog food here, but this is one of the only places I know of that carries Zuke's natural treats. Also, I found the toy selection to be much better than pet smart's - and am happy to know Milly's toys are safe. Great store for treats, chews and toys.
