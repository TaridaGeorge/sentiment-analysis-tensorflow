Great coffee (latte for me), yummy scrambles and breakfast burritos, and tons of indoor and outdoor seating. So far, this is my favorite coffee shop in the area. Also the prices are reasonable and the staff is really friendly. It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but it's a quiet and cool place to relax during the week.
