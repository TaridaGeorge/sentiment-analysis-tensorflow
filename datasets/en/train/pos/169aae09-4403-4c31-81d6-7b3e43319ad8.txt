If you blink you might just miss this small, family-owned sushi bar. I myself am not a great fan of Sushi. However, the husband is, and he thinks this is the bomb. We also brought a friend here who lived in Japan for two years, and he said Hana Sushi was the closest he's found to what he had in Japan. 

Fantastic food, and great prices too! For example the lunch special is under $7 and you get:

1 pc tuna sushi
1 pc salmon sushi
1 pc whitefish sushi
1 California roll 
1 spicy tuna roll 
and a small salad

See what I mean? Great value for your buck. Note, though, that the place only seats around 50 people and can get very crowded for lunch and weekend dinners.
