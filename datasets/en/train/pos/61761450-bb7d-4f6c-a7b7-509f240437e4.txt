Great service, beer, and food.  Everything was above excellent.  I had a tuna appetizer that was delicous and fresh.  A beer that was outstanding and makes me sad that I am such a light weight when it comes to alcohol.  For dinner I had the New York Steak Salad that has everything you could want in a salad.  Our server was great and quick to clear and refill drinks.  Also, she was helpful in reccommending a malty beer that was smooth.   Great memu selection.
