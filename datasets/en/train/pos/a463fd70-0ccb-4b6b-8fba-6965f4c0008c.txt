One of my new favorite places! I love coming here for lunch and sitting outside in the patio area. The sandwiches are delicious, I especially recommend the grilled cheese with added bacon! The Grotto cafe has a great atmosphere, friendly staff and great food with very reasonable prices. I always recommend friends to come here for lunch or breakfast :) They have live music now too on weekends and I am very looking forward to it, I'm sure I won't be disappointed!
