I love me some Pino's.  If you are star struck by local newscasters, you can almost always find one or two in Pino's.  Some are pretty FOXy. 

The spaghetti marinara is great!  But my fav is the pizza-- any kind. 

Strange hours, but that's an Italian for you (I am 1/2 Italian, so I am allowed to say this)
