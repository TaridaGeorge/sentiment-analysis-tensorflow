If you're a carnivore and anywhere near Joe's in Gilbert, AZ, you owe it to yourself to come buy yourself a bottle of their secret recipe barbeque sauce.  The barbeque here is rockin but that SAUCE....damn it's good!  So good, that I walked over here from my mom's house one evening and bought a bottle to bring home with me.

I had to check my baggage because of that bottle but it was worth it!!!  Go getcha some.  I got the spicy it's soooo good.
