I would liken this place to Chick-Fil-A...they just seem to get it and have figured out what everyone else cannot for some reason.  It's nice, has lots of stuff, has great hours, facilities are well thought out, etc.  What's most important to me is how they do childcare though.  They are so, so good at it.  My son literally cries when we leave and constantly asks to go to the gym.  It's a good motivation actually...
