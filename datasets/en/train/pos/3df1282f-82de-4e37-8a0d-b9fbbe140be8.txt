I love pizza and NYPD is my favorite.  The crust is very tasty - thin, slightly crispy, flavorful.  The sauce, cheese and toppings all taste amazing and fresh and are in perfect ratio to each other.  My favorite pizza is their Brooklyn Family (pepperoni, sausage and fresh basil - the fresh basil takes the pizza to a whole other level!).  I've never had a bad pizza from there so they are very consistent in what they produce.  I've only dined in so I can't comment about their delivery but their dine in service is very good and the place is well decorated and clean.
