I freaking love Sprouts. The produce is here is so obnoxiously cheap and fresh. And with the boy being an herbivore and all, it helps keep the bills down. Seriously though, 3 bulbs of garlic for 98 cents, 3 red bell peppers for $1, 4 for $5 strawberries....fantastic. 

I love the selection of organic brands they have as well, many of which are usually on some good sales. I also love that you're able to scoop your own rices, beans, trail mixes, candy, etc. Along with the spices. They also have a huge stock of organic cosmetic/hygiene products. 

Like Trader Joe's though, you're not guaranteed to find everything you need/want here. We usually do two lists, the Sprouts list, and the Safeway list - for eggs, the occasional Ben & Jerry's, string cheese, deli meats, etc.
