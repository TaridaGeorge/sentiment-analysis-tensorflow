Blackened Shrimp & Crawfish Fondeaux... what more do I need to say.  This was the first thing I tried at Pappadeaux's and I have ordered it every time since.  From the fried seafood menu, the Pappadeaux Platter is great and there is enough food for 2 if you get an appetizer to start, unless you are real hungry.
