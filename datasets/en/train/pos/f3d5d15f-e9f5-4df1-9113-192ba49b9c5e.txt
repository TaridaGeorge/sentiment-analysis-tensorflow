If you are looking for a good auto shop run by nice, honest people, look no further.  This is the best shop I have ever dealt with.  Bob and Dorie Corrette are simply the best.  A great example:  We took my wife's car in because it was making a weird noise.  Bob told us that the brake shop (which will go unnamed) that had recently worked on her brakes had messed something up and sent us back to them to get it fixed.  No Charge!  I cannot recommend Priemier enough.
