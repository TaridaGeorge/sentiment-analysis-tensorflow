Went here today to pick up a cake for my husband.  Loved this place- they make all sorts of things that are gluten free and dairy free.  They have doughnuts, cakes, cup cakes, muffins, bagels, pizza crusts, breads and more!  I also saw that they have breakfast and lunch daily all gluten free!  

The cake was good too!  We got a chocolate cake with chocolate frosting.  Normally gluten free items can be pretty hard or dry.  The cake was super moist.  verrrry good!
