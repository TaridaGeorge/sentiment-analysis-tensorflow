I have to say that this is the best and cleanest indian food I have ever had! From the moment we walked in we loved the smells that greeted us and along with the very friendly service I was sold. My husband ordered the Coconut Chicken curry and I the Paneer Makani and three garlic tandoori breads ( I could have just eaten the bread! Super YUM). Everything was as we ordered it and food was stove hot. I LOVE this place and will go there again and again! To all the haters out there, this is good food... COME on!!!
