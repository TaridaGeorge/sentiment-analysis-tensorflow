This pool is awesome!  Kids are $1.00 to get in, adults are $2.25.  Pool has really good hours, and lots of room.

Locker rooms are ample, with lockers, bathrooms and changing areas, showers and of course, toilets.  Two swimming areas, one is more for the kids, and the other is for the adults.  There's diving boards, life guards, and several places to sit and lay out to catch some rays.

The only downside to this place is that its always packed!  Get here early to get a place to sit, as it fills up quickly.  Water is refreshing, parking is ample, and despite it being one of the busier pools in the area, is worth the time for the refreshment alone.
