Great beer selection, but we were just in for lunch. I was definitely tempted, but remained a good girl. Or was a good girl for once... potato... pah-ta-tah. 

The spinach/artichoke/crab dip was really good. I need to find those yummy yucca chips by the bag. I really liked how the dip wasn't too heavy and cheesy. Nice clean flavors. We then spit the chicken salad sandwich with the side of the gnocci for an extra dollar. The gnocci for an extra buck was a STEAL. Seriously... should I have snuck out the back? Holy crap was that gnocci good. The chicken salad sandwich was super yummy too and I loved that it was served on a croissant. 

Service was great and we will definitely return soon. Next time I will get beer!
