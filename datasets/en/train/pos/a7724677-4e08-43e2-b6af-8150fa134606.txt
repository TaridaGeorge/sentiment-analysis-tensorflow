I go to CB for breakfast on Tuesdays. Always a very good breakfast, no wait and great customer service. For a chain restaurant I am very impressed with how much the staff seems to care about your time in their restaurant. It is clear they want  you to have a great experience in their restaurant. 

So many different places to try for breakfast. I have yet to try these places cause Crackerbarrell has given me no reason to go elsewhere. 

Really like their coffee too. The staff always makes sure I  do not have an empty cup and even offer a to go cup of coffee.
 
Keep up the good work CB.
