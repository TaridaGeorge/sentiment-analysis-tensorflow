I come here every sunday after church, I love their three musketeers omelet, california benny, country fried steak and anything on the lunch menu...in general this place is awesome, great food, awesome servers. Sometimes service might be slow but only because they have to tend to alot of tables. Oh its cheap too! Btw if you don't want to wait, call ahead and make a reservation! :)
