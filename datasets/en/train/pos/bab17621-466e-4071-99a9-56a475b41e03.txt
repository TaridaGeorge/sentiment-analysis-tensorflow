The Scottsdale Green Belt is one of my favorite parts of living and selling real estate in Scottsdale!  The section between Thomas and McDowell has a Boys and Girls Club, one of the city's three public pools, several fishing lakes, a few playgrounds and grassy fields, and a concrete skate park, all connected by paved walking/biking paths.
