My mother needed to get her tile cleaned.  So  I came across this company and thier reasonable prices.   They came out just to do the tile originally and did such a good job.  My mother had her place rugs done too.   The turned out way above my expectations.   The company's professionalism and quality of work will definatley make him recomend him to all my family and friends.
