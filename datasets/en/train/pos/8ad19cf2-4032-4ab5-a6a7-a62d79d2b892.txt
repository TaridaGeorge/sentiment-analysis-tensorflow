Brooklyn style pizza (the only real pizza) at it's absolute BEST. Half the spots in Brooklyn don't even match Patsy Grimaldi's. Don't waste your money or risk your tastebuds on any imitations...

The margarita (fresh tomato, mozzarella and basil) is my favorite, and most purists will agree a good pizza rarely needs more. Also a great wine selection, service, and atmosphere. This location is my favorite, however they are all great and consistently high in quality and service.
