The food was amazing, the service was friendly, and the decor was pleasant without being stuffy.  In our party of four we ALL cleaned our plates (which is not normal for us). Two standouts were the fresh, warm bread with pesto (very good) and citrus butter (sublime) for an appetizer and the peach cobbler for desert.  We are definitely going back!
