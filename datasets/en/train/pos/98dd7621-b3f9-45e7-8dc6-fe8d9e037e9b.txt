Their grilled chicken sandwich makes my mouth water just writing this. Absolutely the best in Phoenix. The chicken is juicy and oversized . Love the self serve condiment bar to dress your sandwich to your liking. Prices are inexpensive. The beer battered onion rings are very tasty. This place is a bit shabby but who cares because the food makes up for it.
