Apple is the best company EVER.  My son played with my iPhone in the bathroom the day before so I went in expecting to have to buy a new iPhone... NO!  They gave me a brand new one for $150!  They have the BEST customer service at all apple locations.  The only negative I would say, and this goes for ALL locations is that their Genius Bar is always behind and there is no where for you to wait because there are usually 300 people in the store at a time.
