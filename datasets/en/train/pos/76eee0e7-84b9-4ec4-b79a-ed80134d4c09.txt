Fuego Tacos will have KARAOKE every Saturday night from 8 pm to close starting on 10/20/2012. Also on 10/27 there will be Scary-Oke for some Halloween fun!
Your Host Thom has over 13,000 songs so there is something there for everyone. Still don't see one you like, he can download a song for you, if it is available as karaoke for a fee. Be cool and tip him the amount of the download so he doesn't lose money on the night please!
It is the most fun you can have with a microphone! get out and have some fun!
