Pretty much you could not make this place any better unless you could make it bigger, which I have heard rumored might be happening.

The atmosphere is perfect - a charming old house and great patio.  We once went with a group of 28 and had dinner on the patio and it was perfect.

Food Suggestions - the Antipasto platter - it is a must, the best in Phx
The pizzas are also great and I have heard the crepes as well, but I myself and not a huge crepe fan, so have not tried them out.

If you don't live in the downtown area and are headed down for a sporting or cultural event, this should be your first stop.

Only issue would be parking - its a really small lot, but you can usually snag a spot on the street pretty easy.
