One of my BEST spa experiences! I've patronized many spas at "destination spots" and have to contend with crowds/rudeness/attitudes and just plain crazies. The Red Door Spa at the Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park is a TREASURE for the West Valley, quiet/low-keyed/amazing attentive staff/plus you can order lunch by the pool from REDS.....what a treat, which I recommend! I highly suggest the Olive Oil manicure/pedicure and the Red Door Signature massage. I love this place!
