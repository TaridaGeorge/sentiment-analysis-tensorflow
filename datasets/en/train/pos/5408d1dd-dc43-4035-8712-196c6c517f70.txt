We were told their house specialty is the bone-in fillet. We ordered the 12 oz. version, and it surely lived up to its reputation! As with most true steakhouses, it was served alone on a 400 degree plate. The sides are family style, every one we say looked great. We had the Au Gratin potatoes, and while they were drenched in cheese, they still accompanied the steak very well. Wine selection is decent, though overpriced. Good feel to the dining room, and service was good at 8PM on a Friday night.  We'll be back the next time we're in Scottsdale.
