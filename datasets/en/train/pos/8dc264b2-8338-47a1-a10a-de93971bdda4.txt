Usually take a chance with other Supercuts..but this place was clean, modern, and most importantly I got a great haircut.  Darci totally listened to what I wanted and did it quickly and beautifully.  Went late morning Monday..No Wait..and the best $15.00 haircut.  Next time, plan on taking advantage of their color.
