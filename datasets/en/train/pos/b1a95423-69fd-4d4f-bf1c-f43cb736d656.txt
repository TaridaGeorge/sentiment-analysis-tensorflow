Delicious! Great service! Our server was very accommodating and told me that I could pretty much order my pho custom made to my specs, with a specific noodle and how much broth, meat and so on..... We have yet to go back since our last visit in the Spring because it's been too darn hot! We'll definitely become regulars when the weather drops below 90! :D
