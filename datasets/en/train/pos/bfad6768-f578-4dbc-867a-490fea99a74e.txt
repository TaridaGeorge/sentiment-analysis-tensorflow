Believe the hype.  Just moved to this part of town recently and am now frequenting this place whenever I can (since they close at 4pm).  The fact that I can get amazing, fresh, natural, often organic and local food, in a drive thru is awesome.  This place is very small but it doesn't matter because it's all good and usually pretty quick (considering what you get).  I even ordered soup when it was 105 degrees just because i wanted to try everything!  And I don't mind paying extra cuz it's always fresh, delicious and they're friendly (and cute) so why not.  You probably drive by it all the time and don't even notice it, but you're missing out.  Can't wait to try their dinner entrees (even though they close at 4pm) they also have a lot of breakfast stuff and smoothies and coffees too.
