I chose El Chorro for my wedding reception and it was the best decision we made!  Caroline, the event coordinator, did everything I needed her to do and more while being absolutely a pleasure to work with.  The food, ambience, service, bar were all exceptional!  We received so many compliments on our venue selection and hope to throw many more parties here over the years.
