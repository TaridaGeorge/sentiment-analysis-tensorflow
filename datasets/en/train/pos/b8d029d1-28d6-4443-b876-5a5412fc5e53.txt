Bought a weighted vest here and upon trying it out at home, I determined that it didn't fit right. I had read online that they did not accept returns, so I was a little bit skeptical when I took it back to exchange it for a used olympic lifting bar I had seen there. They gladly exchanged it for me! I have no complaints about the experience.

This shop has lots of useful stuff that larger chain stores like dicks, sports authority etc do not carry - kettlebells (cheapest I have seen ANYWHERE), pylo boxes, lifting gear. I will be back!!!
