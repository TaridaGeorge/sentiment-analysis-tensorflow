Queen Creek Olive Mill makes world class olive oil and they are excellent at sharing their point of differentiation with their casual tour of the grounds.  

They share the process of making olive oil and review surprising facts about the olive industry and how and why they have entered the olive trade.

Of course there is great food to be had upon the grounds in a pleasant garden atmosphere among their producing olive orchard.  Make sure you don't miss the olive bar with FREE samples which puts AJs and Whole Foods to shame,.........and the best part is, it's ALL made in house.  

If you like olive oil and want to understand why Italy, Spain and Greece are considered premium olives, this tour will answer your question.  Take a drive out when the weather is good and enjoy an brunch or afternoon.
