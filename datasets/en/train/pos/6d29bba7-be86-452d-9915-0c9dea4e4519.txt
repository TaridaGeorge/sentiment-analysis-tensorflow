Just went last night and all I can say is Yahoo Yasu!  If you haven't been get  going!  Great fish and the duck some of the best I had.  Very simple full of flavor.  Music got loud as the night wore on. Portions are small and sharing is a great way to go.  I even think they had Kirin on tap!?!?! I don't drink but that seems cool...Looking forward to trying the $75 Waygu(sp?)
