For those of you who don't know, Pearls was formerly Cheap Thrills, except new name and new location. My girlfriend and I first came across this place while shopping for decor for our new apartment and we've been hooked ever since.

Jeanne, the owner, is simply one-of-a-kind. She is such a great person and has a wonderful eye for all things vintage and retro. If you ever get a chance to sit down and chat with her you won't be disappointed.

The thing I love most about Pearls is that there are always new items to see every time you go in and it's nearly impossible not to fall in love with everything in the store.

Pearls definitely deserves 5 stars!
