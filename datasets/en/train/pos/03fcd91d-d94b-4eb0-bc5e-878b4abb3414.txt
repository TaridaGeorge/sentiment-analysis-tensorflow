Great local coffee house with lots of character and in this land of strip malls, what a relief to find a place to chill that's NOT A CHAIN. Free wifi, funky art on the walls, super friendly staff and owner (he introduced himself to every customer that came in and took an interest in their lives--even us, who don't live here and are just passing through). Light and bright, high ceilings, great vibe. We had a hummus wrap, which was fresh and tasty, and a multigrain waffle with fresh blueberries and maple syrup, which at $5 was a crazy bargain. Coffee was strong and tasty. If I lived in Mesa I'd make this my hang out spot for sure.
