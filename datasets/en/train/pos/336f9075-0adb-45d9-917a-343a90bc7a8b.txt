My husband is from Philly and a major cheesesteak snob...and he won't go anywhere but Forefathers! The cheesesteaks are AMAZING; the fresh meat sliced and cooked to perfection and just oozing with cheese or cheese wiz. As for the sides,  I am partial to the sweet potato fries with their homemade (complimentary) honey mustard sauce, and the hubby enjoys their regular fries with the homemade fry sauce. Although, the fries are not the reason you go to this place.  Great service and fabulous food. Somewhat of an obscure location, so I certainly hope that business is steady enough to keep the place around for the long haul. It was so good that we went here twice in the week that we first tried it.  Yummy!
