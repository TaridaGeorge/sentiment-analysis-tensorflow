If I ever develop diabetes, this shop is seriously responsible and I love it!

The staff is always helpful and makes sure to greet you when you come in. This place is stocked full of every flavor and type of soda you could imagine as well as seltzer waters and retro candies. Plus, they have coolers in the back with some of the sodas already cold and ready for consumption.

I am addicted to Henry Weinhard's Root Beer, Not See Kola, and Red Cola.
