Zia, Eastside and Bookmans are the Trinity when it comes to record stores and its kinda funny and convenient that Zia and Eastside they are like 100 feet away from each other. An AWESOME selection of used CDs and good selection of new. They have tons of DVDs and vinyl.  This is your stop for any CD/DVD needs. The Vinyl selection at Zia is better for your new vinyl needs and not so much for used classic vinyl.  Although the back ally parking is kinda sketchy and I can't get my wife to go with me. Plus its lock that there will be a bum out front asking for money. But its worth parking in murder alley and getting hustled by bums. Still 5 stars.
