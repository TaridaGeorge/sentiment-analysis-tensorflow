I feel like when I walked out of this place, my hipster cred went up just a bit.

A small independent theater in downtown Mesa. I was pretty happy to see they pick up some of those movies that have just a limited release. (I saw Being Elmo.) They also play old movies, which is fun. Seeing a movie on the big screen is always fun and it's nice to have the opportunity to some older ones back up on the screen, even when it is a movie that I may own. (Such as Die Hard, which was playing after my movie.) 

Another note, they have very friendly staff who all seem to care about you having a wonderful movie experience. A really fun time.
