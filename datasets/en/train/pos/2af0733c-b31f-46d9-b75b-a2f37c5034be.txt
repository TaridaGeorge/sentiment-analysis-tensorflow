Great hole-in-the-wall coffee shop with good atmosphere, even if it's in a strip mall.  My step-brother took me to his local brew house the day after Christmas.  We sat at the outside tables and had good early morning convo.  

I had the french press coffee: House Blend and French Roast -- both fantastic.  Being from San Francisco, I liked it so much I felt compelled to buy a pound and bring it home.  I kept getting whiffs of the tasty aroma coming from my carry-on, causing me to salivate like Pavlov's dogs.
