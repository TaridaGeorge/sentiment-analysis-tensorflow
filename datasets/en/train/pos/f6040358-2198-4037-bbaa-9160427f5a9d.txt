BevMo is like Christmas and chocolate and kittens and angel cum. In my mouth. I want to twirl down the aisles while Andy Williams sings "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year." 

The bottles, they are like beautiful jewels.

The staff, they teach me things to make me sound smart. I am better for knowing them. 

The unicorns in Aisle D-4 (don't let them tell you there isn't an aisle D-4!), they make me smell better.

I am certain that, if only I can drink my way through all their exquisite libations, I will find the entrance to Shangri-la hidden beneath their display of 5 cent wine. I will swipe my magical membership card, the doors will swing wide, and I will be admitted into paradise. 

I write these words in the hope that they will guide you on your pilgrimage. Visit BevMo! Try everything! Achieve alcoholic transcendence!
