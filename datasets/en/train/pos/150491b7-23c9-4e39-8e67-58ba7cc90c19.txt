Well, this was my first time in Gilbert and my friend Amy took me here after we were off-roading all afternoon and it was nice to pull into this chill laid back spot.

They have a good selection of wine & beer and the food is pretty tasty and reasonably priced too.  I didn't get to try the carrot cake or red velvet cakes which looked delectable but heard that they both rocked so I'll have to check those out on my return visit whenever that might be...
