They have a steer named Horny. Seriously, a live long horn just chilling outside the restaurant. I am not sure if this is a beef freshness indicator or just for the kids, but it is a cool touch nonetheless. The view of the sunset was fabulous. This place screams rustic wild west while yielding gourmet five star fare. Thank you for a fantastic finale to our work trip.
