I cannot say enough good things about Mike, Brice and the guys at Greulichs.  My car in in for its second major repair in a year and they were so easy to deal with, worked with me and most important?  Did a great job and DIDN'T rip me off.  They worked with my crappy warranty company and fought to get new parts - not the used parts the warranty co. wanted to stick me with.  They will always have my family's business!
