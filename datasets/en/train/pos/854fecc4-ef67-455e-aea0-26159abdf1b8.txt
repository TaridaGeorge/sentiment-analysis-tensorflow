Best sushi place I've eaten at in the area. I've had Kabuki, Sakana, and Raw and this is by far the most authentic and least "Americanized" sushi place. They even have soba noodles and the appetizers are great (the sauce tastes authentic too). I had the agedashi tofu, fried oyster, mixed tempura, spider roll, and eel&cucumber roll, which were all very good and very filling. I got my order to go and they were really nice about it, packing it so that it didn't lose its taste. Will definitely be coming back!
