I have visted Anita for a few years now to get my eyebrows threaded. 
Before I saw her, I used to get them waxed, which ended up pulling on my skin and now at 40, I have some loose skin under my brows.
Thanks to Anita, I no longer have to worry about waxing. Her threading technique has shaped my unruly brows better than wax or tweezers. She gave me the brows I always wanted. Her prices are very reasonable.  And she is always so polite and a joy. I also took my teenage daughter to see her. She was using accutane, and the natural thread would not irritate her skin like waxing.
After my session, she uses natural rose water on the area that was threaded. This gives me no irritation.
I highly reccommend Anita, she is very expierenced, reasonable and FABULOUS.
