I moved to Scottsdale in Jan. and tried a few places before LUCKILY coming across Kara!!! I have worked in the spa industry for the past 10 years and she is the best person I have ever been to for waxing. I had the worst experience ever at MOZAIK and would never recommend anyone to go there. Not only was my wax completely botched and left me with peeled off skin everywhere, I had to follow up with my complaint with the owner twice who made me feel like I had done something wrong. 
Not only is Kara professional she also keeps a clean environment, and is extremely knowledgeable. Her technique is painless and super clean( she gets every hair). Do not try other people Kara is your girl for facials and waxing! A+++++++
