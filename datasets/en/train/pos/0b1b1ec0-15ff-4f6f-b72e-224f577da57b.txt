This is the best library in the valley. Although it's not the most accessible, and for me going means trekking down Scottsdale Road...I feel that this library is worth every effort. It's modern in design, staffed with wonderful, knowledgeable, and well-read individuals, and provides every nook-and-cranny you could ever expect a library to do. Civic Center soars to new heights!

The library is large and expansive, and located amongst other cool things in downtown Scottsdale which give it an all-around good vibe. It's large enough to accommodate a mass amount of people comfortably, and provides numerous cubicles and carol's for study. The collection here is every growing and extremely resourceful, not to mention organized and well-structured. Covered parking is a plus!

Needless to say, this is my absolute favorite library in the Valley, it blows Burton Barr away!
