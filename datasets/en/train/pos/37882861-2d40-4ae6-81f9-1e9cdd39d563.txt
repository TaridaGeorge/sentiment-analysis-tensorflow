Any criticism of the Picture Show is far outweighed by the reasonable concession prices-  and i think even a little cheaper than others at the box office!  It makes a family movie reasonable and I have never encountered a friendlier, service-oriented staff at a movie theater!  They offer you boxes to share the big refillable tub of popcorn and offer to help you to seats if your hands are too full. There was even an employee who wasn't working that saw I would have a hard time opening the door into my theater and she detoured from her show to help me in the door to mine!

I'm always loyal to local businesses and in Phoenix that means i try to frequent Harkins.  While I don't really know the corporate structure of Picture Show it feels family-run and I LOVE IT!
