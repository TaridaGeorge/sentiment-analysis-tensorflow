I love this place too!  Sure it is a chain, but everything they have is wonderful.  I mostly go there to pick up breakfast I really love the Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata it has eggs, ham, brie, sauteed apples, sage and leeks, served with Wildflower Home Fries and buttered toast... so yummy.  There soups are very good and so are the sandwiches that I have tried.  As for the pasta dishes my favorite is the butternut squash ravioli... to die for!  Also at this particular location they sell certain items by the quart like their soups and meatballs with sauce and it is a good option if you are looking to make a quick pasta dinner.
