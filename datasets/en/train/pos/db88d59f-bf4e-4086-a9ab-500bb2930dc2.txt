One of the top 10 dining experiences I have had. 
Attentive service. Deliciously prepared foods with unique flavours. Everything was spectacular - from the custom prickly pear cocktail I requested, the way the cod was perfectly cooked, to the intriguing foie gras concoction, which had a foie gras ice cream sandwich, strawberry marshmallow, and foie gras on top of finely diced strawberries. 
I like this place and would absolutely come back next time I'm in Scottsdale. 
Emphatically Recommended!
