We go there all the time and love the red vegetable with extra fry bread with powder sugar.  They have lots of drink options on tap, but we prefer the ice cold water they make available.  

Right next door is a great coffee shop that you can finish up dinner.

Now the service is not the best, but you may get a smile if you crack a joke, but they definitely have some great authentic fry bread!
