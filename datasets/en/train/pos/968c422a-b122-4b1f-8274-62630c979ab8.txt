Ok, so I just tried this place after reading all the good reviews.

Like someone mentioned before, the Lovely Bit O Salmon is awesome.  Of course I didn't get that, but my coworker did and it made me jealous!  I got the Spicy Asiago Chicken and although it was really good, it was nothing like the taste I had of the salmon pasty.  I will have to get that salmony creamy goodness next time. 

These things will fill you up.  I felt like I needed a nap after my pasty lunch!
