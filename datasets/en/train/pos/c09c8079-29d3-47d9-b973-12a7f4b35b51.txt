I have been going to Shogun for over 10 years and I'm a huge fan. The service is always very friendly and the food does not disappoint. Get the godzilla tails or chicken over udon noodles.

Best time to go: HAPPY HOUR. You can get godzilla tails for 5$ also the sushi is half off. The beer and sake are next to nothing. GO!!!!!!
