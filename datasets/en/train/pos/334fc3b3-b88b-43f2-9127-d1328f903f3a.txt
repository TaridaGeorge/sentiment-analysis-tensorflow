I have been here a million times over the years and have not met one person who doesn't love Wildflower. That includes my grandma who is a rather picky woman. Their service is great. The food is wonderful. And it connected to Changing Hands Book Store which is a fun little shop even if you're not looking for a book. 

As for food, I recommend potato cream cheese soup bread bowl. It sounds weird but trust me, it's amazing. For salad, I'm hooked on their Thai chicken salad. I really like their iced tea too. 

Wildflower is the kind of place you can just get a quick lunch or spend the afternoon reading, doing homework or chatting it up with friends.
