Los Dos Molinos, you are like my exgirlfriend.

Ridiculously HOT. Soooo tasty that I can't resist going back for more. Kicking me in the balls at every opportunity. A major attitude problem from knowing that you're all that and that if I dump you you'll just replace me with another customer without another thought. You even treat my friends like crap. You made one wait for 20 minutes today because he was honest enough to say there were 2 in his party but I was late. Totally pissed him off with your "we won't seat you until you're all here" policy. So arrogant. No wonder I've sworn to all my friends that I will never come back to you again. 

Did I mention that you're ridiculously hot? I love you.
