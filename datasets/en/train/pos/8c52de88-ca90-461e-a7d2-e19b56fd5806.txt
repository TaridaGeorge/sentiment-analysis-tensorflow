Dr Pirotte and his staff have been taking care of our animals since we moved to Scottsdale almost 15 years ago.. several pets later we are still happy patients. Absolutely no complaints about their staff or care. Cannot say enough good stuff about this office- please check them out if you are in need of a vet in the area!
