Holy cow, the food here is amazing!

Just a small quick eat place with super fresh and healthy food. They have very a very creative menu with options for just about everyone's diet, including vegi, vegan, and gluten free.

Very friendly service, from people that seem to love working there.

I recommend the cali club the ingredients sound strange, but trust me, it works. Check out the photo that someone has posted of it.

Highly recommended, its a must do in Scottsdale.
