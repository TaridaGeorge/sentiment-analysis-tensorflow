I love this place! My husband and I go about twice a month for date night. Sometimes we sit at the bar to get the entertainment factor. You'll know what I mean when you go and I ain't talking about the live music. For a more romantic cozy dinner we sit in the dining room. The lobster mashed potatoes are a delight to the senses!  Anything on the menu is delicious. I love the 12 oz filet, it only cost a few bucks more than the 6 oz so it is a better "deal". The place is not cheap, But it is by far the most delicious steak and seafood you will ever eat!  The butter cake with fresh berries and made to order whipped cream is a heavenly dream. What are you waiting for!  Get in your car and go!!!!!
