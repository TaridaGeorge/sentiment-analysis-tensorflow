"Best Late Night Burger spot in Phoenix" as voted by Eric M of Yelp.

Portions are huge so split a burger with a date and a shopping cart full of fries with their amazing dipping sauces. Then sit back and enjoy some great local beers or whatever else they have on tap since they have a full bar until closing time. 

If you're ending your night here and just eating, get a milkshake. Seriously, when can you ever go wrong getting a milkshake. 

Sure food is more pricey here, but you won't get the patio dinning or late night crowd experience from your car of the [insert cheap fast food chain] parking lot, or the amazing fresh, "all-natural" grain fed beef. It's worth it.

Protip: Let the waiter know your sharing and they'll split the burger for you and give you an extra plate.
