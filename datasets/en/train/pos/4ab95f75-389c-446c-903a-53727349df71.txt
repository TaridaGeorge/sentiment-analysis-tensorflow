I love a good cobbler and was so pleased to find Boris. I have a penchant for expensive shoes and rescue dogs, not a match made in heaven! Boris took a pair of terribly mauled Donald Pliner sandals and reworked them so one would never know they had been dog fodder. Boris charges a fair price and gets the work done on time. He is one of those rare repair guys who could probably make shoes, not just stick on new heels!
