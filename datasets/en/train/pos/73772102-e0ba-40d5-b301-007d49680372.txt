This place is a home-run.  I knew as I walked in the door.  Archtecture is killer.  Barternder is a pro (known him from other places).

Food was fantastic, and very reasonably priced.

If you like like AZ88, anything from Craig DiMarco, Hanny's, Anything from Chris Bianco... you will love this new restaurant.
