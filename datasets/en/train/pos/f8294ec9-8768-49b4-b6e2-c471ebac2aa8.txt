Hands down the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. I wasn't really even in the mood for pizza but my date was and he suggested Barro's. I'm so glad I went!!

The food is unbelievable. I ordered a medium Kona Pizza (Teriyaki sauce, chicken, pineapple). With 8 slices, it was more then enough for me alone and I was happy I got to take some home. YUM. 

The atmosphere is a typical pizza joint: clean, friendly, and welcoming. Wait time is average but worth it for these pizzas!

Prices are a little higher then you'd spend at Pizza Hut but only by about $10. Indulge! You won't regret it.
