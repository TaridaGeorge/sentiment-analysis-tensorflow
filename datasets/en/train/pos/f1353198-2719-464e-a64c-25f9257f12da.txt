I don't remember the service - aside from the pregnant waitress, the food or the beer.

I do remember looking at all the ladies in the bar area wondering why the HELL they were dressed to the slut-acular 9's. 

Then it hit me: they're trying to pick up the guys who can't make it with the waitresses.

Clever, and a little sad... and that makes for awesome AWESOME awesome people viewing! It's sooo much better than the airport!!!
