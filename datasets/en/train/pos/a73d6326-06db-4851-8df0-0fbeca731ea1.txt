Great food and drinks. The patio area is amazing for those nice cool PHX nights. Even in the summer it is nice and cool on the patio with their misters. I met the chef and he was a great person. The food he comes up with is crazy good. The mac n' cheese is one of my favorites and the Shrimp Tempura BLT was phenomenal!
