Millennium Day Spa is great for haircuts and other spa beauty treatments.  I will admit I've only gone for my hair stylist, Mandy, but she is so fantastic, I'm giving the place 5 stars.  She is very artistic and knows a lot of good things to do with color.  I've been going to Mandy for many years now and have sent many friends her way because she is fantastic in such a way as to accomodate all types of hair styles and tastes.
