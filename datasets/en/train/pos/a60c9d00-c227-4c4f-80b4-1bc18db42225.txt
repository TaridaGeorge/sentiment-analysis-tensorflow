I've actually not been to any of the other locaitons, but the Sakana in Mesa is fabulous.  Their sushi is always fresh, their portions are insane, and their daily specials are YUMMY.

I'm sort of a regular there, I guess, but more of a carry-out regular than anything else.  The owner calls me by my name and knows what kind of beer I want while I wait for my carry out order.  

This place is one of the few things I'll miss about moving away from E. Mesa...
