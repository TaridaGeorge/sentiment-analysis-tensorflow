Quiet, secluded, elegant, old Spanish, luxurious. Excellent restaurant and lounge with live music. Beautiful pool with cafe. Fantastic service at every level.  Perfect getaway. Five star hotel, but some real bargain prices available during July and August when it's inconceivably hot (temperatures were 110-ish on the weekend I was there).
