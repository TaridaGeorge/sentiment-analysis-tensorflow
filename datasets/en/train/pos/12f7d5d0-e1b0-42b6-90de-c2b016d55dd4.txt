I am so jealous of this stadium.  Very pretty.  It truly is Superbowl worthy.  Went here for my first Monday Night Football game ever...I think.  Loved it.  It's huuuuuge.  The retracting roof is awesome.  Everything looks brand new.  And much to my surprise, there were TONS of Niner fans there.  I'm pretty sure it was just the MNF crowd, but still.  I felt very safe, and very much at home...or at least wishing it was my home stadium.  All in all, it was an awesome experience, capped off with an awesome game that came to the very last play with 2 secs left.  Cardinals won 29-24.
