I'll never forget my first Urban Cookie. I was checking out after a successful day of shopping at Frances (my favorite boutique), when the girl behind the counter offered me some cookies they had out on a tray. I hesitated at first (because I was worried about fitting the new skinny jeans I had just bought) but gave in after little persuasion.

It was love at first bite. After buying my jeans, I rushed immediately to Urban Cookie and bought one of every kind. Although it was close, Urban Trail was my favorite. 

I really can't help myself, I keep going back for more (plus the owner is super cute). 

I love urban cookie!
