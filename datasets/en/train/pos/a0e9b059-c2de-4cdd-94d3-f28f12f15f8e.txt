You will love the pizza here, unless you're some sort of east coast pizza snob that thinks all pizza should be the same.  The toppings are very high quality, and the crust is awesome.  They have very creative and different styles of pizza, so you have to keep an open mind.  I'd highly recommend the Egg & Pancetta, Buffalo Chicken, or the Yukon Gold Hot Potato Pie pizzas.  While you're there, grab a pint of the Papago Breweries Orange Blossom Wheat Beer, you will not be disappointed!
