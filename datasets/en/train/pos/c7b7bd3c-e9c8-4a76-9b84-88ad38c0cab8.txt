Hands down 5 stars, no questions asked.

This place has the freshest fish in the valley by far, or for that matter some of the freshest fish I think I've ever had.

The service is impeccable, recommendations are amazing... wait, everything here is amazing! 

If you try the Foie Gras with Japanese Eggplant though be fully prepared to order another serving as the stuff.....is......so...........awe......so...me.....

I'm daydreaming now, thanks yelp.
