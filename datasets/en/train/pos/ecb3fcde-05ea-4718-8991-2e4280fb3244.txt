Rudy, Rudy, RUDY....

I don't know which will make that name more famous, that ex-fighting Irish inspiration or this slow-cooked, smoked deliciousness.

This ain't a sticky sweet BBQ sauce kind of a joint.  The meat brings most of the flavor, the sauces just add a bit of heat and spice.  Brisket as tender as a Jane Austen novel.  Portions as big as Texas.  Prices fit for Arizona.  

I'm already starting the Rudy chant for my next visit.
