I go here several times every month.  For lunch and dinner.  I have never been disappointed.   Burgers, sandwiches, hot dogs and fries.  It is all good.  

My favorite is the Mexi-burger.  Fresh salsa, avocado, bacon, pepper jack and much more.  A great burger.

And then there is the great collection of soda.  My wife loves the fact that they carry her favorite "Rock n Rye" Faygo pop.  Straight from MI.

This place is definitely worth checking out.
