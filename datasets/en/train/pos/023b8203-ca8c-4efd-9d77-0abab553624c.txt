I just feasted at this place for the first time. My friend Flaco Feathers recommended it to me and I can't thank him enough. Everything looked awesome and tasted even better. The sushi was a thousand times better than Ra and Kona Grill. The yellow tail was delicious and so was the hamachi kama. I think I will probably have to eat here at least once a week and I live in central Phoenix. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for fresh and tasty sushi.
