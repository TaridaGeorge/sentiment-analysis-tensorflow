I recently leased my first new car in 12 years. The dealership told me to have my first service performed at 5,000 miles, so I stopped in here to get it done. The mechanic took a look at it, came back 5 minutes later, and asked me if I was aware that my car didn't need its first service until 7,500 miles. I was not aware! He still checked my fluid levels for free, sent me on my way, and told me to come back after another 2500 miles. I definitely will.
