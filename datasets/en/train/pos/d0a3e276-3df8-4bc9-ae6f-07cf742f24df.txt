These guys were referred to me by a friend who was very satisfied with their price and service.  They put on a whole new roof for me and I too was more than pleased and have since referred them to others.  Another home we own has a small leak from last week's storm.  I called New Life this afternoon, they remembered who I was, and they are coming to look at my problem Wednesday.  If my future experience with this company changes, I will update the review but my experience with New Life Roofing has been excellent.
