Stopped in here for dinner the other day and had a great experience.  My girlfriend and I ordered the dinner special combo.  It came with Won Ton soup, Pu Pu platter, pork fried rice and for dishes we ordered chicken chow mein with white meat chicken and the qwik schezwan beef.  My favorites were the won ton soup, the steak skewer in the pu pu platter, and the chow mein.  This was more than enough food for both of us and had left overs for lunch the next day.  The owner was there and was extremely friendly.  It's always fun to support family run places.  I would definitely recommend this place look for traditional Chinese food in the area.  We will definitely be back.
