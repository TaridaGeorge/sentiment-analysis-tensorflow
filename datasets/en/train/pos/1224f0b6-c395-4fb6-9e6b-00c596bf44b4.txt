If you want a great pet boutique that is discriminating in the quality of goods, foods and treats, AND practices social responsibility, this is your shop!  Chris, owner of Oliver & Annie, will not carry a product whose company does not contribute to animal causes.  And he runs rescue endeavors himself.  His store is top notch and the service is excellent!
