I am extremely pleased with the service here.  After having a disastrous experience at another optical store (large chain optical store) it is great to find an optical store who know what they are doing and have an excellent quality product.  I am very pleased with my 1.67 high index lenses, both in sunglasses that I purchased here and my normal everyday glasses.  Would highly recommend Ocotillo Eyecare.  Emily and Bronagh are awesome, extremely helpful and knowledgeable.   Will definitely be returning here.
