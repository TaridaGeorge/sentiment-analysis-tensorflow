A real gem, hidden behind a Starbucks in a strip mall in North Scottsdale. Minimalist decor was soothing and service excellent. No sushi rolls, just delicious well prepared Japanese food. Restaurants in Scottsdale are often expensive and mediocre, but ShinBay delivers on every level. If you love fresh well prepared sushi and other Japanese delicacies, then this is the place for you.
