Was in town for a seminar that was held here so my friend and I decided to room here also. We didn't regret it at all. Great place with clean rooms. 2 Large swimming pools. One decent gym. Tennis court. The 4th Grill is a nice place to grab something to eat and watch sports games in their sport bar. They have FREE happy hour at the main cafeteria/cafe? I'm not sure what to call it but damn, free happy hour is awesome. LOL

I'll definitely come back if I'm ever in town.
