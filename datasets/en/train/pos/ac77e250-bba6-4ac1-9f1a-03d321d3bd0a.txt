Fantastic happy hour, one of the best in Scottsdale. All the sushi, tempura, and saki you can eat and drink with good portions of it half off! My wife loves the fancy girly martinis that are half off during happy hour as well. A stellar experience at any price point. A word of warning, the place isn't the biggest and fills up fast, make a reservation.
