This boutique has a lot of really cute and unique items. A bit overpriced, but you won't find styles like these in many places, so I think it's worth the splurge. Also, the store manager at this location is wonderful. Very outgoing and attentive, she made the shopping experience top notch. My mom was visiting from out of town and we had a great time trying on outfits and visiting with the manager. Great experience!
