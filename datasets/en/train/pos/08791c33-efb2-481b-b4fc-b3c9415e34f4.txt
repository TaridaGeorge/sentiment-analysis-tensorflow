I have eaten here several times.  It is my little slice of the French Quarter in Scottsdale.  The beignets were as good as they get...especially with the sauces that come with them.  
I have also had the escargot which were superb, as well as the onion tart and the salmon, also great.  
For lunch, I have had the burger and it rocks, seriously!...oh, did I say the beignets were amazing?!
Each time I have been there, the service has been great.  I love sitting outside on their patio...it has great atmosphere!
