Fresh beer, good food, always a nice crowd. What's to dislike?

Alright, so the parking is a little bit of a pain. Sometimes it involves a 10 minute search-and-walk. And yes, it does get loud - but that's part of why you go. The atmosphere is always friendly and casual, and to be honest a hell of a lot like the atmosphere you get at a great German beer hall like Hofbrauhaus.

The food is always on point, the specials never fail, and the fries are terrific. But the real reason you come is for the beer, and that is top notch microbrew. I am particularly fond of the Kiltlifter, the Oatmeal Stout, and the 8th Street Pale Ale, but they're all fresh and they're all good, so don't worry - just pick one.
