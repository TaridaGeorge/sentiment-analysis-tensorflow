Amazing Italian food! The location in a strip mall is a little misleading, but don't be put off by it. Inside it is a cozy, romantic restaurant. Servers are very friendly and knowledgeable, and there are always a LOT of chef specials. Seafood is always a good choice, and my roommate swears by their chicken parm. Most recently I had an appetizer of crab cakes, which were delicious, and a chef-special scallop dish. Everything was incredibly flavorful and cooked perfectly. Most of the entrees run between $10-25, but they are so worth! Great wine selection, and I love finishing dinner with some amaretto. Definitely my favorite romantic date/special occasion spot!
