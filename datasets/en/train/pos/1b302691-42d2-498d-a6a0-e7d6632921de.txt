It's PetCo, right? What could I possible say positive about a big box pet store when my heart loves shopping local? 

Well, I tried my favorite local store and they didn't carry newborn kitten formula so I could feed my 4 little kittens found in a dumpster. So we went to this PetCo and MAN they were helpful. I mean, beyond helpful.

They pointed us to what we needed. They rang us up. And than... they asked if we wanted to feed the kittens right there. Oh my! For those unfamiliar with kitten bottles... you have to put a hole in the nipple yourself. And guess what? PetCo staff did that FOR us! They also mixed up the powder formula and I just cannot say enough positive things about the wonderful staff here.
