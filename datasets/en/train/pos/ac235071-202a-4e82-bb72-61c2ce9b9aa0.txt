I love, love, love this restaurant.  We were in town visiting people in Phoenix for 3 days, and we went here 3 times.  Incredible.  Insane pizza (they use Tease, which is magnificent), delicious "chicken ranchero" salad, which happens to be gluten-free (incredible) and an amazing bbq chicken sandwich.  One caveat:  it's possible to have mock meat overload here, so follow the lead of the venue's name and order something green, too!
