This place is such a nice break from ....well...every place else? You DO get what you what you pay for. The art, for the record is NOT the attraction. The location is a wierd place near the biltmore is So So. Atmosphere and drinks are killer.
Yay for Merc. Yay for no smoking. Seriously people, it causes cancer.
