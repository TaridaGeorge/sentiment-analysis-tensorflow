Street vendor virgin no more! This place was everything I hoped it would be.  Only serving one item = getting deliciousness every time. The service was fast and friendly and I love that they are open late on a Sunday night even! Most importantly, the condiments were fresh, tasty and clean. If you like hot dogs you really can't go wrong by giving this place a try.
