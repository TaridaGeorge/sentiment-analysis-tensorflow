This review is specifically for the trail off 24th street.  I train for the Grand Canyon on this trail and I believe it's the perfect spot for training because as soon as you leave the parking lot you being to ascend the mountain.  During the week I'd hike before work and all I had time for was a mile in and a mile out.  On the weekends though was my time to explore the mountain and test my stamina.  

The only downside is the mountain bikers.  Like a good little hiker I always give them the right-of-way but I've nearly been run down by these fools a couple of times.
