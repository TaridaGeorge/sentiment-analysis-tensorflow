This is as good as it gets!!! I would eat here everyday if I could! I live in Chicago and since the chain is not out here, I am out of luck on that note.. However, with my Dad being in Chandler everytime I go out there I make sure I make it to Lees! I cant believe how inexpensive the sandwiches are and the baguettes and croissants are of quality you would find in France!! YUMMMMMM
