When I was a little kid I used to love field trips out to Cerreta's.  Twenty years later I'm still a huge fan of the French Mints and anything including walnuts or pecans.  It's a local classic.

The candies are still great, it's fun to stop in and step in the door and get a strong whiff of chocolate.  It takes you back to being a little kid again.
