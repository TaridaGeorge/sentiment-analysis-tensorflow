I have been coming to Baby Kay's for many years.  My wife and I moved to North Scottsdale a few years ago and would only make it down to Baby Kay's maybe once or twice a year.  About two weeks ago we were craving that crawfish sauce so we headed down...I'm so glad we did!  Food was amazing as usual!  On a Saturday night it was just the right crowd....it really reminds me of New Orleans.  I just found out it is under new ownership... Twin sisters and they were both working that night and they were great.  I really feel Baby Kay's is the best cajun in the state of Arizona!   I'm heading down now for the Monday special "Beer Battered Shrimp with Crawfish sauce and dirty rice"  Where else would I find this???
