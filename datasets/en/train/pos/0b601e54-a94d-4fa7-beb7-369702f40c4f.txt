What amazing service! Their service sets them apart from all other Thai restaurants in the area. Authentic dishes are made to order. We went with a large group, and every person was happy with the food and experience. I highly recommend visiting them

NOTE: Their sign above the building actually says 'Pink Pepper', but the door says Tara Thai.
