We came here with a large group from work and had a great time, great food and great customer service.   Most of us ordered the lunch special - half a sandwich and soup and plaintains or tostones.  The cuban sandwich and garbanzo bean soup I had were really good.  The customer service was excellent.  Some of our group arrived later and so were looking kind of hungry when the food began to arrive - moments later the server stopped by with tostones for them to snack on while the waited.  The owners stopped by say hello too.  

Enjoy this small, local business!
