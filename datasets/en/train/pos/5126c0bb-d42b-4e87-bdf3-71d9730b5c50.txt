Ahi tacos were perfect but I needed one more tortilla. Rice and beans were great too, and it all fit together masterfully. I will definitely be back. This was one of the best meals I've eaten in a long time. On the downside, we sat outside directly under one of the cooling mist makers and ended up soaked.
