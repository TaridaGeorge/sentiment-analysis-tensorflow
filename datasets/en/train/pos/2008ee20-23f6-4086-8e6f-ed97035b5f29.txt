Pane Bianco is no secret and I stop here often. I know I have tried other sandwiches over the years, but I crave his tuna. The freshly made bread is fabulous. And on a perfect day, I'll bring the dog(s), catch up with a friend over lunch, watch the time stretch out with coffee and dessert from Lux. Back in the day, we'd also stop in the boutique, pick up some locally made jewelry (or a dress one time). 

Every time, I promise myself to save half a sandwich to take home. Sometimes I even wrap it up. But I always eat it before I leave.

Does Chris really remember me from twenty-odd years ago, stalking him to each new place, or is he just being nice?
