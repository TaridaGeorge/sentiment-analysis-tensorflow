We were on our way to dick's hideaway, but the husband need sunscreen from the Walgreens.  I waited in the car and read yelp reviews.  Thank you yelp!  You pointed me to los taquitos.  The dollar tacos are now served all day on Tuesdays.  However they are only for meat tacos.  I opted for the veggie burrito.  So good with the potatoes.  I had it smothered style with green sauce.  The green sauce was spicy.  The rice was good.  The beans were salty.  My prickly pear margarita helped with that.  It came unblended.  I was sad about that, but it ended up being really good.  Service was awesome.
