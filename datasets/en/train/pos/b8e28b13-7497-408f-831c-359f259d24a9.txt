Best Thai in Tempe!

The people are soooo friendly and everything is delicious!  Definitely get the spring rolls, coconut soup, any curry, pad thai, chili garlic veggies... really everything is fantastic!    I could eat their green or peanut curry everyday!

Everything always comes out hot, is fresh, and is consistently amazing!

One tip:  If you order curry, I do think you get more if you order it to-go!
