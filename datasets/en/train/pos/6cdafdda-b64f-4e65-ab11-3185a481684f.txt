Chicken and Waffles? Who would have thought?

I'm not sure how to sum it up except just a fun little place with great food! The waffles and homefries were my favorite (not much of a fried chicken person, but someone with me said it was good).

They serve Kool-aid, lemonaide, soda, etc...in a big mason jar. It's just that kind of place.

It's a must-do as food goes in Phoenix. It reminded me of the south.
