Rita is the Queen of Hoagies. The best this side of the Schuylkill. Loaded with meat. They only need a better dressing.
Cheesesteaks are authenic also, none of the Cheeze Whiz junk on them.
Recommended highly, tell Mark thet Larry from Philly sent you.
Lots of Philadelphia memorabilia hanging on the wall.
