Do you know what "scampi" really is? 
I learned new food fact at Marcellino this week, something I should have known, but most of us probably don't. "Scampi" is an animal - a type of lobster that looks a lot like a shrimp. I've always assumed "scampi" was the shrimp in butter and garlic dish, but it turns out that is an American bastardization of the term. Real scampi is a particular type of lobster - not very common and very expensive, which is probably how the shrimp and garlic bit happened along. BTW, Marcellino's REAL scampi is lovely, served grilled "on the half shell". Plan on sucking all the tasty bits off the shell.
