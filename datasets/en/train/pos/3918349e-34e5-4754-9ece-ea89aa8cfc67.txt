This is the place for grass-fed beef and top-notch pork. Oh, and lamb, too...that's their new thing. The Meat Shop is outstanding. They've got reasonable prices (though I strongly recommend visiting for the weekly specials), high quality, and spectacular customer service every time I've ever been in, which is quite often. This is the place for meat.
