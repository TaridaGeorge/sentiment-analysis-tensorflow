Out of the three discount theaters in the Valley, this is the best. I realize it's a bit run down but for $2.00 a seat, it's the best deal in town. A few weeks ago I took my family to see The Tale of Despereaux at the local Harkins. After popcorn, soda and candy, it was $60.00. Dark Knight in IMAX is worth the money, not a 2 hour cartoon you can rent for a buck in 2 months.

We went to see Bolt last weekend at Tempe Cinema and it was $20.00 for all 4 of us including popcorn, candy and drinks. I really can't tell too much of a difference once the movie starts. The sound isn't as good and the seats aren't as comfortable but who cares.
