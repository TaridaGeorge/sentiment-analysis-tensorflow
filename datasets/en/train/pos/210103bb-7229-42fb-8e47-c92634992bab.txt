What a wonderful experience! Yes it was pricey, but oh was it yummy! All the servers bustling around you are continuously bring you more and more food. More then you one person can consume! The salad bar was unbelievably stocked with delicious things, several kinds of delicious cheeses, cured meats and veggies! When you sit back down and they start bringing you meat it is almost overwhelming. This is how meat should always be served, one hot mouthwatering piece at a time. Our plates were never empty. Then they bring out the cheese popovers, friend bananas, creamy mashed potatoes and friend polenta! OMG! Everything was fantastic and everyone stuffed themselves to the point we all had the "meat sweats" and waddled out! I will go there for a special treat again and again!!!
