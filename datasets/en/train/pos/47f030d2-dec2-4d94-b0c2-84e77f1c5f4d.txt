Hands down - the best sushi on the planet.

This is one of my neighborhood favorites.  Whenever we have family in town, we are sure to bring them here.  I had to give my cousin (a sushi virgin) a stern warning though - "you will not be able to find sushi like this elsewhere and may find yourself making frequent trips out to AZ just for the sushi" (she lives in PA).  I love the ASU roll, the Vegas roll, the salmon nigiri, the escolar nigiri, the toro nigiri, the dragon roll, the booty booty roll.  Aside from the incredible symphony of flavors that they are able to create in their rolls, this family owned and operated business has one of the best deserts out there.  Their tempura ice cream with strawberries, bananas, whipped cream and chocolate sauce is a sweet end to an incredible meal.
