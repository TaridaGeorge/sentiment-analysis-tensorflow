I looooove Trader Joe's! From your "Two Buck Chuck" to your Sutter's cookies, I love your stuff! 

Today was the first time I've ventured to the Glendale location. I was up in this area doing a little shopping-shopping, and saw your neon sign (okay it wasn't neon). But I saw your sign, and just knew that I could pick up some good snacks for my trip back home. 

It was around 5pm, and parking wasn't an issue. Traffic was pretty steady inside the store, but there weren't any bad lines like I've experienced at others. 

It was just a quick visit for me today, but in general I dig your low prices and wide selection of items that I just can't find anywhere else!
