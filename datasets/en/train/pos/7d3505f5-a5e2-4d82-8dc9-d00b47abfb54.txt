My husband and I love the crab and artichoke dip, but we make sure to substitute the focaccia bread - we could make a meal out of that. This is why we always have leftovers from our dinner portions! The creamy mushroom and asparagus pasta is delicious, too, and we sometimes add shrimp to it. The 3 cheese mac n cheese is pretty tasty  as well.
