A great hotel in the middle of one of America's best party towns.  It is not a resort, but you don't go to Tempe to stay in a resort.  We have stayed there many times wit the MoChiChu chiropractic group.  Free airport shuttle saves a few bucks.  Lots of great dining within walking distance.  Love having cocktails by the outdoor fireplace.
