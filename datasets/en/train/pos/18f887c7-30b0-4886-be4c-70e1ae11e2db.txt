I have always liked the Biltmore Fashion Park. I used to live nearby so i have spent a lot of time here.  The stores are always changing as well as the restaurants. Over the years there has been quite a variety. One thing you can always count on here is change. Covered parking in the Garage, valet parking and just regular parking in the back. Lots of chioces!  Saks 5th Ave. has been here for years and is the only one in the Valley. What used to be The Broadway is now Macy's, fabulous!   I miss that there is no Banana Republic here any more, but, always something new. You can walk your  dogs around through here, they have a lot of good events all the time. Even have an Apple store. Good place to walk around on a date as well.
