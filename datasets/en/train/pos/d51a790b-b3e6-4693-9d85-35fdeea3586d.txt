I was there this weekend for the Tempe Beerathalon with my husband who was one of the runners, I think they did  a great job in keeping up the orders for about 150 + people.  It was a Saturday and it was already starting to get busy, but they accommodated the whole group.  

There was a slight confusion on our order, but all was forgiven due to the circumstances.  I was just happy they were able to host the event there.

I had also been here once before after winning a gift certificate for $50.00.  We happen to go during happy hour and we ate and drank so much and it still didn't total the whole amount.  We were so happy that we tipped our waiter 20 bucks, walked to the light rail and just walked around Mill Ave for awhile.
