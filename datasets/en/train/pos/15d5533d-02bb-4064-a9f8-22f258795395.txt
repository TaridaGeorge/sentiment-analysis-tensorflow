A seperate review will be written for Taliesin West itself, but as is the case with the FLW foundation everwhere in America the staff here is superb.  Helpful, dedicated, informative, and truly happy to help others explore the life of a very complicated man.  

I'm thankful for the foundation because otherwise who knows what would have happened to Wright's works in his passing.
