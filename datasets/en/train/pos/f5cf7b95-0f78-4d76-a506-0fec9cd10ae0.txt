Is there such a thing as orgasm in a bowl?  YES!  Crawfish ettouffee at Pappadeaux!
I had no idea this was a chain restaurant, or I probably wouldn't have gone.  I'm a mom-and-pop snob :}
Anyway, we had a party of 6 and had about a half hour wait.  We had reservations.  It was a beautiful night, so sitting out on the patio was no big deal.  The hostess even came by once during our wait to let us know they hadn't forgotten about us!
I don't usually get fried calamari (I prefer non-fried seafood) but it was light and crispy and the calamari wasn't rubbery at all.
Service was great, too.  We never had to ask to have our glasses refilled.
it's a great place for a date or a group!
