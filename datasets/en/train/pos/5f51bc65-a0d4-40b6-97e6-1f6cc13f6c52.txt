Perhaps the best Thai food I've in phoenix. Their red and green curries are strong and leaves you craving for more. The noodle dishes are also good. Affordable prices (around 10 bucks an entree) for a healthy portion of spicy, invigorating food. It is a small place, family run, with calming interior decor, not fancy, but intimate and down to earth.
