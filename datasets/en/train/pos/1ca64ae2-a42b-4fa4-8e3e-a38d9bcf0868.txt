Doughnuts are bomb. 
Coffee is weak, so deal with it and get a large.  
Next to the doughnuts are instant rame cups and assorted treats that somehow someone must buy.
While having coffee a street character rolled up on a bike and had some serious street survival gear, backpack loaded and 3 shopping bags with extra clothes in them attached around his waist to his belt. And HE bought 2 old fashions. 
The workers sound like "Tammy" from the nail salon comedy bit. 
They sell Oreo cookies by the roll they just took out of the box, no packaged for re-sale here. 
Ok now Tammy is speaking good broken Spanish. 
Man I Iike it here, you won't get that "mas puto!" vibe you get at Starbucks or Fair Trade when your lady drags you into places like that.
