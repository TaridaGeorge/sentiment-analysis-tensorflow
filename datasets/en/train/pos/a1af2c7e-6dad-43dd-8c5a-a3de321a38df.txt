Sunday Brunch 03.20.11

1st visit to Cafe Monarch - very relaxed environment.  Plenty of parking spaces.  Chef Chris was very accommodating.  Chalk board on the sides of the entry way displayed the entree selection for the day.  There was a section for guests to sign in.  $20 includes tax/beverage.   CASH ONLY.  Pork Tenderloin and Bosc Pear salad were choices for the day.  Presentation - amazing.  Quality of ingredients - excellent.  Taste - superb.  

Next visit will be for dinner.  Can't wait.
