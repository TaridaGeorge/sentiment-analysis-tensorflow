Hobby shop meets local art, craft, entertainment for people who refuse to get boring. ~All ages welcome.

I like the local art featured here. They hold events here for local artists; comic book artists, painters, fashion designers, etc. In the store you will find books, bags, gift ideas, interior decor, jewelry, costumes, collectibles, local T-shirt art, funky shoes, comics, and strange new people to meet.

The best part is that you don't have to be able to "afford" the rock 'n roll lifestyle espoused here. Every item in the store is reasonably priced. 

You can also be sure that gifts from here will not be duplicated; 
AND if you're shopping for someone from another generation, there is an underlying "cool' factor that runs through all the treasures you can find.

No matter what you call it: rock, jock, goth, nerd; sci-fi; rave; rock'abilly, urban, emo, queer...it's all here.
