Like everyone else I give Artisans 5 stars!  Thanks fellow "Yelpers" for the recommendation!  I've been here three times now.  The first for a pair of sandals I tore, and the second and third time to stretch pairs of two-hour ("killer") heels I thought would break-in over time...HA!  I have several more visits to go to fix and polish what's left in my closet and now lament all the things given away that only needed polishing and stitching.  That's what happens when you don't know, but now I (you) do!  Great work, reasonable prices, a small business.  There's nothing not to like!
