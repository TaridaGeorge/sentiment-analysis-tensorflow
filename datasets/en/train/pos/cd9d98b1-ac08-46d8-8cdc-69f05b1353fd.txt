Quite frankly, there isn't a better breakfast in America (don't tell my wife). Although TC Eggintons is a bit expensive and always crowded, the breakfast food is second to none.

I am personally a fan of the french toast but pretty much everything on the menu is divine. 

Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I would start it off here.
