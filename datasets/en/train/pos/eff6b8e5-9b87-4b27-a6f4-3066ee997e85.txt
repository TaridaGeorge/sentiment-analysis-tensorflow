What a nice little place for lunch.  20 years ago my daughter used to eat lunch here when she was in high school and she loved it.  I took a business associate in the other day and it was exactly the same as we left it - a lunch cafe offering some very fresh, very tasty asian-american fare.  Nothing fancy, just good food served with a big fat smile.  And served fast!  Everything here is made from scratch from the finest meats and veggies.  The only thing I don't like are the cheap paper plates and utensils, but at these prices, no wonder!
