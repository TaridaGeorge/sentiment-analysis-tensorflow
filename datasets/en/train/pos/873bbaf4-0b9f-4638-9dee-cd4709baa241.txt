I originally went here for a Sunday breakfast since the Breakfast Club across the street had a 45 minute wait. Ends up the cheese omelet was excellent. 

Went back here for lunch and a few beers to watch some Sunday football and enjoyed the crowd. The bar has an open patio for great scenery and an outdoor feel. 

If you order a FULL size grilled cheese off the menu, be forewarned. They give you two huge grilled cheese sandwiches and a ton of fries. Mouth watered just writing the review. 

If I didn't live in Los Angeles, I would make this my regular hangout.
