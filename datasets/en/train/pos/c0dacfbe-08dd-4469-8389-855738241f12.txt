WOW! I Love this place. The naranja is my favorite flavor although the pura pina is a close second. Fresh ingredients make all the difference in the world. 

This is a great frozen dessert if you are looking for something sweet and refreshing. You won't be disappointed with these popsicles. 

YUMMY!!
