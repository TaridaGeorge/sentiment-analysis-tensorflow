I love this place!  The main reason that I choose to continue my membership at this location, month after month, is because it's a nice place to walk in to.  Casey is the main girl that I see here, and her friendly personality and helpfulness, is why I go to this location.  I recommend this place and think the employees need some recognition for bringing the customers back.  

Love this place!!
