Mamas cooking something yummy in the kitchen!

I totally dig the wide-open kitchen setting. It had that nostalgic feel like I was in an old school Italian kitchen with some modern seating arrangements.  We sat at the bar and ordered "the Pig" - pretty much a meat lovers pizza, minus the Hut and Dominos haha.  Needless to say, wowwwwwo! I love the pizza, not because I was hungry, but wooosh the sauce was popping and the cheese was so soft and stringy!  The meat atop was cooked perfectly and had just the right amount of saltiness to give it an extra flare. Oooof!  Definitely coming back!  

Service was excellent thanks to Bryan.  He allowed us to taste some wine along with some of his recommendations.  Thanks man keep rocking! - Enjoy!
