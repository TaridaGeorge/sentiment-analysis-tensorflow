I can't say enough good things about Windsor! If I lived up the street I would be a regular twice a day. I decided to show up for brunch this time. They have the coolest Bloody Mary Bar with all the accompaniments from , fresh grated horseradish, horseradish sauce , pickled everything , onions, different hot sauces. You have a choice between Red or Green Bloody Mary drinks. The Red is traditional with a little kick and Green reminds me of Sofrito for some reason. I really wish I knew the best way to garnish the Green Bloody Mary. I had the Eggs Benedict, the sauce ham and poach egg was perfect. I wish the English muffin and a little crisp to it , but it was still really good.
