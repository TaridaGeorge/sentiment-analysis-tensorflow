I love this place, and every time I go I'm never disappointed. Last night I reserved the private dinning room for a group of my patients and our health/wellness meet-up group. I had a great time! The private dining room is nice because it's quite enough to have a conversation with the entire table. The downside is that it only holds 12 people. 

I had the caramelized onion tart (loved it!), the farmers salad (wonderful spicy sesame dressing!) and the roasted veggies with farro (loved the farro!). And don't forget dessert, - loved the flour-less chocolate cake (dark chocolate with a hint of sweetness)

This place is awesome and everything on the menu is healthy and tasty!!
