I love, love, love this cafe!  The atmosphere is close to perfect.  In fact, I lunched there today with a professional photographer, and she was so impressed, she asked Chris (Chef/Owner/Proprieter) if she could return for a photo shoot, to which he obliged.

The food was beautiful (as always), cooked to perfection (as always), and a wonderful new combination of foods (as I have come to expect).

I continue to tell everyone I know about this place!
