This is my absolute favorite place to do karaoke! Ted is a kick ass KJ and always makes the night a hoot. 

While the song selection is good, there's a few of my favorites it's missing but I am never at a shortage of options. The wait is never long and the crowd is great for people watching. 

The place is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is much better than your typical bar fare. 

I've yet to have a lame Friday night at JJ's. It's a great place to bring a crowd of friends, let loose, do some singing or just laugh at the craziness that inevitably ensues at a karaoke bar.
