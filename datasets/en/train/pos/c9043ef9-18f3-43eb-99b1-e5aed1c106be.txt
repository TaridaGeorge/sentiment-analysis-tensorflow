I have liked Lux the most of all the coffee shops I've tried in Phoenix so far.  I should have gone here months ago!  It was just lovely on a July day.  Interior has a fantastic, simple feel.  The temperature was refreshing.  My iced chai latte was delicious.

I'm going to change that to five stars.  :)
