I LOVE Stockton Dermatology.  They are professional, friendly and compassionate.  (I love the fact that they have a very professional website.)

I've seen this dermatologist 3 or 4 times over the past 5 years.  I especially love the fact that they know how to handle darker complexions.  Don't get me wrong, this place is welcoming to all colors, but it's nice to have some ladies there that are able to relate to my specific skin problems.  

This place seems to be very popular.  They are always busy so be sure to show up on time.  They don't mess around.  Once I was a little late & I had to reschedule.
