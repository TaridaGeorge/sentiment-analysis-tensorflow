I do 97% of my families shopping here. I love the bakery that this location has! Some of their prepared meals are better then others just like any store. The Indian ones are actually quite good for Indian on the go. The meat  and their cheese selection is always awesome. The staff at this store are great, they are always friendly and helpful.
