Never thought i review a gas station, but this one is really different. It is family owned and you can certainly tell.  It is always so clean they must even wipe down the pumps. It is a pleasure to come in. The man that owns it told me it is the oldest gas station location is Phoenix. It does carry quality gas and it is a great location. Right on the corner of 7th Ave and Bethany. The price is always a little less than the other Chevron on Thomas as well. I hear that the auto service is very good as well.
