My sister and I ate here before a movie so we were limited on time. The service was friendly, prompt and the place was imaculate. I had a cup of the Tom Yum something soup which has lemon grass in it--to die for! I also had a dish with chicken, red bell peppers and crisp green beans. That too was delicious. They make your food as mild or spicy as you like. Both of my dishes were just as I requested.

I highly recommend Thai House on Shea.
