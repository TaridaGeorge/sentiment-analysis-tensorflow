They serve gluten-free pita here!  No review has mentioned that yet, but to anyone who loves hummus/other-dippable-Middle-Eastern-dishes but can't eat gluten, it's pretty big news and really sets them apart :)

Gluten-free, pillow-y soft pita bread.  I have a bite of it in my mouth as I type.  (They sell it by the dozen to take home, or you can order it with your meal.)
