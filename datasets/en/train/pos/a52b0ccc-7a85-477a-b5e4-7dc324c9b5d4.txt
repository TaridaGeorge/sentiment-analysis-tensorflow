I am a huge fan of eating meat. I am by no means vegetarian and don't try to be. My fiance had to practically drag me in this place and it is AMAZING!!! I have eating here numerous times and every item is fantastic. I can't even tell their chicken isn't actually chicken. Their secret barbecue chicken is fantastic. I keep finding myself coming back here again and again to try something new. I recommend Green to anyone who likes good food which I think is everyone.
