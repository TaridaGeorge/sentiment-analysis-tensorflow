I absolutely adore this place. Java Frost; Vanilla. What's up??? I've been going here since I was a teenager, and often. This is the best coffee place on the map and I miss them having a location on Elliot too because that one had a blender and could also make Java Frosts. I can't help but wonder, what happened to the blender at that location? WHY OH WHY didn't it migrate to the McClintock store?? But I digress. The coffee is amazing, the people remember me even when I don't show up for weeks, and the atmosphere is cozy to boot.
