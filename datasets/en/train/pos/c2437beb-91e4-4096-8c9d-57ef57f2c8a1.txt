Often imitated, never duplicated... except it's a chain :) Felt exactly like the Rudy's I've been to and the clientele was nearly exactly the same as well! haha. Make this place popular, guys. They'll even give you samples - what's there to lose?

And if I may, get creamed corn because I actually drove from California to get this today, Arizonians. Jealous!

They also sell plenty of Shiner Bock and Blue Bell ice cream here. I'll be back!
