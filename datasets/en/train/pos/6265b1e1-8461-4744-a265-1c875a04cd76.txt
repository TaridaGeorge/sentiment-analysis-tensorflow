BAKLAVA!!! There BAKLAVA is amazing and they have like 5 kinds which is crazy because I thought there was only one kind(its the walnut one there u will understand if u go!).  Anyway aside from that all the food Is great from gyros to cheeseburgers!  You won't be disappointed, and don't let the market part with odd unlabled things intimidate you, its def worth checking out !
