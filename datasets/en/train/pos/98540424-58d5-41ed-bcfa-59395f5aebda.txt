The concept is amazing! The ice cream is fresh! 

Lee makes all the ice cream herself without preservatives and with fresh ingredients.  It definitely shows.

I went in because I had a groupon and I was hooked. I've been back 3 times already. It's delicious and it's unique. My favorite is the Jack Daniels Chocolate Swirl and the Strawberry Margarita with Tequila.

It's tasty, fun, and not overpriced. 2 scoops is about $5, which is comparable to most "normal" ice cream shops, but this has a unique flavor and tastes really fresh!

I definitely recommend for the adventurous or those who want something out of the ordinary.
