consistently fresh and delicious. You can call ahead for pick up and have your order in under 10min. If you're going for take out i recommend that you order your Feta when you arrive instead of as a side order (they have a dry goods market inside w/ deli). 
Also... LOVE, LOVE, LOVE their coffee. you can buy it by the lb in light, medium, or dark roast. DO NOT have it ground if you don't like super fine grinds. 

7yrs of eating there weekly and I miss it dearly already.
