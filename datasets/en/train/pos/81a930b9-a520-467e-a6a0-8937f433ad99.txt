This is a wonderful place to eat if you are ever in Phoenix.  I have only visited the one in the airport, but it is simply delicious!  The ordering is a little confusing at first, but the staff is gracious & happy to help.  It is very much worth the effort to go!  Sandwiches are beyond fresh as well as everything else on the menu!
