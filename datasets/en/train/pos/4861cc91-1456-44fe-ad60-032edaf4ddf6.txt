I loved the menu; it was small but included everything you would want. They have many interesting items on the menu, too. They have a very good lunch offering, and a great beer menu. The wait staff is efficient and very friendly. I look forward to coming back to Scottsdale so I can eat there again. I did not try any of their appetizers, so next time it will be during Happy Hour.
