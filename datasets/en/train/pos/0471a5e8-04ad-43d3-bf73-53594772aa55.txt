I can't say enough great things about Karen. When my cat had cancer and I was on the road, she came to my house and gave him his chemotherapy. She is trustworthy, reliable and dedicated to animals like no one else. I have 2 dogs now who love! love! spending the day at her place. She picks them up at my house in the morning and drops them home at night. She has sheep on her property and my Corgi can't get enough of playing with them. Karen loves animals so much and it shows in everything she does. My dogs have spent more than a week at a time with her while I travel and her prices are very reasonable. No cages! I love that they can spend the day playing in her yard. 
She also runs an amazing animal rescue for senior pets. She is the best.
