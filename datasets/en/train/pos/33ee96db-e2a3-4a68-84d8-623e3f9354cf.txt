Every time I go visit my dad in AZ a stop a Cornish Pasty Company is needed. Anything you ever hoped and dreamed about in a warm flakey crust has come true. They have alot of options from a thanksgiving dinner, to a hearty Italian feast and even peanutbutter and jelly. I've enjoyed everything I've had here and love that they have a good selection of microbrews to wash your pasty down with.
