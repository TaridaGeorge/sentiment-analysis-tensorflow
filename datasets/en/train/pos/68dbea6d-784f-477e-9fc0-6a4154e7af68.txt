If you desire true Chicago deep dish pizza, then Nello's should be at the top of your list! This is a staple pizza location in the Valley- and my family has been going for years. Nello's offers a great menu, drink list, and atmosphere. They offer an excellent Mon-Fri lunch special - a large drink, salad and 2-topping personal pizza for $8.99- what a steal! Don't pass this place up, it's worth it.
