This is my favorite Asian supermarket in AZ.  We come here every month to stock up onBetter than Lee Lee and the one in the Chinese Cultural Center.  

The variety and the prices are fabulous.  Yam noodles.  Seaweed snacks.  Tofu. Green onion pancakes.  Green tea.  Ice cream mochi.  Every kind of ramen.  Check, check, check.

The produce is super fresh.  I had the best Fuji apples here.  I didn't have the highest expectations since the apples weren't so cosmetically appealing but when I bit into them, they were pure love.
