Tonight was my third dining experience here. I came with my family and ordered what I have ordered each time..ahi tuna taco platter with a side of french fries. While there are so many enticing menu options, the thought of this dish always makes my mouth water. 

The rest of my family really enjoyed their dishes, except for my mom. She really didn't like the red pepper soup, although she's not one to complain. Our waiter noticed she had barely eaten and asked if she didnt like it. She replied "not really" and he took the soup off the bill. I was really impressed by his service throughout the meal, but that was really above and beyond good service.

I only wish Chelsea's Kitchen was closer!
