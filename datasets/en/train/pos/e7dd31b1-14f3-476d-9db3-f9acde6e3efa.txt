BEST OMELET EVER!  FLUFFY, MOIST

The cook made the most fluffy omelet I have ever had.  The waffles were so good too.  I asked for warm syrup and it made the twice as delicious.  

They have a jukebox that plays 6 songs for $1.00.  Very cool!

This restaurant is small so go between breakfast and lunch or after lunch for great service.
