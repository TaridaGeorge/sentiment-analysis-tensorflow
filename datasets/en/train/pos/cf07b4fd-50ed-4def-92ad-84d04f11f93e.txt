Leasing with RedSeven is wonderful peace-of-mind. I have been a lease customer of Red Seven for maybe a year now, but it is well worth the peace-of-mind. Recently my leased laptop was acting strangely but Nick eventually fixed me right up. First he spent a lot of time trying to fix it via a remote, but then they needed to work on it in the shop, so it was there for a day. Nick was very patient with followup questions after I got the laptop back. I'm just a retired person but I use my computer every day and it is very important to me. I'm glad they have the Scottsdale office. I would continue to highly recommend RedSeven.
