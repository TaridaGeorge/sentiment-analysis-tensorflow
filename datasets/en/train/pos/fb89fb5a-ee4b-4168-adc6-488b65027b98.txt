I cannot believe I actually enjoyed picking out not just one, but two wonderful swimsuits. I am tall and large on top, so picking out swimsuits has always been an issue for me. After spending last week in Dillard's, looking at overpriced suits with only 1 fitting me (on top), I was shocked to find this store where I spent my lunch break trying on at least 10 suits that were made for me (I am sure there was more, but I stopped looking). The price is good and the service was wonderful. There was another customer in the store and the service provided to the two of us was very helpful. The lady knew her stuff (not the owner) and she was honest about how the suit fit on me.
