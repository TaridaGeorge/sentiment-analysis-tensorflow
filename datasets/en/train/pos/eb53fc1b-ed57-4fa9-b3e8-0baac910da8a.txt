Another outstanding experience at the best Irish themed bar that I know of stateside.  Fantastic menu with some unique "gastropub" style small plates like Brussels sprouts with apples, otherwise some familiar old school fare like burgers and fish & chips.  

What makes this place great is absolutely the atmo and service which is very, very accommodating.  Offers a wonderful variety of warm drinks for cold weather cheer.  Easily the coziest place to hang on Mill.
