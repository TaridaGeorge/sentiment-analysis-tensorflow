I've noticed that the Pita Junge has been advertising on Yelp.  I've always had the attitude that if a business cares what others are saying about it online then it is worth checking out.  The wife and I ate at the one in Scottsdale.  They have a nice patio area which is where we chose to eat. The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon, that's usually a good sign.  Our server recommended a shawarma dish and I opted for one of their specials with grilled chicken over linguine.  Both were really good.  We also had a couple of pitas with a trifecta (3) of delicious humus.  We probably ordered too much food but it was a tasty place.
Also, it seemed like the waitstaff was hired from a modeling agency.  But that may just be Scottsdale.
