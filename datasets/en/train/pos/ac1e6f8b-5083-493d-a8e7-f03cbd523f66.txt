I have been to this barbershop 4 times in the last 5 months and I'm a huge fan.  I have never had to wait for a haircut and you cannot beat the price.  Jimmy and Daryl both have done a great job, and I love the ability to have a beer while I get a cut.  The food is really good, and I typically get a sandwhich to go.  Highly recommend this place!
