If you are one to want to find a unique gift or challenge your child while he/she has fun, KidStop is your place.  Kate, the owner, hand picks the toys she sells; each debated upon and well thought out for our kids. I like to buy our friend's kids' birthday gifts there because their stuff is so different, special and in some cases, one of a kind.  PLUS!! they gift wrap the item for FREE!!!!!  Support local businesses!!
