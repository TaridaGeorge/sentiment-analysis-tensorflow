This was so much fun. We drove out the other day just kind of for the hell of it and were really surprised.

You get pretty much run of the place. You can go in any building, climb on stuff, and explore. It can't be safe.... you'd have to go there to understand, but there are open holes in the ground, nails, and falling wood. We also observed lots of snake skins. I had my snake shot loaded in my pistol so whatever but one might be concerned with little kids. 

All of hte old artifacts are great, and everything looks well preserved. Going on the second story of a falling down house was really interesting to me!
