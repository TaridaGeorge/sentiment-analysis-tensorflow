Picture this, Friday night and the weekend before my daughters wedding and a "problem tooth" deemed by my dentist acts up. I called my dentist who was out of town (Do dentists even work on Friday?) tells me to call Dr. Amin. He met me at the office and took care of the agonizing pain! He was kind, considerate, caring and very professional. The week after the celebration, I only came back to Dr. Amin to perform my root canal. I know my dentist wouldn't do it because she said it was a tough canal (the main reason why I waited so long) but Dr. Amin skillfully got every canal...Afterall he is Harvard and NYU trained. Wow! I highly recommend Dr. Amin for your root canals!
