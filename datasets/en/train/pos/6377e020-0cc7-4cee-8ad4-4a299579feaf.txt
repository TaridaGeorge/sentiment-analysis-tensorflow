Designed by Frank Lloyd Wright of course the 5 stars is for the architecture.  Although I don't particularly like his low ceilings all the fabulous detail work in the cement and glass have a timeless feel that is of a time all it's own. 

Definitely worth a look if you're in the area. Heck even worth a drive out of the way  just to have a drink and just chill and take it all in.
