Does this place really need another review? Well here's mine regardless! 

I have been here a few times before and was always amazed that Chris Bianco made every pizza himself. Knowing that he was not manning the oven any longer, I was interested in trying it again. 

I stopped by on Saturday night and put my name on the list at about 5:30. My girlfriend and I were seated at about 9:30. I ordered the Wise Guy and she ordered the margherita with prosciutto on half and sopressata on the other half. 

My Wise Guy was great with the fennel sausage and onions. Hers was great too with the spicy sopressata and melt in your mouth prosciutto. 

Even though Chris wasn't around it was a great meal and remains my favorite pizza place in town for a special occasion.
