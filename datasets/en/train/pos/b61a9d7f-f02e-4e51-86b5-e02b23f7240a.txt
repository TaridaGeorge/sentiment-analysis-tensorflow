Great addition to Scottsdale shopping! I checked out the Mix Shops this afternoon...I liked how the little boutiques were connected, so I didn't have to walk outside between them (even though it was a gorgeous day out, so it wouldn't have been bad).  Plus, it's a very easy walk from the Fashion Square, so you can shop at the mall and then walk over to the Mix Shops, or vice versa.  Great selection of women's clothes...everything from casual to party dresses. The salesgirl who was helping me was very nice...helpful but not pushy or breathing down my neck.  I tried on four party dresses and unfortunately none of them worked out. The designers with clothes in the boutiques are exactly who I want, so I will most definitely be back to shop at the Mix Shops in the future.
