Great location!   Everyone should dine here at least once- the popovers are amazing!  It was a slow night at the resturant but the service was very good, the manager came by to ask if everything was OK, which is always nice.  I had a filet with mushroom caps on the side- soo good.  I will be back to this hotel and to BLT!
