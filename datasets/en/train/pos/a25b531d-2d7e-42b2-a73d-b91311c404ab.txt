My husband and I ate at Latitude Eight for the first time last night after recently purchasing a Groupon. We hoped it would be good based on the reviews we'd read, but it was even better than we expected!! A great size of restaurant - not too big, not too small - and the atmosphere really does make you feel welcome & like one of the regulars right off the bat. David obviously cares very much about his customers and their dining experience, which is great to see. We had the coconut shrimp appetizer, which was absolutely delicious with an awesome presentation, then we shared the crab fried rice (also delicious) and the sticky rice mango dessert (yum!). I highly recommend this restaurant and we will definitely be back, especially for special occasions!!
