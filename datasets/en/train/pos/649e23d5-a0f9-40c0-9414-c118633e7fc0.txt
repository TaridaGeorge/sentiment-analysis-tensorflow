My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on a Sunday night and I have to say the food is outstanding.  We started with drinks and appetizers at the bar. The drinks were affordable and a good pour. We then sat in the dinning area for our meal. The servers were attentive and we knew right away we were going to split both the fillet mingon gorgonzola and baked ziti.  The garlic bread definitely lived up to the reviews and the salads were fresh and delicious.  Both entrees kept us ranting and raving for the rest of the night. Fine dining quality food in a non-fine dining atmosphere.  Mom & pop type ambiance. Overall...5 star experience
