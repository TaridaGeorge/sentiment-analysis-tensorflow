The BEST chicken shawarma in AZ hands down.  I started my Haji love affair in college, and have introduced many friends to this charming little hole in the wall over the years.  The ambiance is not great, but the food more than makes up for it.  They are crazy that they are still this inexpensive, where else can you get a gyro for under $5?!  I always get the same thing tho, the chicken shawarma.  It comes with a big plate of rice, hummus, taboule, and garlic sauce.  O.m.g. good.  Bonus that I get to also do a lil grocery shopping on my way out.
