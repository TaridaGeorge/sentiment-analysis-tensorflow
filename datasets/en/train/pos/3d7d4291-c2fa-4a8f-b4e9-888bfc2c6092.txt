We just took a hospital tour here because my wife and I are planning on delivering our baby there. I'm not too familiar with hospitals but I think it's really cool that they even offer a tour so that you can familiarize yourself with the whole process. They also offer a ton of parental classes which we plan on taking. And I love how they have it set up to where your baby never leaves your sight after delivery.
