The only thing bad about this place is that they're closed after 10. Love love love this yogurt! They rotate flavors so your tastebuds never get bored, an overwhelming selection of fruit and candy toppings are laid out before you...and the ambiance is so fun and happy, just like the owners! Froyo should be fun!
