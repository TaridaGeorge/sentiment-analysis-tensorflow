OMG!!! If you haven't eaten here you are missing out. It has a funny name so some might be sceptical. However I have been a handful of times and this place is constantly delicious. My favorite is the guacamole burger. This burger is perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. I usually go with the meal which includes a can of soda and a bag of fries for $5.00. If you feel like splurging also get a "special brownie" YUM! Definitely check this place out before it catches on because secrets like this don't last long.
