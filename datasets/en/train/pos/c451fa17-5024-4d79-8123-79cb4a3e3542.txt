I just have to say why can't we have a Thai place this good in Old Town Scottsdale?  I drove my self down there for the family on football bowl day and fought the traffic just for a piece of this sweet action.  Friendly, fast service, excellent prices, and a-mazing food.  The mints are the soft chalky kind too:)  Please open one to the north Thai Basil?
