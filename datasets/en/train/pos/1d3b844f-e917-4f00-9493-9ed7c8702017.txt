As good as the boba gets in AZ. Very tasty! The boba is always perfectly cooked not too mushy not too hard. Price is decent; it's the same price if you get it anywhere. I always get the thai tea boba or the milk tea. YUMMMM! Very light and tasty! i like the graffiti walls, I think it definitely adds personality to this place.
