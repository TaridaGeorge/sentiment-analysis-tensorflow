There are only a couple of restaurants that I would eat at every day, and this is one of them. My wife and I have eaten everything on the menu at least once with our favorite appetizer being the grilled artichoke, favorite sandwich the french dip, favorite seafood the swordfish (when available), love the hawaiian rib eye and the hot fudge sundae makes sure that I go into a carbo coma and my wife has to drive home. The wine list always has a pleasant surpise on it and the staff are attentive and sensitive at the same time. If you have never had the experience of dining here, don't cheat yourself any longer. I have been an restaurant owner and in the food business for over 30 years and this place is one of the best I have been in for great overall experience.
