I have had two experiences here.  They both were great.  I love that this store is in a little nook, so it is never crowded.  It is also very clean and bright.  They go above and beyond to help their customers.  Shout out to Nicole B. who spent a generous amount of time with me last week making sure I had everything transferred back onto my replacement phone.  She embodies the meaning of customer service: knowledgeable, patient, persistent and pleasant!
