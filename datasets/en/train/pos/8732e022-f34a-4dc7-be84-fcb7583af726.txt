The owner, and chef came out and talked about the menu. Sat with us for a few minutes after the meal to chat and see how we liked it. Very personable guy. Don't be thrown off by the deli style setting and informal dinning areas, the food is good, and the service is even better. It looked like some of the food was prepared earlier and set in the refrigerated display case. It didn't affect taste at all, it did help speed the prep time. Ultimately I would go back again. I was pleasantly surprised.
