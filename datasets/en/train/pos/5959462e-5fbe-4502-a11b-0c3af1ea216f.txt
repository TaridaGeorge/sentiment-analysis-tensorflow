My husband's mother is from Thailand so I have great home cooked Thai food to compare this place too. It is by far the closest to her cooking that I have found in this area. When she came into town we took her there and she loved the food and quickly made friends with the staff! 

Try this place out! The red curry is my favorite! Oh and you can bring your own beer or wine!!
