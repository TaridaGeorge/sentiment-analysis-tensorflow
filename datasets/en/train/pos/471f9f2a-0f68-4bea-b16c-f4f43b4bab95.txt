I've always been a fan of Trader Joe's, it was love at first salad bite! They've got a great selection of salads, sandwiches, and even soba (Japanese noodles) on the go. Its a great alternative to shopping out for a salad. My current days have been comprised of heading to Trader Joe's for some Thai Peanut Noodle Salad, Japanese Soba Noodles, or their other pics of salad. Their Indian side curries aren't bad either. On some days they'll have wine tastings or burger tastings. I always love coming here! Wasabi Mayonnaise, Yellow Nectarines... all such healthy and delicious food options! Trader Joes trades in the bad food, and lets you live and eat a healthier lifestyle!
