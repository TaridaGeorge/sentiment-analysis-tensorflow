I love the Coronado Cafe.  They offer fresh ingredients and a seasonal menu.  The service is phenomenal.  I was but a lonely two top in a sea of large parties, but was paid attention to nonetheless.  My buddy and I made many substitutions and our order came out perfectly; our check was below forty dollars, cocktails included.  I wish I lived closer by because I'd be there every Saturday when I wake up in dire need of eggs and cocktails.
