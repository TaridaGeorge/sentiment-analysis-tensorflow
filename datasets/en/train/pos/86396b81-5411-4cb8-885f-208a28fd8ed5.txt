Love, love this place!  I discovered it in the same little shopping area with one of my favorite consignment shops. Luci's has a cafe with seating, as well as a healthy "grocery" type area with healthy fare. The cafe has sandwiches, salads, and a great breakfast that's served all day. They have several coffee drinks also. One of my favorite items is the Smoky Joe's BLT, which I always get in a tomato or spinach wrap with a side of fruit. 

The grocery area has lots of gluten-free and vegan items. They also have some novelty items, my favorite of which is a sticky note pad declaring "You're on my Sh!t List" -- dang, that little sticky note pad is damn therapeutic!! 

Parking can be a pain when it's busy, so just be aware...
