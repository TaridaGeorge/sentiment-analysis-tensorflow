I've been hearing about these cheesecakes from my husband and his incessant twitter following and I was really excited to try some of the goods at the market this past Saturday.

We finally woke up early enough on a Saturday morning to hit up Matt's and then peruse the market before it got too hot.  We made our way over to the cheesecake table and then debated between 10 or so flavors.  He had key lime and chocolate chip out to sample and I decided to try the key lime.  I was amazed at how natural it tasted.  There was nothing artificial about it, it just tasted exactly like it should.  These are very good, very simple cheesecakes.  I ultimately went with the peanut butter chocolate chip which is extremely tasty.  There are a bunch of different sizes to choose from, all at very fair prices.  YUMMY!
