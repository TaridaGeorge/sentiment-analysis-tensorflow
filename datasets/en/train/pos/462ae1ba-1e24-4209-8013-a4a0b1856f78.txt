Turquoise lilypad canopies glow neon pink at night, while posters beckon you to "consider your future" and get a job here in exchange for free movies.  Solid selection of independent films.  Clean facility, friendly staff.  Nice reprieve from the mallrats at Fashion Square.  **Bonus** I may have been the only individual who did not qualify for the senior discount at the weekday matinee.
