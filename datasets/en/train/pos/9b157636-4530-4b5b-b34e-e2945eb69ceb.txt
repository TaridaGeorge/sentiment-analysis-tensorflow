Amazing!! I work down the street and just found this place... Where have you been all my life :)  I NEVER  NEVER eat bread... BUT.. The pita is soooo good that I couldn't resist!! I had a chicken Swiss salad (I asked them to give me mix greens instead of Iceberg and they did.. with a charge, but I was happy to not eat iceberg). Kinda expensive for lunch.. but very much worth it... Do not judge a book by the cover, its cute inside and the staff is nice!
