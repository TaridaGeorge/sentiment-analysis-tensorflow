I had been wishing for an inexpensive korean restaurant for years. When this place opened, it was a dream come true because it was also walking distance from my apartment. Score!

Huge portions. Great flavors. The lunch special comes with 3 types of meat, 2 scoops of rice, and 4 sides of your choice. I really like the sesame noodles. All for about $7
