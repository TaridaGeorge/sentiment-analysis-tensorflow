Love this place - shame it took me so long to discover it! Everything I have eaten there so far has been amazing - especially in love with the breakfast scrambles & potatoes, the sticky buns and the pecan bars. Service always great and with a smile, and a nice atmosphere. After eating there nearly a dozen times, I think I have found somewhere deserving of a regular weekly visit!
