Well I am FIRMLY sticking to my 5 star review!  After attending two more classes at Abby Bella (Cardio Striptease and Bella Barre), I am hooked!  This place has amazing classes that are suited for every fitness level.  The instructors are all enthusiastic and fun, and everyone has been so welcoming in each class, I feel like I've been going there forever!!  I'll be seeing them again tonight at Zumba!
