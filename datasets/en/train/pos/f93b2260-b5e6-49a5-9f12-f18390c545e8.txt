Bob is awesome. This place is so quirky with all the cats, but we love it :) He's honest, trustworthy, and provides great service. 

If you've been to him multiple times  before, know that you should make an appointment with his wife not him (he forgets to put it in the book! :))

I usually get my oil changes here, he never fails to explain to me what's wrong with my car and in an easy way so that I can understand. His pricing is fair and decent. 

Overall, I will continue to go to Bob and you should too!
