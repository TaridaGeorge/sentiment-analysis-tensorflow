112th review for Delux.  I give it five stars because it's the best burger in Phoenix.  Get it medium rare (rare is even better) and ENJOY.  The sweet potato fries are the best I've found as well.  Good beer selection.  Smallish restaurant can have quite a wait, particularly later at night.  Worth it though.
