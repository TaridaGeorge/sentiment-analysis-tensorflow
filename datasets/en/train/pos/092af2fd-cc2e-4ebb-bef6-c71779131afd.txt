I don't give 5-stars easily!  This place rocks!

Not only do they have amazing Italian-style pizza (fairly authentic!), their prices are low and their portions are massive.  You know the best part?  They offer you a refill of soda..TO GO!  The servers are wonderful, as well...  Our favourites thus far are the BBQ and hot (medium, really) wings, the beefstro salad, and any of the sandwiches!  We usually get two sandwiches and split them for 4 of us...often times with food left over!

The dessert cookie rocks--but you may want to order it while you're still eating, since it does take a while.  You can make all kinds of combinations, you don't just have to stick with plain ol' chocolate chip.  Get creative!  And don't forget your fortune cookie!
