First, this theater has great sound. I guess I had been going to older theaters and didn't realize what I was missing. Another bonus is that they accept the harkins refill cups at this location. Great way to save money. Great location, usually not completly full for most movies, and a great selection of movies. Haven't tried their Imax screen yet but have heard it is nice.
