I have gotten some really good service from this place.  I bought a battery from them and they really tried hard to make sure that I got a pro-rated discount if I qualified for one.  I've also gotten my oil changed there many times and they have been honest about anything that is wrong with the car, not like other places that try to convince you to do a lot of work on your car.  The care has always been in good shape after coming back from the shop too.  The workers are friendly and professional.
