My boyfriend frequents here so much the server knows his favorite order by heart (although he likes everything). He swears it is just as good as Greece and I think it is just as good as Chicago's greek town. All the orders come with fries (not stated on menu)  which are mediocre. The sauce is delicious and you can acquire hot sauce by request.  The pita is so big and filled with delicious meat I thought I was going to have leftovers but it was too delicious and I ate it all.  Best in Phoenix.

Got the fries today, so much better! Hot, crispy, delicous. I need to find more places like this...
