Another awesome Yelp night!   It was nice to catch up with old friends and make new ones.  Location, location, great location Humble Pie!  

We started out with the Crispy Calamari, Toasted Ravioli, Tempura Fried Green Beans.  They were fried to perfection and the sauces are perfect accompaniment.    
The endless salads, it was way more then we could eat.  We got to sample the Apple & Arugula, Strawberry & Gorgonzola, and Chopped.  I love jicama!  The Meat Lovers and Fig & Prosciutto pizza will keep me coming back for more.   They have a great wine list too.  

So proud to be a Yelp Elite.  Thanks Lindsey, Yelp, and Humble Pie team for such a great event!  Looking to forward to the next one!
