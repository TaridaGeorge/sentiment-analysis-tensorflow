Wow if you want to be wined and dined this is the place to do it at. I have not been in Phoenix all that long, but this is the best restauraunt in the valley. The combination of excellent service, delectible food, and ambiance off the charts makes this place great. There is nothing better than sitting outside, under the stars, eating locally grow gourmet food in this remote location. Actualy there is, drinking a glass of wine off of their spectacular wine list. Give this place a try for a very romantic dinner with excellent food.
