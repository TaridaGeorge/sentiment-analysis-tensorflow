All I can say is "OMG"!!!  The first thing I had here after a friend brought me for a quick breakfast was the California club.  It really was like a party in my mouth!  I'm not kidding.  Everything on the menu looks so good I can't wait to try it all.  I'm a little embarrassed to admit it but I have circled all the items that I really want to try on the menu and I'm going through them one by one (I'm a total list crosser-offer).  The last thing I tried there was "oatmeal our way". Which is actually not oatmeal at all, but SO incredible!
