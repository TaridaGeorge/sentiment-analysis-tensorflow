Get the Machiatto! (just $2)!!

Heaven in a cup! I crave it often.

The coffee is strong and full bodied so you expect a bitter taste at the end, but instead your mouth is filled with the aroma of the coffee and a roasted flavor. .....kind of like a cigar, but coffee. It's really hard to explain. You just have to try it to see what I mean.

We met the guy that owns it and he told us the espresso machine is 2nd to none! It's expensive and has all these temperature and pressure features that make the coffee much much better.

Also, they roast their own beans here. It gives the coffee a unique flavor that no commercialized Starbucks can compare to.
