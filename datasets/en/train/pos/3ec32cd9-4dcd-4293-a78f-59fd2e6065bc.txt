Razz's is among my favorite places in the Valley. The food is impeccable, the wine list superb. I can't pick a favorite item, though I'm a sucker for the short ribs. FYI, I know Razz can do terrific vegetarian entrees, and according to the menu, they will create one for you on request. Razz's catered my wedding, and even I, a devout omnivore, opted for the meatless dish. Three years later, people still talk about the food at our wedding.
