I went to Modern Steak for my birthday with a party of 5, made a reservation for Saturday at 8:45 pm and were seated right away. Everyone LOVED their food. We all had two round of the Jalisco Flower, it was sooo good. My friend said its exactly what she wants to serve at her wedding. 

I had the Sea Bass, i don't eat meat was bummed about only having a couple options, but it was AMAZING!!! No joke!! It was cooked to perfection and although the portion looked small it was exactly the right amount of food. 

I can't wait to go back!
