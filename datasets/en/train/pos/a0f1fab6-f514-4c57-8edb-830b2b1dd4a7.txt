Not being a drinker this is not a store I would ever really think about checking out. But there are times one needs wine and some hard liquor for company. This place has it seems everything and at reasonable prices, Not knowing much I asked several question of an employee so I would be getting things our Friends would actually drink and they answered everything with enthusiasm.
