Since I'm now a Yelper, I have to give a shout out to my favorite Ice Cream in the world.  My kids absolutely LOVE it too! And I get to finish what they don't eat!

Check out Mary Coyle's if you have ice cream craving attacks like me!!  They got me hooked ever since I was a kid.

And don't be scared to try the Pistachio.  It's to die for!
