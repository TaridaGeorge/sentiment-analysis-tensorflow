LOVE this place. Great for anyone - even families. 

Excellent home brewed beer - I tried one kind and couldn't even try another - it was too good and I had to keep ordering it. 

The fish and chips are INCREDIBLE. 

Everyone I've ever went with here has loved it. Went with people from my wife's work who had never been - they were all sold. They've been back several times without us, even. 

You'll pay a little but well worth it. 

Even their appetizers are fantastic - sliders, and the hummus! Oh yes.
