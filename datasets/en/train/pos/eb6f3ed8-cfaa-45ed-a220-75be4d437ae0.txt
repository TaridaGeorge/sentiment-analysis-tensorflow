The staff is great, the food is great, even the cappuccino is great (had my first one today).

i work close by and I have a choice where to eat and it's very often Acacia for breakfast and lunch.

A few of my favs are:

- Chicken Salad Sandwich
- Southwest Ranch Salad
- Omelets

Enjoy! (maybe I'll run into you there)
