Everytime I come near Tempe, I always have to stop at Grimaldi's. Their pie is really THAT good. Their pizza is thin crust and the coal oven gives makes it crispy... if thats what you're into. The pizza is really good and worth a try. 

*On a side note, the restaurant looks more upscale than your typical pizza place- and as such, I think you are paying for the ambiance. Don't go expecting a take out place, or bar style. They have table cloths and the waiters have those aprons that hang down to their ankles. Still good pizza all around.
