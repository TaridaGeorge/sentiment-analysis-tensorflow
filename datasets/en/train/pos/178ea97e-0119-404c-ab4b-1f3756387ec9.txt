Loves it!  This restaurant is for the die-hard-pho noddle lovers!  You really  can't get anymore authentic with hoisin, sriracha and fish sauce preset on each table and poorly cleaned restrooms.  The bean sprouts are white, plump, and crisp, and the thai basil is plentiful.  The soup is hot and well flavoured.  The price point is great as 4 spring rolls and two bowl of pho were under $19.  I brought my room mate here, and he was first reluctant about beef and noddles in the soup.  Now he won't stop talking about it; infact, we may have to go back tonight.  Slurps up!
