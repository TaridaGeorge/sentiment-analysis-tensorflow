On a visit in late December we had lunch in the courtyard on a warm and sunny day in Scottsdale. The Arizona winter sun was warm against our skin and the soup, salad and sandwiches were fresh and tasty. Arcadia Farms is an Arizona classic, and not just for ladies anymore - although over 80% of the diners at lunch consistently are the fairer sex. Men: go forth and enjoy, too. One of the best lunch places in Scottsdale.
