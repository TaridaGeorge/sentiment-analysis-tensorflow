I have been driving by over and over, never thought to stop.  Until a friend told me they have awesome cakes.  I buy one and brought it to my in-laws.  They thought it was fantask.  The presentation was beautiful and tasted like sin.  

So I returned to try their breakfast.  OMG!  I should have gone sooner!!  I loved the Commuter Sandwich with turkey.  YUMMY!  The LGO organic oatmeal was so decilious.  Need to go back to try the pancakes.  They looks and smelled so good.  

Just thinking about it make me want to drool....
