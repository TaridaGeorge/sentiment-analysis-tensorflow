Light!  Refreshing!    We tried Fresco (and bingsoo) for the first time Saturday night.  Did I mention it was light and refreshing?

These folks take pride in the product they sell.  Light, refreshing (did I mention that yet) frozen yogurt and carefully sliced fresh fruit on top of finely shaved ice with a drizzle of mango glaze.  Light and refreshing and so much healthier than DQ.  

We'll be back for more and to try the boba.
