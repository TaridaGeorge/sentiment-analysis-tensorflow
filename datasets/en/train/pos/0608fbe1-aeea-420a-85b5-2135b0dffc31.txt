I love this place as much as I love the English accent. 
Cornish Pasty is moved beyond expectation by its consistent vision of, quality products, fresh food and employees that love the food so much one can taste it. 
 What else can a yelper ask from this location.  Its hard to find location but once you know its always a debat, Cheba Hut or Cornish Pasty, sometimes it depends what I did earlier in the day.  
  Its so hard to give 5 stars out but this place deserves it, I can't deny the whole experience and the restaurants dedication to food. 

I also heard they have a great deal for Irish Car bombs.
