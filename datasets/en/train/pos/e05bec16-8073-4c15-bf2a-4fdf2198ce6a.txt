Tried this while driving back to Las Vegas after Christmas in AZ, and the entire family LOVED the food (including 3 boys aged 7-15) - all the types of meat we tried (chicken, ribs, pulled pork) were tender and very smokey. My oldest son had the bacon-wrapped hot dog (Sloppy Dog?) and it filled him up (unusually for this teen boy). 

I was reluctant to try a local resturant at first, because the week before on the way through town I made a BAD choice (only 1 of 5 family members thought the food there was even OK) but my wife chose this location with the help of Yelp (yea Yelp!) and we were very happy with the food and service. Certainly we will be eating here again the next time in WIckenberg.
