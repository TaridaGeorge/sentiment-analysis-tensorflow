First things first....do not come here expecting to eat fabulous sushi. Come here if you want to eat sushi in the most non-traiditonal way possible. 

This place is so much fun. Reading the menu will make you giggle. And if there is someone in your group nervous about eating sushi, this is a great place to take them as they have so many different options. 

Yes, the wasabi is blue and it's almost scary. Look past the electric blue glob and devour the food. Drinks here are also great. Best of all...the prices are just right.
