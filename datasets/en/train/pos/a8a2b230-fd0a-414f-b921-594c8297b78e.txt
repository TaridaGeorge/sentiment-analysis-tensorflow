This place is as good as it gets in Tempe, and I have lived here 20+ years. The owners are always very friendly, and they are eager to share to share their vision for their shop. OSP does not just have the best coffee in Tempe; they also the best barista in the state (Take my word for it, Gianni is the best). Prior to going to OSP for my iced americano every day, I had been going to Cartel Coffee Lab for a number of years. I have to say that I like OSP much better as I get a great drink without having to wait 20 minutes in line. 
I will definitely be a regular from now on!
