This is a great dive bar with a little stage.  I used to live right across the street from this place and when i needed to find something to do i headed over to this cool punk rock style bar, its actually hard core!!  A couple of pool tables too... Fun fun fun and inexpensive and just down the street is a convenience store and dance and strip clubs. close enough for ASU students to get away from University and Mill Ave... From LA to Arizona this is another one my favorite places besides the powerhouse (hollywood), the rusty spur (old townscottsdale) and the roadrunner (n. Scottsdale) without feeling out of place
