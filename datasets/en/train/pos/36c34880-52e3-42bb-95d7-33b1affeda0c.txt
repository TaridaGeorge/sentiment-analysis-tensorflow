Just an update on this restaurant for my second trip to the Phoenix area. I'm still avoiding the healthy drinks on the menu. But the food is just too good that I'm updating my review to 5 stars. The Harvest salad is just as I remembered it and is still the best salad I've ever eaten. This time we had the Chicken Sausage pizza, which was pretty good, but I'm always impressed with the crust. This meal we had fish: the Black Cod in a miso broth was so sweet and tender. And the Arctic Char (seasonal) was cooked perfectly with a great kale salad on the side. And the service was very friendly and expeditious as usual.
