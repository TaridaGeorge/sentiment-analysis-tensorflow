I can't understand any of the poo-poo reviews here, because I went last night and it was perfect.  I got an Austrian Dobblebock, a small hummus plate appetizer, and the Pear sandwich (Prosciutto, pear, Brie, and some tasty rationed sauce on Focaccia) w/ an orzo pasta salad.  I'm actually not a big sandwich guy, but this was excellent!

The vibe was kind of like a Boston dive in Central Square, but with the indie-hippster Phoenix flare, and the service was great.  I also loved loved loved the eclectic beer list, and did I mention the hummus was really good?

2 beers + 1 app + 2 meals = $33 before tip.  I'll be back!
