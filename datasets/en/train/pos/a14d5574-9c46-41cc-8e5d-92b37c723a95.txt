Service is impeccable.  I have never had a bad experience at Mastros. The martinis are about two drinks they bring out in shaker with dry ice. Steak cooked to perfection and ahi tuna is deliciously seasoned. They have tower of build it yourself seafood. Butter cream cake with whip cream made from scratch. Live music. The crowd and ambiance is great. I love Mastros!!!!  I will be a return customer over and over again!!
