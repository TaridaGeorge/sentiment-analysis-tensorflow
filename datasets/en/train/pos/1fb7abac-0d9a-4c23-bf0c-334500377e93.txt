The food is outstanding. The French-Vietnamese chef, Duc, has a genuine passion and love for food. He was extremely friendly and talked to us about his passion. The place is very modest but don't be fooled by appearances. This place will blow up and become very popular no doubt with the high quality of food offered here. If you have a big party call ahead and they will be able to take better care of your group.
