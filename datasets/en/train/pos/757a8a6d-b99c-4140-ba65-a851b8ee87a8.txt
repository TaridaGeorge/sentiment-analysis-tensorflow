Only came here for after dinner tropical drinks and dessert

Found the ambience to be nice, and we sat on the upstairs patio and were able to enjoy the beautiful weather

To drink I had a key west colada.  It was awesome.  Truly awesome.

The rest of the people in my party enjoyed various mojitos from the drink menu, and no one was disappointed.

We eventually ordered the Butterscotch dessert, and while it was only 1 dessert, it served all six people in my party.
The dessert was HUGE
and very rich

Very good though.  It was sugarcane and whiskey all whipped together with creme and then topped with chocolate ganache and caramel sauce....

MMMMM.......

So yeah, we had fun!  I would recommend, if only for after dinner drinks and dessert.
