flos is probably one of my favorite places for takeout. Its also very nice restaurant. They have a mixture of Chinese and thai food. They're teriyaki chicken is delicious.. and i love their egg rolls, they're so light.
I been to some pretty pricey Chinese restaurants in the valley and wasted money,  Flo's is definitely worth every penny. if you want delicious fine Chinese/Thai cuisine, flo's is the place to be!
