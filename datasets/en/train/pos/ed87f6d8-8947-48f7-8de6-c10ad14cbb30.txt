Oh my goodness, I have forgotten to review Rocket Burger?! I'm such a bad customer, because I love this place and feel everyone should try them out. I've had:

California Club
The New Yorker -yum!
BBQ pulled pork- even good straight out of the fridge next day with no warm up!
Regular burger
Some special burger they did on Memorial Day with the Rocket Relish- so good and spicy!
Fries
Cheese curds- never had these before, and I really like them now
Chili cheese fries
Brownie

So anyhow... I've been there a time or 6. Good food, great prices, friendly service. Definite go-to spot when I'm around the area
