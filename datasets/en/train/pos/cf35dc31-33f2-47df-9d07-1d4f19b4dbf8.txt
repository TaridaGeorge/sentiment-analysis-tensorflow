Saw this on the show "Man VS Food". I had the regular Torta Del Rey and my wife had the chopped chicken quesadilla. Both our choices were delicious. Her quesadilla was tender and huge. The torta was...well...is "huger" a word? This sandwich had everything on it...literally. Breaded beef, chorizo, chopped chicken, beef strips, cheese, tomato, avocado...and all topped off by an egg! This thing was a good four inches thick. I wound up taking half of it home and it was almost as good reheated as it was fresh. We got out for less than 20 dollars and felt very satisfied. We WILL be going back!
