Oh wow- what a great place! You would miss it if you blinked, right between a PetCo and Fry's grocery. Small and cozy- we got there just before the dinner rush and thank goodness we did because it filled up fast. 

Let's just get right to the food- awesome. The servings are pretty good size. I had Serjio's ravioli, which is a shrimp mixture. SO good. Kids loved the cheese and spinach ravioli, and husband loved the Gnocchi. Really good flavors. The service was also pretty decent. Great place, I would love to go back again! It's nice to find some great Italian food that isn't overpriced.
