Wow!

This is an amazing place. I don't normally speak highly about chain restaurants but this is the exception to the rule. We had the kick butt Garlic bread, Lawrence's Original medium thin crust pizza, and an Oreganos Favorite salad.

The salad and the garlic bread was amazing but by far my favorite item was the pizza. Friends be warned, one can scarf a whole pizza: no problem! It's that good and that easy to eat.

Will definitely be back to go through the rest of the menu!
