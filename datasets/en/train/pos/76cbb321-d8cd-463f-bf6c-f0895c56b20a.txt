We had a bad experience in May with a person at Charleston's we thought to be a manager (see review).  The next day my husband and brother-in-law contacted the restaurant manager, Chris, we had great and immediate communication with him and he encouraged us to give the restaurant another try as we had been happy there before.  
Recently, we had a large party of family members dine at the restaurant and the service and food was perfect.  Chris made a point to check in with us at the table and at the end of the meal.  Great job, Chris and team!  We look forward to dining at Charleston's with you again soon.
