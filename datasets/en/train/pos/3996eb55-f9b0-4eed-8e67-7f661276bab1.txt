Mike at Good Guys Electric is excellent!  He completed various electrical projects in our home, from checking connections, updating wiring and ordering custom parts to installing an outlet outdoors.  As far as pricing goes, his quote was very reasonable and in the end, accurate.  He is now my go-to electrician and I highly recommend his work.  I am very grateful to have located him through yelp!!
