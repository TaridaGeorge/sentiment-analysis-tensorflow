Really good food! The burger was delectable, the short ribs were tasty in just the right way. I seriously recommend you get something that includes their house made tortillas.

About the service: they must be reading the reviews here, because Thursday night (day before yesterday) service was tremendous. Did not ever have to wait for anything, and they were proactive but not overbearing about checking up on us.
