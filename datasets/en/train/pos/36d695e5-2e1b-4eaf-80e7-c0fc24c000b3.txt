My son has been attending child care here for just over a year.

It was a challenge to watch my son go from not want to go to child care to eventually not wanting to come home... lol

The staff at Tots are friendly and knowledgeable.  They treat all the kids as if they were their own.

The best thing about Tots is their flexible payments.  You are able to pay daily, instead of having to pay by the week or month.

Much Mahalo for taking care of my Maikalani O Pua!
