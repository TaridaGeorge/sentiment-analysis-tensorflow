Got an awesome haircut today after trying this place for the first time!  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers for the great reviews, I decided to walk in and entrust my hair to a guy named "Gamlet."  I look and feel like a new person and I've never had that feeling walking out of a salon or barber...  EVER!  The place was friendly, laid-back and very unassuming, which was quite refreshing.  $22 for standard haircut & style (btw, 99% scissor-cut, not clippers) followed by a warm neck shave and shoulder massage.  I'm definitely going back!
