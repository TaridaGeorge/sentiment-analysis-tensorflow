Total class act !
Potent well made drinks and delicious noshes from Elements can be found here.Sleek and lovely interior holds a  nice crowd of people that behave well. It is so nice to come here as it has never been too noisy ,the service is always very good .I love their patio too..it can be very intimate - great views  ,and they have heaters and a nice fire bowl going in the fall .

Raspberry sidecar and the Grapefruit Basil are super yummy ,and the mixologists do love to create you something right on the spot .Free music on Friday nights gives you yet another reason to simply adore Jade .
This is the first place i think of when anybody mentions cocktails.
