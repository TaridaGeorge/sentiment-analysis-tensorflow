Speechless!

The flavors in everything were fantastic and the lunch special, $7.75 for half sandwich with half soup or half salad plus a bonus bag of chips (try the Funky Fusion if you're okay with salt and vinegar) and the most amazing little cookie you will ever taste in your life, is an absolute steal. 

If I HAD to say anything negative about this place it would be that the bread is a little thin in proportion to the fillings (but I'm a bread person when it comes to sammies) and is that really something to complain about??? The sandwiches are stuffed with quality ingredients and the love you can only get from a mom-and-pop shop. 

...and those little cookies will take you to heaven and let you drift slowly and ecstatically back to your deliciously full and satisfied stomach.
