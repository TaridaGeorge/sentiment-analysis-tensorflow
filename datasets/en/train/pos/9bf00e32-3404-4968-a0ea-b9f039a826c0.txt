Love the concept of a green gym where I can do a little good for the planet while burning calories! More than a gimmick though, this place is a solid gym with a great variety of classes, the latest equipment, and a super helpful and friendly staff. Oh, and they have Curve treadmills, the newest ones that burn 30% more calories and are easier on the joints too.
