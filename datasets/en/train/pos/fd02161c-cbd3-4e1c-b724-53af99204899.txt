Best NY pizza around. I am always greeted by the guys making the pizza, but maybe because I smile at them first? The ladies are nice enough too. I think customers expect a red carpet or something. It's pizza and it is GOOD pizza. My favorite. I don't care if a monkey serves it to me I will continue to go back and stuff my face.
