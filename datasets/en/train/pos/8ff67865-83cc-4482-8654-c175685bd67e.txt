My nails and toenails have never looked better or stayed on so long! I can literally go 3 or 4 weeks between appts. Vicky is an artist and has an amazing selection of the hottest new shellac colors. She is not in my neighborhood but since she is the best, I don't mind the drive! You won't be disappointed!
