I love Cost Plus! If you are sick of decorating your house with Linens and Things than you need to come here. Cost Plus World Market is pretty self explanatory in the title. Basically they sell imported furniture housewares, groceries, wine, and anything you would use to decorate. I have a lot of weird little trinkets in my room from this place such as:
A Chinese painting kit
Elephant wall hanging
magnetic board
Buddha painting

They also have an awesome coffee and tea area where I found the Chai tea mix I love as well as coffee syrups I used when I was a barista. 

Why not add some global influences to your decorating style?
