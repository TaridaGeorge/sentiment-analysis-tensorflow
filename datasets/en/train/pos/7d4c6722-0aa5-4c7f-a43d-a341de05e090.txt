Does it get any friendlier than this?  (Must be the sunshine and glorious temps in the winter- everyone in Scottsdale seems happy- and this placed topped out the smile & hospitality meter.)

Love the Buzz.  How can you go wrong with peanut butter, espresso, chocolate, and banana whipped up into a breakfast smoothie?  Fair-trade locally-roasted beans?  Kudos. 

Ate in one morning with friends- cozy little indoor & outdoor spaces.  Had the low-carb breakfast- a pesto-ed fried egg salad and it was excellent.  So good I had to go back the next morning before flying home.  Tried the drive thru and grabbed a breakfast burrito (add some sausage & avocado for a cali-flair).  Perfect.

This healthy fast food movement needs to make its way West.. 
Come to San Francisco, D'Lish!
