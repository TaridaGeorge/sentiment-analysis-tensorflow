Remember when you were little and you came home to fresh baked cookies?  Me either.  BUT, when you walk into Chocolate Star Bakery's adorable shop, you are immediately transported to that idealistic scent that makes it almost feel like you are 8, waiting for your mom to pour the milk so you can eat the delicious cookie, fresh from the ovens.  

I love anything they make with chocolate and mint, and my kids love the pink clouds--a delicious sugar cookie.   I also love that I can send these as gifts-- I love supporting local businesses--especially one as cute and friendly as this one!
