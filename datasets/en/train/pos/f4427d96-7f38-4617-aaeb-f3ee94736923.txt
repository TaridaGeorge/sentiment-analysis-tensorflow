This is a great place for sushi. It's always fresh and tasty. They have one of the best seaweed salads in Phoenix. They are also have inari which is a fav of mine and very difficult to find around here. I'd recommend the veggie roll as well. I never eat tempura or teriyaki so I can't comment on those selections.
