Holy Mary Mother of God. Seriously. No, really. Brunch. Go.

The coffee sucks, but the banana rum cake french toast, though skimpy on both banana and pecans (as advertised in the menu) is overloaded with delicious delicious flavors. Even the suspicious sounding pomegranate creme anglais was heartrendingly yummy. And ample. I could eat it for every meal for my life. Or for a week, at least.

The Potato Mish Mash (sans bacon) was also stupidly good. The prices are reasonable, and the portions are good, though not terribly large. The fresh fruit side is the only thing I would stay away from; getting a side of sliced apples and green grapes with your meal is somehow sort of sad when everything else is so exciting.
