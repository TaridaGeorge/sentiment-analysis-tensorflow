This place is amazing.  The selection is excellent.  This place is second only to Hi Times Wine Cellar in Costa Mesa California.  They have a great craft beer and wine selection.  They also have free wine tasting going most of the afternoon Friday through Sunday.  When I went they had some free tasting for some flavored vodkas as well.
