I was so excited to see 5 Guys open up in AZ!  I first fell in love back in the 90's in VA.  I couldn't stop talking about how great the burgers and fries were and how you got free peanuts while you waited.  Finally I got to show my husband and friends what I've been talking about for years.  5 Guys, you did not disappoint!  As great as I remembered!  Real bacon, and you get to customize your buger just the way you want it.  Tons of fries that two can share.  Too bad I like the cajun and hubby likes the plain.
