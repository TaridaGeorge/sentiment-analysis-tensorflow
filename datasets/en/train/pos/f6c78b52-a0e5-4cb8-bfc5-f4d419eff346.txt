AMAZING!!! I went here the other night and had the best burger ever!! Literally I doubt anyone can top this!! The prices are decent too! This little "hole-in-the-wall" doesn't do little for their food :) The burgers were huge and yummy! The Grind reminded me of somewhere you would find in NYC.. The lighting and even the awesome TV's made the restaurant seem very modern with a stylish touch! I will definitely be going here again!!!!!
