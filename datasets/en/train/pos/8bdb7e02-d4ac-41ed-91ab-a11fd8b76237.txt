This is one super cool cafe/lounge.  They serve coffee, cocktails, and some quick bites that can go along great with your drinks.  There are several rooms you can choose from to sit and relax.  Art decor surrounds this stylish joint and just had a great time here sipping on coffee and chatting with a friend who recommended this coffee shop to me.  I noticed a younger adult crowd here but it doesn't matter.  Wi-Fi friendly, too!
