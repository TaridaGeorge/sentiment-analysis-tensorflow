Every time I come in here, I find high-ticket items for cheap that suit my style preference and size...I have found Stacy Adams loafers for $20, Steve Madden shoes for $15, polo dress shirts for $12. Just found a Bugatchi Uomo Italian dress shirt for $14 the other day (I'm sure normally like $80 or so). This is my favorite place to buy clothes, bar none. Much of the stuff is in very good to almost new condition. Oops...now I've let the cat out of the bag, and there's going to be a run on the place. Damn! No, just kidding... I'm happy to share. Hope y'all find the joy in clothes shopping as I have with Well Suited.
