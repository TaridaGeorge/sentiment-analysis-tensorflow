Came here with a groupon, and was very pleased with the food and service. I ordered broiled salmon and a few scallops on the side. Everything was delicious, although the scallops were fried and I would have preferred them broiled. I don't think the menu mentioned they were fried so be careful when ordering.

The food was very good quality considering the quickness in which they cooked it, and the service was superb.
