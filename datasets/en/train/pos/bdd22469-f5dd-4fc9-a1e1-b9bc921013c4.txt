Four of us dined there on Christmas Eve and it was absolutely incredible! The food, service, wine and atmosphere were all second to none.  
Beverages - we consumed 3 bottles of Arizona Stronghold "Mangus" (from Reverend Maynard James Keenans' vineyard up north).
Food - we each got something different.....the best way to do it......
-Foie gras torchon...excellent
-Scallop Ceviche....excellent
-Wild Mushroom Soup....excellent
-Tuna Tartar....excellent

-Beech Mushroom Risotto with fresh shaved white truffles...no words to describe how great this was.

-John Dory....excellent
-Duck Breast....excellent
-Duo of Pork....excellent
-Seared Scallops...excellent

We all couldn't of been happier with the whole experience! Also, I love the (really) open kitchen...
Can't wait to go back!
