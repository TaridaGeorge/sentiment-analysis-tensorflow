I really like this place and try to stop in whenever I'm in the area. Food is always good and so is the service. Had the wor wonton soup for the first time and I loved it! It had chicken shrimp and wontons plus cabbage, zucchini and snap peas in a hearty broth. This is my favorite Chinese place around. I only wish I lived closer to it! I also had the lunch special beef and vegetables but got it with chicken instead. Amazing! Just what I had hoped for! Delicious chicken with mushrooms, bok Chou, snap peas and more in a tasty brown sauce. So good I want to come back for dinner!
