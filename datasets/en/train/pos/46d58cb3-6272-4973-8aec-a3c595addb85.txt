The Spa at Camelback Inn is one of my favorite places in Arizona. The resort is beautiful and the spa is amazing. The grounds of the spa are gorgeous and tranquil. The Swedish massage is the best I have ever had. Even the shampoo and hand soap smell delicious - I had to buy them for myself. A day here takes away all my worries. I am addicted!
