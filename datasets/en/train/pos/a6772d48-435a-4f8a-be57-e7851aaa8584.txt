I just got back from Italy couple of months ago & haven't been able to eat any pizza here since...finally remembered i went to Grimaldis in old town years back & liked it....tried the one in Scottsdale Quarter by my house & it was even better. Just got the Thin Crust, with Roasted Red pepper + Ricotta cheese..yum yum yum...also nice atmosphere there!
