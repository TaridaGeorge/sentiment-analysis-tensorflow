I got a haircut yesterday by Alyse, and I actually woke up this morning thinking that my hair still looks great. Ive seen lots of hair stylists in LA, NYC, and in town and Alyse gave the best haircut and service I have seen in awhile. She is easy to chat with, offers great advice, and seems to actually enjoy her work.

I loved the location and setting as it seems much more laid back and personable than your average salon. I look forward to having Alyse cut my hair in the future.
