I'll be honest: I've only been here twice. But both times, the baristas have been friendly and intelligent...and they properly pull an espresso shot and make a mean iced toddy (sometimes, the temperatures are too high here for a hot americano...). 

Most important for me, they have awesome beans to take home and feed to my grinder and french press - try the Brazilian Blue and the Mexican Chiapas.
