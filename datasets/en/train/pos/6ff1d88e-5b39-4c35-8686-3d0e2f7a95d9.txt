Love, love, love Champagne Brunch at Narcisse!

The decor, service, and food is phenomenal and a few glasses of bubbles can never hurt a Sunday morning. I've enjoyed the pancakes, scones, eggs benedict, and my favorite breakfast sammy - the dom! Everything is elegantly plated and tastes really fresh.

The nightlife is upscale, but a little Scottsdale-homogenous - everyone seems to look the same. If that's the scene you crave, then Narcisse is the place to be!

Hm.  Now I want breakfast food and champagne...
