This place is great. It's part coffee shop (see reviews of The Coffee Conspiracy), part art gallery, part book shop, part artist-made jewelry shop, part clothing store, and parts of a bunch of other things all in one tiny house turned shop. Most everything is hand-made/painted/drawn. They have some cool stuff here that you won't find anywhere else in the world, and some great things for gifts for entire family. Check this place out for sure.
