The only drawback is the service is done primarily by high school kids so, while they are very polite and courteous, they have a tendency to not know common service rules such as not taking one person's plate when another person at the table is still eating.  But the food is marvelous, the crowd is relaxed, and they really do care about their customers.
This would be a great place to have downtown.
