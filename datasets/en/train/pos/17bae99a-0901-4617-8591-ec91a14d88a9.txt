Best prices I can find in Arizona! Huge selection is an understatement... more like great big ginormous mega giant selection!!   Has all those hard to find items.  If they don't have it they will order it for you.   

Wine tasting booth on certain days is very nice to try a new wine.   There is very helpful informative workers willing and eager to help pick out a wine or other item.  I am not a huge wine drinker, I love it but I don't know much about picking out a good wine and I am often on a budget.  The employees have never steered me wrong with a wine and the discription I was looking for.  Never have they tried to force a product on me out of my price ranger either.

You can often find a free tote coupon in the newspaper so keep your eyes open for them.
