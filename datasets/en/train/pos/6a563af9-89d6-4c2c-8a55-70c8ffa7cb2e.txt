Every time I visit this coffee shop, I wish I lived closer! The building is adorable (converted gas station), they have free wifi and they are vegan-friendly. I hear wonderful things about their cupcakes, but I haven't checked to see if they carry vegan cupcakes. I did have a vegan apple cinnamon muffin there a while back that was delicious.
