We come here every Sundays after church for breakfast!
it's one of our favorite breakfast spots ever! It's usually busy that day so I suggest you call and reserve if you don't want to wait.  This place is a cute little cafe, the staff is awesome, the food is great and you get pretty big portions for breakfast for a good price. My all time favorite would have to be the California Benny and my boyfriend always gets the Princess Omelette. My boyfriends dad is in love with their Country fried steak. He said it's better than Cracker Barrel's and I would have to agree on that.  We tried almost everything on their breakfast menu and I can't really think of a dish that I was disappointed in so I say go check this place out!
