This shop is a diamond in the rough....

I am a novice biker at best, but coming in this store Ryan, and the rest of his staff helped me out made me feel super comfortable and made great suggestions for my bike....

Their pricing beat the shit out of other stores in town, and my bike rides better then any of I have ridden before since I had him set it up....It's nice to be able to have such an honest hardworking individual running a small business as it doesn't seem to happen that often any more.

I highly suggest checking him out if you thinking of buying any bike, as their prices are very good, and knowledge is even better....try them out you wont be dissapointed.

It doesn't get better than this if you want to ride....
