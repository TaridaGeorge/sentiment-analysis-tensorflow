I grew up going to Four Peaks on 8th Street near ASU and loved their vibe and atmosphere along with their brews.  I live out in east Mesa now and the revitalized downtown Chandler has a similar charm these days.  My taste buds have now developed into a full blown obsession for IPA style brews.  It was a hot Thursday afternoon and my girlfriend had to work out some financials with her EX so I was wisked off to the closest brewery.  When my girlfriend arrived I was two IPA's into it when we ordered the grilled cheese with a couple of salads.  The food is amazing and this selection was no different gouda, tomatoes on artisan flat bread oooohhh yea baby!!!!  Oh and these people love what they do and it shows as their service is heads above those trendy tempe/scottsdale bars/clubs.
