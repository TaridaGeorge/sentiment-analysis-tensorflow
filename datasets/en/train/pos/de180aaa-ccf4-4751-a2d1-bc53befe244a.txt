Main reason to go to Sonora - the Kobe burger!  By far the best burger in town.  I usually go for lunch since its close to my office and have never been disappointed by the food.  Great service, great waitstaff, great food.  I've been once for dinner and the beer is exceptional.  All around a great pick! Even worth the drive from the NW Valley.
