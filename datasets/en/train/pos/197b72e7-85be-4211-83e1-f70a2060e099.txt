The Meritage Steakhouse is a hidden GEM in Phoenix!  It is perfectly located for anyone in the west valley, right off the 101 in the JW Marriot Desert Ridge resort.  

Prices were reasonable for a quality steakhouse and the Meritage did NOT dissapoint.  Great service, attentive, but not intrusive.  Management did the rounds which is always a nice touch.

First of all, the steak was cooked to temp which is always a great way to impress me right out of the gates.  They nailed it.  The wedge salad was delicious, the beef carpacio appetizer was awesome.  What else can I say?  The meal was great from start to finish!

I would add the Meritage to your short list of places to check out.  It is a great alternative to Flemings, Ruth Chris, Mortons, etc!  Nice out-door dining options too!

ENJOY!
