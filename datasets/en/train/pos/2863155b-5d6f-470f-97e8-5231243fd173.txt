Just wanted to send cheers to G-Star Scottsdale for continuing to be RAW; And by RAW I mean awesome! The heads up phone calls, a prerequisite to better fashion, continue to come. Keep it up. They will search for articles through the distributor if the item is not available in store and they are helpful in the store too. Been loving the line for some time, does not look like something to go from fad to bad. PLEASE GET YOUR CLOTHES AWAY FROM BUCKLE! I dont need to see an Obey, RVCA or Affliction shirt next to G-Star. Thanks.
 Only downfall is G-Star on lexington in NYC spoiled me too much. The Scottsdale store is about 1/2 the size.
