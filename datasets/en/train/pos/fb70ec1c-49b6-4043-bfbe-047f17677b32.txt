On a recommendation from my wife for a great place to have a meeting, I suggested to my new clients that we meet at Next Coffee Co. For a first visit I was surprised when the folks behind the barista immediately recognized me as a new customer and took the time to explain their services. As an avid tea-drinker I was pleasantly confronted with many options for both iced and hot tea.

With a full breakfast buffet and a solid selection of beverages you can't miss with Next. Make it your next stop in the west valley!
