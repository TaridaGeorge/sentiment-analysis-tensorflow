Have been here only once since my last Update a year ago because it's way down here in sticks, but oh what a treat this trippy place is!

On this visit Robyn N. & Mike C. joined in, & I went with a Sonoran hotdog, onion rings & a chocolate malt.  Yes these these guys are a little expensive, but there's no place else like it & both the food & the fun here have been absolutely 5 Stars for me on every visit!     :-))

Sonoran Dog & Side $6.99, upgrade to Onion Rings $2.50, Chocolate Malt $4.49.
