Places like this are such a refreshing change of pace here in Phoenix.  Even if the food weren't good, I'd recommend people to come here just for the atmosphere. 

I came here on a recommendation from a customer of mine, and I was not at all disappointed.  The place is usually busy, so I'd suggest ordering over the phone and skipping the 10-15 minute wait, if you're in a hurry.

The employees were friendly and made good suggestions for a 1st-timer like myself.  I'm with the other reviewers: keep this in the DeFalco family!  You've got a great thing going, keep it up.
