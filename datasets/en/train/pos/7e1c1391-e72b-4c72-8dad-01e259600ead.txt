You know what!?  I have been going to this hole-in-the-wall Chinese take-out place for about 10 years now and its time to give it its due.  I have pretty much only ordered one dish because there is no reason to order anything else here.....The Hunan Chicken.  In the 10 years some things have remained very constant:  1. The owner is very friendly and is always working. 2. This dish is always consistent and tasty. and 3.  They are very quick and cheap.   
What more is there?  I'm going 5-star just based off of that.
