Do you ever want to go out for dinner but just can't decide on what you want or where you want to go???  Well, I think I have found that place to go for very good food.  

The Pernil Asado (pork) was very moist and flavorfull.  
My wife got the veggie enchiladas...all fresh veggies.

Cornbread caserole (with bacon), jalapeno cream corn, and chipolatle mashed potatoes were all great.  

The portions were very big...had to roll is out!
