I come here about once a week to work and attend their hacknight. I've been coming here since last October when they had their Startup Weekend event. The owners and others who work here are very nice and helpful if you need some help. It's a great place to work with other technophiles, and learn in the process.

Drop by and you will meet plenty of new people, who will be very nice, and will even help you get acquainted with others.
