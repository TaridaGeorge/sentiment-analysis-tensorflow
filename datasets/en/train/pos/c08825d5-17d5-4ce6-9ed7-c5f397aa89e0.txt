The Paper Studio is a store, a gallery, and a classroom. They carry lots of craft, bookbinding, and scrapbooking supplies, as well as stationary and some amazingly beautiful paper. They have a small gallery where they show handmade books and other paper crafts by local & national artists. They also hold a regular schedule of classes: bookbinding, paper making, letterpress classes and more. Check out their website for a schedule. The staff is super friendly and nice, the classes are fun, and it's always a pleasure to shop there.
