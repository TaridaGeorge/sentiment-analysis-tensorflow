We had brunch at El Chorro today and it was wonderful. The patio was comfortable with the umbrellas and heaters. The service was outstanding. The food was delicious. I had the creme brulee french toast - it was carb/sugar heaven. Everyone else enjoyed their food. The eggs benedict came out perfect. The BLT looked awesome. The fries were delicious. We will definitely be back.
