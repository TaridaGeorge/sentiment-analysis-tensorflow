Went here for an eye exam and to get fitted for contacts for my first time. I came in and was met with a very friendly staff and a nice office. Then was greeted by Dr. Eric Clyde himself and taken through the tests. He was very informative throughout and really seemed to go the extra mile in making me comfortable. 

I now go out of my way (live in SF) to get my exams and check ups done here.

Thanks Doc!
