Numerous times since Verde shut its doors have I sat, eyes glazed over, longing absent mindedly for a good horchata.  Enter: The Sweetness.

Their horchata ice cream is delicious and fills that void in my soul that Verde's departure left.  The other night, I also tried their spicy chocolate and that, too, was amazingly good.  In fact I've tried many of their flavors and que rico to all of them!

Nestled right inside the door of the Fair Trade on Roosevelt, I love that I finally have a local small biz ice cream option in downtown, and the fact that I can get that local small biz ice cream wrapped awkwardly in a warm freshly cooked waffle makes it even all that much better. :-)
