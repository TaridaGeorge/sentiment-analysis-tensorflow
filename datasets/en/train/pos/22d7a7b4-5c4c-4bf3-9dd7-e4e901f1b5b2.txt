Hipster is an understatement, but I learned to see past that and the "interesting" people really quick! After my first bite of the Filet-o-Fish and their sweet potatoes fries with that oh so addicting curry mayonnaise! Yum! I have also had their summer shrimp salad, steak salad, fish tacos and several other things. All delicious! I have figured out that no matter what I order, the chef behind the menu knows his food! They really understand how to create depth and develop flavors. 
By the way, their dinner menu is much better than their brunch/lunch menu, so go AFTER 2!
Wish their service was a little better, but LOVE their food and would suggest this to anyone and everyone! A Phoenix Must try!
