I'm half Japanese and have had a very difficult time finding good authentic Japanese food in the Phoenix area.  I am so impressed with this little restaurant!  The customer service is awesome.  The owner walked around talking to people and refilling drinks, getting to go boxes, and generally made sure everyone had everything they needed.  Top that off with some majorly delicious Japanese food, and that's The Blue Fin.  I had the Katsu Pork and I have to tell ya, it's just like my mother's.  Their food is made fresh and their sushi is made daily.  It's made the old fashioned Japanese way, not like the kind you get at Fry's Grocery Store.  Their prices are also very reasonable.  I can't wait to go back for the third time to try some other dishes.  Hmmm...maybe the yakisoba...
