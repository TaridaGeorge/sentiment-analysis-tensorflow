I'm a 30-something mommy (been a while since I lived in NYC and rocked wild punky clothes) so at 1st glance, 42 Saint was a question mark for me.  Every time I popped my head into this store though, the sales people were always really cool even when I'd say "I'm not feelin it."  Finally dug into this store the other day and had a great experience.  It's a great place for awesome jeans and accessories that add 'just enough.'.  They have high-end tops/dresses to match, found a lot of mark downs and totally scored.  Peter, the  friendly chain-wearing, pierced, very rock-n-roll store manager offered the hubby a beer while I had my own time (can't beat that!!!).  I usually wear simple more feminine tops but will hit 42 Saint for a punch to the wardrobe and visit their awesome staff.
