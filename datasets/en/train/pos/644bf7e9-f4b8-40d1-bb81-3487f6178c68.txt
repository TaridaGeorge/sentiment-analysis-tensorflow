I don't eat meat anymore but man am I going to miss this place. Best word to describe the food would be yum-a-licious! The freshest, most tender, moistest chicken fingers you will ever have, along with a ridiculously nice staff and clean restaurant. I would definitely recommend the regular box: three chicken fingers, waffle fries, texas toast, and sauce. They make it when you order it and the food is so delicious! The chicken has a very light but flavorful batter and the chicken is just rockin' good. Try it please!
