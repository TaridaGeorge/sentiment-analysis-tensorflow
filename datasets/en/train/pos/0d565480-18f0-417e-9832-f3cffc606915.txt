Excellent Subs, So far its been consistent for me. The actual store could use some work and decor, but what would I expect out front of a community college.

Lunch Deal is also great. $5 bucks for 8" Sub, chips n Drink... I wouldn't expect more service since, the price is great. If they hired some knowledgeable experiences service staff, they would need to pay more, thus prices going up.. I am totally kewl with the way they are..
