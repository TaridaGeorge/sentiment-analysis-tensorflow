The wonton soup was to die for! I had the garlic chicken and it was delicious. My fianc√© had the basil beef which was also good but not as good as mine. The portions were huge, plenty to take home for another meal. The ratio of meat to the amount of rice they give is like 4:1 but the waiter offered more when he saw we finished it all quickly, so we had some to bring home with leftovers so that was cool. The dining room was open and airy and there was nice music playing, all and all a great little restaurant. I'll be back! :)
