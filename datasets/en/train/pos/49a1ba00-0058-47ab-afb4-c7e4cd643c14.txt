My friend lives here. It reminds me of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon with all of the rich vegetation that falls off the balconies. He lives on the 5th floor. On his balcony is a damn palm tree planted into the ground with mulch. I coulnd't believe it! How could this happen? So I decided to sleep on the mulch my first night in town and pass out. This didn't last too long, I started thinking about a scorpion stinging my drunk self and slept inside. Very nice condo with a decent workout center. Indoor and outdoor pools. A lot of rich people live here though and seem to be like sticks in the mud, so I guess that would suck to deal with. Damned if you do, damned if you don't! I rather live around poor people, but that is just me.
