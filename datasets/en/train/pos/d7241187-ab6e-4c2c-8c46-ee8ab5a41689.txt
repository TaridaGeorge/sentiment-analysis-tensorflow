After spending many years living in Silicon Valley, I couldn't wait for an Indian restaurant to open up in the West Valley. It's hard to list a favorite because I loved everything I tried...Garlic Naan, Shrimp Vindaloo, Curry Chicken, Karahi Lamb, etc.. Don't forget to try the Mango Lassi and Kheer if you have a sweet tooth. They're family owned and operated and all great people. I love the decor and ambiance. And I can't wait to try their lunch buffet and their beers from India.
