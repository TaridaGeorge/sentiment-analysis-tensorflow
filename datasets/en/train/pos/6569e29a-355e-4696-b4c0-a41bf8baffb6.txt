Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic!
Service: excellent, friendly, attentive
- the server was energetic, answered all of our questions, refilled our drinks and the sauces
Food: my tastebuds couldn't stop thanking me for coming here
- the different sauces were AMAZING, humus was good, salad had a little too much olive oil but still refreshing, the rice was so super I asked for more
- we ordered the meal for two and it was more than the two of us could handle (and I can EAT)
- the mixed plate had everything and we loved it all!
- they didn't have the rice pudding I wanted for dessert, but the baklava was divine
Price:
- very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food, the lunch specials look like a bargain

I absolutely recommend this place and will go back for more!
