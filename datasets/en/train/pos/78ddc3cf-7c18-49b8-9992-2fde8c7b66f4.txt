I wanted to hate this place.  There isn't that much parking.  It is packed with only a few big picnic tables to sit outside and eat.  It was to hot to eat outside, IMO which meant I had to take my sandwhich to go.  There were only 4 sandwiches and 3 salads to choose from.  One dessert they were sold out of.  The price was high- $8 for a sandwich with no sides.

However, once I took my first bite of the tomatoe, basil, mozzarella sandwich I was in HEAVEN.  The perfect amount of each ingredient.  They have perfected the sandwich!!  I have been craving it ever since.  I will stop by for lunch EVERYTIME I am in the area.  I will bring everyone I know to eat here!  Seriously!
