I've been to the Camelback Inn 4 or 5 times now, and have been nothing but satisfied.  

The rooms are clean, spacious, cozy and romantic (if you're in to that).

The resort is beautiful.

The new addition of BLT Steakhouse is great; what a menu and wine list.

The spa, one of my favorite locations, has everything one desires at the spa. have always been happy with my service.  Their hot stone massage is amazing...put me in complete relaxation mode.  The pool and treats you can enjoy while here are also pretty great.  On this last trip I had a cut and color; Sheryl did a fantastic job!  To boot she was very friendly and sweet.  

Very much recommend...and, I'll be back!
