Walking around through the park and this place was located in just the right spot! Confirmed this place with Yelp before we walked in and all was well. I think only one spoke english, but that showed me this place was real Italian people, which made it better. Ice cream was very good and loved the little sampling spoons. Stop in this place if it's hot out and your just walking around.
