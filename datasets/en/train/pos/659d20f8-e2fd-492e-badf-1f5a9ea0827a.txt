The infamous Japanese Friendship Garden. I love this place, how can you not. The first time I went here was with my ex-girlfriend, and we just walked through it. It's awesome to just soak up the scenery and look at the wonderful koi fish swimming elegantly through the pond. Alright, enough of the sappy stuff. Nevertheless, this place is soothing and makes me happy all the time. A terrific place to mentally stay focus. Oh btw, I enjoyed feeding the Koi fish, pretty fun, they just suck up the food off your hand like a vacuum cleaner. Really enjoy this place.
