My husband and I recently celebrated our 14th Wedding Anniversary at this restuarant with several of our friends back in September. The food was fabulous! The ambience perfect! Nice bar area too! We went during restaurant week so it was super busy! Our waitress began to slack a bit and we had issues at the end of our meal, but the Manager on duty quickly resolved things for us! This Manager went above and beyond to make us happy and ensure that we would be repeat customers! We will! Thank you Fogo de Chao! We will be dinning there in 2 weeks! Our friends from CA will be joing us! We are looking forward to another wonderful dinner!

Thank you
Pamela,
