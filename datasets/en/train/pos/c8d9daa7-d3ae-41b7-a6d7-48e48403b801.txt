LOVE this nail salon! It's called Number 1 Nails for a reason. The color selection is large, which is always a plus for me. The salon is clean (which personally for me says a lot about a store), the service is fast so there's no wait, and my nails are always glowing and beautiful after the manicure/pedicure. I adore the lady who runs this nail salon --- she makes my visit very pleasant every time. 

Not only do I recommend this gem of a nail salon for it's nail service, I refer it for waxing also. I only get waxed here now (upper lip & eyebrows) and you really can't beat the price.
