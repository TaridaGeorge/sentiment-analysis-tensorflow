THIS PLACE IS A TREASURE CHEST!! Granted, you have to set aside at least 3 hours to fully go through their entire selection and watch out for items that have holes or rips in them, but I mean what else do you expect since its the clearance of Nordstrom Rack. I spend about $100 there each time and come out with multiple pairs of shoes, dresses, tights, leggings, etc. I've gotten Marc Jacobs purses and designer jeans for about 10% of the retail price. Shopaholic certified for sure.
