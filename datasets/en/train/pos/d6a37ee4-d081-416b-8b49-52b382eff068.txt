Lamps, chairs, cowboy hats, tea cups, guitars, and anything your heart and desire is at Zinnias. When I was in the process of redecorating my living room last year, I was searching every consignment shop and antique shop in central Phoenix. The second I walked into Zinnias, I knew I had hit the jackpot. Every square foot of that place is filled with something awesome. After spending nearly an hour in ther, I decided on a table. It saddened me I had to leave but thankful that I live roughly 3 minutes away. I have since been back thousands and thousands of times (actually about 20) and find it very hard to leave without something new in my hands. I HIGHLY reccomend everyone go here.
