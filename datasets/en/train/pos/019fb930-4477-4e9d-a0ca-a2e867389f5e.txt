I went here for my first time a few weeks ago. Originally I went here to get coupons to wet and wild but then decided to eat here as well. I'm glad I decided such a good choice, the service here was great. They asked if I was a new customer and was more than happy to tell me what to order and how things worked. There are a good selection of burgers and sides. 

I ordered the Bufallo Chicken burger with blue cheese and that was delicious. It wasn't too heavy and had that nice bufallo wing sauce kick! The shoe string fries I got as my side was great too! 

If your looking for a good burger place, I would recommend this place. I would definitely come here again!
