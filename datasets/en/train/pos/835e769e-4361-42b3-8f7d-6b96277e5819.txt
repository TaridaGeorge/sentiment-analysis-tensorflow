16 reviews and I am first to mention Papago Golf course.  This truly an AZ gem at least for those of us who play.  There is no better place in Arizona for an early morning or late afternoon round of golf particularly if you are walking.  You are accompanied by quail and bunnies on every hole and the path you take while playing the course  provides for many different perspectives of the light on the the buttes.

It is also a very interesting and fun place to play golf.  A mature and challenging course that follows  the contours of the land meaning all putts break towards the Salt River.  The absence of  houses gives the course a much more open feeling than many others, however the mature trees,  desert areas, and mounded greens make you pay for shots missing the target.

One of my favorite afternoon diversions.
