Fresh and Easy... They have great prices, and they have GREAT veggies!  If you are looking for a tasty, tasty salad, then come here.  Their ingredients look like they just came from the field.  Fresh, crisp lettuce.  Water-dripping tomatoes... And don't even get me started on the cucumbers!  

All in all, I went here for a salad, so for that, the review may be a little skewed... But in terms of my experience, I give this place two thumbs up!!!
