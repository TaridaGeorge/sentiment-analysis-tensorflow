This spa is the most beautiful and friendly that I've ever been to.  My sister and I were in town from Boston and our appointment was scheduled for the wrong day. However, the manager made sure we were still able to be serviced and the treatments were on the house. He made our experience so wonderful. We will definitely be coming back for Mother's Day again next year and will be sure to stop at Aji Spa. AMAZING!
