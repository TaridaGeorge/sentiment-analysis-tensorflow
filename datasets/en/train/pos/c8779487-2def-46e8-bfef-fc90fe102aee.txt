Crap, how could this place NOT get 5 stars. The fact that it is a PB & J restaurant is enough for 4 stars. PB Loco is original and delish. To be honest I stay away from the weird crap like the curry PB and sun dried tomato crap. You get to choose your bread and combo of different peanut butters, I like the white chocolate peanut butter, raspberry jam and marshmallow cream. They are grilled on a panini maker and are served with animal crackers. This place is a genius concept and everyone should try.
