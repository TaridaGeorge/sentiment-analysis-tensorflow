I can't say enough wonderful things about the food quality at this restaurant for the price!  I've had dinner there three times  this week and the filet is simply amazing.  I had my first sample of Cholla Steakhouse 12 years ago and although I don't gamble, I will keep coming back again and again for the filet.  I think I know what dinner is going to be tonight :)
