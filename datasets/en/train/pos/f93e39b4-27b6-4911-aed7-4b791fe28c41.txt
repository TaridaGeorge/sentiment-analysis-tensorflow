Phenomenal sushi!  We had another incredible dinner last night.  The quality is simply the best in Phoenix.  
This is not a chic, trendy scene like some of the clubs pretending to be sushi bars.
This is a simple, quiet, nice, comfortable, little spot with excellent sushi as well as other traditional Japanese food.  It's as fresh as it gets and Yuki and EJ are truly talented at creating the most delicious sushi offerings you could ever hope to eat.  I highly recommend that you give it a try.
