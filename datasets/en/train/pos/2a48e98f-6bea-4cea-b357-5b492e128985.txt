This place never ceases to amaze me with their delicious food. Yes it sucks they are closed on Sundays, however I make sure to get in there some other day for sure. I've loved everything I've had, lemon chicken, orange chicken, mongolian beef, beef and broccoli, sweet and sour chicken, teriyaki chicken, egg rolls, crab puffs, fried rice, and chicken lo mein. Can't go wrong in this place, at least not that I've experienced. It is very small and dated, but the food will impress. The prices are also cheap for the amount of food and quality of everything on the plate. Lemon chicken is my favorite thing, the sauce is a light sweet coating on the well fried chicken.
