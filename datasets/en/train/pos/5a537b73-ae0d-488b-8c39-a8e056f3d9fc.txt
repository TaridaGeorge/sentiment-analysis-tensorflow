Excellent Asian traditional and fusion cuisine.  We have eaten at this Tottie's many times this first year of its opening.  We've been to Thailand and this is the best Thai food in America.  Also like the Vietnamese Bun Tom salad on the menu.  Love their fresh spring roll with tempura shrimp (a fusion item).  Our only problem is we live in Santa Fe and can only eat at Tottie's when we visit AZ.  Beautiful, sophisticated atmosphere with a nice bar and friendly, great service.  The Best!!!!!
