The peppered steak pasty is amazing and the peppercorn brandy sauce is so addictive. Also the carne adovada pasty is great.
They have too many pasties to choose from which is just another reason to keep coming back. 
For dessert, get the banoffee pie but save room because it is huge ( big enough for two people or more). 
Also, if you like beer they have a lot of it and you can get steins if quantity is your thing.
