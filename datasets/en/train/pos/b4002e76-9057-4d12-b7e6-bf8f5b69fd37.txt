We just heard about Ted's from a friend, I'm really glad that we did. When we walked in, there was a pretty long line, which to me meant that we were in for a treat. I had the Bratwurst Dog, my wife had the all beef. We are both used to Chicago Style Dogs, these are very different. The way they are cooked on the grill, the way they are poked at by the cook, I really enjoyed it. 

Try the onion rings, we liked those as well. 

It has a very unique vibe, we will be back.
