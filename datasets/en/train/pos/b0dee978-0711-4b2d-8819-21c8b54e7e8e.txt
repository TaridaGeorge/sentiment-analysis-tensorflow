The setting could not be more perfect - an sweet outdoor patio with a glimpse inside of a small rustic interior, the entire operation carefully orchestrated by the chef/owner Christopher. We had a delightful brunch, felt we could be in Provence, and ate the most wonderful and interesting food. It was a sort of quiche but lighter and taller, filled with sausage and topped with a delicate sprinkling of cheese. A beautiful green salsa sauce well placed to the side and some divine-ish asparagus, artichokes and mushrooms to the other side, made the symphony of flavors complete. Our second visit to Cafe Monarch was just as wonderful as visit #1 for a Saturday lunch.  Now, we are delightfully planning our first evening visit to enjoy the 3-course dinner and showcase this gem to our visitors from CT in late April.
