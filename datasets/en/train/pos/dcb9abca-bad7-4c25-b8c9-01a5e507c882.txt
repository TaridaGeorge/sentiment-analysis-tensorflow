We ate here for the first time tonite. Great food and EXCEPTIONAL service. JR was our waiter and we will definitely ask for him next time We ordered the Sat. special which was prime rib, blue cheese mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach a salad and dessert for $19.95. Everyone said their Happy Hour is great so we'll be going back for that next week. Can't wait to try other menu items.
