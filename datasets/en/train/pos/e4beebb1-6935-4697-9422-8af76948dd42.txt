Located at Sanctuary Camelback Mountain Resort & Spa, this is a beautiful place. There are some great views and a nice patio and large windows to enjoy them. I went here with my family for Thanksgiving, the meal was excellent. I had a Kobe beef carpaccio appetizer/salad with truffles, it was very good. The dinner I choose was the traditional Thanksgiving dinner, turkey, gravy, stuffing, mashed potatoes. And for dessert I choose the pumpkin cheesecake. Everything was very good. We had some cocktails at the bar before and after dinner, the bar was cool with a wide range of people of every age. Very cool.
