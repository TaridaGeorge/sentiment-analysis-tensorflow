YUMMM YUMMM and yummm.... My boyfriend decided to take me to dinner and he was craving Wildfish.  I had yet to try it so we figured what the heck.  

To start off we ordered the crap cake and a spicy tuna roll.  I'm telling you now I'd go back just for the appetizers - delish!  For our entrees we decided on the Sea Bass in a lemon cream sauce, a 10 ounce filet, the heirloom tomato salad, and crab rice to share.  I'm not one for red meat but the filet was by far one of the best I've ever had.  For dessert we had the pineapple upside down cake (they pour a shot of 151 on the top and light it on fire) - I mean redic.  Our servers were wonderful and very attentive.  All and all I didn't have one complaint.
