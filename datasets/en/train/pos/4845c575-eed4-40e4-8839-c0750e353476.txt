This is one of my favorites places to chow down in Arizona. It's an oasis of refreshing Italian food with hearty portions that won't break the bank - although they may break your belt! Most everything on the menu is extremely palatable from the salads to the sandwiches...but they do some mean pasta and pizzas. I'm a huge fan of the Big Rig pasta. And of course, they are known for their melt in your mouth dessert, the pizza cookie (aka pizzookie). Save room for this bad boy, because no Oregano's meal is complete without it.

The ambiance is really casual but fun, and the staff is really friendly. My fav location is the one in Tempe. It really is a place with "Menu can trust."
