So this place has only been open for a short while. I must say that I was thoroughly impressed. The vallue of this place is off the charts! I mean where else can you get any style eggs, bacon, your choice of toast, fresh fruit, and country potatoes for $5... exactly. The people who work here are super kind and very laid back. Now, do not get me wrong, they do not slack off in the service department... very attentive. I never once had to ask for a refill on my water or coffee. I will definately be back...again and again and again :)
