Hands down my new favorite place in Scottsdale!  Every thing about this place is perfect.  The atmosphere is romantic and relaxing, the service is friendly and helpful and the food is fresh, flavorful and downright incredible!  There were four choices today for lunch and I honestly don't think you could have gone wrong with any of them - all for the low price of $13.50 each.  

I selected the arugula, prosciutto, tomatoes, cheese, and pesto plate...AMAZING!  

Note that they are only open for lunch & dinner Thursday through Saturday and brunch Sunday...and they close for the summer.  Also, it is cash only, but trust me, it is so worth it!

The chef stopped and talked to us as we were leaving...so nice and appreciative of our business.  Definitely a first class place!
