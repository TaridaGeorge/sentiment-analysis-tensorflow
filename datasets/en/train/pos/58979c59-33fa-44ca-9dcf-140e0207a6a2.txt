We stopped here on a Thursday night on a raving referral and they we not exaggerating - this place is fantastic!
We are always a little hesitant to try a new place when an omnivore suggests it, but as vegetarians, we found Sekong by Night so accommodating! They offered to convert nearly any dish on their menu into a vegan alternative, and it was delicious. The spring rolls are really big, and they swapped their fish dipping sauce for a vegan version. We had the Phnom Penh Noodle Soup with tofu & veggie broth (just like the Vietnamese pho!) and the Katheaw Cha rice noodles with tofu instead of beef - AMAZING. 
Service was top notch, and as many other reviewers noted their prices are unbelievably low for the quantity and quality of food that you get.
Looking forward to our next visit and trying more fantastic dishes!
