Sapporo is my favorite place to take my parents in Phoenix!  

Visiting my parents in Phoenix is kind of like reverting to my lazy, angst ridden 12 year old self.  Usually by the time we go to Sapporo we are thoroughly sick of one another and need something to distract us.  I personally think the Japanese invented the Teppanyaki tables for this very situation.  You're hungry and you want to go out to dinner but not with your own family.  You want to meet new people, eat yummy food, be entertained and fit in some quality people watching.   Sapporo is the place to go.  The clientele is mostly upscale, the food is good, the chefs are showmen and the center bar is captivating to observe.
