What a lovely way to spend the first Saturday of the decade...sitting sipping succulent saucers of sugary non-soda sustanance while staring silently at the sills saturated in satin stained suggestions. Still stalking the scenario, suddenly it seems our shouting shook a local without solicitation to solve our sight-seeing saga!  Sensational. 

And the coffee and company are good too.
