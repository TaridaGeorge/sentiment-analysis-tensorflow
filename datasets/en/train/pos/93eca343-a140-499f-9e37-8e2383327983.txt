Check out the "Tongue" couch and stand on the glass floor look down the abandoned elevator shaft, trippy to say the least. 

Great addition to downtown.  Sleek and contemporary interior.  Soon  they may have a club downstairs according to our server.  Upstairs is a neat, albeit slightly odd space.  They have a DJ in a small room over the main entrance, look for him.

TRY THE BAR PLATE!!!  It's about $7 and you get fresh shaved Parmesan and prosciutto, melon and bread.   It's so F'ing good.

They have Pimm's, but I don't know to much about it but it tasted OK to me.

---IMPORTANT: the "pizzas" are not normal, they are super thin, I mean like 1/2 of a tortilla thin.  Tasty, but not a filling as a normal thin crust pizza.

Darn snazzy place.
