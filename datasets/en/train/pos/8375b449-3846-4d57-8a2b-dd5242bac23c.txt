Mmmmmm, Mmmmm, Mmmmm...Never Fails...

This place is UNBELIEVABLE for breakfast and Lunch (i have heard great things about dinner as well although i have yet to enjoy it).  
i have only been for lunch twice, but both times were fantastic.  The first time i had the Burger (wonderful) and the second time i believe it was the Halibut (could have been Seabass) and was equally as delicious (i have posted a photo).

What i really want to talk about is their Breakfast though...OMG-favorite spot in town.  I am a huge eggs benny fan and they have this Mediterranean version that is out of this world.  It's on Focaccia bread with prosciutto and this red bell pepper hollandaise sauce...SO GOOD (i have also included a photo of this dish).  Also, try their green eggs and ham.  :)

Hope you all enjoy this place as much as i do!!  Bon Appetit!
