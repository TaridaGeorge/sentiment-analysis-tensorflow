I can't believe this place would even get any bad reviews! AWESOME SERVICE- AWESOME ATMOSPHERE AND AWESOME FOOD. The service was outstanding! I went here for my birthday and i had an outdoor dinner. As soon as we walked into Fire N Sky resort we were greeted and our picture was taken by the lobby.
The restaurant itself is beautiful and the price is affordable. Our server entertained us the entire night and even the manager came to say hi. I felt like royalty here and highly recommend this place for a casual or formal dinner- especially romantic for couples. Hint: the cheesecake with the berries is the best!
