This place is utterly delicious and a great hidden gem of Phoenix. I first had it after they catered an event I went to and I haven't looked back. The chorizo taco and the green chile tacos are my favorites, but the navajo taco is also a top contender, simple but delicious. And you can't go wrong with the wait time. It's quick to get in and get out and the food is always fresh.
