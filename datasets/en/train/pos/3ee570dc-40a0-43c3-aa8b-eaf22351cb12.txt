I love going to the Suns games. The suns are one the the NBA's most exciting teams year in and year out and the games are generally sold out so you are sure to some rocking and rolling in the arena. 

The Suns also have had some of the best NBA players grace the hardwood floors from Steve Nash, to Connie Hawkins the list is almost endless. 

If you have time to make it to a game you will not be let down. Oh yeah the Suns are also one of the winning'est franchises in the game so you will probably see a W.
