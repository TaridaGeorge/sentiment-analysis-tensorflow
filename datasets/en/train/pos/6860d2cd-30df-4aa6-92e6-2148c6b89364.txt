I do miss the Desert Ridge location, and its large patio - but I always did think the Old Town Scottsdale location had more ambiance. We just don't get here as often. It is a relaxed, roomy atmosphere. This is one of the first places my husband brought me while we were dating and I still love everything about it.....just wish they had a really nice (larger) patio. Everything I have tried on the menu is outstanding - including appetizers and drinks. The Pad Thai is the best I have every had.....and my favorite previously is at a family -owned place in San Fran. The Basil Chicken is to die for, and I could eat the Crispy Pla for breakfast.....never have I felt this way about fish. I am definitely a fan. Never once have I had slow or unfriendly service and every meal has been perfect.
