Michael (bartender) was fantastic; very helpful with food recommendations, very attentive and informative.  The food was delicious.  We had kobe beef sliders, cesar salad, bolognese pasta, and sea bass.  Everything was very good0, although as much as the bolognese was recommended, we might try something else next time.  We had the amaretto mousse for dessert - YUM.  The wine list has great selections, and we had a great time!  We'll be back.
