What an adorable place!?!  Cibo is most definitely an oh-so-hip hidden pizzeria gem tucked away a little off the beaten path from central downtown Phoenix.  [This could very easily be a pizza joint found in any neighborhood in San Francisco.]  Picture this: soft, low lighting, faint, hip music playing overhead, ecclectic flair for decorations, friendly staff, amazing aromas wafting from the kitchen -- my heart was all a flutter from the moment I walked in.

I came here based off of a recommendation of one of my best friends and absolutely loved the Quattro Formaggi pizza; the gorgonzola cheese gave the pie a full-bodied flavor.  Trust me, it's a must for all you cheese-lovers out there like me.  ;-)

I would most definitely come back here on my next trip to Phoenix!
