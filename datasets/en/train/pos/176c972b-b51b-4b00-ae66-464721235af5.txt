I wish this eatery was much closer because it is so gooood! It really does make Paradise Bakery look like an amateur! Well balanced and creative breakfast dishes make me get up and drive way too far for my ever pain in the ass stomach!

Lunch is good too, although I cant remember what I had. Oh, yes it was asparagus soup! The bread is amazing dunked into any of their homemade concoctions. Makes me all warm and fuzzy inside! 

Great spot for a business lunch apparently. The last time I was there, it was full of patrons pouring over their paper documents and laptops keys ticking away. I felt a little left out, but Kaleb and I had our own business to attend to.........filling the belly!
