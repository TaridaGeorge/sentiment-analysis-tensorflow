Went for a convention and had dinner in the restaurant. So this is my limited review!

Did a lot of walking to get from place to place.

Convention facilities were above average.

Food in the restaurant was excellent.

Service left much to be desired, seemed we were in the way and a bother!

I love the Biltmore grounds and landscaping was soothing and enjoyed walking the areas!
