Thai Elephant is our hands down favorite Thai food in the valley. Our absolute favorite is their panang curry, the richest creamiest version we've found, full of moist tender chicken and spiced to perfection however you like it. As others have commented, the food presentation is Outstanding.

I regularly drive out from southeast Chandler 20 mins each way for takeout when the family wants Thai, passing probably 15-20 places along the way. The food is simply that good and the portions are monstrous.

Great stuff.
