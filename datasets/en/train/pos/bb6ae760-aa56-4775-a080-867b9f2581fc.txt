My wife and I were in the neighborhood as we had taken our daughter to check out PHX zoo. We heard about this place from diners, drive in and dives and had to check it out. 
we were starving and had a wait for a full two hours prior to being seated! :( This place is a hole in the wall!! However, the breakfast was worth the wait! My wife had the bacon and waffle and enjoyed it so much that she ordered another order of the waffle. I had the special which was to die for, scrambled eggs with turkey sausage, peppers and cheese. 
will definitely come back if we are nearby!!
