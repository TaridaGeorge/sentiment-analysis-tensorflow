I, so LOVE Pizza A Metro. It's kind of a misnomer because their's is a complete Italian menu. The pastas are wonderful, the wine is good, and the service is friendly. This is a very classy place in a very dodgey location. But, don't be fooled by the neighborhood. Pizza a Metro is the best place in the city for Italian food!
