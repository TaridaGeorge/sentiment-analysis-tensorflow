Some say it's not really a lake, well I don't think of the sandy areas of Michigan Lake as beaches in Chicago either, but at least it's a place where there's water in the Phoenix Metropolitan area.  I love rollerblading in the mornings around the lake and taking strolls in the evening especially in the fall.  One can even kayak or sail on the lake too. The light rail is close by therefore, if you are coming for Downtown Phoenix, you can hop on the train and travel to the lake and surrounding areas.  It's very clean and there's lots of festivals and events that happen here year round.  Definitely a place to visit if it's your first time in Phoenix.
