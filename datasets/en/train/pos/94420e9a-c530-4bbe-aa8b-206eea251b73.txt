We don't live in Arizona, so having our relatives take us here was aaawesome!  The place was great.  So great that we went back like two more times during our stay in Arizona.  LoL  One of the first things we did was google to see if there were locations in San Diego...we found one in El Cajon.  We have not been to that one yet, but it is in the plans at some point.  The food was fresh, portions were great, and was not overly pricey by any means.  Reminded us of a Panera....which come to find out it is a sister company of sorts.  Great food here.
