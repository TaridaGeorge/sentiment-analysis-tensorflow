I cant believe we've been to The Keg (this location actually) at least 3 times, and I've never reviewed it!  

We took our friend Ben to dinner here this past Friday night, as a thank you for all he's done for us in preparation of the birth of our son.  7pm on a Friday night and we were seated immediately.  The irony of our table location was, our server was also pregnant!!  LOL  

Great service.  Great food.  Can't wait to go back again!
