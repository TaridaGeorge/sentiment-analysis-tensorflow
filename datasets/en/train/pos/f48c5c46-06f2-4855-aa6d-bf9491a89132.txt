Love this place! Have recommended this place to tons of people. I love the fresh salads, and the apple pancakes. The owner Susan is a delight and always has a smile on her face and a warm welcome. Staff is friendly and professional. It's nice to take family from out of state to something other than a strip-mall. I would recommend to anyone looking for a small intimate setting for a breakfast or brunch.
