We love this place. Great for the young boy to find friends and run around before, during and after our food.

The kids choices are not as great as I would want. Full size grown up food is always amazing.

The grilled bbq pizza is good but it is hit or miss on how burnt the bottom is. :(

The farm is a treat. We spend more time on dinner when we are here. Life slows down for us a little.

Get a malted vinilla shake. Sooooo worth it.

Garlic fries/green beans are overloaded with garlicky goodness. Can you tell I am hungry as I type this? 

A bit pricy to eat often for us. But we are never disappointed.
