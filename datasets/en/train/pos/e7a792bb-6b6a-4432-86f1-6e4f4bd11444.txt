We went for breakfast last weekend and thoroughly enjoyed it. The owner, Jackie I think, came out and greeted us and explained a little about the restaurant and food. Very personal service. I was so impressed. The food was excellent. The baked pancakes with blueberry were very tasty and worth trying. The stuffed french toast was top notch also. The restaurant is one of those tiny little local places I love to go to. Prices are very reasonable also. I will definitely be back.
