Mike sold me on Pre-Paid Legal! Within 4 months of signing up I ended up using this service. When a client told me my business had breached the terms of their contract I needed to verify the validity of their claim. It was an easy process and the attorney returned my call the same day I placed the call. I had to fax the contract for the attorney to review.  She called me back within 3 days to let me know I had not breached an terms of the contract and that in fact the client had since they had refused to make their payment. 
Thank you Mike for helping me see the value of having Pre-Paid Legal!
