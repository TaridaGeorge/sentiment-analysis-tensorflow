My wife and I were invited to a wine tasting here last night.  It is a fun little place with a large selection of wines at good prices.  They have a decent selection of beers and high-end wines as well.  The staff is super friendly and helpful.  The awesome part was that you can order food from Atlas and eat it in the bar area.  Atlas has perfect food for wine tasting so it was a perfect fit.  I will return.
