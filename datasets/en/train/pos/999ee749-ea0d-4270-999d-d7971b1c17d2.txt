This was quite a delight to find. Initially heard about it from Phoenix Mag and searched it out with a customer that has the patience for my foodie needs.
The atmosphere outside was awesome! Lots of shade on the spacious patio.  The service was great and the food was awesome!

We had a salad and a one of their amazing sandwiches.  My chicken salad was plentiful with toasted walnuts and great greens.  I loved the salad dressing and just the right amount of cheese.

Make sure you search this one out for lunch or happy hour and dinner.
