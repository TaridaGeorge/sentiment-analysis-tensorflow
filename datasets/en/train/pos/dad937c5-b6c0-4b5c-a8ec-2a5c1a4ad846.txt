This yoga studio was awesome! I'm a student and recent Grad. I loved their schedule of class they have classes at all times and a ton of different kinds! Every instructor I took a class with were AMAZING! The owners were by far the most kindest people ever! I appreciated my time at Sutra and if I'm in Phoenix again, will stop by for a class. Most amazing yoga studio ever.
