I just finished up a two week "Sexy Slimdown" bootcamp and it was great! Don't get me wrong, I'm not a huge fan of waking up before the sun but I've already noticed results, even in such a short time. I'm signed up for another camp and excited to see the difference it makes! I didn't really have a lot to lose. My goal was to tone up. After two weeks, I feel more solid and can see muscle definition. I also have more energy. Tammy makes it a lot of fun and pushes the group by motivating and staying positive. I definitely recommend it if you need something that will push you to get where you want to be. I wasn't getting the results I wanted on my own and this has been the jump start I needed to get fit and healthy! :)
