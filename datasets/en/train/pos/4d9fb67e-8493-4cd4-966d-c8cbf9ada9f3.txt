How do I love this place, 10 years ago I stopped by one in 
Albuquerque,NM- I went nuts, there was nothing like it in AZ. I went out and bought a smoker just so I could have something like it, came really close too. But really who has 16 hours to smoke brisket, yeah me either. And now it has arrived:
So here's the low down, the brisket is Awesome, hands down awesome! Pulled pork and green chili stew are great! Chicken & links are really good too but I don't  go for the ribs, not my favorite!  All in all great smokehouse!
