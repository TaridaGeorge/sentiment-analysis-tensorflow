I've had so many massages at so many places, it's been hard to find a massage therapist that really stands out in my mind, that is until I had my first massage with John. Professional, knowledgeable, and a true master at his craft, John manages to fix what ails me without making me cringe in pain. I am a hairstylist, and my neck, shoulders and hands suffer, in fact, I was close to seeing an orthopedic surgeon for my hands, but since my most recent massage with John, I have literally NO aching. He is absolutely a MUST, you will walk out feeling like a new person!!!!! Do it. Hurry. Off you go. Get yourself to Space and let John get you back in line!
