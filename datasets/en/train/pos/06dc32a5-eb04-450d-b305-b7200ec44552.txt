i have always enjoyed pita jungle.  i love that the product is about as consistent as it gets in all of the locations i've been to.  However their portions have always been too big for me to take little-man unless we share something and honestly, i don't feel like shelling out $8 for him to have his own entree unless i decide it's leftover-worthy.   but now they have a kids menu and it's FANTASTIC!  it has become one of his favorite spots.  the only downside is that if you go when they are really busy it can be a bit loud and hard to hear, but i'm here for the food.
