Hokay! When this place first opened, even getting a plain coffee was painful. Today I can say that these people finally have figured out how to successfully run a Dunkin Donuts and handle the morning rush.

Even though I only get a large coffee with cream and two splendas (pretty hard to mess up), I sincerely appreciate the girls who run the drive-thru because I haven't had to wait in line for more than 2 minutes on any occasion this week (I drive by at 8:15 ish).

Easy access off of the 101 is a plus too but the parking situation because of the drive-thru line is not happening. If you decide to go inside, park  closer to the Urgent Care.
