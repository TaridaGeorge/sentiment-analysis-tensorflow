This has been the best place we have ever gone for dog training.  What a diverse group of trainers.  You can be a novice with a new puppy, or need expert training in advanced agility...and anything in between.  We love our classes with Debby and Marilee.  We are currently training our puppy Lizzie Lou to become a therapy dog, one class at a time she is getting closer to her goal.
