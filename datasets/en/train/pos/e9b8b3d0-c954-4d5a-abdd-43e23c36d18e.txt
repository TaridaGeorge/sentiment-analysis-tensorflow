Fantastic Eastern European Bakery and Products!

Came shopping here for pastries and discovered they have a whole lot more.  Not only do they have freshly baked cookies, cakes and pastries, they also had hand made Pierogis, sausages and kielbasa!  Hard to find Cech candies and products were everywhere, for a moment, it felt like shopping in Brno or Lodz.  The women  who work there are very kind and helpful.  Enjoy!
