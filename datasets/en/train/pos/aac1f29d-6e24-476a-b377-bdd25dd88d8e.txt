We found these guys online and they offered to come out and give us a free, no-obligation estimate.  Their technician, Michael, was definitely on-time, took a quick look at the door, immediately knew what the problem was, and told me he could fix it in 15 minutes fr WAY less than I had planned for.  
This company is GREAT.  The door was fixed, as promised in less than 15 minutes after he arrived, it works better than it did when it was new...I can literally open it with one finger, it slides so easily, and it was EASY to get done.
I couldn't be happier-and recommend them HIGHLY if you have sliding glass door, screen or sunscreen issues.  Obviously, honest, reliable, clean, quick, timely, and the price was more than fair.
