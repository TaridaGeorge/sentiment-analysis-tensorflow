It's very simple...if you have a Volkswagen and you want it fixed right and you don't want to get gouged, your choices are extremely limited in Phoenix.  Fortunately we have Exklusiv Motorsports.  It's worth the drive from anywhere in the Valley to have Derek take care of your VW.  It's almost mandatory to go here if you have a TDI...all of the dealers in town combined don't have Derek's skill at working on the VW diesels.
