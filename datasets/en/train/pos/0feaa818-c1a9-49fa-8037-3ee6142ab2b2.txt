So, like, this was freakin' fantastic. We came here for a friend's birthday on a weeknight, and I don't know if it was because it was slower or the server was just this good, but he gave some of the best service I've ever had.  The food was so.delicious.  We had appetizers, a main course and the adorable little dessert shooters that are absolutely perfect for the person who doesn't want a full dessert, but still wants a little somethin' somethin'.  Love, love, love.
