I bought a Google Offer for this place, and I'm so glad I did- The classes are SO fun... Even Zumba. Which makes me twitch. I am the opposite of rhythmically skilled. But the classes here are fun, easy, and a great work out too! 

I tried 1 of the cycling classes.... Request the 'naughty' playlist. Cycling to Luda and Peaches never felt so good ;)
