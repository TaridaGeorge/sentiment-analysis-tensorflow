I called Dave because my garbage disposal was not working at all. I was willing to pay to have him come out but he suggested I get a larger Alan Wrench and place it through the middle hole on the bottom of the machine. I gave it a quick turn, dislodged whatever was stuck and DONE. No cost but if I do need a handy man, I will call him again. Thank!
