Love this place. It is really large for sprouts,bigger than some of the others i have been to.  Lots of parking in the open Parking lot.                                                                 A really good location RIght on Indian School Road and 28th St.  Vitamens, herbals, lots of natural products. Great meat and fish dept. Lots of fresh fruit  and veg. Very simalar to Sunflower or Whole foods, and the price is right in the middle. Another good thing. .5cents off your bill for each bag you bring in. Yeah!
