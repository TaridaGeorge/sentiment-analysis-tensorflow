Love the creativity here. Great happy hour menu, and as well great menu all around. Great atmosphere, clean, modern. The staff was very accommodating to my father in a wheelchair as well. Food was A+, absolutely no complaints and I had a few different dishes on the menu. Even gluten-free pasta marinara was very good and flavorful.
