This is the hole-in-the-wall Mexican against which I judge all others.  This is a frequent lunch spot for me, for $.99 street tacos, gorditas, burritos and the occasional torta (not as good as Tortas El Guero, but good).  Mmm...mole.  Theirs is excellent (chicken, shredded beef, and cheese are the choices for enchiladas).  Forget the tostada, order a sope, with the thick masa "tortilla", topped with chicken or pork al pastor.  If you get a street taco, I highly recommend the beef cabeza - it melts in your mouth like short ribs.  

And it's dirt cheap.  We had dinner there tonight, ordered a Pacifico, shredded beef mole enchiladas, a sope, three street tacos and some chips and salsa to go and were $18 lighter (before tip).  

No fancy tequilas or margaritas, just great food.
