Amazing beer selection.  They have huge coolers with over 450 bottles of  beer that you can peruse and select to have your server open for you (or buy bottles to go!).  Would love written descriptions of the beers, especially the tap beers.

Very generous with tap samples too.  Real darts is a nice touch.  Nothing fancy inside, but comfortable.  This place is all about the beer.
