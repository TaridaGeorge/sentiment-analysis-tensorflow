There is a lot of competition in Phoenix for wood fired pizza. Out of your options of Bianco/Grimaldi's/La Grande Orange/CPK, the pizza in itself here ranks in the middle. Given how busy the other places get, if you are located in the area, I highly recommend this little place. 

They have wine and some bottled beer, the salads are quality and fresh, but I wouldn't go there just for a salad. For the pizza selection you have fairly standard gourmet options, ingredients are top notch, and the crust is made fresh daily. The pizza is mouth watering when you see it and is equally satisfying when the warm crust hits your mouth.

This place opened up recently and I see myself there quite a bit.
