Went to the Footlocker in the Chandler Mall today and recieved great customer service from Rob, very personable guy who stated he worked in shoes for 18 years, this guy wet over the top to help me find my shoes and not only that he re laced them so they werent too tight, sold me some great socks and did his job with suggestive selling me shoe cleaner (which I declined) Rob talked to my daughter and was just a good guy having fun at work which you dont see every day .....Good job Rob Thanks
