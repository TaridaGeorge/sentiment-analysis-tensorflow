By far my fav place! Al and Trudy offer exceptional customer service and product. I was never a huge meat eater but i must say when you have the best its hard to turn away.They always offer cooking tips and techniques, which are greatly appreciated! The stuffed peppers are a must when you visit! My husband and I try to get up here every few weeks, sometimes just because we enjoy the two owners so much!
