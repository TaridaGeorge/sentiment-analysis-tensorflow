Scary good.  Seriously.  The pizza was FANTASTIC! Really. Try the Pizza, please!  

As far as I can tell they have just one desert. Know what? That's A-OK because the Pizza Cookie crushes all others.  One desert to rule them all, really.  Try it.  It was amazing.

Portions were large and the service was great.  People like working here.

This is on my must-go-to-when-in-Phoenix list.
