When I used to work at Central and Thomas, this was my preferred lunch location. There would be many times I'd sneak out the back doors to avoid having Melanie pick her up something (which she did every time. Quit asking me where I'm going. I'm not your mule.)

I had the good fortune to be back at that branch and Lenny's was calling my name. They've expanded since my former days going there, but it was just as busy and the food remained awesome. The green chili burger is my standard order, and really brought back memories. Well, fond memories of their food, not of Melanie. :shudders:
