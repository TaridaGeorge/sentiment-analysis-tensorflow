Such a great experience this was. We shared some ahi tuna, vegas rolls, garlic snap peas, and had fried ice cream for dessert. 

The Sushi was made perfectly! 

One thing I would say about their green ice tea... DON'T GET IT!! It seriously tastes like someone took a diaper and rung it out in the tea. 

The Garlic snap peas are my new favorite thing. Fried ice cream was amazing, it has a touch of cinnamon, which made it that much better!! I 'm craving more of it. 

RA Sushi.... I will be back for more!
