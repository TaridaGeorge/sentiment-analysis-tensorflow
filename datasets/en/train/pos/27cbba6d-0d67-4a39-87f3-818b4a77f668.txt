I was referred to Coblentz by a friend, and I am so thankful.  I really respect and trust Cornelius.  He arrived at the time scheduled and his rates were [are] very reasonable.  He has a great energy.  Not that you need that in an electrician...no pun intended...but when I was freaking out, he was calm and cool.  Oh, and he liked my dogs!
