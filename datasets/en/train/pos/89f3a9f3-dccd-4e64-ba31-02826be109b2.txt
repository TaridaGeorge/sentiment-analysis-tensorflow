Wow!! What a great place! Sushi in the desert is a touchy thing, what with the cactus spines and dirt, but Sakana kicks ass!!  The fish is some of the freshest I have had anywhere, in any state. The portions are larger than I would have expected for the price AND happy hour is an even better deal. For every beer you order, you get a very discounted appetizer. The chefs are very friendly and enjoy giving advice. I cannot eat shrimp or lobster or crayfish and the chefs were more than happy to substitute fish that complemented the roll. 

Actually, all these good reviews will make Sakana busier......  So, Sakana sucks!!!!!!  Don't go!!   ;)
