Love this place.  $4.00 for love.  You can't beat that.  They will freshly brulee the top of the creme brulee of your choice.  The flavors will change but love and attention that goes into each little cup will not.  My favorite is still simple vanilla or lavender, but I just had a sea salt caramal that made up for a crazy day of nutty clients.  Usually it would cost me many many more dollars in over priced cocktails to have that affect.  Bonus, is that no one looks at you judgmentally if you eat creme brulee before noon. Add them to your facebook or twitter.  It really is worth stalking.
