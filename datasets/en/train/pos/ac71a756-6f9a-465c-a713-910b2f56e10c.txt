I never went to the resort, I went to the spa and it was EVERYTHING I though a resort spa could be. When you walk in, you're walking into a hotel, but the second you walk into the spa waiting room, the WHOLE atmosphere changes. You're suddenly on cloud 9! They have the whole steam room and many jaquzzi's, a beautiful pool looking out onto the rez, and almost pool side service, a waitor came up to myself and my party and had gently asked us if we needed anything. 
He didn't dissapear either when we said no, i mean he was easy to find later. GREAT FACIAL, GREAT MASSAGE

Worth every penny!
