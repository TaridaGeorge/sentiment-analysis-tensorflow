Einstein's is one of my all time favorite places.  I adore bagels, and there is nothing better in the world than a BLT on an everything bagel.  And they can do it right.  I'm sure there are quainter, less corporate mom and pop bagel places out there, but for my money, I like knowing what I'm getting, and knowing that it's gonna be good every time  I go in.
