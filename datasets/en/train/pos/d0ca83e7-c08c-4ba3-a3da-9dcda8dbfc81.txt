Forever 21 is the absolute best place to find affordable, trendy clothes and jewelry/accessories. While their products are not of the best quality, they have the largest selection and the clothes are extremely low priced! It's a great place to go if you are just looking to buy a few things to spruce up your wardrobe without empyting your bank account. And their jewelry is amazing - they have the funnest items for mostly $10 and under. I love love love this store.
