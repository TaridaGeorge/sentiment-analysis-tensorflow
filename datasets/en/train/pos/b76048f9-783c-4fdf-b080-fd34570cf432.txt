This speakeasy was kickass. The staff is super down to earth and the menu is great. The drive thru is an awesome touch. I got the Turkey Club and it was reallllllly good. We received 2 randomly free samples of a shake and smoothie and had some good conversation with the guys behind the counter. It gets a little noisy if they're makin shakes in there, and the seating is pretty limited. I wish they were open later but so far I'm loving it!
