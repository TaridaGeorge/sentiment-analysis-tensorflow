Don't come here if you are broke or cheap....cause these burgers aren't either.  However, the Kobe beef burger maybe the BEST burger I have ever had my entire life and I am not exaggerating.  Our server recommended it because the meat is tender and buttery and whole cow (pun intended) was it fricken awesome.  Its modern casual atmosphere with great service and excellent french fry options and shakes and super good strawberry lemonade.  Parking blows at the Biltmore so park in the garage in back so you have shade and it cost you nothing.
