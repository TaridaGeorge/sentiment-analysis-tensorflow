All I need to say is PLEASE PUT A BOOKMAN'S IN CALIFORNIA!!!

My parents moved to AZ a few years ago and I have been obsessed with this place since. There is nothing like it in CA and a trip to my parents isn't complete without stopping by Bookmans!

I can always find books, magazines or dvd's that interest me...and you can't beat the prices!
