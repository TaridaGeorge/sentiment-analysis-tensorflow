THis location for Costco is my favorite by FAR.  It live in S. Scottsdale and there are two that are closer to me, but I really like this one because it is right off the freeway, the parking lot belongs to Costco, so no dealing with all of the other people trying to go to the 20 other stores in the area and I feel like this Costco has more products that the Costco that I use to frequent (Thomas and 40th st.).  I recently bought a cake and sandwich platter for my daughters b-day party and the cake was excellent! The sandwiched were good too! THey really give you a lot go the money.  They also have AMAZING prices on fillet minion's, a pack of 4 for $27!  I think that's pretty great... Anyway, go here, it's great!
