Silva is the best thing that has happened to nails!  She is so meticulous and takes her time with every inch of you nails leaving you with perfectly manicured nails and feet.  If you're looking for a half finished, 15 minute job, don't go to Silva.  She's all about taking her time and leaving you nothing less than perfect results.  She is also on top of the latest fashion and trends and always carries wonderful products, such as the new Shelac which lasted me over 3 weeks without a chip!  I HIGHLY recommend Silva!!!
