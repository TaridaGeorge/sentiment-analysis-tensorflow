Hello-

I recently visited Phoenix and the guy at the front desk recommended this place for dinner.  I took the Metro and it was very close once exiting the train.

It was very busy but they sat me right away.  I had a Steak salad with a Sherry vinaigrette dressing that was awesome.

Atmosphere very nice with outside seating (way to hot out for my East coast blood) and the crowd is very mixed which is great.

I talked to one guy that worked there and had to laugh as they were from Squirrel Hill, a suburb of Pittsburgh.

Loved the whole experience!
