Really great store! Staff is always more than friendly and prices on most things are reasonable. 

Bakery is always yummy and fresh! Good selection on a lot of items and variety. 

Most recently, I got a birthday cake for my son's birthday party. 2 layer, custard filled, Thomas the Train theme with whipped cream frosting... $28! And it served 30 people. Everyone raved about it, it was so good!
