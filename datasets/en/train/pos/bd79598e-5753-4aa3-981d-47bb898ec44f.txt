Donovan's is as good as it gets, in my book. I have been 4 times for celebrations and they treat you with the best service! Friendly, yet top of the line wait staff. The food is original and basic at the same time! Jose is our waiter each year as we request him, and he is fantastic!
The free shuttle van comes to Tempe to get us at the hotel and waits until we are done to drop us back off!
