I would not use a shop like this to do major repairs, but for any simple flushes it is perfect. I went here on 12/7/11 and got a brake fluid flush for $29.99 after coupon. Best price anywhere. Rob was very nice and did not ever try to upsell me on anything. I was in an out in about 30 minutes. Great service. 

For real auto repairs I'd probably use a mechanic shop. There are some locally owned in the area which are reasonable priced.
