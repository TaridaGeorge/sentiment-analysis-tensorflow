this past Sunday night we finally got to try this place out after passing it for several years during our runs on the bike path. it was late Sunday night so i thought they might be closed, but luckily they have incredible hours (open til 10!).

i was a little disappointed with the selection as nothing really jumped out at me... that is, UNTIL my boyfriend asked for a few samples. everything we tried was delicious and i ended up going with the rum chocolate (i am so not a rum-flavored dessert person but it was probably one of the most tasty and original flavors i've ever tried). the Italian gentleman helping us was very helpful, friendly and welcoming. i look forward to making many more visits.
