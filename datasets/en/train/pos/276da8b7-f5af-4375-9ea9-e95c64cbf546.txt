A beautifully restored house with excellent drinks. The chai was to die for (loads of whipped cream on top so be sure to ask for something different if you don't like this.) The girl working the day we went was so friendly. 

The great news is that this place is affiliated (or run by, not sure which) a hospice care facility. So your visit benefits people who really need it.
