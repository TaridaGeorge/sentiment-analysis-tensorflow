I am a boba tea enthusiast! This is the BEST place that I have found in the Phoenix area. The prices are about average and the tea was not too sweet. The boba is the best! I think it is the one made from taro root. However...the Asian market a couple doors down was sub-par, do your best to avoid it if possible.
