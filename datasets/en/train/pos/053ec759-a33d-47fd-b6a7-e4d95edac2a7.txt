Coffee shop-perfection.  Friendly staff, great coffee, free wifi, great location (ten steps from a light rail stop), wonderful ambience, and delicious food.  They got everything right with this place; I laid out my criteria for what makes a great coffee shop in my review of Mills End Cafe, and Fair Trade achieves all of those standards, and more.
