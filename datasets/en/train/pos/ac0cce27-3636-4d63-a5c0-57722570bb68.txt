I have been going to them for over 6 years and I can't believe I never got around to yelping them.  Dr. Patummas and Dr. Ma are extremely nice and do great work.  I have never had a complaint after leaving.  These are dentists that actually care about their patients, when I go in they know me by name (is that a good or bad thing... lol)  Their new office is awesome! They have a xray machine thing that scans your whole head... its crazy... The staff is also very nice and professional.  I really can't say enough nice things about them... if you need work done I would suggest going to them and seeing for yourself.
