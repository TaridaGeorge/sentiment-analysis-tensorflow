This small, unassuming little gem is a wonderful surprise!  Palee's Crown was the best Thai food I've had in a long time.  We tried the shrimp pad thai, awesome.  The larb app, in addition to having a nice little heat to it, had a hint of mint - awesome surprise!  The coconut icecream was a nice way to end our meal.  Simple, fresh and home made!  Try to sticky rice and fried bananas, you won't be disappointed.

The owner and her son were so wonderful to chat with, just awesome people.

It doesn't get better than Palee's Crown. I will make the hour long drive to eat there again.  Give it a try!
