Absolutly the coolest art events.  Edgy, new, beautiful garden setting.  The best gallery for kids.  While at most galleries kids get bored and nag on mom to go home, at Alwun House there's plenty to entertain the kids. Koi ponds, doves, rabbits and all kinds of nook & crannies to play in.  


Yet, they really do show some of the most progressive topical art in the valley.
