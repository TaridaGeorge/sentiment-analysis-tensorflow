4th of July - BIG YES!  New Tradition!

Entrance fee $10 per person for full access to the grounds, including petting zoo which kept my kids happy for 30 minutes. Probably other stuff too but  I didn't check.

Casual atmosphere, fun for kids to run and play and be loud and nobody cares. They had a store set up for clearance items $1 - $5 keeps the Tourists happy!

Fireworks were 100% in the air this year so ANYWHERE was a good spot to view!  Reasonably priced beer ($3 domestic) and beverages.  Free parking. 

You can pay upscale prices at the sit-down restaurant or drop around 8 a plate at the other locations.  EIther way, support a good recreational site, don't be stingy, its expensive to keep up these places with staff and facilities.
