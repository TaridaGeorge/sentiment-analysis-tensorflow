so where do I begin? Well, nobody in their right mind would go grocery shopping here. That said....their coffee is great,!(Jason thank you for you hospitallity and great costumes) Where else can you get a thirstbuster sized cup of iced coffee for $1.50? Oh, and without the coffee house 'tude? (another plus in my book). Roast beef is the perfect temp. (indulge me, ask for a roast beef sandwich on sourdough, red onions, mayo, tomatoe, chedder cheese with horseraddish...it's a little piece of carnivore heaven!). Vegi pizza is great. and If your feeling rich and want a hunk of good cheese or some fancy olives this place is quik to oblige.  So happy to live near here!
