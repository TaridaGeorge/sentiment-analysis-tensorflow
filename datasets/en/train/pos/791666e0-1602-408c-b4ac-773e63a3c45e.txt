Immediately greeted with friendly staff when we arrived who are willing to provide us with great service within the resort and information on what to do within Scottsdale and the surrounding area. Pools are great- get crowded on the weekends, as you would expect but there is still enough area to lounge comfortably. Rooms are beautiful- they have their own terrace or patio area and are well maintained. There is also a shuttle service which is prompt and helpful to go out around the area. All of the drivers were friendly. Would highly recommend staying here- especially during the summer months when you are looking to get a good deal.
