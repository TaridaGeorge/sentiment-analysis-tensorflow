Had a great experience here last night. The cedar plank salmon was wonderful. Had a chance to taste the halibut, one encrusted in hazel nut and one simply grilled, both were top notch. Add to all this fine food, a fantastic server, Ash and you have a great night out. As a visitor to Temper Arizona, I was pleasantly surprised to find such a good  seafood restaurant.
