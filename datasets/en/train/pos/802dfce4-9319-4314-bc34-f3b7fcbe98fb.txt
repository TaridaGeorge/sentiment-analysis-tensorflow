I have been meaning to stop in but keep driving on by.  I am SO GLAD that I stopped. I was pleased the moment I walked in.  The store is well lit and cheery, the books line the wall making you feel like you're walking into a oasis of knowledge.  I found 10 copies of the book I was looking for (I needed 10 copies) and the owner said he will order me copies of two books he didn't have.  Also, he offered his community room for my book club!  So nice, very friendly, definitely the kind of place we want to encourage.
