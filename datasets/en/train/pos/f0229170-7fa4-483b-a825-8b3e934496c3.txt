Tried this place after seeing online reviews. It's in a upscale strip shopping center off of Scottsdale road near Lincoln.
It reminds me of Heirloom in DC Ranch. A strong emphasis on local, fresh ingredients, but they have been doing it long before it was hip. 
Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. The food was fantastic. I had the shredded pork, my wife had the salmon appetizer and salmon entree as well. All were delicious and well prepared. 
I would highly recommend the green peppers side. Some are spicy, some are not. It's a guessing game as to which are which.
