Man, I *love* this place!!! Great atmosphere & crowd. And I just heart the Venice Beach Burrito (sans tofu) with a delicious croissant for weekend breakfast with Earl Grey lavender tea or a decaf Americano.

Good vibes always on the overhead. I was able to bask in the sun at an outdoor table, enjoy a leisurely meal, write in my journal, and take in all the people (& dogs!!!). 

Totally dig this place!!!
