Hey for a local DIVE this is the place.  Karaoke, pool, and you do not even need to bring your marlboro's cause it is so smoky you just need to inhale - I was there for a couple hours I think I smoked about 4 packs.  I almost lost my 36 year old friend to couple of 60 year old women smokin cigars at the bar.  Hey corn beef and cabbage on St. Paddys day.  The girls sure are purdy tho!  - and actually the people sure were hospitable.
