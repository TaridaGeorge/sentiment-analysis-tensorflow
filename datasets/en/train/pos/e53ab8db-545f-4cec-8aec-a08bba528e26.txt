To anyone looking for a nanny agency, this is the one to use! Janet, the owner, is very much involved in the process of finding "the perfect fit" nanny for any family. She is very knowledgable about her nannies and is a great resource for any questions I had about hiring a nanny. Janet has a disposition that set my mind at ease.  After meeting personally with Janet, I felt confident that choosing to have a nanny vs. other childcare, was the way to go! 

Thanks to Janet for her awesome service!
