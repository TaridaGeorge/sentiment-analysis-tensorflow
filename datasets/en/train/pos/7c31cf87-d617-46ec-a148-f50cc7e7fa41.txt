I am a long time client of, Karri Hayes. Due to her knowledge and expertise in skin care I have been able to not only quit taking antibiotics for my adult acne but I have the complexion I never thought I'd have. Thank you, Karri for not only treating my problem skin but teaching me to take care between my visits.  You have also helped my kiddos keep their complexions crystal clear!  Such a positive influence my daughter is going to school to be an Aesthetician!  Thanx Karri! See you...
