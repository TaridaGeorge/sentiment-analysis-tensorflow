my last 2 sets of tires have come from this shop. after nearly wearing my last pair to the bone, i came in today for a new set. 

so i brought my bike in the truck thinking i could ride home during the hours and hours it would take them to replace my tires. to my utter shock, the rep told me "oh it will take only 30 minutes" and in fact only took them 20. i was astounded. 

add to that all the freebies, like rotation, flat repair, etc and i was really impressed. my wife loves them too. took her car there for a nail in tire and they fixed her up free in about 10 minutes. 

hopefully now, that won't be me you see skidding across the freeway during one of our frequent rainstorms!
