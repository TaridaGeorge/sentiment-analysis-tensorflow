An Experience.  Order from the menu, or try the 5 course tasting ($100) or 6 course ($125). I did the 5 course, and it was PLENTY of food + you get dessert.  This is the real thing for sushi. The chefs carve it right off the fish, so you know it's not prepackaged.  The staff is very attentive, the food is adventurous, and a lot of care is put into presentation.  If you're looking for something DIFFERENT, this is not your typical sushi place.
