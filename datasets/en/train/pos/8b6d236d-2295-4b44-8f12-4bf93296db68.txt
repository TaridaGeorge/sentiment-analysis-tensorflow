By far the best frozen yogurt we have had anywhere since moving to Chandler last year.  The root beer yogurt is sensational...but everything there is so good you'll want to try all 20 flavors (most places only have 8 or 10).

We were very impressed with the owner, Jeff, who makes you feel welcome and comfortable.  We intentionally pass 4 or 5 other yogurt shops to go to Frio Mio, which isn't the easiest place to find but is definitely worth finding!  

For frozen yogurt, this is AS GOOD AS IT GETS.
