I was there this weekend and bought me a TAG Heuer Formula Watch...and it was not cheap.

Superior Customer Service!!!!

I cant speak enough aboout this shopping little heaven.  You enter the store and they acknowlege you in a very subtle way yet you dont feel hounded or harrassed by annoying sales people on the floor. 
.They always go above and beyond for their customers.   

Kudos Nordstroms...Kudos!
