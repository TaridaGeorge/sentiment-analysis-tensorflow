Went on yelp before coming here to see if it was a bust..not a bust! If you didn't know I am a sushi lover! Me and my brother came here before his Lasik eye appointment..and Oh. My. Goodness. Delicious! We were most impressed by the spicy yellow tail. And cannot believe how cheap it was during happy hour! Can't wait to be in the area again just to go here again.
