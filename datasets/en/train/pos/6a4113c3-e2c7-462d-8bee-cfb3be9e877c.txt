I have tried the other DIY dog
Wash spots and this place cannot
be beat.  

Great products, customer service and atmosphere. I take a 85 pound dog there at least once a month for a self
Wash. I reccomend the ultimate wash- it's so easy to get your best friend so fresh
and so clean-clean. 

Today there was a minor malfunction with a hose during our wash. The owner asked about it and apologized for the problem and cut the price in half. Now THAT is class and taking care of customers. 

In addition- they have a great selection of dog toys you will not find anywhere else. My bff LOVES the sea creature series of dog toys. 

Lastly, if you ever want to give yourself
A treat and have them wash your pup- they have amazing grooming professionals who know their stuff.
