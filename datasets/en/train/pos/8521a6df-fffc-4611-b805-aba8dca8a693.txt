Most people know Malee's on Main, but there's also a Malee's Thai Bistro and Sushi Bar in Desert Ridge that is gaining in popularity.  

Try the spring rolls, veggie fried rice and the shrimp sa-teh- all excellent.  Their sushi is great too and the restaurant gets busy, but the wait for a table isn't ever that bad.
