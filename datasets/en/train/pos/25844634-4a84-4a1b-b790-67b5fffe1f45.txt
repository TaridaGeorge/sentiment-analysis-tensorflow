Papago Park is a great urban oasis nestled between Phoenix, Tempe and Scottsdale. It's a great way to discover the Sonoran xeriscape without leaving the Valley of the Sun. The enormous red rocks stand as a beautiful centerpiece of the park and offer great vantage points that provide you with beautiful 360-degree vistas of the city. Rock-climbing, hiking, mountain biking, picnicking and other activities make this one of the country's finest and most naturally beautiful parks.
