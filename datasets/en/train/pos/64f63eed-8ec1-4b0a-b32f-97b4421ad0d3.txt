Binkley's is the best restaurant in town, period. 

Chef Kevin Binkley, who I understand worked with Thomas Keller at the infamous French Laundry, has a genuine passion for innovative cuisine (foie gras dipping dots anyone?).   My husband and I have been to this restaurant several times within the last year and at each  visit we are completely blown away by the exciting choices on the tasting menu and the wonderful little amuse bouche treats.  The restaurant also has an impressive wine selection and the staff are top notch.  

Don't let the unassuming stripmall location fool you....this place will be getting lots of national foodie press very soon!
