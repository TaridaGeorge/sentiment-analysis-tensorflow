Get the Kobe Beef Burger Zin style. The truffle aioli fries. The Kit-Kat shake. This place is not cheap. But for what you get it is the best of the best. Every time we go here, its an exciting. We call their kobe burgers butter burgers. They truly melt in your mouth without even a need to chew on them. OMG. We just went 2 days ago. All we have been talking about is when are we going again?????
