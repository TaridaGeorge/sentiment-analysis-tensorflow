The service has always been really good.

I love LOTS of things on the menu. The dixie pan fried chicken is great.  There's a great little sticky bun that comes with it.  The Del mar salad is great.  I've had great experiences going to chelsea's kitchen.  

Overall it's in my heavy rotation on places I always say YES, let's go there!
