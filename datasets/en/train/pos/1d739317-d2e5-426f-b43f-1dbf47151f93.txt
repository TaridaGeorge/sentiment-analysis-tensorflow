Pane Bianco is the place I go when I want a great, random sandwich.  A lot of people I take there their time are thrown off by the limited "standard" menu, but I think the stand-by's are great, and the idea of trying a new sandwich/flavor-profile imagined by the chef is fantastic.  

Price:  Not bad
Service: Good
Atmosphere:  Great
Food:  Great

While slightly more costly than I'd pay for a typical sandwich lunch, it's worth the cost.  If the place wasn't situated just far enough north of Downtown to make it a trip, I'm sure I'd go here at least 1-2x a week.
