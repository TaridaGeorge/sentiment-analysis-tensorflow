I may actually be biased because I can walk to this store, but I have to say how much I love it! The store is always clean, the employees have been helpful each and every time I've needed anything in the last three years, and most of the time I find exactly what I need. I love that there are no lines and not because the place is deserted, either. If I moved farther from this location ever, I know I would still come back to this Target because of the wonderful experiences I've had here.
