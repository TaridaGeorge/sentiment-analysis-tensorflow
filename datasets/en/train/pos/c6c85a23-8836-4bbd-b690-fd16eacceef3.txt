Wow! This charming restaurant is just what Phx needs! A food and wine lovers homerun with great attention to detail every where you look. The staff from front to back was spot on and makes you feel like a regular customer on your first visit!
What started off with a quick beer at the bar while waiting for a walk in table turned into a charming and elegant dinner with our own personal dining experience at the bar with a great foody/bartender  who took us on our Beckets journey!
I HIGHLY recommend Becketts Table with only one reservation... I would hate for it to get so popular that I couldn't get right in!
 
Thank you for delighting my taste buds!
