Amazing bagels, especially the Asiago and Egg bagel! You have to get there early or they will be out! Love their bagel sandwiches too! Btw people, if you think they are being rude please don't ever go to Philly or New York. You will never survive. Its a different culture over there and that's why the people at Hot Bagels come across as rude when they really aren't. Not much else to say but go in and try a bagel!
