I remember these guys when it was May West over on McClintock. Anyway, I dropped in here the other day and it is absolutely old school perfection. Every item I have ever ordered here has been above par and the servers go out of their way to make sure you are taken care of. FYI - It gets pretty crowded at peak times.
