I'm generally not a French food fan but this Swiss/French infusion restaurant has completely won me over.  The food is indescribably good.  Don't let the location fool you, the interior makes you forget where you are.  To top it off the chef is incredibly talented having cooked for prime ministers and heads of state.  Everyone in my party walked away feeling as though they had a dining experience, not just a meal.
