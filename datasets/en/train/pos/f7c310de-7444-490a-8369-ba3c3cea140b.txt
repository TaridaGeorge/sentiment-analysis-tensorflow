I love this place. I come here once a year for ANGELS spring training. This trip I got a hamburger and 5 combo deal. The hamburger was good. It tool 5-10 minutes but the cashier helping me was really nice and made sure I was the first one to get a fresh hamburger when it was ready. 

The 5 combo deal can't be beat. For $15 you get 2 hot dogs, 2 drinks(or bottles of water), and a bag of peanuts. I would definitely recommend this deal for people with families or individuals who like to eat. 

The staff was really nice and the venue was clean. Thanks for years of great experiences.
