This place is great. I love the owners - already ready with a smile.  The crab pufs are the best around.  Actually, all the food is great. Don't be scared of the appearance of the building - sometimes the "holes in the wall" are the best kept secret.  In a big city like Phoenix, it is nice to support a non-chain restaurant.
