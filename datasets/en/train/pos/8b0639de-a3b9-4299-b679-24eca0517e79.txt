We love Dr. Curran and the entire East Valley Children's Center team! 
Dr. Curran is thorough, caring, attentive and energetic. My husband and I are constantly pleased by his attention to detail and care for our son. 
The office staff is also very kind and efficient and we are never left waiting. EVCC also has a superb website that answers all the questions that new parents will have. It's even more comforting to know that the info was written and compiled by the Doctors.
