This place is the best place in Tempe town marketplace by far. Good drinks, good food, and great service. They have a great happy hour and you get 25% your lunch just for checking in. Not to mention the sight of old cougs riding the bull at night is worth the trip itself.

Bars are a dime a dozen in these parts so if you want the best experiencing possible go ask for Mel and Chelsea behind the bar. These master mixologists are heavy on service and even heavier on your pour!
