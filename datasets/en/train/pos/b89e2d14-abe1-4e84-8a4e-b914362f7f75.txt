We just moved into the neighborhood and checked out D'lish after one of my co-worker's recommended it.  We can't get enough!  Great coffee, creative and tasty healthy food and coffee that is expertly made.  I recommend the carmel, the mocha and my husband likes the Buzz smoothie.  The quinoa oatmeal with rice milk and fresh fruit is d'lish as is the california breakfast sandwich which is the perfect balance of flavors on a ciabatta bun.  The employees are so much fun and are friendly and fast to get you your order. If you're in South Scottsdale stop in, you won't be disappointed!
