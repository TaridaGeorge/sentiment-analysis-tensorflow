What's not to like about ikea? Drop your kids off and shop, shop, shop! The merchandise is of quality that you would expect due to the low pricing. They have just about everything under the sun! If you've never been and would like the full ikea experience, plan at least 2 hrs to browse the store. And another 30 mins to check out. But it's well worth it!
