I love this place. It's fresh, it's innovative and bold. They have daily specials that are always interesting. The bartenders rock! Burgers are to die for, better than anything around. It's not your basic "cookie-cutter" place so if you're looking for creative and flavor-packed, this place will curl your toes.
