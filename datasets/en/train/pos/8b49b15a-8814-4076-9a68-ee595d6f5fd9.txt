There are not enough good things I can say about family vet care in Chandler!! Dr Wodiske is a truly amazing vet and surgeon. My yorkie puppy has had a couple major medical issues since I got her and he not only saved her life but treated me with such care and compassion I felt like a member of his family. He is always available for questions and follows up with all concerns no matter how trivial. I cannot imagine taking my pet to anyone else. All of the office staff is extremely professional and kind as well. Every person I have met in this office has gone above and beyond in meeting my needs and providing quality and compassionate care. I recommend this office to everyone I know. In my opinion my pet could not be in better hands!!!
