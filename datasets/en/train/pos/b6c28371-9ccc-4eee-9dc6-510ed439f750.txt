Being someone from Arizona, I have never experienced a Phoenix Open until now.... and damn I have been missing out my entire life. I absolutely loved it.

It's a buffet for the eyes with hot plastic women and milfs, out of control outfits ranging from argyle sweaters to all white outfits, white trash and curly mulletinos, mustaches with handlebars... its seriously the best place hands down to people watch.

OK, I was across the lake of the hole 17 sky box on corporate row, but dude, whats not to like?

Free food---- GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Free OPEN BAR ALL DAY---- GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
People watching with perfect weather outdoors getting tan- GOOOOOOD
PORTABLE TOILETS WITH HAND SANITIZER----GOOOOOD

Oh everyone needs to come to the best PGA tour game ever. It's one big frat party. Only time after college where being drunk from 10:30am to 3:30am is acceptable. BRAVO SCOTTSDALE.
