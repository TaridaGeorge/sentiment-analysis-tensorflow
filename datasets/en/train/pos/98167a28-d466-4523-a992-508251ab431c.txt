Had our New Year's Eve dinner experience here and enjoyed every bit of it!  Steaks were melt in your mouth tender and perfectly prepared. We also got to try the bacon wrapped scallops that were prepared perfectly, also.....moist and tasty.

You get to order your sides al-a-carte and they are big enough to share, we always have too many but it makes it fun to try a little of everything.  My favorite is the asparagus with a balsamic reduction drizzled on top, YUM!

For dessert we had to go with the Chocolate Fudge Cake that comes with a healthy helping of rich vanilla ice cream, perfect way to start off the New Year!
