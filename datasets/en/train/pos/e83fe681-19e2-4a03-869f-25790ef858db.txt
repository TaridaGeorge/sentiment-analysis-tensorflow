Ceasar salad was perfect, chicken and rice was the best I have ever eaten, corn on cob with chili butter was amazing, and the homemade Oreo desert was incredible. By the way, the service was 5 star all the way. No wonder this place has a wait most every night. Wish I could eat there 8 nights a week...
