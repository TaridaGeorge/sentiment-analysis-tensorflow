OK, now I am seriously impressed.  The Owner recognized me on my second visit, and bothered to thank me for visiting again.  How awesome is that!?

Not as awesome as the Tiramisu, which was better than I expected!  And huge!  For a girl like me, that would be what I would change actually: I need smaller portions.

Other than that, I still love this place, and my server was absolutely charming!
