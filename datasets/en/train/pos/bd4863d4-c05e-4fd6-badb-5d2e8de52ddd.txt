Ice custard happiness indeed! Brought the kids here after school today for our first visit and we will DEFINITELY be back! Blake, who was working the counter, was patient, helpful, and explained the menu items thoroughly to us newbies. Three of us had Gelati's which are a combination of flavored ice AND custard. Absolutely yum! One kidlet had blue raspberry ice that was delish! 

AND they do school fundraisers as well! Love companies that give back to the community!

Can't wait to go back soon and try more flavors!
