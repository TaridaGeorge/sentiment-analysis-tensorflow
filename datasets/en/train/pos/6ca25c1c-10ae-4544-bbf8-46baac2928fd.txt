Great church Great Pastor. We just joined and realized they have a coffee house that serves Starbucks located outside the main sanctuary HOW COOL!!! The best part is all of the kids drinks are $1! Our kids love going to church here they are very into Awana and all of the activities they offer GO SBC!!
