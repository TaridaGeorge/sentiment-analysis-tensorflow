Bookman's is the ultimate sanctuary for ADD-addled adults with an uncanny ability to justify purchasing magazine back-issues in bulk. No joke - this place caters to my easily-overwhelmed sensibilities and makes me feel like I need to own tattered Joycean hardbacks just to lend my apartment the smell of ancient books. It's like Park and Swap Jr. - there is pretty much the grandest selection of old junk, mixed with new junk, mixed with questionably-useless junk. All of this proverbial junk, though, seems completely necessary.

The staff rules, and the credit there never expires so you can trade in your unwanted garbage for some in-store points and maybe buy yourself a Gamecube or some elementary Teach Yourself Japanese texts. In any case, if you leave Bookman's without a claw full of relics, you have way too much self-control.
