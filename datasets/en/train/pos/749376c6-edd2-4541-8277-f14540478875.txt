I took fellow yelpers' recs and ordered naan and bengun bhartha while my bf ordered chicken korma. It was all incredible! I've been apprehensive about Indian food after a couple bad experiences 10+ years ago, but Tandoori Times has changed my perspective 180 degrees! I cannot wait to go back! Plus, a majority of the customers tonight were South Asian Indians so you know it's truly good Indian cuisine.
