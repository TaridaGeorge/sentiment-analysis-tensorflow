Inexpensive and the acrylics are TOUGH. I like the expression "hard as nails..." corny, but they lasted a long time. Service was fast and they gave me the paint job I wanted which seems simple enough but is not an easy conversation to have at most nail places (a variation of a french manicure). I only get my nails done about once every two years but I'll keep this shop in my mental rolodex.
