I travel for work and have recently discovered Yelp and found this sushi restaurant.  Fabulous sushi and sashimi...just the perfect temp and melt-in-your-mouth taste.  The staff are very friendly and efficient.  I came back a second time because it was that good.  Thanks for those who gave it 4 stars!!
