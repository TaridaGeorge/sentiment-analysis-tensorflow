What's not to love about Boulders? Cool, friendly staff. Dozens of craft beers - importantly coupled with some true, in-house expertise on the subject. Great food, especially the pizza. Excellent weekly specials. Prime location with plenty of parking.

And, of course, there's...The Big Freakin' Nacho. 

The BFN is truly the most unusual, potentially frightening and ultimately satisfying nacho-type dish I have ever utterly failed to finish, even with the assistance of multiple friends. It is served on a pizza platter.  A LARGE pizza platter. Enough calories to support a small Eurasian village through a long winter. And, oddly but pleasantly, the chips are made from fried pizza dough, and marinara has been subbed in for salsa.  

An experience worth having.
