I stayed here for a few nights last month and this place is gorgeous!  They have everything you need on the resort, pools, golf course, spa, fine dining, gondola rides, coffee shops, and live entertainment, so you literally never have to leave.  The views are beautiful and the staff is curteous.  The rooms are really nice and each one (that I know of) has an outdoor patio/balcony.
