Great shop. Went in with the intent of buying a Trek Madone 3.1 on a killer deal. They had my size in stock and ready to go. Just added some Shimano SH11 pedals and a couple bottle cages on it. Took maybe 25 minutes or so and I got great help from Noah. All the guys were knowledgeable and cool. Landis has been in business for a long time for good reason. Great equipment, good prices, good availability, knowledgeable and cool people. Highly recommended.
