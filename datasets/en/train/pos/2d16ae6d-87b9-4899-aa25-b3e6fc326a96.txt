This place is great!

I had a pair of pants that needed to be taken up and they were quick to help.  I needed them in a pinch and they got them done, and done well.

Everyone here is extremely friendly, and makes you feel like family.  They even sewed on a new button for my shirt while I was dropping my pants off.

If you need any alterations (or Creations for that matter), this is the place to go!  They are cash only, but there's a Chase across the street if you need it.
