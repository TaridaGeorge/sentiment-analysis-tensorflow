I cannot really speak to the sushi (I don't eat sushi), but everyone in our party loved their meal.  I just wanted to write a quick review to speak about the service!  We had the best waitress!  A party of ten women and this girl did a fabulous job, was attentive, quick, patient and even helped us with a birthday cake we brought in!!  A great experience!
