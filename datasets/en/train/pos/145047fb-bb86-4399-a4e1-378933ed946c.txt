After living within walking distance of this neighborhood gem for 8 years I finally tried it one night after a long day at work (and coming across great reviews).
The place is clean and very basic.  The real delight is the little old man who seems to be at the counter every day. He is so upbeat and friendly, and sharp as a tack. This place has a very loyal following and I'd attribute that to him as much as the well priced and yummy food!  You can't beat the price and the portions are generous. 
With all the places that are going under these days I am confident this neighborhood staple will be going strong for a good long time!
