I've been to Hula's many times both for happy hour and dinner and the selection is great! They have a creative menu and the drinks are fun and full of flavor! The fish tacos and seaweed salad are probably our favorites. We tried the bean burger and sweet potato fries which was actually really good! I would recommend this place to anyone looking for great food, a chill atmosphere, and great pricing. If you want to wrap up with desert they just opened up Twist next door for a great selection of frozen yogurt!
