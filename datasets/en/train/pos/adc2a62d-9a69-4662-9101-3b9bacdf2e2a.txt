I think my love for Oregano's is only exceeded by my husband's love for Oregano's. I could eat the Italian sausage sandwich and those dang waffle fries three times a day if I had the metabolism of a vole. As is I usually take half of the monstrous sandwich home to devour for breakfast the next morning. The vino bambino salad is glorious.

I haven't tried pizza here, but everything else is great. When family from out of state comes to visit I like to get a party-sized trough of various pastas and the garden salad, and everyone in my family has really enjoyed this. They'll make ziti without the meat as well if you want to please a gathering of vegetarians.
