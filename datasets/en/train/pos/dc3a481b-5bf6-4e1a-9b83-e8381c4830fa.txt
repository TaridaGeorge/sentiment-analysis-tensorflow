Best chai ever. Ever. I can't recall the name of the ice cream I got, I believe it was huckleberry...? But it was delicious. My family got the chocolate covered bananas and they were to die for.

I've played several open mic nights at Pink Spot and the staff/management is always so kind.  

Definitely my favorite spot in phoenix.
