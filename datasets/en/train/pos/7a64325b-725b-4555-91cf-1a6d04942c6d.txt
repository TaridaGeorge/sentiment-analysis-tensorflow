My wife and I loved this place!  The menu was outstanding - thoroughly impressed with the wide variety.  I had the New England Clam Bake - delicious lobster, clams and mussels... the clam chowder was delicious as well.  My wife had the ono, which she thoroughly enjoyed, too.  Highly recommend the oyster sampler as an appetizer.  We took home some bread pudding for a late night dessert too.  Service was great, lots of good recommendations from our waitress.  We went to Wildfish near Fashion Square not long ago, and I'd have to say we'd return to King's way before going back to Wildfish.  Much more reasonable, price-wise, as well.  No complaints - they made a great first impression on us!
