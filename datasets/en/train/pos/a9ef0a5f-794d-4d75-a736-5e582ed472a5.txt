Love this place. 

My cocktail was strong and poured professionally (Sazerac) and the beer selections were also good (went with the Lagunitas IPA). 

I had the scallops which were cooked perfectly. The bacon lardons, grits, and cola gastrique were a unique addition not seen on your typical scallop dish. 

The service was EXCELLENT. I ate at the bar and the two bartenders were awesome: very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. I usually keep my tips in the 20% range but this was one of the rare occasions I was inclined to give more.

Definitely on my list to stop back next time I am in Old Town.
