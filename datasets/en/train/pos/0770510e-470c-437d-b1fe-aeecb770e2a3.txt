We heard great things about Bandera, and had to try it.  I have to say, the pork ribs outdid the chicken (although it was very tender and tasty).  Our source said the meat would fall off the bones, and it did!  You must order the cornbread, but expect it to be a little on the sweet side.  We loved all the sides, and the oreo ice cream sandwiches were fantastic.  We had a reservation, but did have to wait another 15 minutes, which was a bummer.  The staff was very professional and pleasant, and they accommodated our 11-month old with no hesitation.
