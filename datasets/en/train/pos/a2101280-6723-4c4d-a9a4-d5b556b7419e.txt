First my new glasses was not good for me. so I had to go to fix several times. It was not fun to go again and again but they tried to help me.
But finally I had to change my glasses, they just gave me new glasses cause they have 100days return policy.
Now I have a good glasses and I feel very comfortable with my new glasses.
