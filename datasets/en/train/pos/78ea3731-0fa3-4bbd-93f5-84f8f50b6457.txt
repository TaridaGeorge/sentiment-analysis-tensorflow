Great veg place. I take all my friends that wouldn't dare to go vegetarian here and they all love it. When you can take your friends that eats meat and only full fat dairy products and they like it you know it's good. You can't go wrong with the bbq,parm, or steak sandwich. All the Ice creams are to die for. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the chilli burger. That is the only thing out of everything I have tried that I didn't care for. But everything else rocks.
