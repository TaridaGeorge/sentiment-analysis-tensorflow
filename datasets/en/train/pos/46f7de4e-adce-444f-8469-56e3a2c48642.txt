Chatt, Tea and Pizza three of the surprised I found on my last trip. 

Most buffets have the usual suspects garnished with rice naan and some condiments. But to have a Chatt available?  Chai Tea (included) and even pizza (yes Indian style veggie pizza and its good)

This is why I am so in love with this place, 1 Great Flavor, you can beat the unmuted flavors that sing in your mouth. 2. variety, there is more to Indian the palak paneer and tandori chicken and pakora. 3. Value great price for a wide range of options. 

Next time you are in take a look at the left end of the buffet first and see if you can find a Chaat.
