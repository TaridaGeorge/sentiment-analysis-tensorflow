A nice place to grab a coffee and a treat and do geeking on the internet. A great drive-thru option if you can't stay. Megan, the manager, has staffed enough folks behind the counter now to wait on the drive-thru and walkins. They even bring you your order if they can! Also they have a foursquare Mayor contest. Large place indoors and out, cool artwork on the walls, free wi-fi (ask for the password slip when you order) and good background music!
