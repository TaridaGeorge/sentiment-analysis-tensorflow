I totally love this Subway location. It is one of the cleaner ones I have been in and I have had a lot of good experiences here. The owner is always around, totally nice and her employees seem to have some personality which is a plus for me. They are pretty much always busy, but I don't think I have ever spent what I would consider to be too long there in line. I completely accept that you always run the risk of a so so service experience when it comes to fast food, but I have had too many good experiences here not to write about it.
