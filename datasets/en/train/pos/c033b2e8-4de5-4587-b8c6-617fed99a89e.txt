This was a blast!!! Amazing four days of entertainment, quality starts, great really bad for you food, and lots and lots of fun. We did have reserved seats, which even the cheapest reserved seats I highly recommend. It is a completely different experience with the seats. There is tons of greasy fair style food but it was all really good quality. No disappointments. Get there early enough each day to avoid the crazy traffic.
