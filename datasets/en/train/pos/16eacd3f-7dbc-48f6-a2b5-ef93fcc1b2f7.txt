I love this subway! It's clean, fast, and I always leave happy. Krystal, who is also the manager, is always sooo friendly! Ex: I told her I was dieting and she gave me all kinds of tips! She removed some of my bread , loaded up on  my fav veggies, no cheese and also gave me light mayo packets so I could measure exact calories. I always appreciate great customer service, I am loyal to this particular subway just because of that!
