Don Arbuckle knows Marketing. He is not just about handing you a catalog and wanting you to pick out something to sell you. He interviews you to find out what is going to work to further promote your business. I was so impressed with his work. 

I ordered temporary tattoos to give to students who came to our Kidz 'n Power Class as a incentive for them to practice the material taught. Their parents quizzed them every couple of days to make sure they were retaining the information taught and then the child would earn a tattoo. This was a brilliant idea. Thanks Don for thinking outside the box. 

I highly recommend everyone talk with him so he can help promote your business too!
