....About the best your going to get in Surprise.  Most places around there are good for take out - not dine in - and if you want to dine in you should be prepared to be recomended to Red Robin or Carrabas. :(

I am vegetarian and was so incredibly happy to see vegetarian dishes.. a must try is the Garlic Tofu with Eggplant.

The rest of my family enjoyed the flounder and the triple beef.

The place is small but homely .
