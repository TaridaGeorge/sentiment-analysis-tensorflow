I would apologize for any color I may have left on your counters, walls or chairs.  I stumbled into this location after doing the Color Run.  This is such a cute new eatery.  After ordering, me and my friends could not stop drooling over all the plates that were coming out.  Everything looked AMAZING!!!  I decided to try the Pear Omelet and I was not disappointed.   Pear, Havarti cheese, and almonds.....so delicious! My friends were raving about their dishes.  Great location and awesome service!  I can't wait to go back to try more items off their menu.
