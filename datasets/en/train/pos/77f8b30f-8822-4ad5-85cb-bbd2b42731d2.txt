Every time I get an eye exam I try a new optometrist.  Well, I will be going back to Dr. Greenberg from now on.  He noticed a harmless anomaly in my eye and discussed it with me regardless -- no other optometrist mentioned this before.  I got my new prescription glasses within just a few days and I am very happy with them.
