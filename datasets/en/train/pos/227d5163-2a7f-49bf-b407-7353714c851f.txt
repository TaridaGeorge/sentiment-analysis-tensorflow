Attended two conferences here and have been amazed by the property's facilities, food, and service.  The staff here is top notch and goes over the top to make you feel at home and special.  I asked about the sculpture on the golf course and they brought me a pamphlet explaining the origin of the sculpture, the artist, and the property.

The food we were served for lunch & dinner at the conference was amazing too......Filet & Mashed Potatoes for dinner and Cold Cut Sandwiches for lunch.  The food was quality and fresh.  The servers knew how to deliver and pick up the dishes without making too much noise as to distract us from the keynote speakers......you don't find that skill too often anymore.

Overall, it's a great place to organize/attend a meeting.  Plan to return for a vacation.
