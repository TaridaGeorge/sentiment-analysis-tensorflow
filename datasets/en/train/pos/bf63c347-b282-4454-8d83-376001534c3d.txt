We live around the corner from the Red Bird Cafe and would probably eat there every day...if we could avoid hitting 400lbs. 
Everything we've tried on the menu is amazing! Breakfast and lunch are delicious, with daily specials. The bacon blue cheese burger is to die for! A family from Wisconsin owns and operates the restaurant--and they're always nice. 
You always leave satisfied!
