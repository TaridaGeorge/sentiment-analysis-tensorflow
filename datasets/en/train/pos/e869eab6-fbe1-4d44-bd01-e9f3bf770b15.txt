THis was the best THAI I have had in Phoenix and I have been to quite a few places.  The food is so fresh, the Pad Thai delicious, the Kapow chicken prepared perfectly and the panang chicken was awesome.  Thee portions were ginormous and we could hardly finish our meals with a few appetizers.  The staff was very very pleasant and took excellent care of us.  I will absolutely return for more of this great food.
