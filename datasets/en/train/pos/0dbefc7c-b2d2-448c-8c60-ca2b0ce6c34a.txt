This place is amazing!!!! Fantastic bagels,crusty ,with the right amount of chewiness as well as texture and flavor.Delicious cream cheese ,hot breakfast sandwiches as well as deli.Just talked to a New Yorker friend of mine and she called it"the only place besides New York that can serve a great bagel"!!!!!!!
