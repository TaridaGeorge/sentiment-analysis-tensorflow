I have been coming here since moving back from college in 2002. I love everything about this place; the complimentary beverages, the warm shaving cream neck shave, the attention to each persons haircut, but especially the people who work there. Julie my stylist and salon owner has been cutting my hair 9 years. Does amazing work and is a real sweetheart. Adrian another exceptional stylist does equally amazing. If your looking for a nice to place to look your best, definitely check out Boxers!!
