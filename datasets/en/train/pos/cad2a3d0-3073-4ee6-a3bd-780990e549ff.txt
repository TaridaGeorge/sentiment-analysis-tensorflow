1st time at any Joe's Crab Shack & loved it!  We had a steam pot for 2. 1/2 was spicy style & the other 1/2 was fire-grilled style. The spicy style was good but the fire-grilled was outstanding!  Both included plenty of crab, corn on the cob, potatoes & sausage. Everything was very good & we finished with the Key Lime pie. It was excellent & more than enough for the 2 of us.   Great service topped off the experience & we'll definitely return!
