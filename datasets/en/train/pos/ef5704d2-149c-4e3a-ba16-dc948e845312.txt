This place is excellent.  Pricey, yes, but the food is excelelnt and that IS the first reason we eat at a restaurant, right?  Nothing special on the outside and the inside is a touch on the spartan side, too.  No white table cloths here.  Booths.  A basic eatery decor. 

Alaskan Brewing on tap - not sure where else in the Valley you can find that!

I usually get the pasta special and have NEVER been disappointed, even when it is something I might not ordinarily order.  Last week it was spinach gnocci in bacon cream sauce.  Amazing!  Wings are pretty good as well.

Old time waitressing with fun chatting and joking if you wish.  A friendly place that appreciates your business.

Don't arrive too late for lunch or you will be hunting for a parking spot in the gravel lot out back.
