The place to go when you need to see a cactus. Or hundreds of them, along with a variety of other desert plants. I went here with my digital camera and came back with a bunch of photos worth printing. The garden is extremely well-kept and is easily accessable. Admission is cut in half for students, so don't forget that ID card.
