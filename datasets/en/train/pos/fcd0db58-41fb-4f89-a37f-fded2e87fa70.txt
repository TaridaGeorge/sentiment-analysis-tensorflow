Went here today in search of new dog food for my Teddy ... This store is BIG. Lots of different kinds of food, cheaper than most stores I've been to, the staff is super friendly and helpful. It is clean and nice and has toys, collars and meds. They carry other supplies/food for small animals and cats too! I love this store and definitely will be back!!!
