Joe's Real Barbecue is one of my family's favorite places. Great for groups, dates, kids, the grandparents, you name it. The atmosphere is strictly casual, with long picnic tables and plastic silverware. There is a big outdoor seating area we especially like, and if the kids finish before us they can run around in the grass without bothering anyone.

Go with the the pulled pork / sliced brisket combination with cole slaw and mac and cheese. Although everything I've tried here is good. The cheese bread is also especially tasty.

Oh, and how can I forget the lemon cake? Sweet and tangy, just like my Mom makes :)
