Impressed!  I was visiting from Las Vegas for a horse show and this restaurant was recommended to me.  A big thank you to my friends for that!  Amazing service.  Couldn't have asked for anything better!  The food came out in perfect order.  We had appetizers, salad, entrees.  Our drinks were never empty.  The Ahi Sashimi was delicious, my special order salmon done perfect and the prime rib and shrimp scampi my fellow diners ordered was raved about.  I will visit again next time I'm in town!  A+
