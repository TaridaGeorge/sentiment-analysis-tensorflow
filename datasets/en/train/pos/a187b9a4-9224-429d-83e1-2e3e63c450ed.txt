Don't go during dinner. It's definitely not worth a 2-3 hour wait. But, if you go after 9, this becomes a much better experience.

My second visit improved my memory of this place. Came after 9pm, so the wait was less than an hour, and passed quickly at the Rose & Crown. The mozzarella and tomato salad tasted fresh enough to be local and The Wiseguy pizza was very tasty. But, in summary, I think the best experience is to go late and just with one other person.
