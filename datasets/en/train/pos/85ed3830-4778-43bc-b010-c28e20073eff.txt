I attended a baby shower that was catered by the Herb Box. I knew it was going to be good - when we pulled up and saw the Herb Box vehicle, all my friends in the car started oohing and ahhing about the food we were about to eat. 

The food was displayed so beautifully - it looked like a feast for kings and queens. So so pretty!

There were two different kinds of wraps, plantain chips w/ this amazing creamy crab dip, the most wonderful sundried tomato spread on crispy crostinis, and yummy mixed green salad. Everything tasted amazing. I am not a fan of sundried tomatoes, but that spread was so good - I wish I had the recipe!

If I ever need catering, I will definitely use this company!
