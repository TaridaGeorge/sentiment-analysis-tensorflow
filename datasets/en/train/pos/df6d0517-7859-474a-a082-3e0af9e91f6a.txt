This theater is my theater of choice. I always try to come to this one over the gateway 18. It's quiet and the crowd is older so usually there's no texting during the movie. The location is great, they have nice places to eat and shop around. Like all Harkins it has:

1. Loyalty Cups ($1 refills)
2. Loyalty T-shirts (Free popcorn)
3. Military Discount

If you live within the area, I would highly recommend this theater over gateway 18 and arrowhead 18.
