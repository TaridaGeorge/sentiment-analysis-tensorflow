Eat here almost once a week with co-worker.  Usually order number 7 on the Pho soup menu but sometimes would go for number 1 that usually have everything on it (tripe, stomach, etc) if you are into those things. Tasty and big portion always, good service as well.

Nothing like a good hot bowl of soup during cold chilly days.
