This may be the best pizza you can have delivered in Scottsdale. The sauce, cheese and toppings are all top notch. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra 20% to avoid eating another Domino's or Papa John's Pizza! You can pick it up to save a few dollars on delivery too.

*This place is seriously busy, so expect up to a one-hour wait (it's so worth it).
