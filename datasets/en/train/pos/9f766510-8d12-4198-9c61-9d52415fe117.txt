Cute little restaurant that serves up an excellent chai latte. Service was cheerful and very friendly, and they offer almond milk as well as soy for milk alternatives.  I was even given a sample of the chai concentrate to try out before it was made for me.  The chai had a nice mix of spices and had a smooth, deep taste.  We brought our dogs and sat on the patio, but the corner we were at had a lot of ants running around so they sat on our laps for most of the time.  

I'd definitely like to come here again to try more drinks and to try breakfast!
