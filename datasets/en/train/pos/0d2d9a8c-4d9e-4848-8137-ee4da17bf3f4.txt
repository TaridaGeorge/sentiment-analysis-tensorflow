Yep, Penzey's is awesome. In the spice world it's as good as it gets, one stop here and you'll guffaw every time you walk by a grocery store spice rack. Lot's of fresh spices, some you never knew existed and some you didn't know you can't live without, and many of them are available for your sniffing pleasure. Plus some awesome gift boxes available for ridiculously reasonable prices. With friendly and warm staff, inviting but not overbearing decor and really good prices for what you're getting, I would recommend everyone stop and have a look, I nearly guarantee you'll walk away with something awesome.
