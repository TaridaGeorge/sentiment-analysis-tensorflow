When I heard about this place I thought - chicken and waffles served together . 
I could not imagine this combination together but once I tried it I was HOOKED 

All I can see if Oh my gosh it is the best fried chicken and the waffles are light and fluffy and HUGE . 

I love this place - the only down side is it is a bit of a drive for me (but well worth the trip !!!)
