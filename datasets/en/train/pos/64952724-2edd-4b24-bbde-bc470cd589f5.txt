Had to find a new lawn service after the one I was using closed up shop.  Where to look but Yelp!  Saw the good review and called up Marcy to have her come and give me an estimate.  What a great experience.  Nice, friendly, punctual!  They did a great job.  The shrubs and bushes were done as  I requested (I hate it when they trim them so short, I lose the shade over my bedroom window), they hand pulled weeds, and they even went above and beyond and cleaned up the dog poop!  The price was reasonable and they worked with me on my schedule (I work nights) and even got it all done before my company arrived the next day.  So glad I found them, with a little help from yelp, ofcourse.
