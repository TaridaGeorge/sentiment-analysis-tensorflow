Although patio bars are a dime of dozen in the Valley,  there isn't one that stands out quite like Casey Moore's. People come out in droves to this charming century-old-house-turned neighborhood-bar, which is rumored to be haunted.

Guinness flows like water. The bartenders know nearly everyone by name. And the patio is a favorite among Valley hipsters, hippies and musicians, garnering a who's who in the Valley nightlife scene. Jimmy Eat World frontman Jim Adkins even named-dropped the Ninth and Ash haunt on the band's track "If You Don't, Don't."
