I recommend them highly!!  I took my 2 year old daughter for a sleep study and was very impressed.  Our sleep technician was amazing with her, very patient and kind.  The DVD we brought to watch while getting her hooked up got stuck in the TV and they vowed to return it.  We got a call the next day checking on our daughter and saying how sweet she was, they mentioned the DVD.  Several days later, we received the DVD plus a new copy of the Lion King with a nice note.  They are very good at what they do and if they can make a 2 year old feel at ease, they can probably do the same with anyone!!
