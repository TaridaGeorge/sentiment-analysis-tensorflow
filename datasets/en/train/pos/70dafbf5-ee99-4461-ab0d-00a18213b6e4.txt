The day just flew by...I had no idea that relaxing was so much fun!

- workout facility...better than your average resort!
- hot/cold plung pools
- water - I know this sounds weird, but in AZ you need water!  They change the flavors to match the time of day!
- music - during your treatments they let you pic the music!
- mineral pool - hand picked from Europe, the minerals will soften your skin.
- AZ residencial rate - call and ask, its worth it!
- food service - this is the ONLY complaint I have...too SLOW...I ordered food twice and never ate a bite; I never had enough time before the appointments.
