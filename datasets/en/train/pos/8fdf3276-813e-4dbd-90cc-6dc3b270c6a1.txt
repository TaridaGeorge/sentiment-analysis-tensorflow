This is the best tailor in town!  They really can fix anything.  I've taken them all sorts of different clothes from work pants to bridesmaid dresses and they've always done a phenomenal job!  I appreciate their fair prices, friendly attitudes and willingness to work with my timelines.  Their work is of the highest quality and I definitely trust them with my most expensive pieces.
