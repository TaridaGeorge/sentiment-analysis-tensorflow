I'm from the midwest so I was excited to see mountains and cacti! My friend and I were staying in Surprise so it was a very short drive (about 10-15 minutes) for us. I wish we had mountains this close in IL! Admission is $6 and was good for two visits. The first day, we did the Waterfall Trail. It was very scenic and we saw a lot of petroglyphs which was really cool. No waterfall this time though. The second day we did Waddell Trail. It was alright but flatter. Waterfall goes more into the mountains. I wish we had more time to do another hike or two because I loved it!

We did both hikes early in the morning, around 7am and the trails were not  crowded at all.
