Our little crew was looking for a fun and different place to have a birthday lunch celebration. Zinc fit the bill perfectly. This french bistro is nestled in the center of Kierland Commons, well suited for a tasty shopping intermission. My two girlfriends and I each got something from a different section of the menu ( salad, sandwich, and entree) and shared a side of the mac and cheese. Everything was absolutely delicious and the service was superb. Our food came quickly and our server was friendly, funny, and helpful. 

My recommends:
The Basiled Chicken and Brie Sanwich
Mac and Cheese

We were even treated to a nice Brandy Alexander in honor of my friends birthday. 

Definitely worth many many visits in the future!
