Came here for breakfast before my flight to SFO and all the raving I've read on here is completely TRUE.  I got the Half & Half breakfast with the protein pancakes it comes with a scramble as well, more than enough food for two to share and cheap prices.

Loved the quick service and nice staff, I didn't have any problems with them like I read from some others so perhaps they resolved all the issues.  I would definitely recommend this place and visit again the next time I'm in the Scottsdale area.
