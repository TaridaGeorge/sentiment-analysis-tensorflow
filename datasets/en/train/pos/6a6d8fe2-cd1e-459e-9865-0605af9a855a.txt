This place has great food! You have to try the buffalo shrimp, great dish! My only complaint about this dish...the skewers, you make a MESS getting the shrimp off! I love that they have different meat for the burgers, as I don't eat beef or pork...their turkey burgers are awesome!  Try to get there for their Happy Hour specials, it's worth it!
The atmosphere is nice, you get a view of a sports screen from every angle...they have a variety of sports on except when there is a special event. Then if you want to catch the event...no bad seat here! 
I recommend this place for a great hangout for you, your friends and/or family it has awesome food! Enjoy!
