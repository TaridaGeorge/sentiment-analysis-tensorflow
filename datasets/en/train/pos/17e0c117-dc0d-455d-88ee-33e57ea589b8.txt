Driving into the Royal Palms compound set the stage for a great lunch experience. The grounds and landscaping are great, colorful and relaxing, however it was the restaurant that left me smiling. We did not have a reservation during a rather busy holiday lunch crowd, but the maitre de'offered a table on the outside patio. I was all for that, but the people I went with were feeling chilled (being from Tucson and 60 is winter) and hesitated just a bit before saying the patio would be okay. The maitre de saw that short hesitation and made room for us in the dining room. All of the wait staff were just as attentive and perceptive. The food was very good, my cafe latte was fantastic. 
For the price of a mediocre lunch at Applebees I had a great experience at the Royal Palms.
