Out of all the Old Navy's I've been to, they had the best deals!  Maybe its because I'm from CA and AZ had cheaper prices....I don't know. I"m not complaining.  Just happy with everything I bought.  Of course, the great deals were on pull over cardigen and sweats for $3's.....who wears those in AZ? haha...
