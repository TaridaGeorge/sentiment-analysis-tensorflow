I seriously wonder if the negative reviews on here are people who are trying to steer would-be diners away from here so they can get in quicker. You can dislike the wait but you cannot deny the food. The pizza is perfect. Mozzerella made in-house is creamy with just the right amount of salt. The salads are unimaginably fresh. The spiedini appetizer which is Italian Fontina wrapped in Prosciutto over Arugula is quite possibly the best two bites of food possible. The wait is what it is. If you can't hang with a three hour wait then stay out of my way so I can get some....
