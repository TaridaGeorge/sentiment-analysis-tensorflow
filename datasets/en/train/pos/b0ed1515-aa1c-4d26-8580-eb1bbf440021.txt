No matter which one you go to, In n out is the best burger place on the planet (thus far).  The burgers and fries are made to order. And delicious.  I highly recommend the double double which has double meat and cheese.  The burgers are loaded with good veggies and sauce, the fries fresh and crsip, the shakes thick and creamy.  I recommend In n Out for anyone who likes to eat, likes burgers, and has hunger.
