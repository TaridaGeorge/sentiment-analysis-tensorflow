Not to be lame but this is a fun place to go, first time I went was on a First Friday. The place was packed, dj playing in a corner. It just reminds of a hipster bar in San Diego. The music is just right for me, the bartender women are hot : ) the women here are hot, but becareful of the damaged ones which will bring up a bar from 10 years ago lol
