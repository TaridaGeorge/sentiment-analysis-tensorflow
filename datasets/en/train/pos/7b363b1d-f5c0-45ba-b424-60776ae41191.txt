Einstein Bros at Rural and University has been so generous with the nonprofit organization I work. They've donated snacks for our volunteers for years, and each time they are so easy to work with and provide more than enough to keep our volunteers happy. 

When I stop in as a customer, the staff is consistently friendly and the food is consistently fresh and good. Mmm, I'm going to have to go get a pumpkin bagel with pumpkin schmear now...
