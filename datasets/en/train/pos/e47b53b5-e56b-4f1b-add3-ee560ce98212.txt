It is rare I give out five stars but when I do it is for very good reason.  Grinaldis is no exception here.  This must be the best pizza in town!  The atmosphere sends you back taking you away from the present.  The flavor of pizza in the air takes you back and right in front of you are traditional pizza makers and spinners.  The brick oven is right behind them a you watch the pies go for the best baking method around.  Don't waste your time thinking, this place is a no brainer!
