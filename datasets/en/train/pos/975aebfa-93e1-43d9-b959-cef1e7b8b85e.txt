I asked for stinky-sock cheese, and pow, did they deliver! The owner gleefully pulled several from a huge refrigerator case beautifully filled with hundreds of luscious cheeses, I was treated to several samples of some of the most delectable cheeses I've had this side of the Atlantic.  I returned home with a selection  of three cheeses wrapped in cheese paper (how often do you see that??).  What a treasure!
