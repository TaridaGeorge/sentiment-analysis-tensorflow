Excellent service, GREAT food!!!  Blows Olive Garden outta the water.  Breadsticks are better, salad is better, desert is better, and larger portion at similar, if not cheaper prices.  All this without the average Joe riff-raff.  Only con, tight confined dining area.  Good location in Tempe/Chandler though, but thats cuz i live 1 mile away   :)
