What a great lunch!  I had the pastrami sandwich on rye and it was HUGE and perfect--- I've had pastrami sandwiches all over the state and I think Scott's is my favorite, second is Carnegie in NY.  

I didn't order any sides but my lunch buddies did and the fries were good.  Fruit was so-so-- Scott's isn't really the fruit side kinda place.

Service was quick (which is great on a work day!), friendly and the place as busy but not overly crowded.   The deli cases looked really good on the way out too!
