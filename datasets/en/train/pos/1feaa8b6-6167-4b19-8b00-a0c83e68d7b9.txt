In town on business and stopped here for lunch based on prior Yelp reviews. Friendly service and a lightening-fast salad starter helped mollify my tummy when the lunch itself ran a tad slow. But BOY! This is one of the best Thai currys I have had ANYWHERE! I had a red curry/medium spicy chicken with pumpkin (seasonal) that was just the right spiciness and creaminess, without being starchy........you just wanted to keep eating after you were full.  I was truly bummed that I couldn't take the leftovers back to the hotel with me. Sigh.  Will come here again if I am back in the area.  Or just dream of that curry sauce......
