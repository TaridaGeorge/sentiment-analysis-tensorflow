Wright's appliance repair is very knowledgeable and efficient.  My dishwasher had been repaired by three different companies.  I was about to replace it, even though it was fairly new.  Wright's fixed it and gave me some advice for future maintenance.  It has been perfect since!  

Also Wright's is extremely professional.  No comparison to the other repair companies.

Thanks Wright's!
