Our favorite little go to spot.  My fianc√© and I usually go to Upper Crust at least one to two  times per week.  We now have our "own" booth and the waitress know us well. In other words, we are always made to feel special there.  We always get the Ceasar Salad and a large pizza with feta cheese on it...extra crispy please!  We thank you, Upper Crust for your existence and to the great wait staff!
