Lux serves the best espresso in Phoenix.  The service has always been good and they even have Pane Bianco (an amazing sandwich shop) next door if you are there around lunch time.

I recently moved back to Phoenix after spending a couple years in Oregon and going to Lux was one of the first things I wanted to do (in addition to getting some decent Mexican food).  I am looking forward to many more visits in the immediate future.
