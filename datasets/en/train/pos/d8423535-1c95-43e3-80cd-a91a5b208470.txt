Phoenix has no history, you say?  Please, hurry thee to Pueblo Grande for an explanation about our canal system and the historical significance of the Hohokam (fascinating story) as well as others who have since adapted to living in this desert.  In my opinion, no one tells the story better than Pueblo Grande, complete with the actual on-site ruins, and you're almost guaranteed to learn lots of neat stuff even if you already thought you knew everything.

We've gone a couple of times in the last month or so, once to wander through the museum and once for the native market.  Each was a blast, and the food at the native market was awesome!  Given the incredibly convenient location of Pueblo Grande, I hope we go back often.  I remember really liking this place as a kid -- I shouldn't have waited so long to go back.
