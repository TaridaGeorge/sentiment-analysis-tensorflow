In the mood for some funky mid century furniture to take the edge of your Ikea hangover? This is THE PLACE to come. The owners are as friendly as can be and they are really approachable if you aren't an expert in mid century furniture (like me!). There is also an amazing jewelry store within PMR just ask to see Heidi's works of art!
