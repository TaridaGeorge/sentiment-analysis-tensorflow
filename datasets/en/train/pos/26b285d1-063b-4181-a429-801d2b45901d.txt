Okay, I have only had boba in two places... here and at Republic Ramen but this place was far superior.

The boba is soft and the perfect texture.  The smoothies are yummy!  I liked every flavor I tried except the rainbow one... to sugary.. more for a little kid.  The almond milk tea was also really good.

This is now my new addiction.  Wish I had found this place years ago.
