Since discovering Liberty Market a couple of months ago, I'm pretty sure I've made a mortgage payment for Joe Johnston, the ever-present owner.

Breakfasts are great. I'm partial to the Western Scramble, but everything I've had has been very good, with large portions and served by attentive staff. They have some coffee drink, I can't ever remember the name, that comes in a shot glass and you have to stir it up. Delightful. Get two.

Lunches and dinners are also very good. The "bowl of meat" and the hamburgers are outstanding.

I've attended Liberty Market with just me and the bride, a small gathering of friends, as wall as with large groups and I've never been disappointed.
