This review is on the store side, not the restaurant side, of chakra four. 

I love coming here for their loose leaf teas because they have so many, probably over 100 and you can smell all the jars and open them all up to your hearts content. Every one of them which I have smelled and then purchsed, tasted exactly as it smelled when I got home and brewed it. They are not cheap, but what you get is a high quality product and the people who work here are very nice. 

They also offer many medicinal herbs and suppliments with creative and sometimes humorus names.
