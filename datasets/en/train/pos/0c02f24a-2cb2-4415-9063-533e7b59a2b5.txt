Went to a free teaser show today for First Friday, and loved it!  The girls were amazing!  We saw belly dancing, hula girls, singers, and a burlesque show!  The MC is Lucy Morals, who is also headmistress for the Wayward School for Girls, which is where most of the performs get there start.  (Or at least that was my impression!)  She was hilarious and very raunchy - just what you would expect!  I only wish that it had been a full show so we could have seen them really strip down, instead of just miming it!  I will deff be getting tickets to the real deal in the future!
