I just stopped in tonight after the gym, I was a bit stinky and what better way to fix that than 16 bars of soap.

It was late 8:15 when I walked in :15 before close. This is a great time to shop when you are in a rush. It was empty, and the lines were short.

Despite benign the end of a long day the low turnover staff was great and personally recognized me and greeted me.
