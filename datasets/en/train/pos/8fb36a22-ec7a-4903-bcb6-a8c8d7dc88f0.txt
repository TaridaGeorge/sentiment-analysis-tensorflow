Mike is very knowledgeable, worked quickly and efficiently and his prices are much more reasonable than any other electrician I've used.  He returned my phone call promptly the Friday night before Christmas (by which I was pleasantly surprised), came all the way to Glendale for a small job and only charged me half of his rate since it didn't take the full hour.  I am very pleased with his work and I will definitely hire him again.
