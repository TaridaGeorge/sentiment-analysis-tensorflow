Delux is a real boon to the Biltmore/Arcadia area and is probably one of the few good restaurants open in Phoenix until to 2 AM. The place does fill up fast, so I prefer to go there on off-hours, especially during the reverse happy hour. The bartenders are very friendly.

The burgers are large and tasty. The fries are some of the best I have ever had. The bar is well-stocked with a large variety of beers, wines, and spirits. I tried a hot dog at Delux once and thought it was good, but I suggest sticking with the burger and fries.
