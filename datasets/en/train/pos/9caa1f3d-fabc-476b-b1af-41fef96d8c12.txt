The food here is above all else CLEAN, FRESH, and HEALTHY.

The salads are big and full of fresh greens and lots of goodness, with unique tasty dressings to sample from. 

The Rumbi Burger is easily the cleanest tasting burger I have had from any restaurant. I would feed it to my mother!

I'm not a big fan of their teriyaki chicken, but the pulled pork with teriyaki sauce is a 100% home run. I like to order the Lauo Pork Plate.

The rice bowl comes with a ton of tasty vegetables and pork and rice.

The brown rice with teriyaki is great. 

The key lime pie tastes homemade and is 5 out of 5 stars, easily!

I don't get why this place isn't busier. It is a clean, tastefully decorated location with friendly staff. Methinks they need to do more marketing.
