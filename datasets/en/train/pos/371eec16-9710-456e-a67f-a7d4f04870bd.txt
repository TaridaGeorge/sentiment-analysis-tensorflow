If you appreciate middle-eastern food an/or persian food, you will "love" Pars.  

The owner is always in the back cooking up an amazing and consistently great tasting meal.

By far, they have the best hummus in town.  Pars puts Pita Jungle's hummus to shame.

All of their meat skewers are great but the mahi mahi is out of this world.  He also cooks amazing Zeresch Polo (rice with barberries) and everything is so flavorable.  

Although it's hidden in NE Scottsdale, it's well worth the drive and wait!
