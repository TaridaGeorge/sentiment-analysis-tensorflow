OMG...Best buffet in the valley hands down!!!  Beats any LV buffet including Bellagio etc.  Go for lunch...$13.95 is a bargain for this culinary destination.  I've been here twice and have been beyond impressed with the overall freshness, selection and presentation.  Some highlights:

- Salad bar - the "bomb" based on overall taste, selection and freshness as mentioned above...artichoke hearts, marinated olives, gourmet cheeses, many delicious prepared salads etc.

- Chinese - fresh, hot and delicious!   Scallop lomein, duck spring rolls, potstickers, and several other hot delicious looking entrees

- Brick Oven Pizza - Spinach, mushroom & artichokes....need I say more?

- Stuffed Eggplant - didn't even have room for this Italian masterpiece...bummer!

- Desserts - same as above....every imaginable flavor of gelato and so much more!

I cannot wait to go back here!!!!
