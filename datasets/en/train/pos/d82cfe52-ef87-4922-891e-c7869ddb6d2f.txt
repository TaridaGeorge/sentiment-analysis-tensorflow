Dan is a class act. He's helping me rehab the rotator cuff injury I sustained at orange theory fitness. My shoulder feels infinitely better after just two weeks of trigger point therapy. Seriously, I am functional again. Every workout is different, effective, and he is sociable, kind and a total professional. Did I mention I just broke through a major plateau with his help too? If you're injured (or even if not), Dan's the trainer you're looking for. He's worth every penny and more.
