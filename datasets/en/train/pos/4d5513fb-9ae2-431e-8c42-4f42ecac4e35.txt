Jackpot!  Pizza a Metro is that rare joint that gets the basics down right - great food at an excellent value, paired with a charming interior (albeit tiny) and an owner who understands service and customer loyalty. 

My only fear is that the place will change as more Phoenicians get wise to this gem.

Robert O. put it best, you'd have to be a stone cold douche to think that this place isn't [great].
