Being a family owned yoga studio makes the vibe relaxed and welcoming.  All the classes that I took where great.  Instructors were comfortable with teaching and were very knowledgeable in their craft.  The well thought out and artistic decoration set the tone for my yoga experience. I enjoyed the owners as well as the instructors and look forward to taking some more classes.
