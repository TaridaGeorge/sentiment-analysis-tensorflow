I've been receiving massages for 10 years -- as long as I've been running. I've never before been to a studio as peaceful, calming and healing as Space. John is truly a craftsman. He is interested in his client's needs, listens, is respectful and without sounding too dramatic -- a healer.
I keep telling friends he is magical; they look at me like I've lost my mind, until they too visit Space.
There is simply no better massage in Phoenix.
