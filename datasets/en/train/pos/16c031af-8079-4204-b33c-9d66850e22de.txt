Who knew there could be so many teas right here in town? I've been frequenting this place for a good year or so now, and I've never been disappointed. They are super friendly and always willing to help you find your next favorite tea. The staff here remembers your name and tea preference every time you walk in the door. The members points program is cool too, I've been saving them for a while now and can redeem them for a lot of brewing items in there, or even a bunch of my tea! Family owned and it shows!
