Im from the east coast and its great to have them here as well!! The italitan ice is of course fresh and I love all the selections and different ways to have it served to you. Samples are always availiable since their always having different flavors, yum! My absolute fav is Mango! But Honeydew, when in season is soo light and fresh!! Try a Gelati sometime too, its ice and custard together.
