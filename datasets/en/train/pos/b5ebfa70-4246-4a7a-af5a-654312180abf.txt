My boyfriend an I went to FnB almost a year and a half ago ( I know and its taken me this long to review!), but I can still remember the sights, aromas, and good company we enjoyed there. We were in Scottsdale for only five days, and we dined at FnB two of those five nights. The food is honest and simple yet amazingly delicious, we ordered just about everything on the menu between the two nights and were satisfied with all of the dishes. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations on wine. I highly recommend this restaurant.
