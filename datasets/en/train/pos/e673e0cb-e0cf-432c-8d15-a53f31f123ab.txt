Great job!

Okay not on the first time I stopped and had my Harley Truck worked upon, but this review is upon the awesome customer service and the making things right the second visit to your shop. I commend you on being truthful and forward about how it was a botched repair the first time. And that you were willing to correct the problem. I even followed up a couple weeks later with sandwiches/dinner for your staff as a thank you. Hope you enjoyed them, they were my favorite(s) from VTsandCo! I now recommend your service and we'll bring all our vehicles to your garage from now on, you won me over. Again Great Job. 5 stars
