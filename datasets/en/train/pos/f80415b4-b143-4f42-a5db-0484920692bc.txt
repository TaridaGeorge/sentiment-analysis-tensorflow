Excellent customer service. Hands down.

Rented brand new truck for local move. So friendly. Offered coupons with a promotion already. Gave us tips. Totally easy, would definitely rent here again. 

Cannot say enough nice things about them. As a matter of fact, due to their stellar price, I used Budget to move my stuff from uHaul directly next door.

Sweet.
