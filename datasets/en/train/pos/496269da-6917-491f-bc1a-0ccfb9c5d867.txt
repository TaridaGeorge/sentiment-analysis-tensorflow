Slightly obsessed with Trader Joes. Is it their atmosphere? Is it their economically friendly prices that compete with any other grocer in town? Could it be their friendly staff or their tastings? I am going to go with all of the above. Shop here. It's good for you health wise and body and mind wise. 

My only suggestion would be to have more samplings and food suggestions. I always seem to find a new organic treat when I shop there. 

If you are a peanut butter fan, try out "Better n' Butter" -- for two grams of fat you get the experience of peanut butter without the fat -- whether it's a "good" fat or not.
