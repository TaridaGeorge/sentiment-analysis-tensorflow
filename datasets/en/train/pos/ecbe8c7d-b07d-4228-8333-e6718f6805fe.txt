Wow, this is my 100th review!  And what a great place to get it!  There is a dog park area near the corner of College and Curry, with restrooms and park benches.  A really nice sized park with some mountain bike trails going through and some nice short hikes as well.  Great views of the city if you will climb up a hill and some small ponds you can fish in.  Theres so many great areas of this park, and they all have different character and atmosphere, you cant go wrong.
