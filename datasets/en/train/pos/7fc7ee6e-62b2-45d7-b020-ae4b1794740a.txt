What exactly is a noodles ranch? A ranch that wrangles noodles? If so, I want to live there. It always makes me giggle as I think of the Cuttin' Corral, where Napolean Dynamite gets his haircut. 

I also admit to knowing nothing about Vietnemese food before eating here, but I'm so glad to have discovered it!  So fresh, always consistently good. The menu is enormous, my favorites being the spring rolls in peanut sauce, the Bun bo xao which is beef stir fry in vermicelli noodles and the combination Pho soup. All the drinks are good, including the Jasmine iced tea, the Ginger limeade and the Vietnemese iced coffee.
Sadly, I agree the portions are rather small for my fat american ass...but that just means more room for dessert!!
