I absolutely love the homemade pasta here!  My boyfriend had the spicy seafood linguine and I had the pecorino  tagliatelle.  Both to left us with empty plates and the temptation to lick the rest of the sauce off the bowl with our tongues!  

I also had the garden mojito, which is probably one of the best mojitos I have ever had.  Not sweet at all, but very refreshing with fresh basil.

We waited for a while before anyone came to take our drink orders.  Not too long of a wait, longer than usual, but nothing we were complaining about.  At the end of our meal the server brought us a gift certificate for waiting so long.  I thought this was a great gesture, something I did not see a need for at all.

We will definitely be back for more!
