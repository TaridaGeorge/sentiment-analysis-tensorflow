My favourite thing is to walk into a restaurant with my child and have him be greated with smiles rather than dismay. Handing a child a kids menu and letting them pick their own meal like the little person they are and giving them something to entertain them until food arives. This is part of what has made a few visits to Chelsea's Kitchen a true joy for me. 

Staff has always been superb from greetings to goodbyes. 

Food is always amazing beyond words. I've tried the tri tip tacos and the green chile burger and the nachos and the mac'n'cheese. You know I can't go somewhere and not try the mac'n'cheese. Be prepared to eat people. The Food is worth the price. Great heaping portions. Don't be afraid to ask for a to-go box!
