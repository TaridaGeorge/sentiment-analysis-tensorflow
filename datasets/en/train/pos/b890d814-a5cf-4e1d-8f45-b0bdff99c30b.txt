Great trail for those that want a fairly easy hike. It's been pretty quiet every time I've gone which is nice. A few different paths with varying degrees of difficulty keep this trail feeling new to me when I go. Fun for a newbie like myself to see wildlife - nothing scary, just some lizards, rabbits & birds. 

Fabulous views when you get up high!
