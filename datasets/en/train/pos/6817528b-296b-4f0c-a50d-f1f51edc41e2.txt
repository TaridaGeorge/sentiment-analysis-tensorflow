Have always enjoyed going here. Been going here for a few years.

Went for a haircut today. Same great service. 

They get you in and out in a hurry but I've never had a bad haircut here.

Love the hot towel and shave of the nape of your neck at the end.

If you really want to pamper yourself sometime let them give you a straight razor shave. I've gotten them a few times and each time I've almost fallen asleep. Very relaxing.

And like previous reviewers have noticed they are foreign but I've never had any problems getting across what I want.

Highly recommended.
