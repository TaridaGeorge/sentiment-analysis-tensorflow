I am a huge fan of breweries that can match great beer to great food. There isn't one thing on the menu that they don't do well. And if for some reason you don't like what you got or think it came out wrong, they are quick to fix it and make you feel right for bringing it up. Great service, always. I go a lot so that is saying something. 

Favorite thing on the menu: Fries, Blue Cheese Burger, and Nachos. 

Kiltlifter is great. I get all warm and fuzzy just thinking about it.
