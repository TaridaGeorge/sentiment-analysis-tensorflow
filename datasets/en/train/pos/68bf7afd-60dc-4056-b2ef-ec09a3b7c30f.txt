Gods, I loves me some Four Peaks!

I've been there with huge crowds and small crowds, and the experience has always been fantastic. Sure it's busy. Sure it's loud. It's a craft-brew pub on CAMPUS! What do you expect?

The pretzels are amazing. The burgers are gourmet. And the beer... oh, the beer. Whatever is seasonal, get it. Then go for the Hop Knot if you're a hophead like me.

You'll enjoy.
