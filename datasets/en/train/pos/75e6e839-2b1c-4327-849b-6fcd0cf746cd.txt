I love Queen Creek, but our culinary scene here is just plain sad.  Luckily, the deli is a gleaming gem in the restaurant wasteland out here.  My husband and I go here regularly, and have NEVER been the least bit disapointed.  Their specials are always delicious (last night I had roast chicken, green chili and white cheddar polenta, and brandy butter apples with caramelized onions).  Their pizzas are great, with really yummy house-made mozzarella, and their sandwiches are giant and cheap ($9ish).  This is where we go at the end of our work week to unwind, and it always makes Fridays lovely. Also, the nut brown ale that they have is really good!
