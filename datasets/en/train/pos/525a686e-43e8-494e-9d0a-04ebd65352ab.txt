My life has always revolved around animals. As such, I obviously seek out the best veterinary care possible. After returning to the valley almost 4 years ago, I started my search for the right vet. After trying a handful of local vets, we tried GCAH in the hopes of saving our dying puppy from pneumonia. The care they have showed our puppy and cat have been astounding. My sister also takes her dog, and they have gone above and beyond to work on his behavioral issues when he comes in. I can not say enough about this amazing staff and vet! If you want a clinic that sincerely cares more about the animal's welfare over profit, this is just the place for you!
