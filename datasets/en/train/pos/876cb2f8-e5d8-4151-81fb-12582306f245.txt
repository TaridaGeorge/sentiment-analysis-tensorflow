Lolo's gets 5 stars for the waffles alone. The chicken is irrelevant to me. They could call it Lolo's Waffles & I'd be there all the time.

The sweet potatoes, and the corn on the weekends are great too. The chicken & eggs are also tasty, but merely an afterthought to those delicious waffles.

Lolo's is great at responding to their customers on Twitter, and service at this location has always been really friendly. Get there before 10AM on the weekends for a quick table.

They are not open past 3PM except on Fridays, which is a good thing, because if they were my ass would be twice as big.

I love you Lolo's, keep making those amazing waffles.
