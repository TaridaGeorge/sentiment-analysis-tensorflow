I love having QT so close to my home. I give them an automatic 5 star rating, only because I am hopelessly addicted to their Iced Tea. I only wish they had bigger cups to put it in.. 52 oz? NOT ENOUGH! :) I wish I could run a hose from their Iced Tea container, through the irrigation ditches in my neighborhood, straight to my home. :D
