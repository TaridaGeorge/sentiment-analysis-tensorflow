How does this NOT have a solid 5 stars?  Maybe because I have a certain love for little hole in the wall bars and awesome beer that others do not.

Came here for a second date, and it was a great night.  We didn't eat, although everything looked really yummy.  The beer selection couldn't be beat, and the prices were just right.  Awesome juke box and many televisions to watch whatever sporting event that might happen to be on.  The atmosphere is great and the staff are very attentive without being overbearing.  

I will definitely be frequenting this wonderful place!
