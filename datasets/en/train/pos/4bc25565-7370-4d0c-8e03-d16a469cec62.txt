Came here for cocktails when there was live country music on Sunday night. The resort is really breathtaking with swimming pools that seemed to go on for miles.

In 4 days visiting Scottsdale everywhere I went had terrible drinks either too strong or just plain bad. It became the joke of the weekend, that there must be at least one good bartender in Arizona... The one and only good cocktail I had was a mojito here at Hyatt. Excuse me GREAT cocktail. THANK YOU!
