I came to this office before reading any reviews or researching it. I really lucked out with my experience! Upon arrival, Aimee gave me a full tour of the office. As small as that may sound, it made me feel like a valued patient already! It was very thoughtful of her to not whisk me into some room, but rather show me which rooms were for what purposes. After that, she went over a full review of injuries, pains and problems I have been having. I then met with Dr. Scharf, and he was so nice! Very easy-going and friendly! And he genuinely seems to love what he does! I plan to keep returning for treatments!
