I do love this store for its community spirit.  I've been to a couple of social events where two-leggeds were allowed to attend with their furry owners and everyone was very well-behaved.  At the ice cream social they even had treats for the humans so they wouldn't keep begging for the tail wagging sweet potato ice cream,,,begging in public can be so annoying!

The owners also do a lot of animal rescue support, including offering cat food from bags inadvertently ripped during shipping to neighbors caring for feral communities.

Just a great all-around store where everyone of every species feels immediately welcome.
