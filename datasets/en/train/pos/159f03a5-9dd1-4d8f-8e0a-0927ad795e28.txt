A little slice of the Pacific Rim, caught under the broiling heat of the Arizona sun.

It's exactly as Island should be: Fast, fatty, surrounded by rice, and served in a styrofoam container with a side of macaroni salad.  This is food that you should be eating on a beach after spending a morning playing in the ocean.  I had to settle on eating it on my patio after working in my garden but the food tasted just as good.

I rated it 5 stars, this is definitely food that deserves to be eaten.  But make no bones about it, if you hate island food, food from Korea, or macaroni salad.... this probably isn't going to change your mind.  It's comfort food for people who think flip-flops should be year round footwear.
