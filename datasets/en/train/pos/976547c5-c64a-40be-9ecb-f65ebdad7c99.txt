How does In N Out do it?  The consistency is amazing.  The service is impeccable.  Do these happy boppy teens really love their jobs?  Does upper management   inject them with happiness cola on their breaks?  I don't get it.  But this is what I like best about In N Out, the service!  The delish burger sure makes it a great trip too.  Going to In N Out is a "trip", it's always busy, so it's not like a quickie run for a burger and fry.  

The Fries-- not sure that I like them, I always order them simply b/c everything is so cheap- but I also always eat them.  I think I just like watching the happy staff cut them up.
