I love this Safeway, the air conditioning always feel great and the starbucks is right in the front and the deli has the best items...i always get Pesto pasta, brocc salad, a chicken...its just easy and breezy to get your stuff and get out. They dont have self cheker though? I have been going there for weeks and just now realized when i was in a freekin hurry and the place was packed....i sure hope they get that soon
