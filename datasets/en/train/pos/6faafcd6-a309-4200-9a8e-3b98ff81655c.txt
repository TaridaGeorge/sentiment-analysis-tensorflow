We take our daughter here and love love the staff.  We usually see the PA Eryn (sp?) and she is great with our kiddo.  The MAs are also great there.  I can call and ask a question about something regarding our daughter and get a prompt response if not then and there when i call.  As a first time parent, that is quite a blessing!

So it is a little strange that old people and younglings go to the same office but if you can get past that, it's totally worth going, especially if you live in the area.  The staff is great and so is our daughter's board certified pediatrician, Dr. Johnson.  They are not particularly pushy about one opinion or another which I feel like is a good thing.
