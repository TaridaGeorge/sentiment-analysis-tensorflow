Now I know why it's always crowded! They're pretty awesome :)
I finally stopped in after a Coyotes game at Jobbing.com Arena for appetizers and drinks. We had the following:

guacamole & chips (I am super picky about my guac & this was DELIC)
ham & pineapple pizza (LOVE the crust!)
Woodchuck Amber Cider
woodchuck granny smith cider

BTW: there are lots of TV's & on game nights (football especially) the crowd really gets into it, which I think makes it fun, lol, BUT if you are looking for romantic you might want to go to a place with less tv's,,,,, or none ;)
