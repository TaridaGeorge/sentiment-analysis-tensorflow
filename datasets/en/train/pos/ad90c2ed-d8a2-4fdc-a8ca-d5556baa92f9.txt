When work is looking like a crap day, all I need is a sandwich from here, or a salad to put me back in a good mood.   The greek salad with chicken to be exact.

Subs sandwiches are served toasted on really good bread rolls.  The tuna is one of my favs.

There isn't a lot of seating but enough. It can get busy around lunch time so I always recommend going for a late lunch--- around 1/1:30pm.
