I love this Mall, but my bank account struggles with my relationship here. Any store you could possible want is located here along with many delicious restaurants and of course a movie theater. This mall is always clean, from the bathrooms, to food court, to the random chairs located throughout the mall, zero stains or rips on the fabric. Its a rather large mall so its easy to spend time there. There are multiple parking garages and a valet service where you can get your car washed and detailed while you shop. Its the epitome of Scottsdale.
