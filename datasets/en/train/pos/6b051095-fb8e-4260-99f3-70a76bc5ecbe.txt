WOW!  Wildflower Bread Company is as good as it gets indeed!!!  After I wrote my review, I got an email from the founder, Louis, who was very concerned about my review and he indicated that a remedy would be in place to correct the issue.  This is what is called, good Customer Service!!!  Along with this, came a refund in the mail for the meal ordered and a gift card to give Wildflower another chance.  I haven't had the opportunity to return to Wildflower as yet and will make my way there one of these days and see how much improved the service is.  Thank you Mr. Basile for taking the time to read and listen to my review.  You are a person of good character and value what consumers have to say about your business...  Best.
