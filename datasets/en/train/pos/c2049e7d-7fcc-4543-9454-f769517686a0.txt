I was meeting a friend to get Gelato and instead I wanted a latte to check this place out. They have great lattes! The coffee wasn't bitter and very smooth. The place is a smaller intimate place, but I do enjoy the outdoor seating! Make sure you have cash because they do charge .25$ for CC's. I'll be coming back for sure!
