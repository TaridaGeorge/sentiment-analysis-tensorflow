Fresh fruit, delicious yogurt and cookie dough. That's right, COOKIE DOUGH! All of this and it won't do too much damage to the ol' waistline. Well, besides the pound of cookie dough I fit into my cup.

If you haven't been to Yogurtland, you must go right now. What are you reading this review for and go NOW! There are at least ten different flavors and about 50 topping choices. The best part is the price, which ends up being by the ounce (34 cents last time I went), so it's a decent price for a healthy lunch or a trashy dessert. 

I ate here for lunch three days in a row and I usually can't go a lunch without some sort of meat product. That should tell you something. It's delicious, self-serve and customizable. Go there now!
