Hands down one of the best libraries I've ever been to. 

The parking lot is large so you can always get in and out fast. The entire place is immaculate and well kept. The workers are extremely helpful and cheery. The view from the elevators is CRAZY AWESOME. What I found when I went was that the reading room is the largest in north america and the library was built 13 years ago. This place is pretty advanced for being over a decade old.

Getting a library card has never been easier and I will definitely go back to read, write, or people watch. Kudos to Phoenix for a kickass library.
