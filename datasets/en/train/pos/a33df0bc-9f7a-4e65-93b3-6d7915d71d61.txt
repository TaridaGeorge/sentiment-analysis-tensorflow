Been to this Mastros several times now and am consistently satisfied witht he food, drinks and experience overall.  Steaks done perfectly, sides huge but still well-prepared, and drinks perfectly made.  We are never rushed to order or throught he courses and can thoroughly enjoy the evening there.  On this occasion we were celebrating my birthday and our anniversary.  The restaurant comped us a ginormous dessert - flourless chocolate cake (heavenly), chocolate covered strawberries (ripe, not green like you get at other places) and mountains of house made whipped cream.  Amazing!  Between the dinner and dessert we had 6 boxes of leftovers!  The consistent quality and service make Mastros my continued favorite.
