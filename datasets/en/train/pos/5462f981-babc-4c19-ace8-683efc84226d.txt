From the giant red door to the affordable food, what's not to like? It is not the best Mexican food ever by any means, but it is solid. I've been here many times, and it's always been consistent. It's also easy on the wallet. I came here after my ASU graduation with some family and friends, and the bill was about $80, even with two pitchers.
And how can you turn down a PENNY beer at lunch?
