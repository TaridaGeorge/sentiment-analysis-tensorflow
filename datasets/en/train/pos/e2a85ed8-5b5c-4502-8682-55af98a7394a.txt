I grew up in San Antonio and we often drove up the I-10 toward Boerne for their brisket.  Okay, maybe compared to the original location and compared to some  joints in the Hill Country, this place rates four stars, but it is certainly the best BBQ in Arizona.

I know that there are regional disputes and tastes about BBQ and that there are rib and sausage and pork people from Up North.....and DAMMIT, it is the rub NOT the sauce!  If you want Hill Country, South Texas beef brisket, Rudy's is the place and at reasonable prices.  They serve Shiner's!   They make the other stuff too but BBQ really should be brisket and all else is novelty, bar-B-Q flavored food.

It is on Chandler Blvd, just East of the I-10 and worth the drive.  Pity the chump that opened his BBQ place next door, just weeks after Rudy's opened.
