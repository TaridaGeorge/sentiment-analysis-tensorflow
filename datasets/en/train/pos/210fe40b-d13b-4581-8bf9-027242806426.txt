After moving to Phoenix from Honolulu, my wife and I thought we would never find a good Korean place like they have "back home." Luckily, we found this Takamatsu and have been back dozens of times over the years. The portions are reasonably large and the side items are plentiful and delicious.  We always opt to cook table side at dinner time - it's a fun experience, which our kids also look forward to. At lunch, I usually order the regular Bibim Bap or the seafood Bibim Bap which is served in a hot stone bowl - where else are you going to get something like that? As far as "atmosphere" is concerned - well, there really is none. But, there is definitely no better Korean food in Phoenix.
