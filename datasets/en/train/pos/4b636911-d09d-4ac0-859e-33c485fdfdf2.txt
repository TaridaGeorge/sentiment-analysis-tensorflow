AMAZING

This past December i visited Tempe - my first trip to Arizona in about 3 years. Why wasn't Green open when i lived there? 

I'm so happy that people living in this area have yummy, delicious, affordable, exciting vegetarian/vegan options. Service was friendly, helpful, and fast. Food was delightful. I loved the rack of packaged vegan items (i.e., Dandies, Newman-O's and other hard-to-finds) available for sale.  We had two non-veg-heads in the group and they loved it.

Green is a lovely little gem.
