My husband and I hosted our wedding at the Sanctuary last weekend and everything was flawless.  Lauren Wickham, our catering manager, was top notch.  Before I could ask for something, it was already delivered or handled.  The staff at the facility, down to the talented mixologists in Jade Bar, could not do enough for us - our guests were blown away.  Thanks to all of you for the most memorable weekend - we will be back!
