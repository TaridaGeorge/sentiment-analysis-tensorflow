I loved this place.  I was a little hesitant about the concept, but I had a great time. My mom and older daughter were visiting from out of town.  My mom usually doesn't have dinner out because she eats so little. So when my daughter was visiting from LA we told her we were going there and that she didn't need to eat all, just whatever she wanted.  Well, let me tell you, grandma ate everything that was put in front of her,  even had the frog legs Chris served us as our starter. My daughter works production on TV in LA and she commented to Chris that he should be on Top Chef.  Can't wait to be back for another experience.
