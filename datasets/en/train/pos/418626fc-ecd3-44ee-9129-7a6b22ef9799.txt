My husband got us a "package deal" for a date night. It came with a photo w/ frame of us, 12 roses, and a private booth. It was the first time either of us had been there and I loved it. The food was good. The drinks were great. And the experience was awesome. It was a bit pricey but for everything we got it was worth it.
