If you are looking a flavor explosion in your mouth.  Open wide here comes Cheescake Factory. Everything I have tried here is really good.  The tiramisu cheesecake is the best I have ever had.  Even if you do not like cheesecake you will love the tiramisu. The standouts for the appetizers are the buffalo blasts.  They are like shredded chicken deep fried with cheese around it dipped in buffalo sauce. Oh it's so so good. I also like the factory burger for my main dish. It's a hamburger in sour dough bread with onions with fries. Trust me it's really good. My wife and I always go on eachothers birthdays so the workers can sing to us. Great food, service and setting.  I love this place.
