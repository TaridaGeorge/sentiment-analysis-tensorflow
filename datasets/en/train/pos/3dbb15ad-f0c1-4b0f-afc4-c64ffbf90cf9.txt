Amazing!!! 
Never been to Scottsdale! First night here, friend took me to this place! Soon as I sat down and started eating, I said to her, 'how are you going to top this the rest of my days here?!' 
Pork belly dish was phenomenal!!! and no joke, the brussels sprouts!! Omg! I hate eating Brussels sprouts in general and I am so coming back for that @ Roka! 
I would just fly back here from Cali just for this place!!
