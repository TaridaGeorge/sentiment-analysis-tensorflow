On our recent visit to Phoenix for spring training, we picked this restaurant based on yelp reviews. I'm soo happy the reviews were spot-on! 

I absolutely loved this place!  Every dish we had was AMAZING! 

Our top 2 favorites were:
- grapefruit and hamachi ($14)
- seabass and mushroom dish ($14) 

We got to sit in the backroom with a coffee table and a couch, which was different from the rest of the restaurant. The ambiance is cozy yet romantic and the service was good too.

If I'm in Phoenix again I'm definitely going back!
