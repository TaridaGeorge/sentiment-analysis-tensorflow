Del Frisco's Grille is the latest upscale restaurant  in the Camelback Corridor in Phoenix, & its a  hit! Located just steps away from the MercBar, the AMC movie theater, and the Arizona Biltmore and the Ritz Carlton tower this is a great place to start a fun evening.

Combining a comfortable yet hip atmosphere with a exciting savory menu, and crafted cocktails, it's a great place to take a romantic date, or to catch up with friends. The bar, upstairs, has breathtaking views of Squaw Peak and the Arizona sunset.
