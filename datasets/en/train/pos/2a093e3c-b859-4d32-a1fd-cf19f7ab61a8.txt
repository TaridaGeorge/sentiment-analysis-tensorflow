If you are looking for a Thai place in the Phoenix metro area, you've found it. When I first moved to Phoenix, I discovered the Swaddee Thai location in Chandler. A few years later, I moved to N Phoenix, and I was thankful to find that there was another Swaddee Thai close to me!

My favorite things on the menu are tofu coconut princess and Tom Ka, a coconut milk / mushroom soup. I love the amount of vegetarian options; you even get a choice of soft or fried tofu!

The service here is fast, the food is fantastic, and this is a great place to seek out for a delicious lunch or dinner.
