This place is great for a variety of reasons. Whether you are coming here to jump on the treadmill, play some ball, or hit the weights, its always an enjoyment.

There's nearly NEVER a wait for any equipment and its constantly cleaned by the staff.  If you are a regular, the trainers know you and will chit chat about this or that if you engage. Its pretty much "Gawker" free for all you self conscious ladies, and the classes hold a LOT of people. a LOT is stressed!

Check it out and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised. You'll probably see me there if you do!!!
