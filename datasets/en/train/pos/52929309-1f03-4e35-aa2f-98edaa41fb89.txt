I'm always up for going to AZ88!!

This place has been around forever, but I love it every time I come.  I always order some type of chicken dish, and lately it's been the AZ88 chicken.  I love the spicy chicken with the celery with the mayo sauce!  Yummy!  Their strawberry shortcake dessert is also delicious!

My favorite drink there is called "Celebration Champagne".  So good!!  It comes with some type of pop-rocks kind of candy that gets sprinkled in by the waiter when he delivers the drink and it fizzes up.  Love it!
