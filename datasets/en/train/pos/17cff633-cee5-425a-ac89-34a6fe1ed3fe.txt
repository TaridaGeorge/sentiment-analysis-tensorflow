I really enjoy this place, and for a few reasons. 1) A great Happy Hour, and 2) some really good fusion food.

They have a huge bar, a huge area for seating, and a decent size sushi bar.  I've eaten at all three areas and the service has been consistent.  There are a lot of standouts on the menu so you can get whatever you like and expect good food.  I've had excellent sushi and a noodle/beef stir fry that was out of this world.

This is not fine dining but I'd go here again in a minute.  The decor is nuevo Japanese (if there is such a thing).  The hostesses and the waitresses are smoking hot.  I woulda loved to have them feed me the food, nothing like being pampered (damn, time to wake up).
