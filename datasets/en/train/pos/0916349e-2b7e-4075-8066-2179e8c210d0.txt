Poverty Pets is truly an amazing organization that we recently adopted our dog from.  The story behind our pup was so sad, this little baby was found alone, dehydrated and sick on the street so they grabbed him, immediately took him to the vet to get treatment and fostered him until we were lucky enough to run across his precious face! The previous post from Lisa F. pretty much covers what PP is all about, we would absolutely recommend them to anyone looking to adopt!
