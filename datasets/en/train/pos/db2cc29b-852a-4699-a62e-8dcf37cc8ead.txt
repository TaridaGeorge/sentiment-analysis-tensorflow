Beautiful facility.

Clean, comfortable, well maintained.

Suite rooms are very nice. Quiet. Beds are very comfortable.

Both room areas (North and South wing) have their own pool/hot tub.

Then there's the water park area with pool, lazy river, water slide, bar, patio lounge chairs, kids' activities. Very nice!

We found service to be excellent.

While we didn't order from the room service menu, I was surprised how reasonable it was.
