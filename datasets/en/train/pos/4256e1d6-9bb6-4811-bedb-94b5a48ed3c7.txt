House of Tricks, my ray of sunshine! The food defies description, it is always, always delicious. The wine list is exceptional as is the beer list. In fact, HOT  - now apropo it that? - takes a great deal of pride in its' bar and it is where you can find me on a Friday or Saturday afternoon at HOT's happy hour, having a lovely glass of wine, enjoying a taste of a martini - the bartenders are generous and sharing  an appetizer or two. HOT is a great afternoon spot.
