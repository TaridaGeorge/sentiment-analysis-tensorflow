This little gem just opened yesterday and I'm already in love! I followed their ebay store like a wild woman and am so glad I have a home base to fall back on. Their prices are fair, the owners (Ben and Cory) are ridiculously sweet and genuine and their men's selection rocks. I walked away with five 1970's tees, a blouse, a dress, and a skirt for $150. 

They'll soon have a sell-and-trade policy, as well. They'll give Buffalo Exchange a run for their money. Check this out, it's a perfect location for Tempe college students and remember, when they can sell their dresses on ebay for $100-250, you'll be glad you can snag them for $20-35. Get it!
