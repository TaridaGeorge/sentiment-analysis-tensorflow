I used to eat at the location in Leon Springs outside of San Antonio when I traveled for business.  I would return home to AZ and complain to my wife about how no one in the valley can even come close to what Rudy's does.

Well we finally have our own Rudy's.  I showed up on opening day and am happy to report that the brisket is as delicious as I remember it.  Great smoke flavor.  Jalapeno sausage and turkey are favorites too.  Lastly, the creamed corn is excellent - never had any this good anywhere.     

This will be the only place I go for BBQ in the valley - glad it is close.

Consider calling ahead and placing your order.  It is very busy.
