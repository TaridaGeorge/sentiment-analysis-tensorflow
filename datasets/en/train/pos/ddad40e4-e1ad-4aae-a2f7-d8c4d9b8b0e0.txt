I am so mad I just found out about this place - I heard from the lips of Henry Schulman this was a great breakfast joint, and boy he knew what he was talking about! 
Everything brought to the table was delicious - eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast, pancakes - I tried it all. 
And they have BOOZE! If you have been to spring training, you KNOW booze is an important part of breakfast, you know, to loosen up the shakes from the night before. The bloody Mary with a shot of Vodka just might have saved my dad's life!
But all kidding aside, excellent breakfast, a place to sit outside and enjoy the warm mornings, and booze - terrific breakfast place, blows the Daily Dose out of the water !
