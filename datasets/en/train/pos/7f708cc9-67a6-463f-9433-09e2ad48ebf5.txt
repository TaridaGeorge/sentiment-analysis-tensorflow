When I hand out a 5 star review, it pretty much needs to be at the top of my list in that dining category. Chris Bianco earns this! It's really hard to explain why anyone would wait 5 hours for a Pizza. All I can say is try it out on a night where you have nothing to do but drink wine with your family and friends, let your anticipation build for several hours, and judge for yourself. There's a reason The Wall Street Journal heralded this as the best Pizza joint in The WORLD.
