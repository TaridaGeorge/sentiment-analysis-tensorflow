One of my rentals didn't have heat, I called Norris Air and asked them to call ahead because I live a little far away from there. They did: that really save me a lot of time.

Technician arrived on time. He checked and found out there was no power because the jump switch jumped for some reasons.

He spent about 30 minutes to make sure the air conditioner had no other problems.

I appreciate his effort to double check if the air conditioner is in good shape, not just turn the jump switch and leave.

This is so far the best company I have hired, if there's any problems in the future, I will give them a call instead of calling around and get ripped off.
