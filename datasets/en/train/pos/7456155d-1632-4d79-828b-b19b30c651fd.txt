there is only 2-4 spots that i make sure each out of town visitor gets to try as local fare - LGO, Breakfast Club, The Grind, and Four Peaks. This place is by bar the most frequented establishment i visit in the valley. i never wait long despite there always being a line. 

I've tried 8-9 menu items and have only been disappointed in 1 (a daily special of bratwurst hoagies) but that was my fault. By the time i had been served the heavy/fatty menu item, i had already indulged in 1/2 plate of fries and some artichoke dip. 

I'm not a beer fan but crave their beer. Best french fries in town. I crave their nachos with blackened chicken and their white pizza. And with their uh-mazing outdoor patio and the sunshines and weather that we get 6mths a year...Boom.
