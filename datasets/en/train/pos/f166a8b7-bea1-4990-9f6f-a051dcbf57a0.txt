I forget who told me about this place but thank God for them!

I have never had a bad meal here. My fave sandwich is the sausage w/ peppers and onions. Oh so good. And I love that they have Dr. Brown's soda. The line is usually all the way back to the door, but it's so worth it.

I love that the tables are set among the groceries. Ive never had need to go there for anything but lunch, but I like that while waiting in line you can peruse their grocery/deli selections.

2 words: go here!
