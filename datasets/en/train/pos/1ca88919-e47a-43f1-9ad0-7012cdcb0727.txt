closed!!!!!!

EDIT: 20100716: Wait a minute. This place is still open! I think they must have closed for some renovations - went there today and it's definitely open for business with buffet and everything. Didn't look like it was renovated either. Please ignore my previous indication of it being closed. Still one of the better buffet on the west side, too. Looks like they got a new website..
