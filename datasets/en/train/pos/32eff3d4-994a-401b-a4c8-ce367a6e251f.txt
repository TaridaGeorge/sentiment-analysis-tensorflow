Oh Big Lots, you loveable junk store.  We all know why we go there; some off-brand cleaning products, lawn gnomes, a poly-blend tablecloth you will only use once or twice....

So why write a review about Big Lots.  Because Big Lots usually looks & smells  like monkeys got loose in the store.  

Not this store.  This one is new, and rather nice.  Things in their place, and still the good pricing.  You never know what you are going to get in a Big Lots, but this one was a pleasant surprise.  I will drive out of my way to go to this store.  I hope they keep it nice.  I never know when I may need some fabuloso or some other random stuff.
