I can't go to this market every week, but every other time I go, I always end up having fun. Vegetables might not be as cheap as your favorite chain store, but the idea they came from a closer distance and the variety they have tempts you to fill your reusable bag. My other favorite place to visit here? THE TAMALE SHOP!!! theirs is the best I've had so far in Arizona.
