I ate here for the first time this morning as an Arizona tourist.  I got the vegetarian burrito with avocado and put a little sriracha sauce on it.  It was fantastic!  I went in really wanting just some scrambled eggs or an omelet, which wasn't exactly what they offered, so i got this instead.  I am quite picky and not an easy mind changer, but I'd like to go back tomorrow to get the exact same thing.  I wish this existed closer to where I live (Colorado).  It was a little loud in the store itself, but its because it was a weekend morning during breakfast hours.  I'd recommend this place highly!  The also had free additions to coffee such as soy milk and flavors, which is a greatly appreciated touch.
