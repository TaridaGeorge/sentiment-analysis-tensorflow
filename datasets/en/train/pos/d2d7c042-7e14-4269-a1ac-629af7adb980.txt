After frequenting countless VS stores over the years, in numerous states, and having been in the fashion & beauty industry for over a decade, I am happy to report that this VS store went above and beyond and met my needs--total client satisfaction. The staff was attentive, yet not overbearing, and more than knowledgable about their product--an obvious result of strong management training.

The store was impeccable, product replenishment was plentiful, and I easily found what I needed. The dressing rooms are beautiful ( love the mirrors!) and the cashwrap experience was efficient as well.

Of all the VS stores in the valley, this is the one I will be returning to. Though it may not have the wider array of selections like Arrowhead or Fashion Square does, the cleanliness, client service, and efficiency wins my loyalty.
