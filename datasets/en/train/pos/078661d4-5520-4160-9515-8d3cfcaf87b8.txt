I have been here twice in the last week and loved it! The place is now called, The Burger Shack. On my first visit I had a hot dog covered in bacon, shredded cheese, guacamole, and mustard....it was perfect. 

Next visit I had their BBQ Bacon Burger...the burgers here are cooked on the grill, with real fire...amazing burger. 

They are serving a small selection of breakfast items all day, hot dogs, burgers, and some sandwiches. The owners here are nice and friendly and go out of their way to give great customer service...and the place was VERY clean on both visits.
