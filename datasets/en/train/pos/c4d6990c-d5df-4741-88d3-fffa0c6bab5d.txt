I have been here 4 times and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a cheap pedicure.  I would probably do 4 1/2 stars if I could but since I can't 5 stars it is!  The place is clean, the designs are cute and the ladies are very friendly.  Make sure you bring cash since they charge $2 for debit/credit card purchases.
