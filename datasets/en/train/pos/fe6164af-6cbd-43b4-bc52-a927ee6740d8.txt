This review is really for the Home Depot online experience. I needed a new clothes dryer and found a good one at the Home Depot location but when I checked online I found a better one for less money. The ordering process was very straightforward, easy, and quick. 

They just delivered the dryer this morning and they showed up on time and literally within 15-minutes it was set up, working and they took my old dryer away. Oh by the way, there was no charge for delivery and taking the only one away!
