My favorite restaraunt in Scottsdale. The lamb burger, pastrami and chopped salad were delicious. Great selection of drinks but the real find is the bar upstairs. I'd suggest to go here for dinner and then drinks upstairs. 

This is a great place for a date or to celebrate a special occasion with friends.
