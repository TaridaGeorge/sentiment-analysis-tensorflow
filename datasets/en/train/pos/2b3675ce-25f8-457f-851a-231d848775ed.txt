If you're tired of canned soda that have more salt than REAL sugar, you should definitely take a little field trip to Pop the Soda Shop. They have any and all kinds of soda. My personal favorite is Birch Beer, of which they easily have 10+ varieties. They have anything you could imagine, and you can make your own 6 packs. They also have most of their sodas chilling in cases in the back so you can drink one on your way out! Amazing place.
