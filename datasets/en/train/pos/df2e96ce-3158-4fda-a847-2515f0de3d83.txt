This place is phenomenal. Even if you're not a vegetarian, the food is fantastic. Today, I had watermelon gazpacho and the cowgirl wrap, both were amazing. I ordered the allergy fighting tea off the menu, which had TONS of different teas, for all different kinds of things. The service was excellent, and afterward, I was able to buy some tea in bulk and it was very reasonably priced. I definitely recommend visiting this place. If I lived in Phoenix, I would totally make this a regular stop.
