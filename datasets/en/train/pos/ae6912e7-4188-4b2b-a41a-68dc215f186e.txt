We tried a new dish on our Sunday ritual. It was the Caramel Chicken, as they said in the ad.
"Subtle sweetness of caramel with a hint of chile and fresh pineapple. The dish is topped with a fresh Asian slaw of cucumber, red bell pepper, carrots, red onion and Fresno chile peppers marinated in black pepper Asian vinaigrette." 

It was good!
