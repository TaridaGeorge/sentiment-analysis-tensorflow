I've been coming to this place for the last 5 years, the staff is always friendly and this place is really clean. The barbers are very professional and well trained. This isn't one of those gay salon's that will massage your head while giving you a reach around, this is a real mans salon. 

If you just want to get a fucking haircut with no lame gimmicks, then this is the place for you!
