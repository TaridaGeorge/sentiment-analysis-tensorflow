This is my favorite grocery store by far. I drive out of my way to shop here when there is an Albertson's (blech) right down the street from my house.

Luckily this store is just a little bit out of the way when I'm on my way home from work so I make it my go-to store. 

They have a great selection and pretty good prices if you pay attention to the sales. 

Best of all, even when it's busy the cashiers are fast and efficient.
