If you live anywhere in the greater Phoenix area and have not been to Pita Jungle you are missing out. By far the best Greek food around! The falafel pita, glazed chicken pizza, and the medchilada (combination of a chicken burrito and enchilada Greek style -- not on the menu anymore but if you ask they will make it) are some of my favorites, but really anything you get is good. Oh and the tzatziki (cucumber yogurt dip), it's so amazing... just go to Pita Jungle, that's my review.
