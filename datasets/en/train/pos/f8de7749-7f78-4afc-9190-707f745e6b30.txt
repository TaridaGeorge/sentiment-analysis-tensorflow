Local bars.. this is my favorite.
We made a song about it. "we prankin prankin prankin".
There is a little arm movement that goes with it - untranslatable by the written word.

Is it bad I am giving this place 5 stars mainly because i can ride my bike there?  

trivia is fun. food never disappoints. blue moon pitchers. yay. happy hour prices are lovely.  the jukebox is usually ours.  I also love how the name of the place have become a verb in our everyday vernacular:
"well we were prankin thursday night and..."
or just a simple text: "wanna prank?"

they have stand up comedy on tuesday nights. 

yes. this has been the spring/summer of my now favorite strip mall bar.
i will love that place forever.
