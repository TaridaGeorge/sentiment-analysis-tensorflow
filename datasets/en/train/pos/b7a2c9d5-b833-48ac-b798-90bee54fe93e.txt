I am so grateful to Scott and the crew at Whitey's. It has taken me almost 4 years to find a trust worthy auto shop in Arizona and I am so glad to have found Whitey's. Scott helped me in a huge way and has made me a life long customer. And the mechanic who worked on my car was great, he came in and told me exactly what he did and what work I may need in the future. I can tell that they were honest and not trying to rip me off by suggesting unnecessary work, which I have found to be a rare quality among other auto shops I have been to. I will recommend this place to everyone I know!
