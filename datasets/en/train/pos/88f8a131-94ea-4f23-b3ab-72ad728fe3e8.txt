There is little that I don't love about this place. They have an amazing outdoor market on Wednesday and Saturdays. The ingredient for lunches, coffee, wine, etc.. are locally sourced and fresh. The entire place is run as a not-for-profit to bring wholesome food to people who might not otherwise have access. Do go visit. It's good and it's good for the community.
