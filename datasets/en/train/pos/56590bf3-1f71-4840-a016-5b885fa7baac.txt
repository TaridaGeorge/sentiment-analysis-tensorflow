Played it for a tournament and the enviroment was great! Played the Cat Tail course and had a blast. Conditions were great and staff was accomodating and nice. Received a "free play " voucher for the casino and ended up with 40 dollars more so all in all it was great day! Will return soon to play devils claw!
