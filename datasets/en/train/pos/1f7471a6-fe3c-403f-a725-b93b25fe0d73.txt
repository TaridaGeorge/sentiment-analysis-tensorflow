Serious. Check this place out.  Went there today, it is worth looking into.  Super fab merch, great service, and super-cool environment.  Do not miss this place.  To start, I actually saw things in there that I haven't seen anywhere else.  When I need to find that unusual gift for someone, I'll go to Frances first.  I bought a scented candle today that is off the hook.  (yes, I'm gay. really gay.)

I can't say more.  Go to Frances, check it out.
