I stayed at the Firesky Resort and Spa for a conference and although I was there on business I felt like I was there on vacation.  The location is great, the pools and grounds are beautiful and it's really close to downtown and shopping.  I also went to the spa and had a great salt treatment.  The thing that stood out the most was the staff, they were so friendly and helpful, I couldn't have asked for more.  Highly recommend this place.
