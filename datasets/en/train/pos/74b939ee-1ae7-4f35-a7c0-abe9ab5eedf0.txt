If there was a choice to put 10 stars, id so rate it a perfect 10!!!! Loved the food, everything was as fresh as it gets, service was awesome, by far the best place we've dined at in arizona, the setting is lovely!!! Everything was perfect, eventhough its pricey, but definitely worth every penny!!!!
