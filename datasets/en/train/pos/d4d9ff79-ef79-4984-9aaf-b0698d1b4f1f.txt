Fresh Mint rocks! Delicious food, a large variety of items on the menu, and it's all vegan except for the last entrée on the menu (#31 or #32 ?), which has egg noodles.

Their mock chicken is awesome! The perfect texture and chewiness. 

Their main course entrées are pretty large, so it's easy to split a meal with someone else.

Looking forward to going back to try some more items on the menu!
