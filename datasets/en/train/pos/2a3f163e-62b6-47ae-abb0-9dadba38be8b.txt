I love this place... Their wings are huge and the pizza is delicious. I have eaten there a few times and I have never had a bad meal. They do take out and you can call ahead and order to pick it up or they can deliver it up to 2 miles. The store is kinda hard to find but once you find it, you will back again, I promise.
