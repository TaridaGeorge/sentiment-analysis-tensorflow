The Frog is now under new ownership within the past month.

I have been back twice within the last week for the "torpedo" burger.  It is awesome.  What is it?  I guess you will have to order one to find out.

Tasty fresh cut french fries
Good diet cokes with big wedges of lemon
Fast and friendly service
Don't forget to have the "Chocolate Browing" thing.  Awesome!
