I live closest to Centruy City library, but I love going to Burton Barr.  This library is and has been an invalualuable source for school work, previewing books I might want to buy, and just some me time to browse the aisles.  The architecture is amazing.  I love going to the 5th floor and looking down and riding the elevators is fun too.  

I also love that I can manage my library account on line.  Renewing and requesting holds is very convienent for me.  Thank you Burton Barr.
