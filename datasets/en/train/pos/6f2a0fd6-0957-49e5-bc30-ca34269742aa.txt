Absolutely delicious, a must try spot!! Fresh oj or lemonade for $3, beer for $5, add chicken to a salad for only $2, and all the ingredients are farm fresh New Orleans style. Lot's of flavor, I had the portobello mushroom burger and it came on this great focaccia bread and was cut in quarters so easy to eat. The brisket sliders are also quite good but a tiny bit heavy on the bbq sauce for me.
