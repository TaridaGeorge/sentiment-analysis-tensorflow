WOW!

Great place, with amazing food. Very nice outdoor patio.

Started off with the stuffed mushrooms, which are stuffed with spinach dip, mozzarella, and sausage on top. OH SO GOOD!

Pepperoni and Italian sausage pizza. Had great sauce and thin crust, I just wanted to dip the crust in more sauce, it was great. 

Fettuccine chicken alfredo... LOVED IT. Lots of sauce, lots of chicken. 

Match it all up with a glass of vino... you are all set to go. Our waitress helped us match a vino with our pizza. She was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. 

We will definitely be back for more.
