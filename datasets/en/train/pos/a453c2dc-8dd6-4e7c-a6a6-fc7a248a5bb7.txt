If you're in the Phoenix area, this is a not to be missed museum. Every kind of instrument and its history through time is represented. It's well organized, interesting and good for kids and adults alike. 

I walked out impressed and full of knowledge. 

Helpful hint: it's a huge museum and depending on your ability to focus, you may want to split it into two visits.
