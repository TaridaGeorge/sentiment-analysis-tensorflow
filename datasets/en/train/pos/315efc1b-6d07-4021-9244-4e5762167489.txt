Been there twice, recommend to all, will keep going.

So far I have had a Green Chili Burger and Coal Original with blue cheese. Both awesome. I can taste the quality of the meat and buns. Even if your palate can't determine a difference your stomach will. You won't feel a lump in your stomach like other burger places. Probably something to do with natural beef and gluten free buns or something.

Sparking lemonde from the fountain is a must. And love the sweet potato fries with coal sauce to dip in.
