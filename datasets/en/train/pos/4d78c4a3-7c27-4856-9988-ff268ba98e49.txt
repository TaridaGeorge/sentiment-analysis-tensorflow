I adore this place! The atmosphere is totally cool and laid back, the service is fast, the employees are nice and the boba is awesome! I just had an almond milk tea with boba and it's the best I've had in the valley, hands down. I saw a sign saying that they no longer offer extra boba, which is fine because you don't need it! I also had an order of dumpling ramen which was excellent, but super spicey so be careful if that's not your thing. I work down the street from this place and I'll be coming here all the time!
