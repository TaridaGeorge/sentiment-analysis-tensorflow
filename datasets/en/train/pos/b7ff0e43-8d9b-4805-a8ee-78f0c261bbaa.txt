Churn is AMAZING!!! Homemade Ice cream, coffee, and baked goods... Oh My! 

Seriously though, it is a great way to end your night at Windsor/Churn. 

You have to try the coffee ice cream affogato style... they pour a shot of espresso over the top... genius!  So good! If you like ice cream sandwiches they make them for you right there with the home made ice cream and cookies. Really, how can you go wrong???
