I stopped by for some non-plastic wear (cups and bowls) and was delighted to see their fun juice/coffee bar.  They have a nice selection of different fresh juices, coffees and they even have kombucha on tap!  I don't remember the name of the juice I got, but it had kale, parsley, celery, cucumber, apple and spinach and was soooo good!  Overall, I really appreciate the fact that they support local business and stock their shelves with products that have some freaking integrity.  If it weren't so far from where I lived, I'd probably shop here more often.  Keep it real, guys:)
