I met bunch of cute Irish guys here, as in, actually from Ireland with cute accents.  5 stars for that alone!  Kidding aside, I'm a sucker for a good pub.  Every time I've come here, it's been a blast.

Update:  Last night I needed a cab.  I am all stressed about this because my mobile is dead.  No worries.  They have a button that you push to get a cab, that's right, a BUTTON.  I swear it's true.
