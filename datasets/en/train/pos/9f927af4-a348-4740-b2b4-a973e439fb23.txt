After being hungry for this place for 8 months, I finally made it back here today, joined by friends Arlin B., Robyn N., Norm R., & Mike C.  I had a regular gyro, a good sized square of kibbee, & a salad with Middle Eastern dressing (of course!).

The gyro in particular was still the most amazing one I've ever eaten, except for the last time I was here!  My friends carped about this & that & the other thing, but for ME, & what I eat here, this place ROCKS!  We're talking amazing food at amazingly low prices!     :-))

BIG Gyro $3.69, kibbee $1.99, regular dinner salad $1.29!
