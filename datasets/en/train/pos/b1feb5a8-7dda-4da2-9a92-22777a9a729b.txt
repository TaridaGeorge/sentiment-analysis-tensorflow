I wish I could live here. These cupcakes blow any other cupcake I've ever had, out of the water. Orange Blossom is my go-to on their daily menu. Margarita and Mexican Spice are my absolute favs but unfortunately (and maybe fortunately for my waist) they are usually only around once a month or so. On Tuesdays, Short Leash food truck is there and Thursdays brings Luncha Libre. The staff is super friendly and the smells are intoxicating. My co-workers and I have to restrain ourselves from daily visits.
