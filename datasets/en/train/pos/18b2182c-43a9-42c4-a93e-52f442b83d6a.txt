Love World Market - they have reasonably priced coffee. I'm always greeted by employees when I enter the store and check-out is quick! The employees have always been helpful and friendly. They carry unique products which some items are high-priced, but there are some items that are reasonably priced. I like their beverage section, esp the COFFEE! Located next to the Super Target.
