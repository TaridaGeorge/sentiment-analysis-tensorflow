I love sushi! So when I'm looking for amazing sushi, I search far and low. I believe I found my favorite new sushi restaurant. It's quite difficult to find, the sign does not stand out. We had to zig zag through the parking lot to find Shimogamo. That's pretty much the only thing I could complain about. Prices are not bad considering, we ordered 4 rolls, 3 sushi a la carte, sake, beer, dessert, and managed to spend $70. The fish was fresh, the ambiance was intimate and clean. Service was great. The crowd, families, couples, and Japanese business men.Semi-private room in the back for big groups. Check it out sometime, you won't be disappointed.
