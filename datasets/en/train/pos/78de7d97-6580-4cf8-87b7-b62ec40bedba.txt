My boyfriend and I decided to go here on the spur of the moment. We got the Flaming Platter. It was really good. I espcially like the beef on skewers. For entrees i got the Monogolian Beef and my boyfriend got the kung pao chicken they were both equally good. Not the best i have had but still good. The customer service was great! I would definetly recommend this place.
