This park is always packed. This is a very active type of park because there's so many things to do here. Every type of outdoor sport can be found here. Also has a beautiful huge lake.

This is also a great place for fishing and you'll find it packed with people fishing at times. One of my favorite places to go urban fishing. Friendly people to talk to and get tips. I've always caught at least one fish here! Maybe I'm just lucky though? Ha I say you go visit this park. Something for everyone. Unless your looking for peace and quite type of park...
