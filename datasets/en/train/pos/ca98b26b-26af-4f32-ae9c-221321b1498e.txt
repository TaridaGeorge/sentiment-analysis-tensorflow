This is a very nice Scrapbook store. It's not too big and overwhelming and not so small and cramped either...it's just the perfect size! The layout is very appealing and inviting. There is plenty of aisle space and the classroom is BIG, with plenty of table space.

They had a bunch of cute samples and a very nice selection of Scrapbooking supplies sectioned by themes.

Since the owners previously worked at Recollections (which is gone now), the store does look a lot like a mini version of Recollections! The service was super friendly too! 

If you are looking for a fantastic Scrapbook store, Paper Vineyard is the place to go!
