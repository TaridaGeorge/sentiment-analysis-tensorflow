One of the coolest places to eat in Old Town. If you are 20-35, you will love it. Ambiance is loud and fun. Servers are all attractive and dressed casually. The decor is unique and modern. This is my favorite Sam Fox restaurant. 

Food is comforting and familiar-- but usually with a twist. 

Beer selection is great--- wine selection pretty good.

Great place to go with friends, on a date, or to pre-game before a hard night out.
