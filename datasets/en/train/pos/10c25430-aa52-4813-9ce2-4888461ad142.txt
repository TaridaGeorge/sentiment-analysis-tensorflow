Say what you want about this touristy place. They treat locals like gold. yeah, food is a bit expensive but everything is HIGH END. Burgers were awesome, if overpriced by three dollars or so. The hot wings had some BBQ sauce mixed into the hot sauce, which is a pet peeve of mine. The ribs were tender and smokey. Steak was also good here, everything is good. I know tourists want that "cowboy touch" but I like hot wings unadulterated, The bartender was attentive and fun and the manager bought us shots "just because". We had a great time and all the memorabilia gives you something to focus on when the shots start to hit. Great place to enjoy, again.. on payday.
