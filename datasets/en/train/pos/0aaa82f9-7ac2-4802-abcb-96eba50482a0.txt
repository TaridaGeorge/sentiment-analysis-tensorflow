As someone who is just starting gardening, I walked into Baker Nursery knowing nothing and left knowing a little bit more than nothing and feeling very confident about my selections. The woman who helped me walked me through everything I needed and didn't overwhelm me with details or options. It was a great experience and a perfect way to start a new project.
