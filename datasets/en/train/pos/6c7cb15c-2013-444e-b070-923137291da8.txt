Glam Lounge is a product junkie's paradise ... a persnickety product junkie anyway. The owner (who moonlights and daylights as an editorial makeup artist and fashion stylist) stocks her cute little shabby chic boutique with cult-status cosmetics like Lipstick Queen, Kevyn Aucoin and FACE atelier. I went in recently for a total makeup makeover and had a blast (although my pocketbook took a huge hit). The makeup artist wasn't pushy though and I'm happy with all my purchases, right down to the Diane Brill lip gloss I'm wearing right now. Besides makeup services, Glam Lounge also offers skincare and waxing services in their private treatment room in the back of the store.
