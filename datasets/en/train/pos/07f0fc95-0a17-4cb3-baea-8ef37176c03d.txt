I love Classic Italian Pizza. Their pizza is consistently good. Every time the crust is crispy and never soggy. The pizza always tastes fresh and delicious so I love going to eat there. I also love that this place is never too crowded. Their tiramisu is also delicious. It is a hidden gem. Tonight I went to Grimaldi's and their pizzas were definitely not comparable. Grimaldi's was heavy and soggy. It felt like I had eaten a brick after leaving, much too heavy. I will continue to frequent Classic Italian and probably avoid Grimaldi's for a while.
