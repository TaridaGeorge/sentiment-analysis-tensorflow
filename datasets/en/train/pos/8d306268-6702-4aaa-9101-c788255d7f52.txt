St. Francis is officially my absolute favorite place to have Sunday Brunch. I have had dinner there before and the food was outstanding. Last Sunday my husband and I ventured in for brunch for the first time and not only were we surprised that one of our valley favorites, Dennis Rowland, was performing live jazz but that every last bit of food and drink we ordered was incredible. 

The servers are always super nice, the ambiance is a perfect blend of sophistication and personality and I will definitely be there for Sunday brunch as frequently as possible.

It is also a great place to grab a glass of wine or one of several amazing cocktails, day time or evening!
