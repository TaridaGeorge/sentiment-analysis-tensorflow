Ordered takeout on New Year's Eve for my wife and I and we both loved the food. We ordered two meals and that was more than enough for the two of us and we had some left over for the next day. The vegetable lo mein was delicious and the orange chicken tasted extremely fresh. The staff was extremely friendly and delivered great service. We will definitely be going back.
