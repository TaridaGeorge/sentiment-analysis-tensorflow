This place is awesome. I guess I should mention that I'm not a serious climber, I just do it every so often for fun, so I'm not sure how this place compares on a more hardcore level. It can get a little pricey depending on how addicted you are to climbing, but they offer different packages (everything from one-day to a lifetime membership!) It's very beginner-friendly and great for parties. 

They also have a shop where you can buy gear, and last time I was here it looked like they were extending the bouldering section.
