What can I say about the Roosevelt that hasn't already been said? Probably nothing so I won't bore you with how awesome the pretzel & stone ground mustard is for dipping. Won't say anything about the best priced specials downtown. The ginormous braut's with kraut or breathe a word about their selection of brews on tap. I won't sing my pleasure over the ooey gooey cheesy Panini that comes with the best tomato soup I've ever had. No, I won't do it! I will say the food is great, the specials are the best deal going, the staff helpful & quick. I love the ambience the best I think. I love that the charm was left right where it should be in this historic home turned neighborhood pub.
