The scallops were fresh and very tasty. A little kick to them was a good thing. The little dinner Caesar salad was also very good, the garlic bread that came with was crunchy and made a great little meal. 

It was Cinco de Mayo so a margarita made with Sauza was in order. It hit the spot. This was a short stop this evening. But well worth it, did not disappoint.

AND the man who has burger named after him was there, AND friendly as ever!!
