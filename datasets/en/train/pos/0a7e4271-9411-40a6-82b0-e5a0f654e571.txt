The food and service are great!

First, the food is so good and inexpensive.  The fries are amazing, the salad is good, and the gyros are incredible.  Even the desserts are good.

The service is the best though. Everyone working there is incredibly friendly.  In fact, on one recent trip through the drive through, they forgot to put tzaziki sauce in the bag.  When we called them, they offered to drive over 2 sides of the sauce to our house.  I was so impressed!

They also have a really nice patio.
