The team at Nava BJJ has excellent camaraderie & there's a great "family" feel to the school. Paul Nava devotes himself to the school & puts a ton of time into it & his students. The coaches are all top-notch & every student receives personalized attention. The competition team produces medal-winners in every weight class & age division. 

If you're just looking for a way to stay in shape, you'll definitely be able to achieve that through BJJ. We have several students who have lost substantial amounts of weight since joining & I personally am in the best shape of my life at 31. I definitely recommend Nava BJJ for anyone interested in pursuing BJJ either for competition or just fitness.
