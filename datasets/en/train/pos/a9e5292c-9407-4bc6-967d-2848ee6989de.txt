Five Stars. I just barely moved here from back East. I bought a 3.99 fuel filter for my classic car and without asking out of the blue the kid "Marc" from behind the counter at the parts store (last name not mentioned for privacy) went WAY out of his way and offered to put it on in the parking lot. He brought out his own tools and in a jiffy put it on and didn't want a cent for it. What the H??? I went in and told the manager that kid needs a RAISE. HE goes: "...already?? He just GOT here..." LMAO but from what I gathered this free work they do all the time as a matter of course. That is simply amazing. Out of this world.
