Came here for happy hour before the Giants vs. D-back game. The prices were great= $4 for a 20oz beer and 1/2 off apps. We also shared the shrimp & fish dinner which came with chips ( we substituted waffle fries which were out of this world!). It was amazing and a great portion. I think it was only $9 and change. Our server was great too, quick and pleasant- she brought the check quickly so we could rush over to Chase Field. 

We were even welcomed decked out in our Giants' gear :)

Will definitely be hitting up happy hour here again soon!
