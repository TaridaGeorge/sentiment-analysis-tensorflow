SideBar is the shizz.  Seriously folks, if you want a place that feels more like chill Chicago or hip NY then go to SideBar. Forget Scottsdale and all the chippies looking for sugar daddies and the clone poseurs with their bluetooth sideburns.  SideBar is the real thing.  Great people, great owners who really do care about their customers.  If you like a funky Phoenix vibe with intelligent hipsters and anything from goth sweethearts, to urban yuppies to A-gays, this place welcomes anyone and everyone who wants a little something more than your typical trendy fare.  The low soft amber lighting, mod furniture and fixtures make for a unexpected surprise. Great drinks, great vibe and cool tunes.  This is the place you'll find me when I want to go out.
