Lowes is so much nicer than Home Depot, customer service always seems better too. I think it's annoying that Home Depot always builds a location near Lowes in an effort to put them out of business, they have done this at Thunderbird & I-17 and this location as well. Most of Lowes products are usually better, I found this out with garden hoses. I bought a high end commercial grade hose from each store & Lowes carries this great black, non-kink hose that is awesome. I ended up throwing the one from home depot out since it was junk. I have also noticed on a few items that Home Depot is slightly higher on prices. My favorite thing about Lowes though is the fact that it's always easier to find someone to help you.
