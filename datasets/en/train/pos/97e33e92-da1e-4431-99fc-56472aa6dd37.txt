Played 36 holes here with a group of friends on a golf trip recently. This is by far the best course we played during the trip. We rented a house in Cave Creek so the drive was about 35 minutes to Quintero....so worth it.
This Rees Jones designed course is a challenge, fair, incredibly well laid out, and an amazing value. We played the Grayhawk Raptor course and I can say without question Quintero puts it to shame for the money. Grayhawk is a great layout but for the money it is not even close. 

If you are into golf and in the area do yourself a favor and make the trip to Quintero.
