Best Chinese food in Phoenix, hands down! :) I love you China Grill!

Service: 5 stars - awesome staff. This is family owned so go and support them! Panda Express has nothing on this. 

Food: Twice Cooked Chicken is my favorite go to order here! They have awesome food and an extensive menu so there's always something new to try. The sushi rolls are delicious, too!

Environment: The restaurant is super laid back and it's fun to go out as a small group to really large groups. There is a full bar there which is awesome (and rare) for Chinese restaurants. Sake bombs go with any meal!! :) Oh, they also have TV and a large projector so you can watch all sports games.

Thank you, China Grill, for being the best Chinese restaurant in Peoria!

Fully Satisfied,
Emily
