I know, I know.. I can hear you say, "What? 5 star a Walmart?!" But YES. 

This A+review is given only to the car service department. I went there because my husband said that he noticed some oil leaking under my car the night before. Since that last oil change I had was at another Walmart, I decided to stop by and see if these guys could help me out. 

They immediately greeted me and listened to my concerns. They inspected it and found out it was my gasket leaking and replaced it for free.. and admitted that the other Walmart should have seen this problem in the beginning. I was thinking that this was going to turn into an expensive car fix from the beginning but they proved me wrong. I was in and out in about 30 minutes and my car was fixed for free. Thank you!
