I love this place!  
I have eaten breakfast at 'The Bear' several times and have never been disappointed.  Being from Michigan, I really like the outdoorsy decorations.  Every time I dine there I am reminded of restaurants in upper Michigan.

The food is delicious, people are friendly, and I love that the menu is presented in newspaper format.  

Beware that this place gets very busy on weekends so prepare for a wait if you dine at peak hours.  Let me tell you, it is worth the wait!
