Papago Park is a nice spot for an easy or strenuous hike.  Like Camelback, it's right in the middle of Phoenix so it's really accessible.  I used to go at lunch when I worked in the area.  There are a couple of areas to choose from: the side near the Phoenix zoo and the side with the amphitheater.  I prefer the side with the amphitheater.  You can walk around the whole park in about 45 minutes and there are a number of hills that really get your heart rate up.  As with everything else in Phoenix in the summer, go early.  In the wintertime, it's heaven any time of day.
