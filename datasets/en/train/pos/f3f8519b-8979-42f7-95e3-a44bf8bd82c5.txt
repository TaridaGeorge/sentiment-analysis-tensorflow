Chompies.....Chompies.....Chompies.....
Oh, this place is my absolute favorite deli in Phoenix. This place is the real deal....this is New York Deli meets the desert! The family running this place knows how to do it and they do it well. 

You can ask anyone in Phoenix and they will tell you there is no better deli around....hands down. There's not much to say about this place other than if your thinking of dining here, stop thinking and start heading over because there are no disappointments. 

* Incredible menu selection 
* Corned beef and pastrami are my personal favorites 
* Get a Dr. Brown's black cherry soda 
* Try the fried onion strings--haystacks
* Freshest rye bread I've ever had
* Awesome selection of cookies and other baked goods 
* Bagels and cream cheese with a HUGE variety of flavors and spreads

Again, stop making me tell you this------its the best!
