Deeelicious!!! Food is a bit pricey but considering there are not many options like Palatte around downtown, I look forward to going there as many Sunday's as possible!

The sweet toast is absolutely fantastic! I've heard their Bloody's Mary's are awesome on the weekends.

Dinner is AWESOME. Try the Floating Islands dessert. Fluffy sugar meringues floating in a sea of lemon lavender cream! YUUUMMMMM! Everything on the menu is superb!
