There are plenty of reviews to demonstrate the fortitude and cache of Coronado Cafe, so I will simply say that this is a sweet little spot for a lunch date. 

My girlfriend and I had our second date here as one of those safe, sans alcohol, 'is this the one?' dates, which came off perfectly and pleasantly and I looked like the f'in man for suggesting it.  Sucker.  Just kidding.  I love you baby.  Heh.
