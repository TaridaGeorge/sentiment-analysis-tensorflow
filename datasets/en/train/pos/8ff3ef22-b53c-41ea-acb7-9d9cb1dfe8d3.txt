First of all, IT'S ABOUT TIME you opened one out west.  I grew up on Genghis Grill in Texas.  They have them all over they place there.  The food is so good, and that includes the desserts.  I don't really remember how nice the staff was in Texas because I was young and was just excited to go out to eat.  I notice now and they are really nice at the one in Arrowhead.  

I'm with JT.  My bowl had a ton of food in it once it was served.  I didn't even think about going back again.  How can you be mad when someone asks if you have allergies????  They are cooking your food near other people's and want to be extra careful.  They don't cook it in your own pan.  IT'S MONGOLIAN!

I'll be over there tomorrow night....
