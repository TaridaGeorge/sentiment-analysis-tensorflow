I stopped by yesterday to get a new battery on a very old watch. Initially, I went to JC Penney where they charge $10 for battery replacement. However, they suggested I go to a watch repair place because the woman couldn't pry open my square-faced watch. Hence, I found myself at Gemtime.

Like the other reviewers state, you walk into the store and the gentleman at the counter will buzz you in through the security gate. I let the guy know what I needed and about five minutes and $8 later, my watch is back to its old glory. The guy who helped was really nice. I'm definitely coming this way for any watch or jewelry repair needs:)
