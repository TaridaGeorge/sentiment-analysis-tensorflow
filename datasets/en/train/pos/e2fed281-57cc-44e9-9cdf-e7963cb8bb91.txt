Probably my favorite restaurant in phoenix- it's always the first place that comes to mind when deciding on somewhere to eat... I love their original "g" sandwich- it's the best menu item I've tried so far. Some other favorite dishes of mine are the kung pao, diablo red or thai peanut bowls. Everyone I've ever taken to this place is crazy about the tsoynamis and thyme fries. Anyone - vegetarian or not- will enjoy the food here .
