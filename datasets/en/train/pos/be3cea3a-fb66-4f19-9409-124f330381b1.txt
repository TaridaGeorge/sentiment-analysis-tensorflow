This place is really great. I have had pizza and pasta all over the country and I have to say this place is really, really great!!!!! We had pizza, pasta, salads, calamari, capresse (sp?) and a bottle of Italian wine, enough for the 10 of us and it was cheaper than the breakfast we had at Denny's earlier.
I don't know about the guy who reviewed it earlier from NY, but obviously he does NOT know what pizza is supposed to taste like, because this pizza was the one of the best I have ever had. In fact,as we are only in Phoenix for one more day, we are going back for dinner tonight and ordering all different items!
