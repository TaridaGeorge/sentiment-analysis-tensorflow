Been coming here for almost a year now. I've had every pasta dish and the thin crust pizza. Everything was so good. Make sure to get an order bruschetta for an appetiser. That really makes the whole meal for me. On the service end, I've never had bad service. Sure, the parking situation is a joke and this place is always hopping, but MAN it is so worth it. If you want good Italian food, come to Oregano's.
