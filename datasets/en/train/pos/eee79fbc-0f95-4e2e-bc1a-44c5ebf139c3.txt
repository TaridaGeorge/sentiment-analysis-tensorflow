I love AJ's! You may think, why, their prices are so high. Yes some things are more expensive than other stores, but then again I don't do my weekly grocery shopping here. 

AJ's is great for freshly brewed coffee (cheaper than the big name chain), muffins, desserts, pastries, fresh meat, sandwiches, sushi and cheeses. If you need a 12-pack of Coke go to Basha's instead.

Everyone here is very friendly and the location is great right at Camelback and 44th.
