Kudos to Elite Pet Care in Scottsdale.

Sarah is a wonderful care giver who will treat your pet like her very own. She walks, trains, house sits, and will take rover on an all-day dogie adventure.

Imagine your best pal going for a trip to the dog park, over to the doggie bakery for a snack, then off to get a new toy... or even pop by the groomer and get your pooch a trim.

She will even manage your dogie(s) by scheduling vet visits, grooming appointments, regular walks and socialization with other pets.

Thanks for all you do Sarah!
