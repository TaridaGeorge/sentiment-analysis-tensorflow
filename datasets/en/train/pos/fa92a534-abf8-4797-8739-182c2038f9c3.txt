This place has been around forever! They sell some of the best bagels, cakes and pastries that I've ever had, anywhere.  Seriously.  The food is sooo good, but it's not a restaurant.  It's just what the name says- it's a bakery, so you'll need to grab what you want and go.  But you'll definitely have trouble deciding what you want when everything looks this good.

They have tons of different pastries, including clairs, napoleans, croissants, various breads, cookies and more.  The cakes are amazing too- they have this seven layer chocolate one that is to die for. One of my friends actually had Karsh's do their wedding cake, and everyone loved it.

Even if you don't live in the area, you should come check this place out.  It will be worth the trip- the food is really great!
