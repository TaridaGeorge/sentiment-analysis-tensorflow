A couple months ago, I had to see an ENT and I had called around to a couple of offices and was very pleased right off the bat by the friendliness and sincere concern offered by the staff at Entegrity over the phone. They were able to fit me in the next morning, which was fantastic!

Once I was checked in and all my new patient paperwork was filled out (very quick process) I had virtually no wait time before Dr Bailey came in. Again, he showed sincere concern for how I was feeling and offered several options to ensure that the treatment fit my needs.

I've had to see him again for a separate issue and the staff at Entegrity as well as Dr Bailey were consistent with their amazing care.
