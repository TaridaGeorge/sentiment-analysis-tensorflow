9/1/2012 We saw Susan Tedeschi & Derek Truck Band, BB King & the Robert Crey Band. This concert started at 7:00 & was still going until 11:30...I have never been to a concert that lasted this long SO worth every dollar!!! This is one of the best places to see a concert not a bad seat in the house. The Acoustics are Great too.  We sat in the main concourse row 15 section 6 and it was awesome. Susan/Derek ROCKED the house!! We are coming back next month for Brad Paisley/The band perry looking forward to another great time. The only con: $10.00 for a draft beer & 11.00 for a bottle
