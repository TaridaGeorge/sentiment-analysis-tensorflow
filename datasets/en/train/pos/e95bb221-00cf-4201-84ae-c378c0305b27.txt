Wow.

This is not the old dentist that you have been going to for years. The gang at SD is fun and efficient, but really spend the time to make sure your chompers are in good condition. If you have thought about cheating on that dentist you have been seeing forever, this is the place to go.

I was just in for my second six month cleaning and appreciated the good work and fun they have in the office. My teeth have never felt cleaner!
