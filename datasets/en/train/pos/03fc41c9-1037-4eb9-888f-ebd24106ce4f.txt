Michelle was wonderful!  She captured images of our cat that we never could on our own.  The photos are awesome - we cannot stop looking at them.  I would highly recommend using Michelle. She was professional, relaxed and exceptionally prompt.   We were able to view the photos two days after the shoot.   Our photo session was a gift from our daughter.  This is a great gift that someone can enjoy forever!
