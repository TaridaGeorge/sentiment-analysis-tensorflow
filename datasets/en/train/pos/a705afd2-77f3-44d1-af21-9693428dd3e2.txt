Fountain Bowl is just what Fountain Hills needs!  I love coming here to play whenever I'm in town, and Sam and Diana are the coolest bowl owners/managers I've ever met.  The decor is nice and I love the remodel work they've done with the bowling alley.  Also a fabulous way to get out of the hot Arizona sun in summer and enjoy some AC while sipping Coke and bowling the afternoon away.
