My favorite sandwich shop, hands down.  Their half soup (in a bread bowl I might add) and half sandwich combos make the perfect lunch.  I've been diggin the Southwestern Club with Potato soup lately, although you can't go wrong with the Dilly Bird, Blazin Buffalo Chicken, or hot Roast Beef.  There's another place called Bison Wiches that serves similar sandwiches, but I'm staying loyal to Dilly's!  I've been eating there since my ASU days...
