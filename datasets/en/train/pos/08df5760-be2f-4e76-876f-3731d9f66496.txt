My friend told me to shop at Fry's because of some discount on gas but there is no way I'm ever leaving my local Basha's on Hayden / Indian School.  It's always clean, well maintained, organized.  The most important reasons why I won't' shop anywhere else is because of Ruth and Kathy.  Those ladies are the most friendly employees that Basha's has.  They are always happy, kind, helpful and extremely friendly.  Fry's may have discounted gas but Basha's has Ruth and Kathy.
