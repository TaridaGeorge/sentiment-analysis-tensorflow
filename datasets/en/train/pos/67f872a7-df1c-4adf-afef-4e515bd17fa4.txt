Took my wife for lunch today and ordered the "Phoenix" maaaaan!! Best sammich I had ever!!!! Don't sleep on the satisfied frog! Food is the best and beer is cold. If u ever in Phoenix u have got to come here u will nit be disappointed!!! My wife had the "wrinkle filler" oh my God she had to bring sum home! I'm giving this place 5 stars because its just a great place wit great food...
