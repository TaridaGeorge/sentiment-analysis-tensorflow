NOT TO BE MISSED!!!

We visited here a few months ago with our girls (3 and 7 y/o) who had a blast.  The girls just had a blast, and it was easy on the parents too.  THere is no admission fee.  The prices for the rides are $2-$3 per person (parents pay too) which I thought was a little expensive, but the rides are long and enjoyable.  Definitely worth the price after the fact.  The food in the snack shop is good and very reasonably priced.  The experience was just so enjoyable for kids and parents.
