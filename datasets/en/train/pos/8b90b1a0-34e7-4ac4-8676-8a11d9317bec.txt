I absolutely ADORE Postino's! 

The quaintness of the surrounding neighborhood, the fact that it is housed in a old post office, the modern, organic ambiance....what can I say (oh, I already did...) I LOVE this place!

The bruschetta flights are fabulous! So diverse and tantilizing to the taste buds when paired with a complimentary glass of wine. My two favorite salads are the Raspberry Chicken and the Mixed Green...both delicious in their own right. 

I love that between 11am-4pm ANY day of the week, they offer $5 glasses of wine.  Whether you are dining with a girlfriend, your significant other or a few friends, this is a perfect place to meet. (Just note that this place is packed almost 24/7) 

Although the parking is a nightmare, the simple ambiance of this establishment, paired with the phenomenal food/drink, keeps me coming back for more!
