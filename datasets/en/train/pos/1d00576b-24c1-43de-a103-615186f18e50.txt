This is a great store. There are 3 main grocery stores in fountain hills and Safeway is by far the most accommodating, reasonably priced, clean and overall satisfying. It also has a gelato shop, a Starbucks, and my favorite for the hot weather of Arizona, the Jamba Juice. This is overall a great store!
