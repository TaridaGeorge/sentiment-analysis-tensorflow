How do they do it?  Consistently outstanding coffee AND baked goods that should be on the food network!  Recently, I've been wow'ed by the bananas foster croissant creation, blueberry-pear anything, and, my numero uno favorite is the blueberry corn muffin.  A few weeks ago they had blueberry pie.  Not your ordinary blueberry sticky filling... this pie slice was loaded with fruit & flavor!  I just hope this mystery baker doesn't get discovered and go to Hollywood!  As for one of the previous reviews regarding their iced coffee.... that person must have a Starbucks palate, because LUX has the best iced coffee in the city!!
