Went today for the first time. The quesadillas were the best I've ever had. My husband had the Cuban sandwich, which of course I tried...it was equally delicious! The atmosphere made me feel like I was back in the Bahamas. And not to forget the staff. We sat at the bar, and the bartenders were wonderful and so nice!
