Herb hummus, Street Tacos, Chopped salad w/chicken, & Tabbouleh Salad all delicious!

If I had to make s suggestion it would be to spice up the fish in the tacos with a little more flavor, but they were perfectly cooked, flaky and moist.

The hummus appetizer is a generous portion; enough for 4-6 people.
