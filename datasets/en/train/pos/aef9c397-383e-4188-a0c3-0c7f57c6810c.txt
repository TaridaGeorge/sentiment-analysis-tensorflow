incredible selection of rare beers and microbrews always changing. super laid-back atmosphere where you can hear your friends talk. we wanted to take a couple of bottles to go and the bartender instead brought them up to the counter next door (tops liquor) because it was cheaper to byy from them than the bar side. nice guy. good service, good atmosphere, great beer. what else do you want?
