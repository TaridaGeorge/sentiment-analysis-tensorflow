Great service!  The staff is very knowledgeable which make Sole Sports incomparable to the mass media stores, yet the $$$ is the same.  My only recommendation would be to show all colors of every shoe that you have in stock.  I did not know that they had Nike Free's in Blue in the back, and the only pair out on display was a boring grey color---I almost didn't make a purchase because of this....so ask if you are looking for a specific color that is online somewhere ;-)
