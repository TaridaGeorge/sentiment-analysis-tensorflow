I'm a recent transport from los angeles, so you can understand that I've been having major vegan food withdrawals...then I discovered mandala. The macro platter and the BLT are everything a hearty vegan meal should be, not to mention the space just makes you feel healthy the moment you arrive and everyone is really nice.
