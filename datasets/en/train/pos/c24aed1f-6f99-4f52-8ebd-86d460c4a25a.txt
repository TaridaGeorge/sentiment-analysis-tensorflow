I have lived in Tempe, gone to ASU and worked on Mill for years and  I have nothing but good things to say about the ice cream and service at this place.  The owner and staff are always friendly, the servings are big, and they're perfect for stopping by on either a hot day or late night when too many glasses of wine at Cafe Boa make Cookiez sound like the perrrrfect dessert.  I'm not saying it's good for you, but the cookies are the fresh and gigantic, and with a giant scoop of ice cream in between, it's heavenly.  Do yourself a favor and try it out. :)
