Pho Ao Sen is one of the rare Asian restaurants who truly get it--that what draws people is not only having fantastic food (which they do), but also creating the *right environment*.  With trickles of water, strings of jazz, and a comfortably lit and set-up interior, it serves basic Vietnamese fare, at the basic Vietnamese fare that we have come to expect and love.  

It's not pretentious by any means, but comfortable and welcoming.  The food is filling, delicious, and definitely satisfying.
