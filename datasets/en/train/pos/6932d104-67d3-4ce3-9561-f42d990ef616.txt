A gem on Camelback. A modern, trendy spot that was busy well into the night on a Friday. My visit was quick, but memorable. Brushetta was excellent. My Italian grinder was one of the best I've ever had anywhere, and the fries were just as good. Service was pretty good. The entire place was very clean and new looking. I already want to go back. 5 stars all the way.
