I'm so excited to write this review that I honestly can't even articulate appropriately! I LOVE LOVE LOVE SuTRA! As soon as you walk in you instantly feel cool with the modern decor.  Then you see the owner and you made your next new friend! And the instructors are just as amazing.  The classes are intense and fun! When people ask me what kind of yoga I do, I tell them SuTRA yoga! PS Best massage ever.  And coming from a student/server, this place is afforable.  I get my Chi, abs and as* right as this place!
