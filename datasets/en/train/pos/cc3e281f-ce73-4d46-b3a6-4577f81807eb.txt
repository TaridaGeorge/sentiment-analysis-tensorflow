I wish I would have found this place must sooner!! Rocket Burger & Subs, where have you been?  This place is amazing!  Their food is fresh ~ cooked after it's ordered.  They have several burger and sandwich options to chooses from with different sides.  They have the LARGEST cola in a bottle selection I've ever seen and they have super service!

Food~ Rocket burger was awesome! burger patties cooked to perfection and trimmed to fit on a sub role.  The role was fresh and my burger came with lots of veggies and dressing.  The fries were awesome ~ cooked fresh like mom makes them.  We also had their onion rings based on the Yelp reviews, YUM!  The cola selection is mind blowing! I'm going to keep coming back until I've tried each one : -)
