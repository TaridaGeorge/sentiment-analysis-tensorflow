I was in the area one Sunday and decided to have lunch here. I looked at the name and thought....oh my...this is probably gonna be a mistake. Who names their restaurant something that corny and have good food!??  Boy, was I wrong!   The owner was very polite and nice, he was constantly checking up on us while we ate to make sure we got everything. The pho was ....."unphogettable"!!!! .....  I must say this is the best pho I've had since Seattle.  They had the pho out in like, 5 mins also...which is how long pho SHOULD take to make at a restaurant level.  I was very satisfied with the service and the food.
