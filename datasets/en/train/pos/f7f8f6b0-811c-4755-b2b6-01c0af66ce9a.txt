Hands down one of the best bookstores! The trade counter has come in handy from books to dvds. I did buy a cybershot camera storage disk once and had to return it because it wouldn't load in my camera. (huge error message) I returned it and I HATE returning things!
 The saleman was extremely nice and gave me back my money without me having to show him what my camera said. He told me it happens and they buy the items at a risk, but he was just as bummed as I was considering neither of us benefited. I tell everyone I know that needs to sell or is looking for something to go here, and they usually have good luck with it.
