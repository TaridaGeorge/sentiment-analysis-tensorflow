My absolute fav for Chinese food in the valley.  I know that everything is made to order since they are very accommodating to my needs - I'm allergic to MSG and I just switched to gluten free (they do have gluten free soy sauce).  I know there's many places out there that are not very accommodating or is pre-made, so I really appreciate that I can get exactly what I want.  My favs - crab puffs (they use real crab and not crab with a k), pot stickers, hot and sour soup, chicken wings, Szechuan hot beef, teriyaki beef on a stick, garlic shrimp, and anything kung pao.  I have also asked for items off them menu (salty fish, bitter melon, etc) which probably explains why I've seen Chinese people eating here too.  Best place for Chinese in town.
