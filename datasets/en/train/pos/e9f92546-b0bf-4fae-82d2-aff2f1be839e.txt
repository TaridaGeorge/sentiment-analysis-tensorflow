We just went to La Bocca for girls night last night and had the best time!  Our waiter, Levi was absolutely amazing!  Not only he did he take the time to explain menu items he also gave us great suggestions when it came to the wines and dessert:)  The food was awesome, the atmosphere was perfect and Levi was the best!  La Bocca is going to be the new girls night spot for us and we will aways request Levi:)
