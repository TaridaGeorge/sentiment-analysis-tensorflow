I agree with the previous 24 reviewers.  This place can't be beat, and honestly, I don't live in AZ anymore, so I can't even come here !!  Boo-hoo.  I thought that when I moved to Los Angeles, I could certainly find  equal to, if not better, but that isn't the case, and I pine for this place everytime I walk into the place I now have to use.  They are always out of things I want/need, they charge more, and their quality on the food products is much less.  I so miss this place.
