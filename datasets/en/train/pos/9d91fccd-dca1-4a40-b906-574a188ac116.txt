Our office just moved here from the Bay Area and my collegues and I have been on a mad search for a GOOD/GREAT Chinese restaurant.  Difficult to find . . . until NOW!!

Nee House has high quality, fresh ingredients and offers EXCELLENT FLAVORS!!  Certainly on par with many Bay Area Chinatown restaurants!

And yes, the staff is a touch surly  but that's a true indication that this is the authentic thing!!!  Of course they're going to be surly, it's a chinese restaurant!!!  

Excellent food!  Can't wait to try the next treat!!  Tell all your friends!  We need to keep this place open!!
