This place rocks! I would of never thought a place like this existed especially in a shopping center. The beer selection is seriously like I died and went to beer heaven. They have a ton of beers on draft as well as a huge selection of bottled beer you can grab from the fridge and they will pour it for you in the appropriate glass. I didn't get to try there food but heard it was great.
