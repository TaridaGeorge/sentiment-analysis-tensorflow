No long lines, no DMV, excellent personal service!

Okay i'm going off one trip and 1 services rendered BUT... hear me out.

So the day I NEEDED to reg my new truck was Presidents day right?  DMV is closed... my 3-day permit just expired and I'm on borrowed time and am busy...   Somebody, forgot who, told me of this place... called - they were open!!! score

Went in and sat down and the two nice ladies helped me very quickly, some small talk - very nice and helpful.  Even got a specialized plate AND personalized... they got everything correct and over the next few weeks I got all my stuff from the state and everything was good.

I'll never go to the DMV again - unless that's the only place I get it done at :/
