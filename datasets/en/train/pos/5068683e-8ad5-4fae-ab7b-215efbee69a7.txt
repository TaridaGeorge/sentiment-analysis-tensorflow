I love sky harbor!... The construction is about the only drawback that I see. I love the retro (out-dated to some) interior of the airport... I think it adds some charm. You don't get that interior at just any airport... The new airports look more and more shiny and metalic everytime I land in another city :(

LONG LIVE SKY HARBOR!!!!
