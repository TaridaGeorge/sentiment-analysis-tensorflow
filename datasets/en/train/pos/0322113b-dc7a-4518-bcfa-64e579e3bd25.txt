This is the BEST food I have had in Phoenix! Their margherita pizza is so delicious with big fresh basil and they use good moz and great crust. Very fluffy and soft! I also tried their strawberries and goat cheese salad, very fresh and refreshing!! Their nutella and marscopone crepe was AMAZING!!! I wanna come back here every other day! Will be back!
