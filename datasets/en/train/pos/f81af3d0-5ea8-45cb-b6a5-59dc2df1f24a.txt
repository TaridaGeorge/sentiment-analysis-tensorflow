Really more like 4.5*
I do not give such high ratings often but this place totally rocks. Take my order quick, many things to customize your pita with, was not over priced, tasted REAL good AND was healthy. Their menu is really neat too, with many items and even manier (Is it a word?) customizations you can do.

I am sure as hell coming back for more. It just might be very well my new favorite quick food place It aint no fast food)

"I like"
"Very nice"
