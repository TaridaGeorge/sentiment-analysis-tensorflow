A MUST SEE!! I just spent $20 on 10 items--all quality clothing. Stormy, co-owner, is so sweet and helpful. The selection inside the store is AMAZING (when I finally got there--after spending 10 minutes on the $2/item rack outside)!! I just moved here from CA; the styles here in AZ are very different from CA, as you can imagine. I just outfitted a great wardrobe and a few modeling photoshoots--for less than $200. This is my new favorite clothing store.
