This year for christmas I did a lot of DIY gifts, I travled down to MadMaxx's from Tempe one day with my Sister and HOLY COW talk about the most amazing collection of items...from old school coke fridge to furniture to unique trinckets, they had everything we were looking for and more.  I had to come onto Yelp and give a review, Spencer (the owner) was so helpful and extremly nice, he makes you feel like your a regular on your first vist!  I cant wait to go back to see what new treasures I can find.
