Was staying at the Ritz Carlton and wanted to find some good food close by that wasn't a chain restaurant.  Yelp showed Fuego Tacos had a deal and lots of good reviews, so I decided to give it a try.  Tried the two taco meal, and did the server's recommendation to try one Fish Taco and one Pernil Asado Tacos (their specialty).  Both were amazing, but the Fish Taco won out in my book (they are my weakness).  The service was as exceptional as the food.  I love it when they bring me another soda before I have even finished the first one, and they did this again and again.  They have a happy hour daily from 2-6, and they serve any taco for $3.  I would get these a lot if I lived in Phoenix.
