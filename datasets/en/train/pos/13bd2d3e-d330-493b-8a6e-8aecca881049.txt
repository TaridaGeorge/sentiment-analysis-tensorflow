come on, more then 200+ reviews and almost everyone loves it.  Stop debating and give the place a try, you won't be disappointed. The coffee is great, the whip cream doesn't come out of a spray nozzle and the atmosphere is very lax, just how a coffee shop should be.

I recommend the Velvet mocha if you're like me and like your coffee to taste like a dessert.
