I can't believe I waited this long to swing by Fez. I went here last night and am hooked. I started with a pomegranatini and the garlicky hummus. Five stars for both. I had the strawberry/blueberry cashew salad. Again, five stars! Of course I had to finish my meal off with the warm chocolate nut brownie with vanilla ice cream. Another five stars for Fez. We sat at the bar -- I think our bartender's name was David -- the service was great.  Good times!
