Sergio and his brother are very kind and professional. I ordered a Greek salad tray for my business grand opening and they had it ready on time and even went out of their way to accommodate my schedule by coming into work early and having the tray ready for me to pick up. Excellent service and salad was a big hit! Thanks again!!!
