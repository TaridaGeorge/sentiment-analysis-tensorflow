When it comes to sushi in the beautiful Valley of the Sun...this is the place. No reason to waste your time with other sushi joints. Sakana provides the freshest fish, best selection, and best value. 
My husband likes the atmosphere...always a good scene...
We will be back again, and again.

I had lunch at the 59th Ave and 101 the other day for lunch. Smaller than the one on Hayden, same layout and lots of great sushi.
