This is one of those hole in the wall restaurants you hear good stuff about and is actually true!

When I first arrived I was a bit apprehensive having to write you name with pencil down on a piece of paper that the hostess only checked every so often. After about a 30 min wait (Saturday morning) we got a table. It is a very small place but cozy and bright as could be.

From the coffee to the breakfast sandwich, everything was great. As long as you aren't counting calories I would recommend it to anyone.
