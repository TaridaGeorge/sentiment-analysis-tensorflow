I live in the neighborhood and have become a regular at Beckett's Table.  This review is long overdue, so better late than never.  I've been going into the restaurant since about a month after they opened.  I've been in countless times.  The food is incredible, the service is always genuine and friendly, and the atmosphere is laid back and welcoming.  Justin(the chef and restaurant namesake) and Scott(his front of the house manager and partner) are two of the nicest human beings you will ever meet.  They care and it shows!
