5 stars just for the shakes! They have really great chocolate shakes, so good we went back a second time just for them.

The breakfast was also good. Classic diner style, with big portions. Only disappointment was the biscuits - tasted a little rubbery and right out of the microwave, otherwise a solid place for a meal.
