So I've been to Thai Hut several times, and have been a fan since day one. I was stuck on the Drunken Noodles with Chicken, but decided to try their Pad Thai one day. Boy am I happy I did, this is my favorite version of the dish I've had so far!  I'm definitely not a Thai food afficianado, but this is the best I've had. The one drawback is you don't get to order the amount of spice you want, like in a more traditional Thai restaurant.
