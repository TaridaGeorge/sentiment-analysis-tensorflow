I absolutely LOVE yogurt builderz! Just moved here from MI and loved my "Only 8" yogurt. Yogurt Builderz carries it! They have great selection of flavors and plenty of toppings to choose from. I really like the idea of creating your own yogurt- being able to mix flavors and add your own toppings. Their prices are lower than other places that I have gone to. I highly recommend at least trying it. I'm addicted!
