Harlow's is so darn good.  Whenever i come here i always order the Eggs Maximilian with Chorizo because it's soooo tasty.  Their portions are huge and their service is super quick.  They fill up and are always full because it's so popular and so good.  There are always people leaving so it's usually not more than a 20 min wait at the most.  They have a huge menu with a huge variety.  It's a little pricier but worth it.  I would eat here every weekend if i could.  Another place i will miss when i move out of AZ.  

ps. Great place for a hangover.
