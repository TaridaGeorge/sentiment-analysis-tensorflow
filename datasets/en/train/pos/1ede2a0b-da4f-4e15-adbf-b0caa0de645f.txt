the 5 star is from my hubby... he loves this place and said everything hes ever gotten here was delicious... i on the other hand would give it a 4 start... im not a sandwich person and this place doesnt have the good italian pastas that i would order... the food was just okay for my tasting but their desserts are delicious... we got the sfogliatelle to go and ate them on the way home. they have italian sauces/pasta/desserts packaged up from other brands that you could buy. the workers there seem to know their costumers that come in so im guessing people keep coming back... ill have to try it out again next time the hubby goes
