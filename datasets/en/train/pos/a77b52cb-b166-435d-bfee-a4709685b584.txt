MB Motors is a family run establishment that only services Mercedes-Benz automobiles and if you have a Mercedes-Benz, this is the place to take your car for service.  I was referred here by someone a couple years ago and every experience I've had with MB Motors has been outstanding.  They will take the time to tell you, and show you, what needs repaired; they will complete the repair quickly; and their pricing can't be beat.  In fact, I often feel like I should be paying them more than they charge, given the amount of time they often spend with me and my car.  They won't sell you a service you don't need, and they take the time needed to correctly identify a problem.  Take your car here - you won't be disappointed.
