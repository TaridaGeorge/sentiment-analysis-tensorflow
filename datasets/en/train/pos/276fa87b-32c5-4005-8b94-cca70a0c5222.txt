I've only been here once, but as far as that experience goes..it was amazing. We got the Rattlesnake, Little mermaid, Cinderella, & edamame. Everything was so so good. Especially for going in with zero expectations..(good sushi in az is just too hard to find) So many creative rolls, an extensive menu and the server was patient and sweet, even though we had a table of 12 + 2 Rowdy kids. $1 well drinks and $2.50 beers. The place plays music, but not too loudly. 
Food is so much better than RA. Can't wait to go back again.
