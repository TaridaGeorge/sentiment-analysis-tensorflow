This place is great!  Best Pizza I have found in the west.  My husband and and I are from queens, and only here on a short term basis for work, so we are always on the search for what we call "Real food".  This place fits the bill.  The guy who runs it and makes the Pizza is from Staten Island, and understands how to make a pizza correctly.  The crust is very crunchy and the sauce is just a little sweet.  This is a NY pizza.  Best way you can tell with out even trying a slice, ask them how they make their White Pizza.  If they have no idea what you are talking about, no NY, if they put extra crap, not NY.  This place, they do it perfectly.  Eat here, you'll be glad you did.
