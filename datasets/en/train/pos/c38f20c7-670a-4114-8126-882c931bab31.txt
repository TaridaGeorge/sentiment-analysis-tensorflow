I never leave reviews but I always check Yelp for reccomendations on good eats.  I HAD to leave a review for this place because the food is OUTSTANDING!  The owner and his wife and daughter were all working and were all extremely friendly (they're form Hawaii) and the food was very flavorful and perfectly cooked and presented.  I have been veggie for 7 years now and haven't found a place I love this much since I lived in NYC.  Oh and they're mango pudding for dessert was to die for.  5 stars awesome place!  I would go every day if it was more convenient to me.
