The staff made me feel so welcome to my new neighborhood and more importantly took care of my eye needs in short order. My objectives were to get an eye exam and inquire about Lasik.  The eye exam was a joy with Suzi as my "Cruise Director" and Dr. Heffelfinger was very informative about my vision 'present' and 'future'. In the end I'm confident about my choice and look forward to next years' exam.
