We used to live right by the Tempe location and were spoiled by our proximity to great food and beer.  Now that we live out of state, Four Peaks is but a happy dream.....until this past weekend, when we found ourselves back in the PHX for work reasons.  Got a great deal on a hotel near the Scottsdale 4Peaks and dropped by to indulge ourselves for old times' sake.  The food and service are consistently good and the atmosphere is always fun.  Our dinner that night consisted of the Hopknot IPA ($4.50 I think), soup and sandwich combo (Santa Fe chicken soup and roast beef sandwich, $7) and Garden burger ($9).  All were fabulous.  The soup was nice and spicy and the burger was delightfully moist and juicy, just like a "real" burger.  :)  

We raise a glass to ya, Four Peaks.  Cheers!
