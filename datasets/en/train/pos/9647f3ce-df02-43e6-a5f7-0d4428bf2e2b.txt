Wow what a great place!  I was in town for business and stopped for dinner.  The pint is only $4 for their microbrewed beer!  Happy hour runs until 6pm or 10pm to close.  The atmosphere is great and the food was delicious as well.  I got the Italian Beef on beerbread and it is enough to feed two folks for $9.  I had their award winning 8th street and Kilt LIfter and it was great.  If you are unsure of what to get, they offer the sampler for only $9.  All in all, it is a great place to go whether you are inside or outside.
