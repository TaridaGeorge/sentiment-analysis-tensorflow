It looks like I am not alone...I absolutely LOVE this place!  I have purchased many unique items here and stop in every time I am in the neighborhood.  The staff is very helpful - have helped me ship items to my other home in Dallas too.  The merchandise is ever changing and very reasonably priced.  For anyone that loves France or Paris, you must stop in and take yourself away...really feels like you have stepped into an antique store in France.
