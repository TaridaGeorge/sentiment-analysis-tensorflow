This place is so unbelievably cool. In a city desperate for arts, this is perfect! "Her Secret is Patience" is a bold statement for downtown, a sign of youth, renaissance, and complexity. It's serenity and over-looming stature make it something to admire. I wish more public spaces in the Valley were this awesome. 

It's worth checking out, even if it's not your taste in art, you've got to admit it's pretty interesting. Be sure to see at at night too! Lot's of beautiful colors accent the homogenized office buildings. :)
