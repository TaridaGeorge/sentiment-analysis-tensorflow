I felt butterflies in my stomach as soon as I walked in and started looking through racks of clothing.  The buyer for this store has amazing taste: lots of up-and-coming designers and items straight from NY, not the LA garment district.  The selection is killer!

It's been a while since I got excited over a selection of clothes.  God only knows I use every spare minute of my week to find good items.
