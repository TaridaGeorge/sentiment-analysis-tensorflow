I just called Duane to see if he could come repair my dish disposal. 

Instead of coming out and charging me for the service, Duane walked me through on how to fix my own disposal. I was successful at fixing it with his help and it made me feel awesome about being able to fix something on my own!

I will most definitely being using him again in the future!
