Kerry is very professional.  I was looking to have my eye lashes permed...not very many salons provide this service.  I have been there twice just for the perm.  She does an excellent job.  My first visit she told me how long the perm would last, made sure I was comfortale and before I left asked if I was satisfied.  I get the perm for special occasions and I am so please with how it turns out.
