I can't afford my reading habit so end up here often. Lots of computers available if you don't have access at home. They also have a new program where you can "check out" passes to local museums. Some participants include Pueblo Grande, AZ Science Center, & the Botanical Gardens. This branch also has meeting rooms if you need space for a not for profit to meet up.
