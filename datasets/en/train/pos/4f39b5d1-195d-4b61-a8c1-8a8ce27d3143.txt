Student dentists are caring and compassionate and eager to do their best.  They are also humble and smart enough to ask for help when they need it.

NOTE: I'm biased because I'm a student dentist here.

The faculty here is amazing.

If you have lots of time and not as much money, this is a good option for you.  

Upsides of being a patient here: you have multiple eyes looking so you know you're getting the best of care and it's less expensive than going to a private office.

Downsides of being a patient here: appointments can take up to 3.5 hours long each time and there is a long process to things because it is a teaching clinic.
