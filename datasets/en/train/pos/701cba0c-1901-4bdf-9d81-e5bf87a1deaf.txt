Toyota pavilion is a hidden gem.  Under the decks you have a player entry view while having free drinks and an excellent buffet with good quality chefs.  Desserts are over the top.  I am amazed each event has a unique theme and a variety of dinners.  Tabletops are limited.  Use the player entrance to get to your seats.
