Superb gelato - some of the best I've ever had! The guy behind the counter is the owner, and he takes pride in his gelato.

They only use real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup, and nothing contains hydrogenated oil.

I tasted a few flavors and settled on the coconut... it was sublime. 

Definitely some of the best Gelato I have ever had. When I need a mid day sugar rush... I'll be back!
