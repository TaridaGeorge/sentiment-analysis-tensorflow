I've stopped into this Walgreens for random things before, it's not on my usual list for toiletries and such but I didn't feel like driving to Walmart.  I was strolling around their beauty section and a couple of the sales associates actually asked me if I was finding everything ok. One of the associates who was working the counter in that dept came over and offered me a sample of the product I was looking at. A sample? At Walgreens? I had no idea. She even mentioned that she tried the product herself and told me that it's a good seller. Wow! I've never had such personal service before at a Walgreens. It was a nice surprise. 
I think they are pushing a new slogan because both she and the associate on my way out the door told me to "Be Well". Thanks :)
