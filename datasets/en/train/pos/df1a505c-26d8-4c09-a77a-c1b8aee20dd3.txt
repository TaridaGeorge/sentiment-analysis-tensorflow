After finally going I definitely believe all the hype. Everything I got was delicious; the pancakes, waffle, eggs, bacon, hash browns and even fresh squeezed orange juice. I got there at 9:20 on a Sunday and there was about an hour wait, but it was well worth it. 

It is a very small restaurant, but that obviously does not stop the people from enjoying their great food. The service was on point, our food came out right away and when I ordered some extra things, that came out right away too. I would definitely like to try their lunch menu as well.
