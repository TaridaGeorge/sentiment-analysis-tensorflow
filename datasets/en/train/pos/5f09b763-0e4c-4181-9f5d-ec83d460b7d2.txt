Love love love Mabel's! It has by far the best atmosphere of any bar/lounge in Old Town Scottsdale and the drinks are awesome. I haven't eaten there yet, but what I saw of the food looked good too. 

I always get a Pimm's Cup and my boyfriend is a big fan of the Vioux Carre. The bartenders are really good and can make almost any drink. 

The best part is that their happy hour goes until 9 and with food starting at $3 and drinks at $5.
