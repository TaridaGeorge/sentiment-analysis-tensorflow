This is my favorite venue for entertainment.  I went to Maragaret Cho here and all of the seating is very good no matter where you are at.  We paid for a higher price point ticket which was at about row 19 towards the center section.  Staff are friendly, the vendors prices are  a bit ridiculous,so passed on any libations and got some afterwards.  I won't fault the Dodge for this directly but the vendors contracted.  Crowds also tend to behave not as trashy as at US Airways or Cricket pavillon which is a plus
