I have never stayed here, but when I lived in Scottsdale, I spent a lot of Saturday nights here.  Talk about tranquil, beautiful, relaxing........I've had drinks, I've sung karaoke, I've listened to some great music, I've taken gondola rides and been serenaded only in Italian by the gondolier's operatically trained voices, I've eaten dinner at their wonderful restaurant.  I've sat outdoors with the paradise-like vegetation, I've walked by their sandy beach area and the wading pool.  I just love this place.  Maybe someday I'll even stay here.
