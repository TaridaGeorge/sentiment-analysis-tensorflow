If you're in Tempe or Phoenix I HIGHLY recommend Pita Jungle - one of my favorite restaurants of all time - heathy, tasty & amazing!  The food & ambience turned a pouting 12yr old into a happy kid again: and I think that's about the most amazing thing you can say about food. 
We split the Mediterranean Sampler Platter, Chicken over Cilantro Jalepeno Hummus (YUM! It's in the pics - looks like chicken over guacamole), 4 drinks and fed this family of 4 for $33!  Can't beat that at a great restaurant!!!
Love, love, love this place - been coming since there was just the Tempe location on Apache back in the mid-90's.
