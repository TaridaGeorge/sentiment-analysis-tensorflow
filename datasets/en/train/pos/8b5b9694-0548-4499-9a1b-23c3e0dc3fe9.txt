I've only been here a few times, but every time I have, the atmosphere has been very chill and the service has been fast. I just tried their chai today- made by Steve himself. Don't be fooled by the fact your milk won't turn that pink/rust color- the chai is excellent. It's a little sweet, but very smooth with an even blend of spices. I hope to see a real spicy chai from them someday. Also had some of their espresso- very even flavors. Bravo. Barista was very knowledgable.
