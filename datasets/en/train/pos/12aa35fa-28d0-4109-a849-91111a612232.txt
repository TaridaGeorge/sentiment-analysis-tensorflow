As far as gas stations go, this one is turning into one of my favorites.  I haven't tried the car wash, but the service here is really friendly and the gas prices are lower than other places around (especially if you pay cash).  It's also near the 101 at Baseline, so it's convenient on top of everything else if you need to gas up and go.
