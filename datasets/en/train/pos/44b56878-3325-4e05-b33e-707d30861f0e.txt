Ohhhh LGO, how I love you. You are the perfect place to go on a date, with a friend, with my family, with a group, by myself, with work associates, etc. 

There is a bit of a wait if you go during peak times; however it is worth it. 

The caprice salad, when they have it, is INCREDIBLE. Do not pass that up if your server mentions it. On a budget? Pick up a bottle in the store (prices do start around $9.99) and they'll open it for you to enjoy at dinner (or before dinner if you are waiting.)

The pizzas may sound kind of funky if you are new to the joint, but don't fear. They know what they are doing.
