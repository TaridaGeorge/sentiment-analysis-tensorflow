I have been searching for a new hairstylist for over a year after a really emotional dilema left me needing a new stylist.

Alyse is FANTASTIC!  She was timely, did a wonderful job with my cut and color, and was fun to chat with.  She was extremely well priced, especially given the location and her experience.  I am SO excited to say that my search for a stylist is finally over, and I'm looking forward to getting my hair done again with her.
