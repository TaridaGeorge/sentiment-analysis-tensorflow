Before I got to wear scrubs to work, which is probably the greatest thing ever, this was my go to dry cleaner.  Everything is $2.25, and if you have it in before 9, it's done by 3:30.  The staff was friendly, and everything is basic and simple, the way it should be.  I kind of miss having to get my work clothes dry cleaned.  They only accept debit cards (w/ a .50 fee) or cash.
