Hands down best darn fry bread around!  Loved the tasty meat on the taco and its authenticity.  Tried one for dessert with the powdered sugar-yummy!  Friendly smiling faces serving it up too. I no longer have to wait for the state fair to come around to get my Indian Fry Bread fix whenever I'm in town.  Lots of fans too, great prices. I always see a line! The story behind the truck is great too, third generation keeping the family dream alive.  Love it!
