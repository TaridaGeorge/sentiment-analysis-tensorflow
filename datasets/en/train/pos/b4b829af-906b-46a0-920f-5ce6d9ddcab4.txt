I'm so happy to have found this place. And it's in my neighborhood! Everything is very reasonably priced and the staff was very helpful. My little maltese mix is quite a chewer which means I'm always having to buy new toys. I've saved a bundle here! I've even purchased a toy for $3 that I've seen for $15 - $20 at the pet store. They have a huge assortment of toys, grooming products and treats so you'll have no problem spending the required $25.
