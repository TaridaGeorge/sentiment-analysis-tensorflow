AJ's is a nicely decorated specialty store. I first compared the look and quality of the food to Whole Foods Market. 

It was fun to go through each of the aisles. I found a lot of the Food Network personality's food item, such as Barefoot Contessa, Paula Deen, and Emeril. In addition, there were some foods imported from other countries.

I found Turducken in the frozen food aisle for $55!! 

There's also a hot food deli section which looked good. In addition, there was a guy making sushi, like CA rolls. You can request specialty sushi for $10, such as Dragon Roll.

Expensive place to do grocery shopping, but it's good for those hard-to-find items at a regular grocery store.
