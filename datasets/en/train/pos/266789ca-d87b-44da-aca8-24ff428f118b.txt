If you go for lunch, order the salmon salad! I don't care for anything else on the lunch menu that I have tried.

If you go for dinner, order the prime rib! It is HUGE (one other Yelper referred to it being "Flinstone sized") and it's less than $20! The huge slab is covered in a very tasty demi-glaze. For less than $20, you get a very green salad (not iceburg), your choice of potato (I like the cheesy garlic mashed) and a veggie, plus a basket of bread. Your dog will love you as you will likely need a doggy bag, if you are willing to share your leftovers.

The atmosphere is relaxing. It is located inside Embassy Suites, so unless the hotel is busy, the restaurant won't be. Great for a Saturday night if you want a good prime rib and want to avoid the crowds.
