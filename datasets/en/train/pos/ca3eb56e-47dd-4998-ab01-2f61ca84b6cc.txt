What a cool concept: quality brats and great beer all around!
Paid my visit for a weekday lunch, so it wasn't very crowded. The beer brat sandwich I had was fantastic (great hoagie!). I added some sauerkrat and sweet peppers to it to give it a little umph, and it was great. The Belgium fries were also a pleasant surprise as well. I didn't order a beer but I was excited to see all of the types of beer they had on tap.....next time! Our server was on the ball and amazing. What else can I say......except I want to go back!
