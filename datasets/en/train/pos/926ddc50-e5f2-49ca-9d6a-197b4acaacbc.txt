It was great to go to this place. I am from around the Chicago area and use to go to a Potbelly's around once a week. I was really pumped up to see one here. I walked in  and ordered the wreck sandwhich and some chips. After the first bite I was hooked. I finished my food and got right back in line again and had another sandwhich.  I don't live close to this location but I will be driving up here at least once a month to go here. The service was also great.
