Liberty Market is the closest thing to La Grande Orange that the East Valley has. The staff is very courteous, and the food is so fresh and tasty. I love the Demi Breakfast (bacon pancake, eggs,grilled meatball - yes I said grilled meatball - toast & fruit) and the little shots of Cuban coffee for breakfast, and the pizza and salads for lunch or dinner. The baked goods are out of this world! (think red velvet cake and gigantic cinnamon rolls). Joe, the owner, is there quite a bit and is very nice - as are the rest of the staff. It's just a nice, pleasant, cool place to eat, drink coffee or shop for kitschy gifts and knick-knacks.Love it!
