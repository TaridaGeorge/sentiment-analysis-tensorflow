This is the nicest city pool in the whole east valley. It is more like a small water park. A huge lap pool, a seperate pool with a large kiddie play area, 2 water slides, spray pad, whirlpool, lazy river. Cheap fun for the whole family. Hours vary so go to their website for summer hours. They do get VERY busy in the summer and are often to capacity by 1pm so go when they open, or later in the afternoon around 2 or 3 and you should be fine.
