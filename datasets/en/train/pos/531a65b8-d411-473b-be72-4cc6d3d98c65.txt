The bf and I went here, had some drinks, and dinner, easily fulfilling the 2 item requirement.  The food was surprisingly good and our seats had a great view of the stage.  The servers were incredibly nice, and even though it was more expensive than some other places we've been to, the entertainment value totally makes up for it!  I live too far away, but they have some other special deal that gives you a free ticket if you buy 2... i would have paid more attention if I lived close enough to go back, but it sounded like a good deal!
