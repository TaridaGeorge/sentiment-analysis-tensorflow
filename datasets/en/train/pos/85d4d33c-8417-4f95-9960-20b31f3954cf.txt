I took my husband here for his 40th birthday and we were both very impressed. The atmosphere was beautiful. We were fortunate enough to have a table near the window so we had a fantastic view of the valley at sunset. Our waiter was fantastic (not stuffy) and the food impeccable. 

Obviously on the pricey side, but that is to be expected for an establishment such as this. Might catch a star or two. We saw Steve Nash at the bar.
