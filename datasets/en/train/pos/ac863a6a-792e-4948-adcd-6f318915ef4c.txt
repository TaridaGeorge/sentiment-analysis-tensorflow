wth?! why does Lucille's only have 3 stars?! this place is amazingly delicious and I'm glad I didn't read the yelp reviews before coming here.

So let's make this short... I got the tri-tip sandwich and mac and cheese since the waiter suggested both. It was amazing!!!! The meat was sooo good, and the sauces were delish. I have never had mac and cheese that delicious in my life. Also, I don't know why people are saying the prices are high.. it seemed pretty standard for a sit down restaurant. 

Anyways, I'm 8 months pregnant and since Lucille's, bbq has become my new obsession!! I've never had bbq from the south or anything, but I've tried a couple other bbq places around the area and I have yet to find a place as good as Lucille's.
