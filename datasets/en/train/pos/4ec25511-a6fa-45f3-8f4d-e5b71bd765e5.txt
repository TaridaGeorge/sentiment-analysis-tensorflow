A Phoenician Phenom!!  We had waited a bit before attending this mecca and Wow was the food ever perfect!  We enjoyed the Osso Bucco & the Spare Ribs.  Desert we had the Smores.

The place is as cool as they come, and the Chef runs a very organized and OCD clean operation!   Front of the house was managed by a husband & wife team that seem to have perfected the art of running a high end restaurant!

The food was perfect, more importantly the prices were not to be believed!!!    The smores for desert was a kick in the pants and we cannot wait to return!!!!!!!   One of Phoenix AZ Best eateries.

Best service to date!!  These people must be related to Southwest Airlines as there is no other operation that prioritizes customer service more then SWA and Beckett's Table has MASTERED the art of customer service.
