i just started climbing a few months ago but thanks to climb max, i'm a  true addict! the first time i went i got great instruction and everyone was very helpful. the atmosphere is very welcoming and relaxed and there are climbers of all levels there. you can do both top rope and bouldering there and the staff is super knowledgeable. it's been a while since i've gotten to go but i'm looking forward to returning and signing up for a long term membership!
