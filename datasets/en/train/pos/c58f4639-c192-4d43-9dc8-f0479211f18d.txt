Great food and drinks. On the pricey side but worth it. 

I had the Fez Burger that has spicy honey molasses bbq, cinnamon pears, feta, lemon garlic aioli, crispy onions, & cilantro on ciabatta. SO GOOD. The food is delicious and the drinks are tasty. Definitely one of the more modern, trendy spots to hang out. :)
