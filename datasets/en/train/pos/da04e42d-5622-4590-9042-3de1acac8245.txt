I'm married to a Japanese and work for Japanese company. I've been to Japan I don't know how many times and have eaten well there. This is simply top class, I'd even say special. The style is a kind of fusion ranging from basically pure Japanese to Japanese with some very tasteful western inflections. I'm not in Phoenix often. But this will be on my list every time I go if I have anything to say about it.
