I've been in Arizona for almost five years and have finally found a Thai place worth recommending to my friends! Completely unassuming, nestled in a partially empty strip center the inside is elegant yet simple. Booths are a little tight so if you bring friends and big-boned buddies you may have to wait for table seating. I had the Pad-see-ew and it practically melted in my mouth! Went for late lunch and it was empty but be sure to arrive before 2:30pm as they close to get ready for dinner. Best Thai place out here by far!
