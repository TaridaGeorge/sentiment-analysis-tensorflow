This place has Portland coffee! 

Ok, not really, but seriously - it's got the same muddy, murky, delicious quality that reminds me of rainy days in coffee shops in March in Oregon. I ordered the house French press, which for $2.75 is maybe the best deal in Tempe - it provided me two (and some change) cups of amazing coffee. 

The atmosphere is pretty great, too. The barista was nice and gave me a lot of info when I inquired about their beans (they are supplied by Cortez Coffee, a local roaster). 

Like the other reviewers mentioned, it's a great spot to take a book and spend some hours reading and people watching. 

Solo might be my new coffee crush.
