I love this property!  It is tucked nicely on the side of a mountain and when you enter the property grounds, you feel like you checked out of Phx and stepped into a nice tropic bungalow. I think the pools are beautiful and the rates aren't too terrible.  The rooms are very contemporary, which made it very 5-starrish.  But the price of the mini-bar in the room - STAY AWAY!
