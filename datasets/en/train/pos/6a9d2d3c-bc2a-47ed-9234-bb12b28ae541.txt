If you haven't tried this place then your missing out. I was introduced to this place over a year ago by my sister. One day my husband and I went there for the first time on my birthday. I was suggested to get the fontina burger with a side of sweet potato fries and let me tell you....my tummy was very happy. Everything is made with their fresh veggies which is grown in their farm. Everyone should try out this place I know you will not be disappointed. Trust me. Make sure your try out their sweet potato fries. If Guy Fieri approves of then that tells u something.
