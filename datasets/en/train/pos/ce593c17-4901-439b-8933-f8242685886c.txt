This is my favorite breakfast place ever. I've moved around a lot and never had that "neighborhood breakfast joint" that the locals go to, and now I finally do. (Smiles!) Their omlettes are absolutely delicious, you can either make your own or pick from a few that they have created... like The Bird... yum. They have tons of pancakes topped with candied nuts, fruit purees, whipped cream, and even ice cream. Is this really breakfast?! :) They also have a number of healthy options, you can order egg whites, and they have great fresh fruits, oatmeal, and yogurt. I love their toasted bagels and soy lattes. Their lunches are actually really good too... I've had their Turkey Club Wrap and it was great, breakfast is still served all day though. I recommend going early though! It gets packed after 8am on weekends and usually even weekdays.
