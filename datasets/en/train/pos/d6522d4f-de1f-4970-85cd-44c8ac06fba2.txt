The revival has begun.. the Sail Inn has reopened! Granted it's a little bit nicer inside (due to the remodeling done by Trax) but it's the Sail Inn I've known and loved for some time. I've been visiting since the late 90's. Same owners, same bartenders, familiar faces, friendly people, hippies, jam bands, cheap beer. You really can't go wrong!
