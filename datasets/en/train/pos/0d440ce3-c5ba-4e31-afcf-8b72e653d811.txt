The food is fresh - the lunch bowls are so customizable that nobody can really have an excuse to leave hungry or unhappy.  

The service is prompt and unfussy, this place knows its business and its customers and does a great job of lunch. 

The parking lot is gruesome, but that can't be helped on this corner.
If I didn't have a 35 mile commute, this would be a happy hour goto for sure.
