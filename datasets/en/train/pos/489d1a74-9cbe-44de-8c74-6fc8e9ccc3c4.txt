The pizza is ok, but nothing special. The big draw is the organ, of course! Organ Stop is a great place for having a fun evening with a group. I went last night with my girlfriend and her family, and we had a blast!

Definitely go early, as this place fills up fast! (Same with tune requests & birthday announcements. Get em in early.)

The crowd is quite diverse. Little kids having birthdays are quite common, as are those from the 75+ crowd.
