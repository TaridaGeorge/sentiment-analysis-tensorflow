My husband and I love this restaurant. We have been many times and were so happy when they opened this location in Gilbert. The manager is great and always remembers us, even though we only come in about once a month or so. The sushi is always good and consistent. Love their happy hour menu. They have a nice variety on their menu to cater to sushi fans. The martinis are awesome. We love that we can come here and they have sports on the TV's. By and far some of the best sushi in the valley.
