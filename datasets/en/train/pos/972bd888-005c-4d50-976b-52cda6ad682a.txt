I discovered this place by smell after driving past it for a few months.  They smell up the whole area for a few blocks around with delicious BBQ aroma when they are cooking.  I tried the brisket, it was very tasty.  The plate came with texas toast and 2 sides and the portions were decent.  I split the "heavyweight" with my girlfriend and we were both full.  I can't wait to go back and give their pulled pork a try.  I would definitely recommend giving Tha Spot a shot.
