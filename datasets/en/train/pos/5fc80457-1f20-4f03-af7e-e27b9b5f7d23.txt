Stay away from this place because it's too yummy, you can't handle it. The Philly chee steak sandy made me feel like hurting all the other posers who had been selling me cheese steak lies previously. Plus, the friendly guy behind the register recommended that I add avocado. Who knew?? Flavor shotgun blast to my dome!
