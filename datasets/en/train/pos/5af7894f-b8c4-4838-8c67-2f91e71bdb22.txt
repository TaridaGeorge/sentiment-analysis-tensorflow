I discovered this today at my local Farmer's Market and I am now addicted. I don't think I can ever go back to store pasta. They had samples of the spinach basil garlic pasta and it was delicious. When we asked what sauce they used, I was shocked to hear just butter and a pinch of salt - all of the flavor came from the pasta itself!
