I LOVE the Wag!  Their employees know every item in the store, so any question you have about health, grooming, you name it, they know it.  I prefer to treat myself and my pets naturally and anytime I have needed something, they have had it in stock. 
Last year I used the self wash with my dog and found it very easy as they had everything I could ever want in a handy bucket - they really have thought of everything.  
If you haven't stopped in to check it out, you should go next door and get a coffee and copper star and stroll around.
