Great little coffee shop. I noticed it while driving down 7th Ave. the other day and it looked so quaint I decided to return for a drink. I recommend the black tea they have. It's delicious and pretty generous for $2. The atmosphere is relaxed with what sounds like the silversun pickup station playing in the background. The staff is friendly and welcoming.
