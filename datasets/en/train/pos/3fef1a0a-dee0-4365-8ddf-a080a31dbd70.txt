Pane Bianco is #7 on my speed dial, so I can call them and ask what their Market Sandwich of the day is!  My mom is #8.  Is that bad?

I have grown up eating italian sandwiches from my neighborhood, my entire life.  So ever since I moved here, I've been comparison shopping.  I still love Alpine, Gene's Deli, and Freddy's, but marone!   

The ingredients and preparations are simple, which puts them on another level.

Menu-simple and straightforward.
Bread-disturbing
Mozzarella texture and taste- truly homemade.
Tomatoes- Sea salt and Fresh Ground Pepper!
Counter Girls-Word up.
Price-a tad high, but I would almost pay double.
Salty piece of Caramel or Fudge Candy- Thank You. 

I'm pushing #7 right now, to see if there is anything to sway me away from getting the Mozzarella or Sopressata sandwich today.
