Silly greenbelt, how can I not give you 5 stars and a "woohoo"?! Escaping from the smoggy and not-so-pedestrian/biker-friendly streets, I enjoy many a run and bike through this pseudo-paradise. No, Arizona shouldn't naturally have little lakes and rolling green hills for mile after mile....but...as the environmentalist in me tsk tsks...I always appreciate a park... and have to love this nice gem of an oasis.
