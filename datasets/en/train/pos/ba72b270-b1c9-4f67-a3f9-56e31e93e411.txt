This Inn is really called the Inn at Eagle Mountain. We stayed there weekend and were blown away by how beautiful this place was. Our room was large (we got the suite) and really comfortable. The view was beautiful. At night, it is so quiet you can hear your heart beat. In the morning, watching the sunrise over the mountains is spectacular. And best of all, it was REALLY reasonable pricing. Go figgur... And the service and support staff were very helpful and pleasant. Great place!
