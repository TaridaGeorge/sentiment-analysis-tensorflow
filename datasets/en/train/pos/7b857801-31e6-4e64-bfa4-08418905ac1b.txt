Every time I travel to Phoenix, I go to Miracle Mile. It is usually my first stop after I leave the airport. While San Francisco (where I am from) is known for its world-class restaurants, there are no great delis. Every deli in my city--from the traditional deli to the is-this-meat-or-is-this-tofu deli--pales in comparison to Miracle Mile. Either the deli has day-old, rubber-like meat or has bread so stale that a pigeon wouldn't eat it.
 

The sandwiches at Miracle Mile, in stark contrast to all of the other delis I've frequented, provide the perfect marriage between great meat and great bread. Their brisket and pastrami sandwiches are so good that every time I bite into them, I'm transported to another realm of consciousness!
