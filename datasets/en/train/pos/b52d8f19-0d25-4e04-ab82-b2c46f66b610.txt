Thoroughly enjoyed splitting a small house salad and a small pizza today!
Great amount to share for lunch WITH left overs.  

Started with the House Salad that has roasted red bell peppers, fresh mushrooms, cherry tomatoes,  crisp lettuce and tossed with a tasty Italian vinaigrette.  Followed up with the "Personal Pizza" a 9 " topped with veggies, Grimaldi's delicious sauce and just the right amount of cheese for a crunchy thin crusted pizza.  Is your mouth watering yet?  

Doesn't break the bank and great service to boot!
