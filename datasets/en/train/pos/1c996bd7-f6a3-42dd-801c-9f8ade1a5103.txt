I don't know what it is about this place that brought out the FUN in all of us that went. We had such a good time with friends and family. I cant wait to go back next year. 

We came to see the DODGERS. Fans could be up close to the players. Its more family oriented than the stadium. 

The prices are almost the same as the stadium prices. 
Lots of energy, great vibe, fun environment!
