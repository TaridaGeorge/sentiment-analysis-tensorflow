You haven't had great gelato until you've gone to Angel Sweet!  I tried Angel sweet over the weekend, and it did not disappoint, and there is huge variety of flavors.  I only tired 2 flavors so far-Panna cota, and Oreo but its superior above any gelato I ever tasted.  My husband had the tropical fruit and Mint chocolate flavor, which I loved and we ended up trading my Panna cota for his Mint chocolate.  This is my new favorite gelato place, because unfortunately its does not compare to the current gelato place we go to.
