Rain Massage - ever had 1??  This is the 2nd time I've taken advantage  the couples massage room :-)  

The Rain Massage was unique - using rain sticks as background sounds, as well as smaller rain sticks utilized for massaging during the massage.

If you are bored with 'regular' massages, this is a cool alternative to try - espcially together.

FYI - with any/all spa treaments, you have use of the rest of the facilites: work-out room, pilates & yoga classes, adult pool, steam room, jacuzzi, ect.  This is located in the Westin Kierland Resort.
