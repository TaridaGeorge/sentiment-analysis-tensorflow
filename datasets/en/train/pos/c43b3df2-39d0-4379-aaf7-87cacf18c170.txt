This last thursday night was my first night out to McCormick and Schmicks. 
The food was simply AMAZING! The menus are updated twice daily, one for lunch and one for dinner. The menu was even dated :)  This showed what was fresh and in season. 
I ordered the Alaskan Crab Legs that melted in your mouth! It came with a side of clam chowder that was out of this world! And served with potatoes and amazingly fresh vegtables.
After a few rounds of drinks for the 4 of us the total bill was close to $200. So for about $50 a person you leave with a full stomach, left-overs for lunch the next day and GREAT taste in your mouth!!!
