I went here to buy some slacks, shirts, shoes, etc, since I came to Scottsdale unprepared with jeans and a t-shirt. 

Very cool dude in the men's department helped me pick out some slacks, shirts, and shoes. To my surprise, they tailored the slacks within a few minutes of trying it on. I was stunned. It was very crowded and they still managed to help me out with an emergency tailoring almost immediately. 

For us guys who hate to shop, this place can't be beat.
