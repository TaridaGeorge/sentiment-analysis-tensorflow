First off, I've got to say that the location and decor of this place is awesome. Great job by whoever is responsible for that. This is a great place for a date, or for brunch with friends on the weekends. The food is excellent and the service is outstanding. I would go more often, but it is a little on the pricy side... but well worth it.
