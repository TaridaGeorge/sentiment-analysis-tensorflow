Love...love...love Spinatos!  Honestly, one of the best pizzas in town.  I've been eating here since the mid 90's and it has consistently been great!  I usually get the Super Six.  It has everything on there except the kitchen sink!   The thin crust is never ever soggy and that sweet sauce is like crack to me!  The service is always great.  Do expect a wait on Fridays and Saturdays.  If you have more than 8 people in your party, prepare to wait atleast 1 hour or more on busy nights.  For an appetizer, totally go for the bruschetta!
