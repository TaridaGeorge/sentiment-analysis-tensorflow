Visited on a Tuesday night at the end of June - place was pretty packed for a Tuesday.  I had the North Central Chicken, which is apparently a new menu item and wonderful.  Almost like a spicy BBQ sauce on the chicken and some sort of corn/green chile sauce that was fantasic.  The corn was cut off the cob and you could tell it was super fresh.  Came with mashed red potatoes.  The smaller portion option was a perfect amount of food.  Paired with a glass of white wine, a perfect hot summer meal that I didn't have to cook!  Oh - and you have to get the guacamole.  I don't think you can eat a meal there without having the guacamole first.
