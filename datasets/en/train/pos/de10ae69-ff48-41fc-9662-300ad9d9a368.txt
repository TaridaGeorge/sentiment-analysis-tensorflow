Best burger around these parts.  I had a turkey burger that was moist and flavorful, not easy to do with turkey.  I really like how you pick everything on your burger from the bun to condiments, some of the choices are interesting and tasty (raw jalapenos-hot!).  

Onion rings were not greasy, but had tons of taste-didn't even need ranch or something to dip them in.

My dining guest had the veggie sandwich that was also near perfection, maybe just a touch too much oil on the veggies.  

Only problem for this place is that the center is dead.  6 PM on a Friday and the place was not even 25% capacity.  I hope it makes it as this is a great place to grab a bite.
