I've been to about 20 Vietnamese places. I mainly get pho or rice plates but this place is great. Pho soup tasted great, eggrolls (kinda on the small size) but still taste awesome. And the rice plates or awesome. This was the first time I've had a beef salad and it was soooo good. I would recommend it. Out of all the places I have ate pho this place ranks in my top 5.
