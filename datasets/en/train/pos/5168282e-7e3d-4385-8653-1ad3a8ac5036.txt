I had heard a lot about this place to start off with, but it is definitely one of those "Gotta experience it to believe it!". 

It definitely lived up to its reputation with the most AMAZING oyster plate I have had in a long time! It was stuffed with shrimp, spinach and topped off with some WONDERFUL sauce that drove me absolutely crazy for the place. 
Mind you, it's only Michelina herself cooking for, on a Friday night, over 30 people easy, as far as i could tell. 

At the end of our dinner, she came out and introduced herself to ALL her customers to make sure everything was tasted up to par. How many cooks will do that every night? 

To say the least, I will definitely be seeing her soon and enjoying those DELICIOUS Michelina's Oysters!
