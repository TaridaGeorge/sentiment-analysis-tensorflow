Wow, how did I miss writing a review for one of my favorite eateries? 

I can't even count on both hands the number of times I've indulged in a pasty and beer. Basically, I'm trying to work my way through the menu! :) And for the love of god don't miss out on the dessert.

I love the food and atmosphere. Service is sometimes sub par but hey it's more of a pub atmosphere so it doesn't seem to bother me half as much. 

Eat, drink and be merry with a pasty!
