What I love most about this place is:

1. Pesto Chicken pasta
2. Portion sizes are big
3. Endless samples of their bread of the day

 
I've told people this before, that I'm a true 'bread person' through and through. You don't know what that means? It means that I tend to get full off the complimentary bread before my meal even makes it to the table. There's just something about bread+butter.... mmm..


ANYWAY, this is a nice "let's talk over lunch" or "read my book over lunch" kinda place. Definitely a bistro meets internet cafe tone. Perfect ambiance for a lunch date, a working lunch, or a hungry bite if you're getting your tires rotated next door. It's not really an "in and out", as it takes a while to get your order but you can kill time here easily.
