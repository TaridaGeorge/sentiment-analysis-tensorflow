I've been seeing Dr Wyant at East Valley Foot & Ankle for about 4 years because I've had some foot issues since I was little. I've always been able to get an appointment within a few days and the office staff have been really nice & helpful (even when trying to help me get the referral faxed from my PCP, whose office staff isn't as great). 

I love that they have xray equipment on site and it's been really quick getting into a MRI at EVDI when I've needed one.
