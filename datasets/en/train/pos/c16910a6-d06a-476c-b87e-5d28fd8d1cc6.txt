As far as cupcakes go, this place is great! Yea, yea, yea I know it's expensive, get over it! One cupcake is like a full dessert and you know it's expensive going in so stop complaining. Alright, that's off my chest now...

The red velvet cupcake is amazing, the frosting is unreal. I also like the banana, the muffin part tastes like really good banana bread. I also enjoy the peanut butter chocolate, carrot, black & white, pumpkin and milk chocolate. There are a couple I don't love like lemon and chocolate marshmallow. 

Overall the really good ones are excellent, great for birthdays and other special occasions that give you an excuse to go here.
