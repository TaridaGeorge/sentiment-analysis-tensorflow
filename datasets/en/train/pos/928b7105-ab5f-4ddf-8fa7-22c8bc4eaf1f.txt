Loved this hotel! The rooms were beautiful and modern and the staff was friendly and helpful. They have a really cute restaurant and bar with outdoor seating and a fire pit. We sat outside at night and drank wine by the fire, it was great ambiance. I will definitely be staying here next time I am in the area.
