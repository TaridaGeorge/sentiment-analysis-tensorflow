I love coming to this Starbucks. The Strawberry Frozen Cream is awesome. I have tried the blueberrry bagel, vanilla bean cupcake and the butter croissant and they are all really great. The employees that work here are very friendly. I have enjoyed coming here for the past month. I also love the WiFi. I don't have to worry about the battery going dead because they have many outlets. This location is student friendly. I like sitting inside where the desk is.
