Daily Dose? Yes please!

1. The menu has something wonderful for every palate and food preference.

2. The staff is always friendly and responsive.

3. Their drink specials are phenomenal.

My favorite is brunch time - you can't go wrong with any omelet or my favorite - the Protein and Iron.  The DD Hash is legit.

Daily Dose is our proverbial go-to whenever we are in the area.
