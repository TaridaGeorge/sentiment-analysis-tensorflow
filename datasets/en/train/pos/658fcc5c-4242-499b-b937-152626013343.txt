Really cute place with a modern hipster vibe.    Service is fast and friendly and everything always seems organized and clean.  Their order up front and wait for your food at your table makes it a quick way to have a nice sit down breakfast with your family without the wait of regular sit-down restaurants.  Their veg scramble option has sun dried tomatoes in it which just rocks my world.  They put a lot of thought into making their menu unique and provide delish healthy options above just the "wheat pancakes" of other breakfast places.  My official recommendations are: anything with the veg mix in it, their turkey sausage, wheat pancakes and the lox breakfast.  But truly - everything on the menu is worth having.
