After my last two favs went out of business, this is the new go to place for Froyo.  Don't get me wrong, I really like Orange Leaf, it's just not as close to my house as the other two favs.  This is a destination location, meaning we're on a mission for yogurt when we come.  I guess I'm a little tarted out because I'm really enjoying the white chocolate strawberry and forgoing all tart flavors.  The strawberry cheesecake is also good, but not as good as the white chocolate.   Also, the fruit is always fresh.  This is key for taste and makes my dessert super healthy.  The decor is very trendy and orange, naturally.  The TVs are a big hit with the kids, and the background music is a nice touch.  There always seem to be a few patrons, but also a few available seats for us.
