I have been cautious of Banfield for a long time, but Dr. Blackman at the 90th and Shea location completely put me at ease.  She does everything she can and is truly concerned for the well being of your pet.  She asks the right questions and actually tells you what she would do if her patient were her own pet. She is my veterinarian for life!!!
