this place is so fun and they have awesome hefveisen on tap...very yummy...and the bouncer outside went to alert the waiter who alerted someone else and a guy come out pretty timely to change out the propane tank when our heat lamp was burned out last week so we got to warm up and continue drinking. I always recall 2 years ago when the guy waiters  and other guy staff were dressed as german beer girls or swiss beer maids with wigs, knee socks etc..the costumes were really hilarious...and yes it was on halloween! it would be funny if they dressed like that everynite though
