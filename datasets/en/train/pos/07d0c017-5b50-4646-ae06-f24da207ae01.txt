I was very surprised with the efficiency I encountered at this airport! All staff that I encountered was super friendly! (Even on their complimentarty shuttle service)!! Which...by the way was so convenient! 

Coming back through Sky Harbor the second time, I was checking through extra screening required. I was a little PO-ed at first but I was suprised how uninvasive security was (as opposed to SJC) they were friendly and did their jobs well. They were also very efficient in checking all manner of carry-on items. I wasn't the only one selected for "random screening" but I was surprised to see how good of a job they did! 

I look forward to traveling through PHO again, as I know my trip will be safe and secure!

Thank you Phoenix....until next time!
