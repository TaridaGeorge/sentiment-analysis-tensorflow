There is no better way to watch a movie than the Cinema Suites here.  No kids and recliner chairs are the way to go.  Drinks are fine, food menu is better than I would have expected.  It's a bit pricier, but worth it.

Side note - if you want to save some bucks, come for a morning matinee show.  Spend what you'd save otherwise on a Bloody Mary at the bar before you go in.  Worth it!
