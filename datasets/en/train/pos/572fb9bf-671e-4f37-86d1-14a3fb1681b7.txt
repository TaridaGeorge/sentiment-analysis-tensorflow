Was referred here by a friend. I needed a good hookah. I have had a chinese hookah here for a bit and it fell apart. Wanted to spend under $200 and get a quality hookah. Stopped in at numerous smoke shops and all they had were junk. So i drove 45 minutes up to Phoenix. WORTH THE DRIVE. They had a shop filled with anything and everything you can think of when it comes to smoking. I ended up getting a large MYA hooka (Best Quality Chinese Brand) with case for under what i was expecting to spend. Super friendly and helpful staff. A+ by me.
