Love this place. After visiting Greece and searching for something to replicate how the Greek make gyros... I must say, this place does a great job. 

The staff is very friendly...I'm going to guess and say family owned. Plenty of Franks Red hot to go around, never knew how good a gyro was until I sprinkled some Franks on it. 

At first, I thought the price was a little high, but then, after I had finished my meal, I couldn't have been happier. Well worth the $7.00. The best part of the meal was the amount of taziki sauce was just perfect! This restaurant has become a staple in my local lunch spots, especially when I want to sit outside and enjoy a peaceful lunch on a busy day.

A must try if you love gyros.
