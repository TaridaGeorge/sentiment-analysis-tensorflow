Paldo Market is extremely clean, and boasts fresh products at cheap prices!  The market itself has a great selection of traditional Korean products, along with a variety of fish / seafood / meat.  There is a small counter in the back corner of the store where you can order extremely reasonably priced entrees as well.  Super friendly workers, you really can't beat this place for the combination of service, price, and quality.  Highly recommend.
