I've been to 5th & Wine several times now for business meetings and cocktails with professional peers.  Great setting & ambiance. On street free parking is typically plentiful within a block or two.  Fantastic happy hour with a HH menu, and discounted beverages.  They have a nice craft beer selection. The servers have always been accommodating in giving a taste of a particular brew before committing to a pint, and the music & artwork are interesting, stimulating and refined, without being obnoxious or over-bearing.

In particular, Corey (sp?) and Joe have been excellent and remembered me each time I've returned.  Makes you feel welcomed and appreciated as a patron.

All in all, this is a very comfortable, mature adult place to meet or eat and I feel equally relaxed in jeans & a tee, or a shirt & tie. I like that easy versatility in a bar-resto concept.
