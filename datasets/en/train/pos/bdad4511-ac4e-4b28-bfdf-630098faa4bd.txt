I went here to check if they have any deals on their home fragrance oils,  for my oil burner. Today was my lucky day to find a helpful person that let us in on an upcoming sale, June 11th.  The oils will be going on sale for as low as $1.00 wow!! They are normally priced at 21.00 and sale prices are 7.50.  She (I forgot her name) asked her manager if she could sell them early to us, the manager said yes.  We bought vanilla spice, floral passion, and gingerbread for $1.00 each, you can't beat that price.  They have these oil scents so cheap because they are getting rid of these scents.

I like these oils, when they burn; they give your home a calming, and not overwhelming scent.   Excellent when you have guest over or after you clean your home, this is the cherry on top.
