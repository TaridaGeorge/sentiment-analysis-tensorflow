Went there for lunch on March 27 and was part of a large group of 10 and was very pleased with the meal and the service.  The wait-staff were really first rate and very attentive to all of our needs.
My chicken salad was very tasty.  I liked my panini..but it lacked a little in taste.  There was a little mistake on one of our orders, but managment brought over a plate of chicken salad to sample while waiting for the order to be corrected....GREAT customer service!
It is so pleasant to have such nice service...especially when you consider the "herd you in" and serve yourself service that is offered in establishments on two other corners of this intersection.
Good luck Postino!
