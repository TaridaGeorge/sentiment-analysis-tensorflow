Hey, I stayed in Phoenix twice in the last 3 months and ate here everyday for lunch. Never, ever got tired of the offerings and had something different every time I came in. The salads are wonderful, and you can completely customize your own tossed salad. Totally fresh and delicious. I had several sandwiches and loved them all. I'm a big fan of the Chicken Tortilla Soup...yum!

I ate at a place similar to this in San Francisco in a tiny little shop over 15 years ago and have wondered why somebody hasn't done a restaurant like this nationwide. I love it!
