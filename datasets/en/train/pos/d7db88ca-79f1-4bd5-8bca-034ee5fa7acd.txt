Finally, I know all there's to know about cacti, bee's, butterfly, thyme, rosemary and chives.

The Botanical Garden, a great place to take a stroll on a beautiful spring day, when the garden is at it's blossoming peak.  But as other's have said, go now before it gets too hot! 

I really enjoyed my time.  Of course, if you go hoping to see a lot of fresh green's, beautiful plants, and flowers, be ready for disappointment.

But for what it is, a desert garden, it certainly delivers.
