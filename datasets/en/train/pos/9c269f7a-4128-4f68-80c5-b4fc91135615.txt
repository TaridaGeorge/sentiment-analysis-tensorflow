OMG!!!  Phat Thai (Pad Thai)  I ordered it super spicy and my wishes were fulfilled.  Whenever it's cold I like to warm the inside of my body, and WOW, my lips were flaming the whole drive home.  I also ordered an appetizer, the fried tofu with spicy sauce, that was very good as well.  So stoked on this place!!!!
