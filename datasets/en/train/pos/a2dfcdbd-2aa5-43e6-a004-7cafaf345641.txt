5 Stars for Happy hour!  They have a late night all summer happy hour menu which mimics the dinner menu. Jesse and Jamie are fantastic bartenders with A+ service!  Get the Crab cake, wedge, or seafood salad ti start, Everything is great here. Only downside is that this is not a place for eye candy so bring a chatty girlfriend or someone you can enjoy great food and convo with.  Definitely a place you can be comfortable sitting at the bar alone or with friends!
