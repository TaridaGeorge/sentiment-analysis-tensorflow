Since its remodel of Great Escape I don't have to worry about coming in here and getting a staff infection anymore. Super dark and sexy. Reminds me of a 1980's Ski Lodge/Coke Den. Bad ass bartenders, beers, and cocktails. A great watering hole and an excellent addition to the neighborhood. (Ask Kevin what his favorite 3 things are.)
