The Tempe Center for the Arts @ 700 W Rio Salado Parkway is where I went to see Childsplay last weekend. What a beautiful venue!
Ferdinand the Bull was showing & it was fabulous! Kudos to the entire cast! 
Folks, this place is really a treasure. I know you've heard people say that nonchalantly about stupid stuff but this is for real!
Like all of our other theatres in town, this place deserves our patronage and support. 
If you don't have kids, go alone or take your niece or nephew! You won't be disappointed.
