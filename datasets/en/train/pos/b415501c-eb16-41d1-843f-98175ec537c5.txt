One of my favorite restaurants of all time.  I live in Albuquerque and get to Phoenix a few times per year and always have FnB as a place to go.  It's a casual and cozy atmosphere with great service and amazing food.  My favorite dish last visit was the Cauliflower, yes Cauliflower... it was sauted and had a Thai like sauce, wow!
