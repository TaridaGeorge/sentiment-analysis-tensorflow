I grew up down the street from Little Saigon in The O.C. and this place is just as good as anything I had there. Even better since it's 4mi from the crib. Seriously, their soup is AMAZING. I used to say Pho Ao Sen was my favorite, and, don't get me wrong, it's good, but this place is REAL GOOD. 

On top of the great food, the staff is 110% TOP NOTCH. That place is run with precision and the owner is not only very knowledgeable about their fresh good food, he's one of the nicest guys I have ever met. The staff really makes this place, IMO, it just so happens that they have BOMB PHO.

I go here at least 1x's a week, sometimes more.

Oh, and if you have food allergies, they are 100% on point and can direct you toward items that don't contain gluten.
