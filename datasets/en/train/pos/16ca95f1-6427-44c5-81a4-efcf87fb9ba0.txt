I love Lush and almost all of their unusual cosmetics that I've tried. I'm addicted to the Coalface face wash, it's the first product I've found  in years that always leaves my face feeling super clean without drying it out. It also has helped me to keep clear skin all year round. 
Their bath bombs are so much fun and a great excuse to take a load off and relax in the tub. 
Hmm what else have I tried? Ooh their Big shampoo is awesome. It's kind of weird at first because its like you're putting exfoliant on your head but once you add water you get a great lather going and it ;eaves me with big shiny hair with a lot of volume. 
And on top of all of this all the Lush people I've ever dealt with are super nice and very helpful :)
