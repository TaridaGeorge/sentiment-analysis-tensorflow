The Granola French Toast and chicken apple sausage is the best breakfast I have ever eaten. Period. Also had oatmeal on another day.  Superb. 

Then there was the fruit smoothie. My wife had banana and I had the blueberry. Perfect.  

I also had an entree Mediterranean salad with tofu for lunch.  One of the best salads I've ever had.  Amazingly fresh. Great vinaigrette.  And the tofu was tasty. 

The natural setting is beautiful. The service is friendly and attentive.  Love it here.
