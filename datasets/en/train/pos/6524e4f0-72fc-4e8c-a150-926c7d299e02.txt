You know, for a goodwill this one really isn't bad!  They have a ton of clothes that are actually displayed to make them look orderly and clean instead of the usual crammed heaps and stacks you see.  I love the books - a great selection of books you have always meant to read (and I don't mean the old classics, though they have those too) like James Patterson, Anne Rice, and all those gooey Twilight books.  Looks like they moved out most of the furniture recently, but perhaps they will be getting a new shipment soon.  Lots of knick-knacks and vases, and about 25 printers to choose from!  Check here first if you are looking for one of the above stated items - they is a good chance you will find it!
