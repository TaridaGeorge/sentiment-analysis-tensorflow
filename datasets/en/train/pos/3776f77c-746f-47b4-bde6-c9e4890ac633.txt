This has got to be the friendliest blood donation center ever. So friendly they deserve another star.

I showed up way early for my appointment, but they were able to get me in right away, no waiting. Even got a free Diamondbacks baseball cap. Gotta love free gifts.

The staff is incredibly friendly and efficient, and the place is spotless.

So how'd I do, that's what you're wondering, right? My best time ever, thank you very much: 7:05. That's right. I can bleed a pint in seven minutes. I know you're impressed, don't try to deny it.
