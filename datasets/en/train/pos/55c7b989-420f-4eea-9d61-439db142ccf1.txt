Great location in a quiet and scenic community. Clean facilities, very friendly and helpful staff. Lots of cardio and fitness equipment as well as free weights, so even during peak hours any wait would be minimal. Whenever any need for equipment repair arises, it is attended to immediately. Announcements of many varied classes, programs and events are clearly visible. The heated pool is great; I just wish it were open on Sundays, though.
