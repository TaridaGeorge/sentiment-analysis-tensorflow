Frst off i will say once again THANK YOU YELP! For helping me find this diamond in the rough.  I would give this place 6 stars if it would let me! I was hooked after my first bite of my jumbo dog. Juicy fresh and full of flavor! 

I was a little skeptical when I saw what the place looked like and the no decor in the dining area but really are you thereto judge how nice the windows look or how much you dislike the paint job. You go for the food!

The fries... Where to start on the fries. Wow Blew me away! By far the best French fries I've had since moving to Phoenix. Will defiantly be a regular eater at this place.
