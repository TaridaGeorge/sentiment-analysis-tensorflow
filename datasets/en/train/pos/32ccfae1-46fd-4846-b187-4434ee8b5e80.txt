I learned of J & M when their menu was stuck into my front door.  They boast "New York Style" Chinese cuisine, and it is really good.  We have only ever ordered for delivery (rare these days, it seems), and we have not been disappointed once!  My faves: wonton soup, spring rolls, Szechuan Garlic Chicken, and J & M house chicken.  They deliver in East Mesa only, between McDowell Rd, Recker Rd, Elliot Rd, and Meridian Rds, as well they have seating at their establishment.  (FYI $20 minimum order for delivery) The staff is really friendly, and the owner even delivered once!
