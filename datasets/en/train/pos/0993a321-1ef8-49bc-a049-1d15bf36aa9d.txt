Mmm dirty hipster bars.  Let me count the ways in which I love you.

You are cheap (we had $2 Stellas)
You are interesting (local art on the walls that I'm told changes regularly)
You are full of pretension (people watching is always worth the price of admission)
You are friendly (like minded souls can smell each other out)

If you are in the Roosevelt district, I highly recommend stopping in for happy hour.  Its cheap and hipstery.  Both words have been used to describe me, so I am naturally predisposed to this place.
