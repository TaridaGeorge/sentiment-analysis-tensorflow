Update to my update.... Returning to the Phoenix area once again for work, this time with my boss and a coworker, I decided to give HoT another try....they were fabulous!! The service, food, and ambiance were on par with my first trip here!  Even my European boss, who is very particular about which foods he calls "good" said the meal (halibut and beet salad) was "brilliant!".
I am glad that it seems like my previous experience really was just a fluke.
