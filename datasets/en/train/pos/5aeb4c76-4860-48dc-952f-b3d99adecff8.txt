I discovered Freddy's a few months ago, and it has since worked it's way into my lunch rotation since it is fairly close to where I work.  The burgers are unique compared to the norm, if not a little greasy.  The staff has always been more than friendly, especially during those early days when I wasn't quite sure what constitutes a "steakburger".   On every visit an employee walks by asking how our meal was and clears our trays for us, which isn't  service you don't get at many fast food joints.  Maybe one day I will leave enough room to try their famous frozen custard!
