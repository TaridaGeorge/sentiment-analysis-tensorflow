Okay, I don't even like sausage or chorizo or anything that comes in a casing. But the chicken chorizo scramble sounded good for some reason, and it was probably the best breakfast I've ever had in my life. I got the half and half of course because I can't live without those amazing protein pancakes. But the chicken scramble with chorizo was just insane. I don't even have words to describe it. I wanted to cry it was so good. Please just go here and get exactly what I ordered. For the record I told her to hold the tomato, it just didn't sound like the right ingredient to keep in the mix, and I was happy without them even though I normally love tomato, just not for breakfast.

I better start planning on how to convince my boyfriend we need to go back here again ASAP.
