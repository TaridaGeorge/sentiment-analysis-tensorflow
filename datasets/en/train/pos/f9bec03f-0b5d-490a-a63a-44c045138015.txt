I stumbled upon this place by accident one day while running errands, and I'm damn glad that I did.  Not only is it a closer homebrew store than that outfit in Tempe, but it's far and away a better store.  It's very open and clean, and they've got all the supplies and equipment that you'll ever need.  The staff is great, offering up great advice and even putting on brewing classes from time to time.  Their grain room is something to behold as well.
