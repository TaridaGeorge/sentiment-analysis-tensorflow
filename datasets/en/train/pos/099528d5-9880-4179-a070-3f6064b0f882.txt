I am a volunteer with a nonprofit that helps moms & babies breastfeed.  We were in need of a cake to help thank the volunteers in AZ and Honey Moon Sweets was kind enough to donate a lovely, delicious cake for the event.  I have returned many times (as have many of the other women who enjoyed their delicious creation) and I will be back many more.
