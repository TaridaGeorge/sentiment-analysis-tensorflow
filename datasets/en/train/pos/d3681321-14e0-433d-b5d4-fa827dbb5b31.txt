From 2008 to... almost 2013.

I still give Scott 5 stars.  He, and his staff, are excellent.  I have referred several people to this office, and they all receive the same service.

Scott takes care of not only my car and renters at a great rate, he also takes care of several members of my family as well.  4 years, and not a single drop in the level of customer service.
