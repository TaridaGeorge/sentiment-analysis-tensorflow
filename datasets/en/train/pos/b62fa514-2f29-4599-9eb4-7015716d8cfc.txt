Love Pita Jungle! They have the best grilled chicken breast ever and will not tell me what they marinade it in :O)... all I know is that it takes three days to marinade.
I love their broiled chicken salad and hummus (original flavor) appetizer. 
My girlfriend and I go there at least once a week! we're both obsessed. It is healthy and reasonably priced.
