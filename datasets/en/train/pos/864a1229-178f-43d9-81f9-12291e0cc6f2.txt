Tammie Coe is nothing but pure, sugary sin. Blissfulness!! I've had several of her cakes (birthdays), and my god, they are truly amazing. They are small and pricey, yes, but they are so rich that a little goes more than a long way. 

I suggest anything and everything here. The croissants are heavenly. As well as the Berry Tarts. The Ooey Gooeys are a little heavy on the frosting but the cake is amazing. Try the Betters cookie. Or the Blueberry Banana Bread. Or their sandwiches! The Portobello..or the Uncle Louie. All of it is fabulous. 

I'm getting married in September, and we have already decided the only worthy baker is Tammie Coe. Check our their wedding cakes online!

Yum yum yum...oh how we love you Tammie Coe!
