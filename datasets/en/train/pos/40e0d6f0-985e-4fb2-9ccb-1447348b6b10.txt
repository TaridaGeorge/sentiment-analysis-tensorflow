Boy do I LOVE Pita Jungle!!

I'm so glad they made it up to Desert Ridge. I have always had a fantastic meal at Pita Jungle. My favorite is the Mediterranean chicken salad. It's HUGE and so delicious. Great chicken, fresh veggies, the perfect dressing. There is nothing better, except maybe the hummus. Always a hit!

I'd love to review more menu items, but I always get the same thing. The lemonade is great, not a fountain drink. And a great tasting fresh lemonade, not like all the others. 

The service has always been friendly. They are always super busy, so sometimes you have to wait. But, it's so worth it!

Lunch is always crazy busy. The patio is perfect on a great night. In the summer they have mist and big fans.

I could eat Pita Jungle almost every day :)
