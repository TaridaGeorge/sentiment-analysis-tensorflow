I try shopping locally, but it can be tough.  The boys at Stupid Cupid make it a little easier by filling their store with great home decor items.  My favorite is their line of scented candles by Scent of Scandal, with such scents as: Ho Ho Homo (fruitcake), MILF (milk & cookies), 8 inches (Banana), and Crazy Bitch (fruit loops).  They smell great and they're freaking hilarious!  They also have great picture frames, magnets, wall art, cards, a jewelry made by local folks!  Stop on in for some last minute holiday shopping:)
