I first heard about gangplank at the Arizona Entrepreneurship Conference last year.  Since then I have been a regular there and the people that co-work or work there are some of the most inspirational ones I know and are passionate about bringing start-up culture to Phoenix area.  

The companies that anchor Gangplank are always working overtime to plan events from Gangplank Jr. for kids to learn programming to the Wednesday "brown bag" talks that have ranged in topics from how to pitch to angel investor to a local news anchor talking about how they are using Twitter as a resource for news leads.

Gangplank rocks.  Nuff said.
