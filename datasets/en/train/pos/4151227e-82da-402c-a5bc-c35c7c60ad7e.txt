This place is great. it's busy, but the atmosphere, while more modern, has a similar feel to the Arcadia location. Tonight we had quite slow service to start and the apologetic server comped our first round of drinks even though we weren't angry about it. I really appreciate that level of customer  service...it's a lost art. the food was wonderful and the beer prices were extremely reasonable.
