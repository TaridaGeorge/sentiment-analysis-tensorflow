Duck and Decanter "the Duck" is freaking awesome!  I like the store like atmosphere and the friendly staff.  Aside from fabulous sandwiches and sides they have lots of other great stuff too.  They have unique dishes, gormet foods and sodas.  The Duck also have a large wine room and beer selection.  

They can get busy during lunch, but the staff are very friendly, and quick!

This is a great place to grab a handmade sandwitch and snoop threw the store while you wait!
