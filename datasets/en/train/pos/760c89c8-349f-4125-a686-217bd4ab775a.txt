Awesome staff, solid coffee, and great food. This has become my new place to camp out and get some work done during the day, and there is something on the menu for all three meals worth trying. 

The food is all local or organic, and it tends to show. Definitely better than your usual cafe fare. 

I like the buffalo chicken wrap or sandwich- they marinate the chicken in the buffalo sauce (I think) as opposed to merely slathering it on after the fact. The same goes for a Caesar salad with chicken. 

The huevos rancheros could use less tortilla strips and more beans or other filler, but the sauce with it is great (although I suspect more than a little calorie dense).

The service and staff are excellent- friendly, helpful, and even interesting when you talk with them. 

Overall- great place.
