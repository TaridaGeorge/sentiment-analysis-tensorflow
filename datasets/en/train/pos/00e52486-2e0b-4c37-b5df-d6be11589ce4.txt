I have been seeing Michele for 6+ years from her former location.    Everytime she is very detailed, doesn't rush.  She takes the time to explain about the product and is very objective.  I'm impressed that I have never felt a sales pitch or pressure.  She will offer advice on more or less when necessary.  I have also read other reviews where one said she will work within your budget too.  Her work is art.  I would definitely see her again and recommend her to a friend!
