Cowboy Ciao is one of my favorite things about visiting Scottsdale! Every time I've been there I've had an unforgettable experience. Food is an amazing balance of funky and phenomenal. Wine list is extensive and service has never been short of fantastic. I can't stop thinking about the ahi filet the size of my head so so good. Can't wait for my next trip to AZ.
