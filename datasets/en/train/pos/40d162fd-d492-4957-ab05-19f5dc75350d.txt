Back again!  I'm so happy we have some friends that live, literally, right up against the mountain so we can park at their house and walk to the trail.  

I tell ya, this is a tough one and not for your first time hiker/tourist.  Follow the blue and white spray painted dots - we saw several lost hikers.  Per usual, I'm feeling a little sore today but like I always say, no pain, no gain!  :)
