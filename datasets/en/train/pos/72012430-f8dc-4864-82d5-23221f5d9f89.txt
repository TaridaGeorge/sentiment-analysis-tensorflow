Make the BEST ribs I've ever had. Order a full rack with mashed potatoes. You'll be in heaven. This place and Bobby Q's are pretty close in my book with good BBQ. Those are actually the only two places I consider even remotely "good" for BBQ. It's harder to find than it should be. Anyway, this is not really a restaurant. It's a order at the counter, they bring your food, and that's it kind of place. Their sweet tea is THE BEST! Their ribs are always fall off the bone tender, meaty, and just the right amount of sauce. Their mashed potatoes are amazing, I don't know how they make them, but Yum! The West Gate location is not good at all. If you want good Shane's you gotta go to this one.
