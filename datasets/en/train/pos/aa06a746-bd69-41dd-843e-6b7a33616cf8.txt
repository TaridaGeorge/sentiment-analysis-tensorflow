I don't understand how this place could get a bad review ever. Justin and Dr. Brooks are two of the most knowledgeable people I've ever come across in the medical field. To further that, they will remember who you are and have impeccable bedside manner. They will sit and talk to you until they're blue in the face answering questions. I think they really care about their patients and the business they run. Also, I don't think I've ever had to wait more than 20 minutes to get back. Which is amazing for an urgent care or any doctor. I'll sometimes wait 40 for my gp! I just wish you guys would hurry up and be a family practice so I don't have to keep going into these crap doctors and have to pay my urgent care copay just to get some good treatment! :)
