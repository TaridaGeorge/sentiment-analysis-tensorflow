My friend brought me here when I was visiting Phoenix as she explained this was her favorite breakfast place in the city.

The place is decorated like a country farmhouse with floral wallpaper, pictures of farmers and spoons and whisks hanging from the wall. Our servers were friendly but young. I swear everyone who worked here was 16 or younger.

I ordered an omelet that had cheese and pear and bacon. It was delicious and one of the best omelets I've ever had. I was blown away by just how sophisticated the food was for a place that seems very quaint.

I would love to come back here the next time I'm in Phoenix.

The best part was the menu that explained the weird and wonderful Eggington family. You need to go here just for the charming menu.
