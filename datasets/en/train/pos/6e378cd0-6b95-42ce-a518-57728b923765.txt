I've had a problem with noisy faucets for the last 15 years, since I built my house.  I've had numerous plumbers, handymen, city engineers and more try to resolve the issue.  Someone recommended KW Plumbing, and the rest is history.  As soon as he got under the sink, he had it figured out.  He had to get a part and come back at a later date.  He called on time, booked an appointment, and came as scheduled to fix it.  It has not made any noise since.  Kevin is extremely reliable, honest, professional and reasonable, and obviously knows what he is doing.  And a big plus to me, is that he takes his work boots off at your door, before entering your home.  How many people do that anymore, especially without being asked?  I would recommend him in a heartbeat.
