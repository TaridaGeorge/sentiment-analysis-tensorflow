spectakski.  Not going to read through all of these reviews, and not wanting to be too redundant, I'll just say the fig/ prozuut  and tomato jam/ sheep's cheese were insane! I may just order a board of the two on my next visit.  Wasn't too jazzed about the salmon or buratta/bacon (they were good, but paled in comparison.

They sell the bread too!  I was doubting myself the whole way home as to why I would buy a $7 loaf o' bread, then I ate it again and realized I have short term memory loss ;)
