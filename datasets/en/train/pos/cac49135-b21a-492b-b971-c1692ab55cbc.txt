I'll preface by saying whether you're going to Meineke or to your ridiculously overpriced local dealer I believe most mechanic managers/owners are the scum of the earth. It's amazing what will happen if you go to a few different places to get an estimate to fix your car and what they'll say needs fixed and the ranges in cost involved.

I was referred by a work friend and I don't trust my vehicle with anyone else. The service is good, prices are reasonable, and they are quick in getting the job done and done right.
