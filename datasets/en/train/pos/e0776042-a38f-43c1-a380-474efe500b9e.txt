I less than a month I was put here by my company twice. I like it here. It's clean. The staff seems friendly. It has a pool and jacuzzi. I love the jacuzzi at night when no one else is around. It's relaxing after a day of meetings. There's a diner right in front and a bakery too. The rooms a big and the big 5 stars is they have free wifi. Even outside by the pool. So far so good.
