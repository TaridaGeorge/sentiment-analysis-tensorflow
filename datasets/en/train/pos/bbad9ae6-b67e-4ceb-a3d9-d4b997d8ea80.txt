I've been to my fair share of breakfast places, but this one takes the cake. Excellent service, fantastic food, warm and welcoming ambiance...I was really blown away.

I ordered the veggie frittata with a side of salsa, which was excellent (I do recommend the side salsa, though - it adds a lot more flavor), and my companion got the strawberry French toast. Really excellent food.

So happy to live close to this place!
