This place is realllly yummy.

If you have an affinity for girls/guys with tattoos/gauges you will enjoy this place

If you want thanksgiving dinner shoved into an unhealthy English version of a Pita Pocket you will DiiiiiiiiiEEEEEEEEEEE (Rachel Zoe ) this place.

I'm naut ruckabillie but I "dig" this place. It's really dark inside, and the food goes good with beer which they have much of.

There are really great/grotesquely intriguing pictures of coal miners on the walls too which are fun to look at while eating said pastys...not the nipple coverings.

TRY: the pasta salad..it ain't a pasty but holy-rockabilly-hell it is effin' good!
