If you love learning about the Hohokam culture, Pueblo Grande is a must-see!  It's an incredibly cheap activity- it will cost you a mere $2 for adults and $1 for children, but you'll get to see things you can't anywhere else.  For instance, you'll see 1,500 year old Hohokam village ruins, an 800 year old platform mound and an excavated ballcourt.

You'll also be given a wealth of information on the Hohokam culture, so you not only will get to see how they lived, you'll learn about the people themselves, the challenges they faced and their everyday lives.  Really cool.

You can also take a little trail to see replicas of prehistoric Hohokam homes.  You can go in them because they're full-size and it's a hands-on experience.  

Lastly, if you want to take a little of the culture home with you, there's always the museum store!
