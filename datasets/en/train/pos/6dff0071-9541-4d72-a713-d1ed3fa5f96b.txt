Bobby Q is to legit to quit!
Having recently spent a few months in Texas and KC, I figured that Bobby Q would not match up or be as good as I remembered.

I was WRONG this place is great! While it's by no means the quality of BBQ, its some of the best I've had outside of Texas and better than many places in Texas.

The Brisket is moist, not as smokey as it should be, but it's tender and full of flavor.
The Mac N Cheese is excellent.
The Corn also kicks A.

AZ is lucky to have a gem like this in their city. Most places around the country can't even get close to this.

Hats off to Bobby Q!
