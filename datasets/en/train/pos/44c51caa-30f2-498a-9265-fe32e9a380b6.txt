Another spot I love & can't stay from!!
A foodie's absolute delight! Modern, but classic French, with an occasional twist.

This is another place that my husband and I  frequent regularly, order something new every time and love every time.
I adamantly never ate pork until I relented and tried the fig & espresso pork belly at zinc last year.  And I have to say I've seen the other side!! Amen, hallelujah!!  Pork belly is absolutely as heavenly as people make it up to be...

The scallops & chorizo are amazing, short ribs, sword fish, crab crepes, omg!!  Just order and you'll do fine!
