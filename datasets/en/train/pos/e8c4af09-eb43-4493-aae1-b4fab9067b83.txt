I was in Phoenix for MLB All-Star game and was looking for a place to eat after a HOT day at the ballpark. We stumbled into the Tilted Kilt for a bite to eat. Our waitress Erica was very fast with every request!

Being from San Antonio, wasn't expecting much from the Chips and Salsa but was surprised at how good they were! Very chunky with great seasoning and flavor. Another appetizer that I highly recommend is the garlic fries. Possibly the most antisocial thing to eat but as long as everyone in your party has a few, it's all good! ;)

Everyone seems to focus on the girls in kilts but there is something for female customers too. All the male staff members are wearing kilts too. LOL
