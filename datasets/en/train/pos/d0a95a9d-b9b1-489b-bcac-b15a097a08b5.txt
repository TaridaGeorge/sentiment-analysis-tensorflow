I love everything about this place! Whenever someone comes to visit me this is the spot I take them.  The set up is great and the food is even better. Think of Joe's Farm Grill like a gourmet burger joint that pleases everyone. I am not even really a burger kind of girl. The dark chocolate milkshake is to die for. Last time I went I had the Presto Chicken Sandwich. It was so tender and juicy I polished of the plate in no time. Breakfast is really good too and the waffles are a must. I love that there is a lot of sitting outside and big trees to keep you shaded. Every time is a a good time at Joe's.
