The feel here is always so cobwoy-eque, and I've been going to this restaurant since I was a kid. Glad not all things have changed.

I love the $15 birthday/anniversary/etc huge eclair, cowboy hat and handkerchief, and singing. The eclair is bigger than a football so be prepared.

We paid $50 for our split meal, appetizer, and eclair special including the $3 extra plate fee (which we knew about, but didn't know it literally included extra food, too = BONUS!). The Indian fry bread was delicious with the cinnamon butter and honey as always. So were the tater skins, and all the sizes of food were humongous. We made 2 meals out of our leftovers!

You never disappoint!
