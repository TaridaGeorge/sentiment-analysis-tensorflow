I had a Defalco's prepare two appetizer trays for an upscale cocktail party at my home. The trays were not only impressive to display on the table, but the variety and quality of cheeses and meats were outstanding. One of the trays inlcuded bell peppers filled with delicious pesto sauce for dipping with the huge order of sliced italian bread included. There were over 20 guests at the party and the amount of food was more than ample. I also thought the price was more than reasonable to feed that many people. Perfect price and quality for any event.
