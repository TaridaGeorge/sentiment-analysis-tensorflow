If you have a cake craving go here.  Their cakes are some of the best I have ever had. They have mini-bundt cakes so you don't actually have to buy a whole cake so you can feel better about it.  Do yourself a favor and get the white chocolate raspberry bunt cake. It tastes like a really amazing cousin of a jelly doughnut.

Great place even if it makes you feel a bit guilty
