Yeah it's a bit pricey but I feel the money is well spent on staying healthy. The facilities are phenomenal and that staff knows me by name.

It is really only crowed around 5PM on weeknights. Crowded but you still don't have to wait for cardo machines.

Super clean, new machines, great location, friendly staff.
