We tried having our knives sharpened at a place near our home and it was a waste of time and money.  After reading the reviews on yelp.com we tried The Knife Shop.  Our knives were done perfectly and are now super sharp.  We couldn't be more pleased with the craftsmanship and quality -- all done while we waited and at a very fair price.  We talked at length with the owner and learned so much about knifes and how to care for them.  Although this store is out of the way for us we will continue to be loyal customers and will recommend tThe Knife Shop to everyone.
