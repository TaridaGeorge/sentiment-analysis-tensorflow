Stayed here this past weekend for our son's 16th birthday and it was as good as it gets!  They had special little bundt cakes with a happy birthday message waiting in our room when we arrived!

The staff was AMAZING!  They couldn't have been more helpful or polite!

Loved the pool and spent a large amount of time in it!

Loved the shower!  Was huge!

The room was GREAT!

There's a fridge in the room and a microwave downstairs in the galley if you need it - very cool!

The free breakfast - OHMYGOSH!  It was GREAT!

Huge TV!  Quick and FREE internet!

We WILL be coming back to this hotel.  Our experience was wonderful!
