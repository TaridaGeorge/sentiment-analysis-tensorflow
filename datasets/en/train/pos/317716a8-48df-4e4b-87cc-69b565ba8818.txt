This place is as good as it gets! Amazing selection, super helpful staff, and the prices on used books CAN NOT be beat. I used to shop at bookmans until I stumbled upon this place, the prices are 25-50% cheaper on used books. And if you don't find something you are looking for, the staff is always happy to help you find it or order it for you. I took a Children's Lit class a few semester back and I practically lived at this store on the weekends. They never let me down and I was always able to find what i needed, and on the flip side my son's book collection grew exponentially :)
