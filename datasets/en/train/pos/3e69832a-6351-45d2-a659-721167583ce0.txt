I stayed here for 5 nights and found the staff welcoming, the externior clean and in good repair (they were replacing the walkways when I was there and doing an awesome job), and the rooms clean and comfortable.  Breakfast is complimentary and it is well prepared, warm, and the staff is helpful and friendly.  There was an unexpected problem (through no fault of mine or the hotel and their staff) that was handled exceptionally well.  It is easy to be great when everything goes well...not as easy when they is a problem..Best Western InnSuites Phoenix really saved the day!  I would stay here again and again!
