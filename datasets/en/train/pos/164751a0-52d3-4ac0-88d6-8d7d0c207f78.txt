It was so much fun getting to know other fellow yelpers at a very fun event last night.  Thank you Andrea S for getting the party started by opening up the first bottle of bubbly!
I am a little challenged when it comes to the make up department so it was really nice to have a pro show me how to create the smoky eye.  The massage was really nice too!  We got to sample some of their products as well during the hand facial.  
The best part was the goody bag.  Thank you guys so much and thank you Lindsey for putting this all together.
