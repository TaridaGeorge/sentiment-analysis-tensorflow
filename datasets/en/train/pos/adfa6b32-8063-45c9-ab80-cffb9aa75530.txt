i LOVE goodwill...or my goodwill. 2 locations to shop near us...the renovated home goods goodwill on the east side of scottsdale road near oak street, and the new goodwill on the west side of scottsdale road near mckellips. 

almost all my work clothes are from here....khaki and polos....and they look pretty good. just a good toss in the washing machine and clothes are good to go. 

they have racks and racks of good clothes...you just have to spend a little time to filter through the items. of course, they have great items/clothes for parties, mud runs, halloween, etc. 

books, knick knacks, ties, belts, sheets, everything. great place!
