I discovered Royal at the Market in October of 2009 on a visit to the Saturday morning farmer's market. Though I do enjoy coffee drinks, I am a chai lover...and this place has the best chai in town! Since then I have made Royal my Saturday morning treat, stopping for my tea and then perusing the market for tasty treats! A wonderful place to stop and a great location to hang out!
