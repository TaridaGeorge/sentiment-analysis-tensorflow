My husband and I really enjoyed ourselves here.  We ordered the cheese artichoke dip appetizer, hamburger and jerk chicken sandwich with fries and a couple drinks.  This is a great place to bring out of town guests.

Pros:
-relaxing upscale atmosphere
-great food
-good service
-the patio

Cons:
-parking
