WOW! I mean wow, that's about as a good as you can get with fresh seafood.  Put it this way, it was so good I had to create a yelp account just to brag about it!  
My fiancé and I have been to just about every seafood fine dining spot in scottsdale, (mastros, ocean club, papadeauxs, salt cellar, etc.) this takes the cake by far.  Service was great, management was super friendly, food was outstanding! Lobster was the best my fiancé has ever had and my scallops were top notch (I actually let Eric, our waiter, pick my entrée and he couldn't of been more right) Oh yeah, don't forget about the drinks, blue cheese dirty martini absolutely perfect. 10s ACROSS THE BOARD!!!
