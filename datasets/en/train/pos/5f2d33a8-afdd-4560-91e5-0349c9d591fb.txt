I have tasted Gelato in many places across the US and this is hands down the best I have ever had. My wife says it's the closet thing to the Gelato she had in Italy and that is a high standard in her world. Any time we have friends going to Scottsdale we recommend they stop by "Cool" for a tasty treat. Check this place out if you have the chance!
