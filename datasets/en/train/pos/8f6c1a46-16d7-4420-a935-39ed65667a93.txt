This is one of last "true family integrated" businesses! You need to find a way to get here. The multiple varieties of "dogs" and sausages are wonderful. My kids love the attention they get from the staff, makes them feel great! Try and go next Friday or Saturday to try their authentic South Carolina Barbeque! Fantastic food, fantastic fun, fantastic family business.....
