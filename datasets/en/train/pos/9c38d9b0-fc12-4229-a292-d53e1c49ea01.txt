oh my goodness I am in love!!! Just ate here for the first time and that was the best breakfast ever! That was as close to gramma's homemade breakfast as you can get. You can tell the ingredients are fresh and real... Not preprocessed restaurant supply crap. The hashbrowns are fried up with garlic which is a surprising and tasty touch. The service was fast and friendly and the price was unbelievable! 25 bucks for all this...

sausage omelet with hasbrowns and sourdough toast
little piggy omelet with hashbrowns and toast
full order of biscuits and gravy (with biscuits the size of softballs)
short stack of frisbee sized pancakes
and enough coffee to make me forget that I only slept 4 hours last night

mickey, will you be my gram-gram?
