We've been twice in the past month and think it's well worth the wait.  There's only one Chris Bianco and he can't make the pizza any faster without compromising quality - crusty complex dough and generous tasty toppings. 

We've worked out a system.  There's two of us and we try to go early in the week before 7pm.  We leave our name and get the usual "it'll be 1.5 to 2 hours but check back in 40min."  Make sure to call back exactly in 40min - we almost lost our place when we called back 10min late.  Plan something to do during your wait - bring reading, go shopping nearby, whatever.

Both times, we lucked out and got seated in less than one hour.  Make sure to get an extra pizza - tastes just as good the next day - 5 min in a 500 degree oven.
