We've always wanted to try this place but they are only open for dinner and we don't live on this side of town. But, so glad we finally made the pilgrimage. We sat on the patio with the heater on and enjoyed our al fresco dinner. The food was very good and fresh tasting.  Had the olives, crab salad, artichokes and clam, trout, calamari, pollo colonial, rice salad and tuna. All tasted so good. Can't wait to go back!
