Probably the best place for pizza and calzones. I love the atmosphere and service here. Its very mom & pop, but professional and fun at the same time. I've  taken my friends and family here, and both groups are quite critical in their own way... but they LOVED the place. My best friend Anthony is from NM and seriously comes to visit me because of our frequent visits to Spinatos - not to see me. 

Obsessed with the spinach calzones. Joey is my favorite server. the riesling is divine.

A+
