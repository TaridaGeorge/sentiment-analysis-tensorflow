This place is fantastic.  They are NOT affiliated with the Princess nails at Carefree and I-17, so don't let the bad reviews of that joint scare you away.  The owners are super nice.  Pedicures are always top notch, massage chairs are the best I've ever sat in and my nails always come out great!  Give them a try, even if you don't live close, its worth the drive!  Very competiviely priced, as well!
