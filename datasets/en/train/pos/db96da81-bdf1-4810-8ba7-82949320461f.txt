I have been eating here off and on for 7 years, and I have never been disappointed. Granted, I have not tried many things on the menu (only the lemon chicken, BBQ pork, orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and everything that comes with the combos).  

The orange chicken is the best orange chicken I've ever tasted.  The chicken is thin cut and lightly battered, fried, then coated in a flavorful orange sauce.  I also recommend the egg drop soup and egg rolls.  

They have great prices and large portions. I have them on speed dial so I can get my food ordered for takeout.
