Love this Chilis. Have been to the one by Superstition and it was a terrible experience but this location by the Riverview mall area is amazing. My husband and I frequent when we get our rare date nights, but it is just as great when we bring the kids along. Very affordable as well. Love their trio appetizer!! My husband is a fan of their big burgers and fries and we always get the enchilada soup. Always good!! The staff is very friendly and always on point with our food, refills and overall customer service.  If your looking for a great meal with that won't break the bank I highly recommend !! Perfect for get always or family dining.
