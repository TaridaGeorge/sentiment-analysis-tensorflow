I love this place but I've actually never tried the pizza. The salads are awesome!! The caprese is one of the best I've ever had, and I love the insalata italiana with gorgonzola. The penne primavera is so good too! P.S. They DO accept credit cards, just not American Express, which sucks because that is the credit card I have for my work so we don't come here nearly as often as I would like to. Also, I've only done take-out orders so I don't know about the service at lunchtime, however the parking situation is really bad!
