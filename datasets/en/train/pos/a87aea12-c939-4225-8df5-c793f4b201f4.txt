I used to watch New Scandinavian Cooking on PBS just for the girl in the pigtails. Now, I find that I should have also been paying attention to the cooking, too! All the five star reviews are totally warranted - incredible Scandinavian dishes, friendly family service, and a low price point. Best new cheap eats place I've been to this year.
