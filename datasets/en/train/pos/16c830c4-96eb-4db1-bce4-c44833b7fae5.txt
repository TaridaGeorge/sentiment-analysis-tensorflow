I have been researching upholsterers for some time now.  Found this company listed on EthicalAZ's website.  Called and spoke with the owner Frank Lopez and he quoted me the best price, so I decided to give them a chance.  I had them reupholster our jack knife sofas for our toy hauler.  I picked them up today and I am very happy with the results.  I would definitely recommend Sit-Well Upholstery.  I will be returning with a few more projects.  

Pros:
-excellent work
-fair prices
-friendly staff

Con:
-far away from my house (but worth the drive)
