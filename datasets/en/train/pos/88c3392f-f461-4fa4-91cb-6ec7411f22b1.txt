What a great Happy Hour at La Stalla!  My wife and I go quite a bit for an early dinner and can walk out for less than $20. 

Happy Hour is every evening from 4 - 6 an we usually get a beer or two a piece (at only $2) and great authentic Italian pizza (at only $5 a pie).  

When we've ate a full dinner - it's always been great as well. The desserts are fantastic ... Check out La Stalla!
