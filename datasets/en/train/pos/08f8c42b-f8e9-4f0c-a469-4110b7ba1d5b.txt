Legacy sets the standard for resort courses in Phoenix (actually, the standard is much lower!).  The course is excellent, with perfect conditioning, soft sand, and wide open fairways.  The practice facilities are convenient, and water is plentiful (which is nice during the summer).

This is also one of the best deals you'll find, with summer rates at $20-$30, depending on the time.  Can't beat that for this quality.

And I suppose it also helps that I had one of my best rounds here, avoiding anything worse than a triple bogey (unbelievable for me).  This definitely deserves a spot in the rotation.
