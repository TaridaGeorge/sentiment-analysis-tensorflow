I admit that I dabble in the art of some asian cooking.  I spent some time over there and have learned of few neat dishes that are very good.  Lee Lee is the only place so far that i can find my favorite soy sauce.  go there and pick up som Silver Swan soy sauce and you will never go back to anything else.  in fact you will be disgusted with that kikoman crap that they serve in every resturant and wish you had this every time you went out to each.  They also have everything else you could imagine from the orient.  its worth the drive and the experience.  who needs a passport and a $1000 plain ticket to experience asia.  just head to Lee Lee's
