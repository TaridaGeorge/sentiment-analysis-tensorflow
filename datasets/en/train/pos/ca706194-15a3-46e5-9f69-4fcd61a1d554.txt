I lived in Phoenix back in 1995 and Pete was running the Newsroom then too. Pete didn't just give us blue collar kids a place to hang...he watched out for us too. Back then it was very common for one side of the bar to be drunk hotel workers and construction workers and the other half to be psychotic homeless dudes. We always felt safe though. Pete made sure of it.
