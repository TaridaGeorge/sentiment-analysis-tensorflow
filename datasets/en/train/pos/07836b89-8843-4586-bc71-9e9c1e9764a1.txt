Bertha's is my favorite lunch spot.  Great food with very reasonable prices.  I like to order either a half sandwich/ half salad or split a sandwich with someone.  Both options still give you a cookie.  ( :  If you only order a salad, no cookie.  ) :  They have free refills on iced tea and a self service counter with water and lemons.
