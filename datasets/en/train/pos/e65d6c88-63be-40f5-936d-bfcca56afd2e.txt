I have no complaints.  My brother and I were throwing a 50th Anniversary party for our parents and I was looking for some decorations.  The woman who first helped me explained the pros and cons about paper vs. plastic plates.  Then another woman came to help and she said why don't I rent the plates?  They are totally cheap and I got the white with gold rim china plates.  I picked them up the day before the event and they loaded them in my trunk.  When I dropped them off, they took them out too.  They come in a closed plastic banquet plate container and you don't have to wash them!!!  To me, I was being green as well as making it a very nice looking table.
