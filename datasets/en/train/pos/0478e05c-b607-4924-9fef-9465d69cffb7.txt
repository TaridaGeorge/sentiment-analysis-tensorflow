Just came back here the other day and this place totally made me feel in love :) Started off with traditional Spring rolls which was very good and what could I say, Pho Tai was "pho"nomenon!
Thai Iced Tea was the bomb and very great atmosphere with nice decor' and great service.
Definitely come back :)
