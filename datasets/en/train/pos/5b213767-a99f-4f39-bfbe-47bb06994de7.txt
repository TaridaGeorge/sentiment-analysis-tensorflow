I love this place! I don't get the folks that are saying it's expensive. I've been twice now and each time had one of their plates - falafel and chicken shwarma. The plates come with the main dish (generous portion), a pita, a generous helping of rice and a Greek side salad, plus Tahini or garlic sauce. All of that for about $10, and it's delicious. I think the prices are fair for the quality and amount of food you get. Give it a try!
