YUM!!! Delish inexpensive YUM!!! My friends and I stopped here for fro yo after a yelp event. I tried coffee, pumpkin, vanilla and plain tart....all my favorites were available - how is one to choose? They were all wonderful! ahhh! If the place were  not 20 minutes away, I would get in the car right now and go for seconds!!! I ended up w/ half pumpkin and half plain covered in granola and strawberries.  YUM!!!! My friend also had a huge cup of goodness - the total cost for both our wonderful creatives was $4.25.....that place is perfect - I will go back every time I am in Scottsdale and it's open.
