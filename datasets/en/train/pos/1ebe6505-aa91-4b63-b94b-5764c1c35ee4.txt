This is our favorite wine bar in Scottsdale!  The atmosphere offered by the cave-like speakeasy environment offers a unique retreat from the typical bar scene and the selection of wines and beers changes regularly so there is always something new to try rather than the same boring, tired selections that many places offer on their stagnant and never-changing menus.  The staff always offer great service and can usually offer a winning wine recommendation when we describe what we like.  They also have beers from worldwide locations including some obscure places that one wouldn't ordinarily expect to find a quality brew, but my husband has found numerous beers here that he loves.  The place can get a bit loud when they have a DJ playing, but the uniqueness of the overall experience outweighs any negatives and is definitely a place that's worth checking out.
