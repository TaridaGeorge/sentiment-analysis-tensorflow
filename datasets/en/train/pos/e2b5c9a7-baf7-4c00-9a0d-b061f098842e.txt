I've been here about a dozen times now and I have never written a review.... but I could write a super review for each of those times.  Tonight I was on my own so I got galee gai and sticky rice to go.  The galee gai is a spicy yellow curry - similar to masaman curry but spicier.  Now, I am a total wimp and this is always spicier than I really can handle but it is so good I deal with it!  I put it on rice and drink a lot of tea :-)  The sticky rice is coconut sweet and, well, sticky.  I have ordered sticky rice at other places and it never compares to Wild Thaiger.  I am happy to have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!
