Alex'is is the perfect place to bring a client.  They serve dinner and lunch.  The nice atmosphere is conducive for conversation and eating.  There is massive lightrail construction going on in fornt of the restaurant though so getting in and out is not as easy as it used to be, but in soon time it will be back to normal.

Anyhow, Alexi's is a nice place. It has it's old Phoenix charm.  The owner, Michael is also the owner of Christo's.  Today, I had the filet minon and veggies, it was delicious!

Gov. Janet Napolitano is a fan! I hear she frequents the restuarant.
