Been going to Toyama's for over 5 years now and definitely my favorite sushi restaurant in Arizona.  If you are on a date night without the kids definitely sit at the bar by Mo (owner).  We have gotton to know Mo well and love walking in and he remembers our name and always says hello.  Japanese version of Cheers Bar.  We usually just ask him to surprise us with what he recommends and have not yet been disappointed.  Not only does the sushi presentation always look amazing the flavor and quality is top notch.  The whitefish carpaccio is amazing and so is the seabass and halibut sashimi.
