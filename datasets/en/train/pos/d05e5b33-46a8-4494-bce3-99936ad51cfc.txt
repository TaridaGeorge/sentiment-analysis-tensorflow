I had to update my review today, after going to Wildflower for my typical "I'm in Chandler and I must get my Wildflower fix" nosh.

Today, I was pleasantly surprised that when the counter person took my order she made sure to point out, and ask if a) capers were OK on my salmon dish, and b) if mushrooms were ok on my caesar salad.  The thing is, I've been coming here a long time, and have been with other coworkers who are surprised/shocked the caesar salad comes with mushrooms on top.  I think it's pretty damn cool that they are now, even though it's written clearly on the menu, for those folks who don't read item descriptions - giving customers a heads-up just in case.

Outstanding adjustment in the counter help (not that I ever minded mushrooms in my caesar ;-) )
