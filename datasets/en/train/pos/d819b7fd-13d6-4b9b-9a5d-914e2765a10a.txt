I stopped in for a quick treat after a day at the spa next door. I had never been in before, and walked in not quite knowing where to go ( I didn't see the wall where the yogurts are located when I walked in - duh) but the employees where helpful and friendly. Lots of low-fat, non-fat, no sugar added varieties and the most toppings I think I've ever seen at a Froyo joint.  Great prices, my little cup cost me less than $3.00...although I didn't really load my serving up. Very fun place!
