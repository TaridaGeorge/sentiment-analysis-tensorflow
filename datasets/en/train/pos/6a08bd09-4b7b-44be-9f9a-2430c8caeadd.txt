Everytime I pull up to D'Lish I seriously have cartoon hearts popping out of my chest.  I have loved every single thing I've eaten here. Breakfast go to is a Frittata - perfectly done. Split a hummus if you're grabbing lunch with friends. My new favorite dish is the Southwest Bowl - Basmati Rice and Enchilada Sauce together as one? Yes, Please! The staff here is phenomenal..always feel welcome! I prefer to call ahead and you're in and out in a flash.
