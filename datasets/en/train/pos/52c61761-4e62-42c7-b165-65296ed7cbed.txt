I've been shopping at ON for years without a single problem. The clothes are inexpensive and I restock on a pile of tank tops every year. Recently, I had a huge issue with a large amount in a return not being credited to my acct. After 10 days and no credit, I went into the Desert Ridge location to get it handled. It turned out that the credit was processed incorrectly and never communicated to my bank. 

Kelli was the lucky one who "took my case." She spent some time on the phone and did some complicated data entry (seriously, it took 67 steps to undo the original error) and completely solved the problem. She was patient, professional, smart, and really determined. It was a lot of money and she recovered it for me, and I'm very appreciative.
