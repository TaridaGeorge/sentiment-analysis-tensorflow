Went to Grimaldi's tonight, and I thought it was fabulous!

My friend and I got the pizza of the month -- the BBQ Chicken pizza.  This was one of the best pizza's I've ever had.  The veggies were nice and crunchy, and I have to say that using fresh mozzarella makes pizza a totally different experience.

We also shared the small greek salad (which was enormous) -- we got the dressing on the side -- which I think is usually a safe bet with any kind of vinaigarette -- too much can ruin a salad.  

All in all, a stellar experience.  This place *may* just take over as my fave pizza in Phoenix!
