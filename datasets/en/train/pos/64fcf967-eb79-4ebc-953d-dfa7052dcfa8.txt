One of the rare 5-star reviews I'll give because it just doesn't get any better than this.  Forget Disneyland, THIS is my Happiest Place on Earth!

I have a (pathetic) habit of visiting Costcos in every city I visit to see what regional goodies they offer.

This is my 'home' Costco.  It's a little like Cheers - I know most/all of the employees by name and/or sight, and I'm such a Costco fixture that many of them know me.  And the team here is a helpful one.

I know the layout of the store and can easily spot new items as they arrive.  In short, this store is like a comfortable old shoe...that also sells bargain-basement gas! ;-)

If I could find one complaint, it's that meat prices have recently risen a lot, but it's still a bargain relative to most meat markets.
