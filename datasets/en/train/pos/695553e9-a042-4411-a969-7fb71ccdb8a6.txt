Lived a handful of blocks away for 3yrs, and I don't think a week went by that I didn't go in there at least a few times.  Best liquor store in the valley.  So, what hasn't already been said . . .

What I miss most since moving is the random case sales.  Their distributors will have "near sell-by date" overstock, and Top's will load up to sell cheap!  Beer doesn't last long in my home anyways.  A 12pk of Pyramid Heffe 24oz bottles for $14?  24pk of Coors tall boys for $12?  Hell yeah, baby
