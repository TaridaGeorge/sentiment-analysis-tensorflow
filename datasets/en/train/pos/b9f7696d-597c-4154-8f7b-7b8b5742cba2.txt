This review is for the floral dept. I was looking for green ti leaves for vase liners, and the florist was very helpful. I brought in the different vase sizes, and she called me later to let me know how many leaves I needed. They were ready for pickup at the right time, and the price was terrific, 7$/bunch. I am really happy with the quality and quantity of the leaves, as well as the service that I received. Thanks!
