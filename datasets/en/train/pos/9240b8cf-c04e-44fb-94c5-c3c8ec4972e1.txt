We go here at least twice a month (ok, sometimes weekly!).  For those who haven't been here, it is cafeteria style where you walk through and place your order and get a number.  You pay at the cash register and then within a couple of minutes of getting your drink and finding a table, your food comes out to you.  Love their soups and salads and their chicken walnut sandwiches are absolutely amazing.  With most meals, you also get the most decadent chocolate chip cookie - mmmmm!  Great food and customer service.
