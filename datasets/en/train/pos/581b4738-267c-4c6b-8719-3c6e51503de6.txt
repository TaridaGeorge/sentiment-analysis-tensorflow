In celebration of National Hot Dog Day, Thomas and I made a special trip to Ted's. I have never been there and I am now sad that I have been missing such a GREAT spot! 

I shouldn't go much further without stating that I do not like hot dogs. But when I finished my dog, I was contemplating getting another one. I got the 'all beef' with mustard, cheese sauce, chili, and onions and cheese fries. I wish I would've skipped the fries, I would have definitely been able to get another dog down.

The cheese sauce isn't worth the extra $.60 on the dog or the fries- you'll be much better off just skipping it.
