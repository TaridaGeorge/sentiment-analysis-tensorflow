During another PHX visit, I took friend here for a romantic dinner out.  As always, Bar Bianco and Pizzeria Bianco didn't disappoint.

This time, we did half a Wiseguy and half a Biancoverde.  Why the hell didn't we ever think to do that before?!?  Spectacular combination!!  

I'd love to see a pizza smackdown in the middle of Union Square San Francisco, between Tony and Chris.  We would see the 2 best pizzaioli in the USA.  Fo sho!

I can't wait until October!!
