I was really excited to try this place out and I'm so glad I did. I went with a few people so we all had different items and shared them. Everything was incredible. Each dish was flavorful and my fish was cooked to perfection., Who knew bok choy and kale could taste so good! They have a good variety of food on their menu so there is something to suit every taste. I'm always a supporter of using local produce and wholesome organic ingredients. Also they have really unique and delicious mixed drinks both alcoholic and nonalcoholic. Will definitely be going back.
