I've been eating at this cafe for years, and it never disappoints. The food is homecooked fresh, European quality.  I highly recommend the Chicken pasta dishes, especially the Chicken Pesto. To die for! Also try anything with their Tzaziki (sp? sauce....the best I've ever had)
The wide open view of Fountain Lake makes this both elegant and relaxing.  The wait staff knows how to handle children, and the service is appropriately paced for a cafe in America.  However, the owners are European, and they ensure a relaxed, not rushed dining experience, so plan on relaxing when you go here. 
Finally, the owners oversee everything themselves; they are not absentee owners, and of course this makes a big difference.
