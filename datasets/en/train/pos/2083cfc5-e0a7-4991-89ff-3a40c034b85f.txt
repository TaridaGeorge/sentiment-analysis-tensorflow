Sushi as good as you find anywhere in Phoenix (not as good as the coast but still good). Hibachi as good as any teppanyaki place in town. Lots of std Chinese buffet fare but fresher and nicely done. Plus gelato and birthday cake for dinner. What else could you want :-). 

Price: 19.99 for adults for dinner - still less than you would pay to eat sushi or hibachi plus everything else. To me that is a good deal.
