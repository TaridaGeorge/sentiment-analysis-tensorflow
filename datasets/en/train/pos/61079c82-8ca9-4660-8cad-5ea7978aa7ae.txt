Here is why this gets the Five Starts:

1. Independently owned with the owners actually there working
2. Authentic German Food done VERY well
3. Amazing staff that understand the menu and doesn't make fun of you for pronouncing anything wrong.
4. LARGE outdoor bier garden in historic downtown Glendale
5. Das Boot - You can get a real German bier in a large Glass Boot.
6. Best from scratch pretzel you could ever dream of. 

The overall atmosphere is one that is just fun and very different from anything else I've found in the Valley.
