This is one of those places you drive by a million times always thinking to yourself "I have to check that place out" but you never do because you can't figure out exactly where the parking lot is or are always on the way somewhere.  Well, my friends, it's time to stop.  If you like the furniture at DWR but the prices are out of your reach you will enjoy 2b mod.  You get the same style for about half the price.  The store has a small selection of what is actually available (check out their website).  The owner is very friendly and I was told he can arrange for custom pieces...  I have the "Womb Chair" and "Noguchi-esk"coffee table earmarked.
