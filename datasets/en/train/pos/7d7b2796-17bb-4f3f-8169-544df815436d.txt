My disposal was leaking again.  I called Nicole at the Leasing Office and let her know my predicament.  She was incredibly attentive and scheduled for maintenance to come by the next day.  Ramon came to my apartment this morning, and immediately found a solution to the problem.  He used a different kind of sealant than the other maintenance guy used to prevent leakage.  

He was conversational and polite (he even rang the doorbell a second time when he returned from picking up a new part).  He wiped his feet, and even offered to take out the trash.  This is yet another reason why I love living in San Antigua.  Thank you Ramon!
