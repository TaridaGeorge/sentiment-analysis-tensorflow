I am sorry unPhogettable. I am sorry it took me so long to get here. I was told by many about your greatness, but I still took the longer route. At least I got here and now I am here to stay. Your service is awesome. Our waitress, who I think owns the place, was so helpful. The food was delicious. I had an amazing thai tea that was not too sweet, which they usually tend to be. The vermicelli chicken noodles tasted great. Even the dessert of fruit and coconut was great. I had a wonderful time and will be coming back soon!
