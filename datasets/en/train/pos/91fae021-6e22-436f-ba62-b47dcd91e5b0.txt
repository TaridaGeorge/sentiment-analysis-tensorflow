Awesome Hotel. Went for the Girls Trip during July 09. Stayed 3 nights and had a wonderful time. Pretty rooms, comfy, nice decorations, great!!!! Ate at Bourbon Steak - Matthew is a great bartender and wonderful waiter. Use him and tell him the "Dallas Girls" sent ya. Also, hung out at Stone Rose Bar quite a few time and enjoyed that as well. The hotel is large, but they do have golf cart service to help you get around if need be. Besure and have breakfast there at the restaurant  and ask for TIM. He was wonderful and I can't wait to go back and visit. Loved it! Ready to go back!!!
