Simply put, if you like chicken fried steak and you haven't been here you don't really like chicken fried steak.  I've eaten chicken fried steak pretty much everywhere in the world that its available and it just doesn't get much better than this.  Go with the fried potatoes instead of the mashed.  Not that the mashed are bad, just that the fried potatoes are so GOOD.  For those that are less enthusiastic about chicken fried steak, the fried chicken breast is also great as are the steaks and burgers.  Love the house salad with light oil dressing and diced olives on top.  Oh, and the biscuits, top notch, TOP NOTCH.  Don't let them get away with bringing you a bread basket that's half filled with biscuits and half filled with some wheat roll disaster, ask for all biscuits.  You're welcome.
