LOVED LOVED LOVE THIS PLACE!  It's kind of like a cafe style restaurant with a glass cheese display.  The owner is a humble Republican State Senator...after a few glasses of wine he probably gets cornered quite a bit.  

Anyway...I was on a date.  This is a GREAT date place.  We ordered pairings of cheeses and wines that are already selected for you.  We each got our own tastes (3 each).  We shared each other's cheese and wine.  The service is so so, but nothing to complain about really.  After our cheese tasting I ordered the salmon.  It was cooked very well with fresh vegetables.

Great place...and I look forward to my next visit in Phoenix to come back here.
