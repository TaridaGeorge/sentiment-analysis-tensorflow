Service was great, food was awesome!  Yelp is right.  Definitely try the pork belly pastrami ($12) and the Citizen chopped salad ($12).  The pan-seared scallops were also winners ($24).

The cask cocktails are also amazing. So smooth.  The Manhattan ($11) was amazing.  The flavors definitely mellowed in the cask and gave it a unique flavor as well.

And don't miss the bread pudding!  Yum! $10 and worth every penny!

Plus one of the only places in downtown Scottsdale that's open past 10pm.  Score!
