When my daughter and I moved to Maricopa I was concerned about enrolling her in a new school. Her old charter school was so amazing that I was starting to feel discouraged when I looked at the public schools in the area. I found out about Legacy and fortunately we were able to get her enrolled. It is, in my opinion, the best school in Maricopa. My mother, who is a teacher at an exclusive private school in the state, is impressed with Legacy as a whole. :)
