We love this place so much that we actually had them reserve the room upstairs of their North Scottsdale location to host our wedding shower in!!  Of course tons of southwest chicken rolls and hummus were served, along with the delicious beers they are so well-known for.

Being vegetarian, I appreciate that they have a nice selection of veggie stuff to choose from (cheese enchiladas, artichoke dip, blackbean burgers, nachos) and the service at the North Scottsdale one is just great.  We like the Tempe one, but usually find it a bit warm and a bit too far from us.

We always have super-fast service and perfectly prepared food, I just can't give this restaurant a better review!!
