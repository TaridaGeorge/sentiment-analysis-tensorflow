I work close to this place so that's why i give it 5 stars.  Mostly for convenience.  On a hot summer day they have misters everywhere.  It's a place you can hang out with friends, bring a date, or bring the kids.  A great place to eat, hang out or shop.  I go all the time.  At least 3 times a week.  They have pretty much all the stores you look for in a regular mall.  Its clean and kept up with very well.  They also have a harkins theatre for going to the movies.  It's also in a great location next to the major freeways.  PLUS PLUS PLUS
