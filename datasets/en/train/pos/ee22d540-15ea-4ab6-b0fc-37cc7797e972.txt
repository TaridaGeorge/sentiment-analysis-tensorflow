Cibo!  I found Cibo last summer when I was looking for a relaxed place to meet my grandfather for dinner.  With seasons tickets to the Diamondbacks he can meet me at Cibo for dinner before he catches a night game.

I love Cibo's location in downtown Phoenix.  I love that it's in an old house.  I love the staff--so welcoming.

My grandfather is a little disappointed that they only serve wine and beer so that he can't get a gin and tonic, but I like sitting at the bar and drinking a slow glass of wine.

The food has always been delicious (we're pretty snobby when it comes to any kind of Italian fare...)
