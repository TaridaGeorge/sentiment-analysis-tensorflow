I can't believe there are only 8 reviews on here for Seattle Espresso! The number of regular, faithful customers who frequent Seattle Espresso rivals that of any coffee shop I have ever been to either in the U.S. or internationally. It is my, and many others, home away from home. 

Go, and go more than one time.  Try a double shot iced White Russian and then work yourself across the menu! All of their drinks are delicious!

The Baristas will remember you and your drink, especially if you go a couple times. My favorite aspect of Seattle Espresso is that all different types of people frequent the establishment.  It is not only made up of trendy, hipster customers, although some of them come here too! 

The decor is nothing to write home about, but it is the people and the product that keep people coming back again and again.
