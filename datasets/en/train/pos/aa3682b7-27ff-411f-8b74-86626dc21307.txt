This was the best lunch I have ever had. We ordered this at 1100am and were able to pick up by 1120am! The food was fantastic! I got the Eggplant Rollatini, wasn't sure just what I would be getting, but it was A LOT better than I imagined. Eggplant, fresh basil, fresh mozzarella wrapped in  delicious dough! The pizza was to die for and the calazones were perfect. Great bang for your buck! I got 2 lunches from $8 and was satisfied both days.
