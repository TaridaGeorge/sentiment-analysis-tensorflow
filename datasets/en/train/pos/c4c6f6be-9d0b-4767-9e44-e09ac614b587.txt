My review is mostly for Julia, my waxer. She helped to make my first and subsequent experiences there more comfortable. There is a little private waiting room within the salon/spa and there is nice music and a small fountain. The girls bring you water while you wait. Maybe tea/coffee too, but I'm not sure. 

I want to go back to get my hair done and possibly get a mani/pedi. Any girls with me on that one? 

I purchased some hair products there too -- I recommend the Bumble & Bumble line.
