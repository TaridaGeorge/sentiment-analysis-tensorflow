The wait is completely worth it.  (just don't go before sunset if you'll wilt)

Price:  Great
Atmosphere:  Great
Service: Great
Taste: Like no pizza ever before

This is not just the best pizza you've had, it doesn't compare to the greasy, saucy pies we all love.  The oven or the ingredient or some kind of mystical alchemy really make this food shine and satisfy.  

If you've been told Cibo or Liberty Market are "just as good", you've been lied to. Yes, those places both make good pies, but it's not the same.  

Take a few friends, put your name on the list and have a few rounds at the Rose & Crown across the yard.  When it's you're turn, you'll be happy you waited.
