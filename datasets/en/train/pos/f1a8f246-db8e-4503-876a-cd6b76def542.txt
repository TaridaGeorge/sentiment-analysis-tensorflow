Here is a weird review. They didn't fix my car, but it is the best place I have been for car repairs in a long time. I have a Toyota Land Cruiser that has a brake system issue, and Tim looked at it for 2 days and determined that I would be better off taking it to an independent Toyota Expert since he was not the most familiar with the ever so expensive Toyota brake system on my vehicle. He did charge up my batter for me, but never charged me a dime. Why can't they all be this honest!!
