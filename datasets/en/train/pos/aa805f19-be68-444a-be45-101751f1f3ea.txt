Okay, so the service is spotty. If it's the old man, fuggedaboutit. You're not going to get served forever and you're gonna be frustrated. If it's the daughter, you're in luck. She runs the room like a pro. So, why five stars?

Because the food is spot on incredible, and their rice is the best carb-load in town. We get the number two combo platter to go (our two young girls make it difficult to eat out). We skip the questionable service and come home with enough food for at least four meals. 

I can't recommend the food here highly enough. The service, well, not so much.

Oh, and get a slice of the daughter's wedding cake. It's just the tool to get you off of the Atkins wagon.
