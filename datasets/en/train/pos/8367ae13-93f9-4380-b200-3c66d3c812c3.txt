I live in the neighborhood and a few months back was wondering why there were all of these cars late at night by this little place.  Well, I stopped in and was so excited to learn that it was a coffee/wine bar. I have been back several times for lunch and dinner and it just keeps getting better and better.  I even hosted my monthly book club here and everyone had a spectacular time. The staff is great and  Rebecca, Josh and Jeff always aim to please.  I highly recommend the lavosh of the moment & the roast beef sliders are divine!  Follow them on twitter as they tweet specials almost every day.  Can't wait to see more people discover this little gem.
