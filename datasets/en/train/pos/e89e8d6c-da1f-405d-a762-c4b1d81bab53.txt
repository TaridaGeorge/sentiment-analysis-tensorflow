Not sure what to expect based on earlier very mixed reviews, but WOW! Great service, amazing entrees. My husband was thrilled by his eggplant parmesan (his standard for Italian). I had escolar with a lemon caper sauce, lobster ravioli, steamed veggies, all done to perfection. Definitely will be back
