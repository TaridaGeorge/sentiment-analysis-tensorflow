Note that the previous reviews were from before the remodel. There are bathrooms and adult beverages. My kids went here on a Saturday morning with their grandpa and had a great time. They said everything was very modern and clean. At 10am on Saturday morning kids under 12 bowl free, you just have to pay for the shoe rental. The kids said there  were several bowling balls to choose from. The owner and the employees working there were very friendly. You definitely should come check the new place out!
