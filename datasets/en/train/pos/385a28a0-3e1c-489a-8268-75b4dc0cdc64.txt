I love this Festival, we look forward to it every year.  I move my schedule around so nothing interferes with me being able to make it.  This year again, we had a great time.  We had pizza from Spinatto's and tacos from America's Taco Shop.  I had a piece of bruschetta from Postino, of course the fig, apple, brie one.  YUM.  After several attempts, finally the twins had cheese pizza, of course then they wanted more, they ended up having 3 pieces each, face full of tomato sauce and stains all over their superhero outfits.  Bruce Brown catering was handing out very generous portions of Jambalaya, and it was really tasty, with enough of a kick to it.  Kidstop had a great craft activity for the kids.  This event is so AWESOME!
