Amazing sushi and that is all I have to say!  Found out about this place from Phx magazine and the sushi chef at AJ's fine foods supermarket @ Dana Park and it was as good or even better than they described it!  my favorite was the sea trout carpaccio (On my 1st visit). On my second visit to this place I took the advise of our server who told us we should sit at the bar next time and try the "chef's Choice", so I did and it was outstanding ! we did 7 courses and left there satisfied but not over stuffed and very pleased with every single course. In two words: quality and creativity. Will certainly be returning to this place soon.  
PS. If you consider california rolls real sushi this is NOT a place for you - go somewhere else!
