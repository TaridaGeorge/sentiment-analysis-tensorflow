What an amazing blessing!!!!!  After ball practice we took the kids up for dinner.  We ordered our meals (two adults and two kids) and it was on the house!!!!  The cashier said, "This is your lucky day.  Its on us.  We appreciate your business and thank you."  We were so surprised and really didn't get why.  How terrible that good customer service is so shocking!  But it was.  What a great thing!  The managers were beyond great, the staff was awesome, the food was good, and its so amazing when customer service is a valued part of business.  Especially in this day and age.  It made our night and its a great feeling to know there are still good managers teaching their staff good values.  Thank you Freddy's!!  We will be customers for life!
