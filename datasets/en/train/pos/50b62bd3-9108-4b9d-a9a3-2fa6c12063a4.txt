Cibo's is easily the best pizza place in the city of Phoenix and probably in my top two overall for the valley of the sun (the other is in downtown glendale.) Great food, great wine and an amazing atmosphere, what else could you ask for? Come at the right time of the evening when the white patio x-mas lights are on and you'll swear your an extra in some cheesy romance movie and you just can't see the cameras. Winters are even better when the fire pit is roaring. 

See the other reviews for how amazing the pizza is, i can't say anything more then what's been already said. Haven't tried Cibo's yet? what are you waiting for, get down there. You won't regret it
