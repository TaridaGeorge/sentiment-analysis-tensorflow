The resort is beautiful. My favorite part about the room is the gold fish! An extra special touch for sure. The closet is larger than the bathroom! Loved the balcony with the doors so I could enjoy the desert weather! We held a company event this evening and the entire staff was very accommodating. Anything we needed (and we needed ALOT) was never frown upon. The food is AMAZING.
