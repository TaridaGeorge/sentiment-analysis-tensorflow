This is a newer chicken place in town. They server Chicken Fingers, Toast, Fries, and their special Sauce.
If anyone has ever been to Lucky Wishbone in Tucson, it very much reminds me of their chicken fingers meal.
It is excellent and their homemade lemon aid is to die for. We always have to order extra because we fight over it. 

Slightly pricy for a fast food place, but you do get the quality you pay for and they have a club called the Caniac Club you can sign up for and get free meals.

Whats not to love? As my 2 year old says "Bok Bok Chicky!!!"
