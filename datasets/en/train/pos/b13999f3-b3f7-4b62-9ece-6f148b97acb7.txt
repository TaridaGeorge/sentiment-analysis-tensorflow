It is always a treat to eat here. The tastes are delicious and exotic and the staff is helpful. 

A great balance between affordable and romantic. 

Amazing Persian rugs on the walls as well!

You must try the filet mignon (Barg) with the raisin and date rice (adas polo). One of the most delicious meals I've ever had!
