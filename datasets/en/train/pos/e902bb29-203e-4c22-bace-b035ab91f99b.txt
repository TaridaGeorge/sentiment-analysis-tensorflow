I've been here about a dozen times and every time has been a great experience (really fun for groups with a ton of small plates in the middle of the table). During the high season, best to get a reservation but this last Wednesday, pretty quiet.  The food is amazing as is the decor.  When they seated us, the host asked if I wanted a pillow for my high backed chair-nice!  The service was great-staff is laid back and personable (knowledgeable, too).  I stick to the veggie fare, but my hubby goes for the meat dishes. They have plenty of great wines (we stay in the $40-50 range and still fabulous-you can go way up from there , but..). Topped it off with an espresso martini and was good to go.  Dress: casual/hip/sexy. Can't wait to go back.
