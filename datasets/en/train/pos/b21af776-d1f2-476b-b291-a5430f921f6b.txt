I thought I left a review already Hhhmmm.. Ok. Great local mail center. It's nice to have right here since I hate going to the post office. Ugh. Snow Birds are coming back soon. They don't come to this side of town (well unless its Senior Movie Day!) so it's nice for us local residents to have a place to go, get in and out quick. Always with a smile.
