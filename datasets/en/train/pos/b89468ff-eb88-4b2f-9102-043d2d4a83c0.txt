The food here is fantastic.  The ratio of portion to price is superb, and the selections are vast.  Also, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of ingredients.  I'm giving The Greek Pita 5 stars for these reasons, and also because of the cry-baby reviewer who gave this place one star over a 50cents sauce.  Hopefully this will balance the overall rating a bit higher after her unnecessary emotional outburst and 1-star rating. :)
