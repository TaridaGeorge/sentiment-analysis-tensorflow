Incredible breakfast/lunch spot in North Phoenix!  If you're looking for an extremely clean place with spacious outdoor seating (two large patios!) then check-out The Good Egg's Tramonto location. This is one of their newer locations, and the decor is as fresh as the food.  Recommend the Breakfast Burrito, my personal favorite and if your a regular, make sure you follow #thegoodegg on twitter.  The love the positive tweets and oftentimes will surprise you with complimentary meals.  www.twitter.com/thegoodegg
