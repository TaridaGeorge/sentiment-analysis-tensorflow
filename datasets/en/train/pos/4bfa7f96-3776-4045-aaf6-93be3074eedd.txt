Probably the best Thai restaurant in the valley save for Malees on Main, which is double the price. I have been to Thailand many times, and Thai Lahna represents true, authentic Thai cuisine like what you would find on the streets of Bangkok. Clean flavors, good preparation, friendly staff. 

This family run restaurant is a pleasant change from the chain eateries so common in Phoenix. They have beer and wine
