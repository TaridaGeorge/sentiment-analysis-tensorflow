Best Feature: Too many to count!

Ok, there's too many things that I want to say and if you know me, I don't like to make cluttered reviews so I'm just going to give it to you strait.

The coffee is excellent - try their lattes hot first.  

Their teas are great

They have a giant hangy light thing which rocks.

Have you ever seen a hardwood floor in Arizona!?

DVD and record player free to use.  They raided the LP selection of someone from Pitchfork Media.

WiFi.

They got pews from a church in Prescott!  In my opinion it feels like you're at a train station!

One of the owner's names is Chaz.

Awesome
