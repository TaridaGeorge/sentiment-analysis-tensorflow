All that I can say is get the trash can lid full of food you get all your favorites plus corn fries and slaw.  The Brisket here is awesome!  The ribs are very good! Not as big as shanes BBQ but still good.  The smell alone is enough to make you hungry!  The service is pretty good, drinks are overpriced but that seems to be the new standard nowadays.  The Portion size is huge.  You will be taking some home.  My favorite is the RIb Tips.  You get three times more rib meat and half the price of a rack.  You will not be disappointed.  This place is not for calorie watchers.   The sauces are awesome too.
