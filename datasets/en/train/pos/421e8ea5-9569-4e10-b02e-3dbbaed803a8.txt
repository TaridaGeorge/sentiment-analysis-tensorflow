I happened upon Aloha Kitchen on my last visit to Phoenix. The food was authentic and perfect. I grew up in Hawaii and was transported back to the islands and my childhood. On my fortieth birthday, it was the perfect evening. 

The saimin, char sui bao, and the teriyaki chicken were great. I wouldn't recommend the haupia pie as authentic which is a good thing for the locals. When done exceptionally well, it is addictive. 

I will eat here during each and every visit to the area.
