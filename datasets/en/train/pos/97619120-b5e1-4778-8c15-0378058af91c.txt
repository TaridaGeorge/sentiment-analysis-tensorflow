Quite possibly my new favorite bar in the Phx area...don't get me wrong, I still love Gordon B's in Tempe but this place fulfills food and drink criteria...delicious pretzel with spicy mustard or cheese dip...honey wheat on tap or try the bartenders vodka concoction. Hoppin' crowd but not crazy...definitely a place to come back to!
