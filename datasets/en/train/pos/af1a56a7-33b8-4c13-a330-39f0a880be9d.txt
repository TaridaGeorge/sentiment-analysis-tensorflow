This is one of the most underrated places in Tempe.  I am a vegetarian and I love the falafel.  The family that owns this place is very nice and if you come enough times they will start remembering you and know what you want.  You can substitute fries for hummus and it is delicious.  I have never had falafel as good as this one.
