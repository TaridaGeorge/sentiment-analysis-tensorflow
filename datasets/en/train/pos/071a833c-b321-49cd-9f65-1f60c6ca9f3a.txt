The Great Wall is our family's #1 favorite Chinese restaurant - hands down.  It has a wonderful family-owned feel, yet with consistently fast, friendly service every time you go.  We've never found anything we didn't like, and our 5 yr old daughter could just about eat her weight in their egg-drop soup!

We recommend it to anyone in the East Valley who is looking for good Chinese.
