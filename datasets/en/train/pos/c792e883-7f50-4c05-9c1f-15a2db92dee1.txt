Unbelievable food for a chain restaurant! Normally we would never go to a chain place for dinner - especially in phoenix - but i could not resist all the pics of their food on facebook.

We started with the spinach/lump crab dip, it was good but not outstanding. I ordered the big bayou platter with stuffed shrimp, bacon wrapped shrimp and lobster - it was excellent (dirty rice was great too). My gf ordered king crab legs - wow - she got the medium and i swear it was a full pound and they tasted great.
