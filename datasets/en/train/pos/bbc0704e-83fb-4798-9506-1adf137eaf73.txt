Another totally awesome reason to make the trek to Glendale! How does this man find all this cool stuff!?!? and he has a location on 7th avenue right across the way from Retro Ranch? what? His Glendale store is gynormous! Way bigger then the 7th ave location. And it is just packed with amazing vintage finds. You want serious Danish Modern classy gorgeousness? He has it. You want super cheesy kitsch monstrosities? He's got that too. Love me some vintage with a sense of humor! You will laugh...you'll cry... you will want to take the whole freakin' store home!
