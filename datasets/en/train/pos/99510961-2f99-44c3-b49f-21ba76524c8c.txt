Wicked good food, very convenient, great beer selection.  What's good here?  It's more like what's not good here?  Nothing comes to mind, honest.  The one thing the food is not, though, is light, though they do have salads, if you're concerned.  But then you'd miss out on that excellent buttery pasty dough.  fyi...pasties (pronounced pass-tees) are calzone-like meals, with much richer dough and almost anything you can imagine inside.  There's a huge vegetarian selection too.
