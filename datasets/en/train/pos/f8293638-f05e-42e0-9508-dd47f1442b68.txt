We visited on a Friday evening - wow, is it popular!  We had a party of 16 but had phoned ahead.  They had us seated pretty fast and the service was absolutely great!  I had a Ruben Sandwich and it was very tasty, but I really loved the home made tasting Cole Slaw that came with it.  I stole some of my wife's French Fries - very yummy!  I didn't have a beer, but several others at our table had draft beers delivered in very large frosty mugs ... mmmmm.  I had iced tea and it was weak - I like a stronger tea.  I will definitely come back again soon.
