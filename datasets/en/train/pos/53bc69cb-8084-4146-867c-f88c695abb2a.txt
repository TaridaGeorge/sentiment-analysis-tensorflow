Excellent service, amazing selection of bottled beers and wines along with the metro/retro lounge feel make Side Bar the perfect place for a drink with friends. 

Both bartenders I met, as well as owner Josh, were attentive and actually interesting - offering up thoughts and suggestions on some of their favorite beers and cocktails. I gotta love a place that spans the beer universe from PBR to Lagunitas IPA to Chimay. But don't get me wrong, this isn't just your average beer-centric hole-in-the-wall. Side Bar is definitely more lounge than bar. The exceptionally sleek interior design set against hardwood floors and exposed brick features low comfy couches in the front and funky spring-loaded white leather barstools with a real splash of color coming from the orange-lit bar itself. Side Bar is a most welcome addition to the neighborhood.
