I grew up in New Haven, CT with great pizza and have heard about this place for quite some time. We went last night and it was dynamite! The wait was an a hour and a half but next store they have a wine bar to grab a drink and a snack to hold you over. The service was great, the employees who we interacted with had been with the owner for 25 years. The margarita was divine and the wise guy was also tasty. I would highly recommend!
