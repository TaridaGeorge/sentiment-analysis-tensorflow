This store, man! It's the best. Perfect place to shop, or kill time, or boredom, or all of the above! 
Browsing here is just fun, i always manage to pick up a few random items, and usually spend less than 20 bucks.
Also a great place to buy a unique gift. They even sell fun gift boxes!
Their end of season sales are superb, too. We picked up a few lawn chairs for $20 each last August, and obviously in Arizona. managed to get plenty of use out of them!
