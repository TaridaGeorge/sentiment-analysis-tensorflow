Love AJ's!  First and foremost, I am completely addicted to their iced tea.  Every food establishment in Phoenix should be required to offer the same brand of iced tea, in several flavors, with your choice of lemon or orange slices.  The only problem?  Frequently long lines.  But super great and friendly service.  Don't forget to pick up a brownie or tiramisu.  Oh yeah, they have really great groceries, too.
