I brought my father here because it was the only place open over the weekend. He got treated right away. The doctor and the staff were very helpful.  We really appreciated their attentiveness and promptness. My father was helped with the symptoms, left the clinic feeling better, with prescription and treatment plan that his regular doctor fully approved. The facility was clean and well stocked. I highly recommend it.
