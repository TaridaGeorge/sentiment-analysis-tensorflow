Warm and full of character, a rarity for Phoenix.   East to get in and out of.  We sat in the newly added area (server told us)  - the addition was done in a tasteful way.  Adds some needed inside space although I cannot wait to try the HUGE patio in the winter.  We were on our way to a concert at Comerica Theater, the restaurant is just a few blocks north.  Food portions were appropriate and reasonably priced.
