A neighborhood favorite.  You can always count on excellent up beat service from Jake & Season and their brew crew any time of day.  Their service alone makes me a returning customer.  Be sure to try to the freshly brewed iced teas, yummy lattes and tasty Bialys.  A good place to get quick great service and hang out in their patio with friends or to meet new ones.  Very cool coffee shop.
