The food here is amazing, try the Machaca beef tacos, I prefer them with no garnish.  This is another real authentic Mexican food place in the Phoenix Metro area that has quality Mexican food at a great price.  It is very clean, fast and the people are friendly.  They have delivery for a small area in south scottsdale, but the amunt of time it takes them to get your house kinda reuins the food (soggy taco shells).  BUT I still give them 5 stars!
