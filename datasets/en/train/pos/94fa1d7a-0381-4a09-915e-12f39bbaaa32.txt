Still Loving Crackers after all this time! 
They are one of the few places I've been to recently that doesn't seem to be cutting corners and going down hill! 

One of my favorite lunches is the "Turkey Avocado Melt" it's called the Roast Beef Avocado Melt on the menu but I always get it with Turkey and a side of fruit!(see pics) 
Maybe it's the special sauce or that light and crispy grilled sourdough garlic bread but it's a Damn Good Sandwich I find ,my self craving all too often!

Try it you'll love it!
