What's not to love about this place?! The food is delicious and the atmosphere is charming! 

I highly recommend the Omero Salad and the La Noce and Rustica pizza's!

On a side note, there's always been great debate among my friends as to how the name is pronounced. I went to the website tonight before I wrote this review and found the answer we've all wondering Cibo is pronounced "CHEE-boh"! 

Enjoy your visit!
