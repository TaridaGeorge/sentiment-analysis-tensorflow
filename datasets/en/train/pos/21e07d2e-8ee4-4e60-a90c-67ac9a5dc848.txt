I am in love with Switch. I have only been there a few times but each time the food has been delicious. 
I like the laid back atmosphere and the service has always been great too. the have a huge menu, lots of options for salads, sandwiches and more. Large drink menu as well.

Recommended - the burgers, the chicken sandwich, the hummus, the mac and cheese and the sangria.
