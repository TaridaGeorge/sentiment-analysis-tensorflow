Had another amazing meal here. Some more recommendations include the Gulf Crab Dip....pair it with the Pinot Grigio....and you have perfection! Also my husband ordered the Cajun Prime Rib which I had a few tastes of......delicious.....even nicer if you order it with the Shrimp. My main meal and the dessert were the same as last time.....and I think if it is possible the Rhubarb and Strawberry Cobler has managed to improve and taste even better than the last time!
