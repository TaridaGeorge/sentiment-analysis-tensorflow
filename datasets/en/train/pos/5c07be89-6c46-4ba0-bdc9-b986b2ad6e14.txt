I have been frequenting this place for years now, and it just occurred to me to write a review. 

I love the tea lattes at Solo! I took my BFF for a JASMINE NECTAR and now she is obsessed. The atmosphere is awesome, as are the baristas. It is a great place to study quietly, or to just chill. 

I do agree that the chemical smell from the salon can be overpowering when they go in and out through the connecting door, but I also love the fact that the husband owns the coffee shop and the wife owns the salon. It makes me happy to see both their businesses flourishing. Maybe now that they are more established, and doing well, they will extend their weekend hours.
