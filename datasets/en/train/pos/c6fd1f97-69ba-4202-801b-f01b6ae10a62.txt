I have many pictures of my four legged kids, most not very good as I can never get them to sit still long enough to capture the 'who' it is that they are.  Christmas of last year, I decided I needed professional assistance and contacted Michelle Pelberg of Cow Dreamz  Photography, (602) 510-1929.  Michelle will meet prospective clients in most any setting as it is her mission to photograph pets relaxed and in their element.  We decided on a local park and met in the afternoon.  Like all great photographers, Michelle snapped away, remaining inconspicuous as my dogs enjoyed a winter day in the great out doors.

I will utilize Michelle in any future pet photography project and happily endorse her services to all interested parties.  She has a knack for capturing the essence of our beloved four legged kids.
