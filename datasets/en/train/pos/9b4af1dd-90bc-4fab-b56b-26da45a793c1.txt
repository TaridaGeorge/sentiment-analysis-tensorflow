I know it is a chain, but I am hard pressed to find better barbecue in Phoenix. The rib tips are among the best I have ever tasted. The brisket and ribs are also good. The hot links are good, but not as wonderful as the other stuff. I buy their sauces for home and go through Devil Spit like water. 

Service is always good too. They also do a great job at catering. They handled food at an event I recently coordinated and they handled 200 plus people very efficiently. 

I highly recommend Famous Dave's to anyone who likes barbecue. There is better at certain mom and pop places in the South, but again, I put it up against anything in Phoenix--even Joe's in Gilbert.
