This store is great. Comprehensive collection of baking and cake decorating supplies. They had everything I needed to complete the cakes for my brother's wedding. 

The staff is everywhere and super helpful. I didn't feel lost at all. They were also quite friendly. Frick and Frack (not their names, but what can ya do? :) ) behind the counter were hilarious to listen to and interact with. So fun!

It's in a good central location, although it is still quite a trek for me. It's worth it to find everything I need in one place. 

Their website is also super helpful. You can order online, or just check that they carry something before you make the journey there. 

Prices? Quite reasonable, thank you very much.
