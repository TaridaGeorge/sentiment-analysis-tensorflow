Visited Thai Basil again yesterday while on my way back to the DREADED DMV. The DMV Sucked as usual, but Thai Basil was wonderful as always! I had the Red Curry Chicken & had it Thai Hot. Let me say it was the perfect amount of heat. The sauce is Sweet & hot & DELICIOUS! My husband had the Yellow Curry Chicken and was just as impressed. The food comes out in no time & the atmosphere is very ZEN if you get my drift. The music is tranquil & you can always hear birds gently tweeting in the back ground. A great break away when you have to face the dreaded DMV or on break from a hectic day at work. GOOD STUFF!!!
