LOVE Postino, best bruschetta  ....ever. Go on Monday or Tuesday after 8 and you can get a giant sampler of it AND a bottle of wine for $20. Love their brunches, love their location, love the free valet parking. It's basically a giant love fest. Also, their staff is amazing, no matter how busy they are you always get great friendly, timely service from lovely people. P.S. they like dogs too, so sit on the patio and you can bring yours...they even have little doggie dishes of water to keep your furry friend hydrated. What's not to like.
