Love, love this place. Had their White Russian Daiquiri mixed with their tasty Banana Daiquiri. This particular location has more choices, I love more choices when it comes to alcohol. Place is pretty large, alot of Fat Tuesdays tend to be much smaller. Can't wait to have another one of their frozen delights in my hands.
