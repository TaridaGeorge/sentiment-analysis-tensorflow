What you have come to expect of Trader Joe's in terms of quality, service and experience, you will find at this one.  Employees eager to help you if you need help, simple store layout, great bargains on certain things that i go there specifically to buy.  Like another, I do go there to get the wines.  I also usually pick up some cheese and always am looking in their frozen food aisle for something that might make a good snack.  I have never had a problem with this store and have been going there since it opened a long time ago.
