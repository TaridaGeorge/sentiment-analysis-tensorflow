Move over Bosa, there's a new champ in town!

This place is super good, and the one area where they crush Bosa, is in customer service. Bosa is nice, don't get me wrong, but Golden has the friendliest, warmest staff around. The donuts are close to Bosa, but just edge it out by a hair. It is very safe to say if you like Bosa, you will love Golden. It's great that the valley has so many non-chain options, and I encourage you to skip Dunkin, and the corporate crap, and support locally owned spots.

This is where something funny and witty would go, but I got nothing. So maybe think of a good joke during this time. Ready, go: ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Ha ha! That was a good one! Now go get some donuts!
