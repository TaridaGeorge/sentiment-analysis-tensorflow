Some of the best ice cream I've ever had. Super creamy and flavourful home-made taste without being icy or leaving a weird film in my mouth. The prices are a lot lower than I expected, too! 
After trying a sample of the "Vietnamese coffee" ice cream (which was delicious but not what I was craving), I got a scoop of double chocolate on a sugar cone with a few pieces of the home-made caramel they had sitting on the counter. 
They have a huge list of toppings, candies (normal and home-made treats), coffee and coffee drinks, and baked goods available too. Also, local art if you're into that.
I'll definitely be back for more.
