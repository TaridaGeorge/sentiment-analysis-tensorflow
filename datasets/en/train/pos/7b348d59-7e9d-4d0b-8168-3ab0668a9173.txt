YUM! Everything is made fresh and they don't over cook the veggies.  They use a sauce in most of their dishes that is fabulous.  I take my visitors there and they say it is the best Chinese food ever.  Especially the hot and sour soup.  YUM! The service could improve.  When we do take out, it only takes 15 min.
