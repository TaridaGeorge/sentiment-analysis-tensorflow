Last night was our second visit and I am impressed (which is somewhat difficult to do).  We dined on the upstairs patio and it's a fun little place to hang out.  

The drinks were creative and interesting.  The Camelback Cooler is a fun take on a margarita (who knew cayenne and sugar got along so well?).  My table had the sesame ahi, meatloaf and stroganoff.  All were delicious.  For dessert, we had the lemon cake, nutella bread pudding and adult milkshake - all fabulous.  (At this point, we have more than corrected for the pathetic sundae that was served during restaurant week.)  

The service was attentive and friendly without being overbearing.  Despite the emphasis on cow, it's definitely NOT just a steakhouse.  Go get your yum on!
