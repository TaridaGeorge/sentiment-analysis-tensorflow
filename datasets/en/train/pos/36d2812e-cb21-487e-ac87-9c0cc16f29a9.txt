A-mazing service! 

The girls are always very calm for a starbucks. Which is great for a change. I always know what I want when I walk into any starbucks location, however, I usually get the rushed feeling. This location is always very steady with the customer flow, the girls have great control over the customers. 

They actually want you to take your time and figure out what you want. 

AMAZING. It's always the small things that get noticed. Great job!
