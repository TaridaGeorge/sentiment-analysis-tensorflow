Just had lunch here, ridiculously well priced for the quality of food and service. The ambience is very nice and classy but do not be intimidated, for lunch everyone was casually dressed, jeans and even shorts.  Bread with awesome sun dried tomato basil butter is complimentary.  The appetizers looked phenomenal, with mostly seafood options, we couldn't decide what to order as a group so we unfortunately didn't try any =( I had the Penne con Brocolli, the garlic butter sauce was the best I've had, I mopped the rest of it off the plate with the fresh bread they kept refilling our baskets with. yummmmmmmmmmmm.
