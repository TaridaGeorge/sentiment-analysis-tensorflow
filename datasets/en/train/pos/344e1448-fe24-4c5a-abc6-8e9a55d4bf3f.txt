This is the best apartment complex I have ever lived in. This place is very close to school. Flash bus is free or you can bike it easily. It is not a new complex by any stretch, but it is well taken care of, and managed extremely well. Pam (I hope she's still there) is a decent person as well as being a great manager. My hot water heater went out and it was replaced the same day. Pam even allowed me to use the shower in the model apartment because I had to be at work before my water heater would be replaced. Henry (the maintenance guy) takes care of everything lightning fast. I really have nothing bad to say about any of my experiences here. I've lived in many apartments, and Salado Springs is far and away the best.
