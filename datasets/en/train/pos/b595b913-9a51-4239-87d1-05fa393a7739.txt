Best drip coffee in Phoenix, hands down.  The staff is extremely friendly and gracious.  I also love their deviled egg sandwich.  I've definitely taken every out-of-town friend here.  I've heard (though have not tried) that their cupcakes, which are made in-house, are to die for.  The place is great for studying - tables abound.  I've conducted a few interviews here for various things and have always found the atmosphere to be great - quiet enough but enough background noise/music (and the music choice is great) to make it lively.  Just left Phoenix and I will miss Copper Star!
