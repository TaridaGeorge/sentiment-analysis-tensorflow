Haji-baba I love you!
Best middle eastern food!!! :)
I came here last week 3 times for the chicken shawarma plate and kabob. 
If I lived in Arizona I would have to come here at least once a week... it's that good!
Reasonable prices, casual dining and friendly service!
Stress free parking!
If I ever visit Arizona again... HAJIBABA will be first on the the list!
If you live in the area or visiting Arizona... and love middle eastern food... you have to eat here!
Arizona I'm so jealous!
I'm a fan!
