I took the kids to the Farmers Market with me this weekend and it was a great experience. As soon as we got there, they were handed balloons by one of the vendors, then we trailed around the Market, to get a good idea of what I wanted to purchase. I ended up buying some delicious home made pamegranate jam, followed by a stop at the kiddie korner, where the kids made Valentine's for Daddy. Then, we tried the breads and decided to grab a fresh loaf of 9 grain. Yum! Lots of veggies and fruits later, we have a fridge full of great locally grown snacks and meals. Can't wait to go back!
