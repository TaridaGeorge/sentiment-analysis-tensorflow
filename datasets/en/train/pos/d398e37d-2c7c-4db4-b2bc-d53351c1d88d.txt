This place is really great (but you'll have to get over the intense nail salon smell inside). 

The owner is very nice and easy to talk to. The frozen yogurt is really really  good!!! I asked for a small Cheesecake flavor, easy on the berries and instead I got tons of berries layered up but that was due to generosity which was very sweet.

I'm definitely an addicted fan!
