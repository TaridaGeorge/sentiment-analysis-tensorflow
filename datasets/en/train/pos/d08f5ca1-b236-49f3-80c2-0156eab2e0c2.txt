I absolutely love this place.  The food is awesome and the owner genuinely cares about downtown PHX and giving her customers an awesome choice for dining.  I live nearby and eat here often.  Try the Pho- you won't regret it.  Spring Rolls are fantastic- I love the variety and splitting several w/my husband. Ambiance is awesome- not your run of the mill chain restaurant drab beige interior, as they've made over an eyesore of a historic home into a chic and welcoming spot you'd be proud to take a date... and you must take anyone who thinks the Phoenix food scene is lacking in character and hipness ;)
