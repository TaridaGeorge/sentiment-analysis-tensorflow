This is one stop shopping for indie music fans. They have listening stations where you can preview new releases. The selection of used cds is large and could easily take up your whole afternoon. I always find something I've been searching for when I go in!
But the real reason I keep going back? The staff. They give me great recommendations every time I visit, are always willing to talk, and will even put on any of the cds in the store for you to listen to while browsing. Stinkweeds is an essential part of the indie music scene in Phoenix. Support your local record store! You won't be disappointed!
