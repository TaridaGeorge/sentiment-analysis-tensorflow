Great place for a manicure and pedicure. It's spotless, airy, and light -- a good place to spend a few hours on a Saturday afternoon.

There are about eight pedicure chairs, and they'll let you soak if they can't start your pedicure right away. There are six or seven manicure stations, so it's easy to bring your friends and have a conversation. Or if you're alone, there are plenty of recent magazines to keep you busy.

Prices are qutie reasonable -- $18 for a pedicure and about the same for a French manicure. Tina did a great job on mine, and I'll go back again soon. Drop-ins are welcome.
