I came in here yesterday stressed to the point of an anxiety attack, and walked out with, literally, a pound of frozen yogurt. I'm so ridiculous. But it was so good. The Skinny Blueberry is so incredibly delicious. Frozen yogurt is making me wonder if I have an addictive personality, because I can't go a week without it. 

This one's much smaller than the Biltmore store, but also has a lot less people, and a different array of flavors. Stress relief through frozen yogurt-not the best solution, but it works for me.
