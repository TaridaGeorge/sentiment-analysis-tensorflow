Had a great time pool-side. The atmosphere is great and the staff was very attentive. Drinks were great, sun was a little hot, can't really blame the W for that though. Beautiful hotel with a great modern style. Definitely recommend as a great spot to relax in the AZ sun or stay for a weekend. Also not a bad spot for some celeb sightings, saw a few of the Cardinals there when I was there
