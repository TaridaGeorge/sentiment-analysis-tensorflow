My family and I always go to this little pizza joint, when family members are in town.

Great organic food, that is fresh and super tasty!

Caesar salad with pine nuts, and feta cheese, YES please.

Their cracker thin crust is delightful.  

Get to Picazzo's today and you'll be amazed with their food.
