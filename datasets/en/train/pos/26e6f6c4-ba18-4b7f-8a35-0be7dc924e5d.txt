Locally owned.  Very helpful owner & salesperson.  Mike helped me pick out a bike to surprise my husband for his birthday.  He told me all of the benefits of the bike he suggested, and listened to what I told him that was important to my husband.
  The store has a great return / exchange policy.  Thankfully I will not have to return it, my husband absolutley loved it.  Thanks Global Bikes for your help and suggestions.
