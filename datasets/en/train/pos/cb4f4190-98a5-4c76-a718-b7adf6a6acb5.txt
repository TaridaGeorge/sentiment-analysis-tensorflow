Yes, it's true - their ice cream is amazing. 
They've been an award winning gelato store for 4 years in a row (02-06) for a reason.
The only negative thing is that the smell of chlorine in this store is overwhelming :( 
Get your gelato fast and run!
Update 09/08/2007 I haven't noticed any smell of chlorine lately. Hopefully, most of the germs were killed during previous disinfection raids ;)
