I recommend CCC to my friends.

I stopped by Central Car Care 3 years ago, because I had a nagging problem with my car. They figured it out and fixed it. Then, I had a battery problem and I asked them about it and they checked it for free.

I have an old Blazer, so they have repaired many worn out parts. Recently my air conditioning system, started blowing hot air. They got the job done quickly, professionally and I was happy to have cold air.

They always do a great job and charge me a fair price. They are nice and talk my language, which is not "auto shop language." In all these years, I don't have one complaint about Paul, Rex, or anyone there, just praise for their great efforts.
