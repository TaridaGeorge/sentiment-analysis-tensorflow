this is a very good coffee place.

I like the feel of the place. It's very authentic. The owner is not trying to hard to create a certain image like Lux coffee downtown. 

It's a simple place with a limited menu. The coffee is outstanding. The maple scone was very fresh, excellent.

My only complaint is the small cups they serve the coffee in. I prefer a larger mug but no big deal. 

It's small but I've never had a problem getting a seat and staying. the wifi is fast too.
