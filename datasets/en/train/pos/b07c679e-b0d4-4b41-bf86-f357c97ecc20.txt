Ah..Yogurtology.  How I miss thee.  Although it's been over 3 months since I've left Arizona, I still miss Yogurtology like a puppy misses its bone.  It's got the best tart froyo hands-down, and is cheaper (and tastier!) than nearby MoJo. 

The toppings bar is diverse; the fresh fruit is always fresh (instead of on-the-way to rotting like some other places I've been), and they have lots of toppings (Nutella, anyone?)  

The store is always clean, and the employees friendly.  I've actually considered getting a membership to nearby LA Fitness just so I can use Yogurtology as a motivator to visit the gym.  If only they would open up a store on the East Coast.
