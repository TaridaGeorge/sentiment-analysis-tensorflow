Home of the World Champion SF GIANTS!!!!

Budget yourself a few extra minutes as traffic in Scottsdale can be hectic.  You can also find street parking nearby. The crowd and staff are friendly.  I can't imagine a better place to watch a game other than ATT park, Wrigley, and Yankee stadium.

GO GIANTS!!!!
