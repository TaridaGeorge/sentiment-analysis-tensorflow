Heard that Charleston had the best roasted chicken ever and I was craving it. So made may way there and the waitress recommended I try the chicken rib combo, OMG this was an incredible meal, they did not disappoint. Later I had one of the best Key lime pies ever for dessert! Wow, I will absolutely be a regular here when I'm in town.
