we started with the cucumber, tomato, onion and parsley salad which was amazing. it was super fresh and so tasty. our waitress told us they don't chop the veggies until someone orders it. 

i had a chicken kabob (some of the best chicken i've had in...maybe ever) and an onion kabob. freaking so good. the onion was nice and charred and it was so much food.

my sister had the chicken kabob with the basmati rice that had the berries on top. she said it was ridiculously good.

by far some of the freshest food and most flavorful food i've had in awhile!
