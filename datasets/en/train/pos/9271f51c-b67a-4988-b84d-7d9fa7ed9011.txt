It's REI, what more can you say! They are always very freindly and extremely helpful! The staff knows the products they sell very well! Everytime I've been looking for something from spin shoes to a backpack, they know their stuff and that saves a lot of time by getting it right the first time.
Not the cheapest place to buy sporting goods but worth it when you don't want self service!
