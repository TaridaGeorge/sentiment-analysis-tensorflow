I love this place. The decor is cute, the service is great  and the nail techs are professional. I had a gel mani done and the nail tech took her time to make sure the color was on evenly and there were no marks or smudges. The salon just opened and they have the newest equipment and nail colors. The prices are great and it is close to great shopping. I definitely will be back!
