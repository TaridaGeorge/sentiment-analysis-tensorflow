Just wanted to take some time to say how much I love everything about this place.  Their fish, meat and produce are all simply amazing.  The staff is always SO friendly and theres always tons of testers (yum).
Best salad bar in the valley, hands down.  Their prepared foods are really nice as well.  The cheese dept totally rocks, I especially love the little bin w/ small pieces of reasonably priced cheese, I usually grab one or two pieces of something I've never tried when I go.
Keep it up Whole Foods!
