I have been a patron of Mabel's for a while now and I love this place.  The food is great, yea for the Mac and Cheese!  I have had everything on the menu and there isn't one item that I don't dig.  The staff is friendly and the ambiance is cozy and romantic.  What truly impressed me though is I was putting on a fundraiser and couldn't find a place that didn't want to charge and arm and a leg.  Mabel's let us do it for free!  Now a friend of mine spins there so I did have an in but still it was a show of amazing generosity.  They even gave us 20% of what the bar made that night!!  Beyond impressed.  Mabel's is at the top of my list for Scottsdale bars, no douchery, no snobbery, simply wonderful!
