I was here for an alumni event.  Fixed, catered meal.  It was amazingly delicious.  I had the Filet Mignon.  The other two choices were fish or veggies.  The veggie plate, one might think, "oh that won't be enough food".  It was a fucking mountain of veggies!  Even with my great steak, I was jealous when I saw the veggie plate.  The starter salad, sides, and finishing creme brule sealed the deal.  Even the meet & greet h'orderves at the beginning kept me centered around the food table.

It wasn't the perfect place for a speaker with awesome pictures of Mars b/c the projector situation was meh, but otherwise this was a great venue!
