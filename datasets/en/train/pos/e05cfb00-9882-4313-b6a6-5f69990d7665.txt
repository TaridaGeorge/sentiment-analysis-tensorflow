I was staying the Marriott Camelback Inn, so the restaurant was very convenient for us.   The breakfast buffet here was awesome!  The pancakes and omelets are cooked to perfection.  They offer so much variety and the fruit was the absolute best.  The lox was fresh and delicious. Being on vacation and having breakfast outside in perfect warm weather doesn't hurt either
