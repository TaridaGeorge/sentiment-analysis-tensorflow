This place is awesome. I love popcorn, I love local business, I love great customer service and attention to detail, and more importantly I popcorn. 

They have 50+ different flavors of popcorn....yeah 50. That's not to mention the flavors of the week, like loaded baked potato and bubble gum. Yeah, bubble gum. Flavors like cheesecake, pizza, buffalo wing (my favorite), parmesan garlic, caramel with almonds, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate. 

You need to try this place, even if you are not a popcorn fanatic like I am. Oh yea, and the kettle corn is the best kettle corn I've ever had, and that is including the renaissance fairs' fresh kettle corn. 

Another plus: they use Apple products!
