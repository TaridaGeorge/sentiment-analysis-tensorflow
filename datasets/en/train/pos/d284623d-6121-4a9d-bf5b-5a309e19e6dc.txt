Fridays are our date night and I must say I was extremely happy with our choice of restaurant. Houston's at the Esplanade has been a favorite of ours for years, but last night confirmed our feelings once again. After being told that the wait would be 15 minutes, we decided to go out to the patio and order our drinks. Less than 5 minutes later we were seated at our table. Impressive already! Our appetizers were wonderful! I didn't like artichoke until last night! Total Yum! My husband had the usual, the Pork Ribs and loved them.  As for me, I had the Grilled Halibut and couldn't be happier! The freshness and quality of my dish was to die for! I love Houston's!
