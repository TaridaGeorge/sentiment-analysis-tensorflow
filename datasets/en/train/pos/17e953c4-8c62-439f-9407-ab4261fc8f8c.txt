I absolutely loved this little place! cozy, warm atmosphere, great drink specials.. loved the upstairs fireplace. Had my birthday here and everyone really enjoyed it, in fact, I believe were going back tonite! The live bands are awesome as well as the beautiful view outlooking civic center park. You can even bring your dog for a drink! Too cool..
