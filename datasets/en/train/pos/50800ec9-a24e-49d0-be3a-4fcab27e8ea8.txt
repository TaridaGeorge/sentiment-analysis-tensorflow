My favorite sandwich place in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. The chicken walnut sandwich is great..huge portions. The salads are all great. They have good ice tea and the mini chocolate chip cookies that come with the meal are yummy! I love their cookies..the snickerdoodle, sugar, peanut butter, chocolate chip with nuts..they are all good. You better go early...this place is always packed around the lunch hour.
