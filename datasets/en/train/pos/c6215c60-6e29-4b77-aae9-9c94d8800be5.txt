I'm just going to start off by saying that I am not really a huge breakfast man, however, this place is awesome.  The service is great and always gets your food out extremely fast.  Even when it is really busy, you never wait for a table for more than 15 minutes.  My favorite dish is the taffy apple french toast, it is unbelievable and really filling. I have been here many times and tried about half the menu and have never been disappointed.
