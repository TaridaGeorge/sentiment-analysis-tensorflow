Last night was my 2nd visit to this place in 3 years which is far too long between visits.  I love love love this place.  The decor, service, and food are all top notch. Here is the rundown of our meal:

Roasted Brussels Sprouts = excellent
Caesar Salad = excellent
Mozzarella en Corrozza (Crispy House Made Mozzarella) Salad = excellent
Roasted Corn Pizza = excellent
Pesto Pizza = excellent
Funghi Pizza = excellent
Pepperoni Pizza = excellent

I literally cannot say enough good things about the food here.  I could write a page on each one of the pizzas, but then I would get hungry and carbs are my enemy.

The only thing that fell short was the Arancine (Crispy Saffron Risotto).  It was a fried ball of risotto with marinara sauce.  It was just ok to me.

Can't wait to return.
