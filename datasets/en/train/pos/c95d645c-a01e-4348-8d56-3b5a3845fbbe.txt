I have lived in the Phoenix Metro area now for 16 years, can't believe this was my first time at the Phoenix Art Museum.  I came because of Bank of America's Museums on Us program which got us in for free.  This place is pretty huge and extensive.  Currently they were having a display about the art of paper.  I thought this was pretty cool.  I had lots more fun here than I ever expected, and will definitely be back.  Living in the East Valley this was very convenient to get to being across from the Central & McDowell Metro stop.  I now know why AAA has given this museum a gem rating in their Arizona travel book.  Highly recommended. =)
