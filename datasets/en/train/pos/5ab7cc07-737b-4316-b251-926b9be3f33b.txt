Dr. Ganem is as good as they come. Very professional with excellent communication skills and a thorough knowledge of his discipline. He brings the complicated world of cardiology to your level. You will know exactly where you stand after each visit. His staff and office are a pleasure to work with. I fly here from Indiana just to see him.
