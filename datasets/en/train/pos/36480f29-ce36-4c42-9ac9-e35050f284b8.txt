I've been going to Pizzeria Bianco since 1995, when I first moved to Arizona and I can say without a doubt, this is the best damn pizza I have ever had. In fact, I'd go so far as to say Bianco is my favorite restaurant in all of Phoenix.

Chris uses only the best ingredients and he makes the pizza himself. He is unwilling to grow the business and add more people because he knows the food will suffer. He's made a choice to do things his way and I applaud him for it.

My favorite pizza is the Bianco Verde but I also love the Rosa and the Margarita. The antipasto is always amazing and the salads are perfection. I do miss the old days when I only had to wait 1.5 hours but I still say it's worth every minute.
