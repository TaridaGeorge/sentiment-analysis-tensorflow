Makers of Belgian chocolates and other sweets, located in Scottsdale for 25 years. 

Seven Sisters makes cadies in three flavors to choose from -- dark, milk, and white. The dark (my fave) has a deep flavor and wonderful richness, without being bitter.

The white chocolate, is light, and has a very smooth texture, but is too sweet for my tastes. 

Their milk chocolate is sweet and creamy, with a nice velvety texture. And it melts in your mouth the way good milk chocolate should.

They also create fun, fanciful items from chocolate, such as a cactus, cowboy hat, wedding cake, baby bottle, racecar, hearts, and roses. Great for gifts!
