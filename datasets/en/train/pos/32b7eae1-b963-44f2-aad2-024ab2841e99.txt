I have gone to this nail salon many times. It is very clean which is a number 1 priority. They use separate plastic shields in each foot bath as they did today. They have nice massage chairs and lots of magazines. Every thing is clean that they use on you and the place it self is clean and pleasant.  They take walk ins and also do waxing. I did not get a wax today but ,have many times in the past. Always clean and no after problems.  They take cash and credit. Plus they follow direction well. Some salons do not! The prices are not bad,there are cheaper places but, they are not as clean. Lots of parking.
