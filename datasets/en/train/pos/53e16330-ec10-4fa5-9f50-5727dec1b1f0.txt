My husband and I found this Club about a year ago and have watched them grow into what they are today! And that is a wonderful, laid back, accepting atmosphere for everyone! After years of going to clubs and getting dirty looks or stares it is nice to have a place to go where everyone there is there for the same reason, to have a nice, drama-free, and fun night out with friends, a date, or even by yourself without feeling like you don't belong! If this might be what you are looking for, then DEFINITELY give it a try! You won't be disappointed.
