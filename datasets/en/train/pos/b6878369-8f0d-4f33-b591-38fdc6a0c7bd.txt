The food was great! My burger was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I had a side salad and the balsamic dressing was probably the best I've ever tasted. The wings were great. Moist, crunchy, and the sauce had a nice little kick to it. Our waitress was great. She was very friendly, made great recommendations and most importantly, kept our drinks filled!
My only complaint was the decor.  As the name implies, everything was blue. The walls were all blue, every other window was tinted blue, so your food appeared to have a blue tint to it. It was a little off-putting.  They should rethink the blue and just have pops of blue with neutral walls and non-tinted windows. It would make the food more appealing to look at. I still give it 5 stars though!
