I only like to eat pizza two places on the valley and mamma mia is one of them.  But this place makes more then good pizza.  

The Penne Vodka is some of the best in town.    Eggplant Parm is also rocking!

It also make a great lunch or quick dinner how can you beat 2 slices and a drink for $3.50.

The Arcadia location is small and seating is limited.  About 6 seats inside and at most 12 outside.  Making takeout a better option.
