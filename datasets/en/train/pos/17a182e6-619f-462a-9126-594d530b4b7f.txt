I love eating at Cheba Hut, and the westside store delivers as well as the store on the east side of Phoenix.  THey have an awesome interior and very friendly staff.  My favorite sandiwich is the Chronic, if you havent checked this place out you should.  Go inside order your sandwich and chill at one of the coolest sandwich places in town.....
