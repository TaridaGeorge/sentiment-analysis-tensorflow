My husband and I stop in to Cibo for dinner every time we are in Phoenix. It is one of the best restaurants downtown, dishes incredible pizza, and has a great staff of servers. We have been stopping in for years and always try to have the server Kui. Always friendly and attentive, we never have to ask her for anything, she seems to be clairvoyant regarding our needs, and makes the best recommendations from the menu. She even lets us know what's going on around town since we live in LA, but frequent Phoenix often. Try the caprese salad, its to die for. Great wines too!
