I had never been to Humble Pie before, but had heard about it so I was lucky to have a chance to try it out with fellow elites last night. It's not a small place at all, but it's very intimate feeling which was nice. I was surprised at how much food they brought out and the quality. Highlights were: calamari with chili basil sauce, chopped salad, and the pizzas and wine. The staff was great and I dig that everything is made from scratch or purchased locally. It's a lot out of my way, but I hope to stop by another location and become a fan!
