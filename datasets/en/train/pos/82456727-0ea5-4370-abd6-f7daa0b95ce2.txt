Loved this store, had some nice clothes and designer wear.  Clothes were sized and separated by types.  They were running a sale buy $25 and get $5 off and green tix were 50% off.  The 50% off sale and buy $25, was hard pressed to keep finding more clothes because of the deals.  Clearance racks in the back of the store.  Clothes were clean and the staff friendly and welcoming.  Not much in housewares, mostly women's clothes.
