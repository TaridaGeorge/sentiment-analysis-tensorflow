This is one of the nicer, cleaner stadiums I have been to. You can tell that it is fairly new. I came out here when my Dolphins played the Cardinals in 08. I had a decent seat, but I can see the field really well. That had a live rock band playing before the game, that sounded pretty good. They kept that stadium really clean. The Arizona fans don't taunt or get on your nerve, either.  My Dolphins got blown out, but I had a good time. I was just impressed by just the sheer beauty of this place.
