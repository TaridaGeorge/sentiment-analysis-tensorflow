Scottsdale Pen is a fantastic store with a great selection. The owner, I can't remember his name, is extremely friendly and helpful. 

I feel very fortunate to have found Scottsdale Pen while in AZ on business. I am a fan of Lamy fountain pens and there are no Lamy dealers in Utah (where I live). While I was in the shop I purchased a new fountain pen, an ink well, adaptor and refills. The prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend this shop to anyone looking for a good, reliable fountain pen or any other kind of pen. The trip will be well worth your time.
