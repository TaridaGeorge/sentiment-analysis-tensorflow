I work near this shop and have seen the most beautifully groomed dogs leaving for months. Today, I  finally took my very dirty Bischon-Poodle mix over to Christopher and one of his groomers transformed her into...how can I describe it...she looks like a show dog now.  I have never seen her fur so silky...she looks like velvet.  She was very relaxed and seemed to get along very well with them, too. They are lovely and very personable. I highly recommend.
