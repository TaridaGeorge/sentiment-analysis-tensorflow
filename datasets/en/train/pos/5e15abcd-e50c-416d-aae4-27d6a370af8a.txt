My wife and I wanted to check this place out after reading some of the reviews on Yelp. First, because we're trying to watch what we eat these days, and also, to try something different.  We were not disappointed.  We aren't too familiar with Indian food, and other than the usual curries and lentils, we had no idea what most of the stuff was on the menu.  Rest assured, the food was fantastic, but perhaps a bit spicy for my wife since she is not accustomed to hot foods.  In any case, the food was filling, spicy, and tasty.  If you are looking for something different and something healthy and vegetarian, give this place a try!
