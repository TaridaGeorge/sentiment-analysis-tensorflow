It's nice to swing by grab a $2 beer and sit on the patio, and chat with friends while all the pretty Arcadian locals come in to grab their superior breads and cakes.  I would expect a beer at a place like this to cost $5.  Nope.  It is only $2, while my own pretty little wife with her affluent proclivities finds, thinks, postulates and debates which bread will best suit our upcoming party.  I can sit back and have a reasonable drink for only $2 at a truly pleasant setting.
