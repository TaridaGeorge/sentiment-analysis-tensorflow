The closest thing to Mama's home cooking and if you know how good my mama cooks... Well, the woman can cook! Their ceviche is big with fresh seafood. The lomo Saltado comes in a big plate and worth every bite. The only thing I'm not a fan of is that they do not serve Peruvian beer here. I crave a cold glass of cuzquena beer with this appetizing meal. All in all this place is a must try!
