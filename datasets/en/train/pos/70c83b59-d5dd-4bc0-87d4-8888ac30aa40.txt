Burritos are extremely good and the pastries are awsome.......especially with a cup of a hot beverage.  I especially like the flauta with cheese or flauta with cajeta.   Nothing like grabbing a green burrito, mexican pepsi, and then a flauta to for a business lunch.  I've taking a few of my collegues here and they have loved it as well.
