I give this place five stars because you have to be as unAmerican as they come not to love going to a baseball game. seriously, i don't follow sports, certainly not baseball, and my atttention span lasts about 8 seconds when it's on TV... but come one, a live game in the stadium with the 7th Inning Stretch and kids running in place as video hot dogs, that'sabout as fun as it gets.

Real grass, and a roof that detracts to let the sun shine in when the weather allows. If it's the dead of summer and you know the roof will be closed - bring a sweater becuase they keep this place FREEZING. You'l look like an idiot hiking from your car 10 blocks with a cardigan but i'll take that over three hours of goosebumps and teeth chattering.

 p.s. it will always be "BOB" to me, too.
