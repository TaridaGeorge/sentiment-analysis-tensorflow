I love thrift stores and this one has got to be my favorite!

For those of you who think Buffalo Exchange is a thrift store, this is NOT for you! The art thrifting is all about the 'find' going through random and sometimes horrendous items until you come across that one hidden treasure!

This is locally owned and the proceeds go to different charities. The last time I went they were playing a 98 degrees song in country form! lol......They have some great deals on furnature and lamps! I'm always checking out the jewlery case for some cool vintage designer peices.

Go on Saturday and Sunday for their 50% off! Don't forget to bring cash, or be prepared to use the ATM, this place doesn't accept cards!
