By far the BEST bagel place in the east valley!!! I am a Jersey girl and I have desperately missed having a good bagel! I am sooooo happy to have found this place! Bagels are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside-perfect! The owner is super friendly! No more bugging relatives and friends to bring east coast bagels when they visit :)
