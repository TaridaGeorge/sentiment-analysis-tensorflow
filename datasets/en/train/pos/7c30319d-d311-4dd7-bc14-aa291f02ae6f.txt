My kids love it! We love it! Its a WIN!

My kids love the food, the firehats and the cool digital coke machine. I LOVE the Engineer sub...which is easy to remember since my hubby's an Engineer at Intel!

I took my father here when he was visiting and he really liked the food too. This is saying something, because he is very picky about his food.
