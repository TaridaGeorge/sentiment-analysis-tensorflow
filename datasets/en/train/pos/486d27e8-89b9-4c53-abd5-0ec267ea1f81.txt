Natalie W is completely on the money, but not out of it. My Sister's Closet is a great place to obtain designer togs at an awesome price. I just purchased a Coach handbag (not a knockoff) in great condition for under $40. Other than eBay, I can't think of where else I could possibly do that. This store, in particular, is well-organized and more open than the other locations, making items easier to find.
