We decided to bypass all the other places in Old Town and parked ourselves at Drift for a loungey, yet fun and enjoyable night. The dark decor and spacious area allowed us to space everyone else out.  The bar was lively, but not too crowded, which eventually died out as the night went on.  A definite must- the big seashell drink ($29) to share....It was plenty for 3 people!
