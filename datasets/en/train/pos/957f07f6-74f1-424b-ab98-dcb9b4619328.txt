I had a very pleasant experience here today. 
I rented a car and declined insurance since I have insurance. The lady warned me that if there is a mishap and the car has to be taken to repair shop... I would be charged $500 a day. Even then I went ahead and declined insurance.

At friend's parking area I brushed the front bumper and it got scratched. I went to this place in order to get a quote since I did not want claim anything to my insurance company. I told the guy the situation. And he fixed it for free. There were miner scratches but still... I insisted on paying but he wouldnt take money.

I am from San Francisco, its hard to find people like these over there.
