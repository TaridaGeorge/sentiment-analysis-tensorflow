With Saturday upon us, and the rain, I hope it will not be too wet to enjoy the food at Vincent's Sat. Market. For those who have not heard, it is a great event. Our favorite is the roasted chicken served with homemade french fries and seasoned vegetables - for $10! It is enough food for two people. There are many choices -sure to please all!
