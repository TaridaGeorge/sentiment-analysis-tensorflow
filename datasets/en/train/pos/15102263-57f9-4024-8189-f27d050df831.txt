I'm not sure why some of the folks who wrote glowing reviews still only chose 4 stars? From my experience, this place should get 10! I could care less about the celebrity thing, but I can see why they flock here. 

We went for a wedding in the middle of July. It was amazing. Everything. I have not one complaint. Except that I may never get to go here again if I'm spending my own dime....
