I have a confession.  I had an affair at this hotel.  A CHOCOLATE AFFAIR!  This hotel offers a chocolate making class in their Champs Kitchen.  The very same kitchen that was designed for the pastry chefs to practice for competitions, who by the way are National and World Pastry Champions.  

The class was so much fun as well as informational.  Chef Greg and his assistant were fun, patient, helpful & full of information.  

Sign up for the class if you're staying at the hotel or live in Arizona.  

Highly Recommended.  Have fun!

By the way, everything that you make is yours to take.  You also receive a gift and breakfast was included for the same price.  Great Deal!
