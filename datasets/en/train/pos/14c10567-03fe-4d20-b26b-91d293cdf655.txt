Very happy with this place! This is the place to buy a bike. Don't go to the location at Rural and University, their service sucks to say the least. This location on Apache was not the case. The staff really listened to what I was wanting in a bike and didn't try to upsell me on anything I wasn't interested in. They were also very knowledgeable. I have to say I love my new bike they sold me so much that I ride it more than I thought I would. I take it everywhere. I also got a great price for it too. This is definitely the place to go to buy a bike or even get maintenance done.
