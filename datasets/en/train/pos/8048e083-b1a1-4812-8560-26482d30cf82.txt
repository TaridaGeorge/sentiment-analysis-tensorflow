Just wonderful!  I came here for a girl's lunch and we had a great time.

We ordered a bunch of different things, but the most exceptional was the classic curry.  Perfectly seasoned, not too hot but plenty flavorful.  Shrimp was good, hot pot was fun.  We ate everything!

If I'm looking for Thai, I'll be happy to return!
