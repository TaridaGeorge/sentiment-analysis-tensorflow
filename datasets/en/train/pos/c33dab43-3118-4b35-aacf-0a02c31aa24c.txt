Every time I come back home to Phoenix, I stop here at least once. I have to get my fill of empanadas (especially the pumpkin) and pan dulce. I buy fresh flour and corn tortillas to bring back to DC (usually a whole bag worth of about 20 lbs). I get an agua frescas to drink as I walk around and get groceries. 

"Pro's" Ranch Market is my most favorite grocery supermarket in the US!
