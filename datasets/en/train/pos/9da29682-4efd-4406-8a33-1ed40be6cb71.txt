This place is an unintentional riot for people watching.  

Having worked at two different stores here over two years, this is geat people watching.  1.  The people who can afford to shop there 2. The people who might be able to afford things on the third level. 3. The puppy mill protestors. 4. Overhearing conversaions as Starbucks.  The overall clulessness of drivers at Christmastime.  

Go browse (or buy), the selection of upper end stores is great.  Refuel at Paradise Bakery (stay away from Sabaro -- your stomach will thank me) and enjoy the free people watching.
