I was deeply sadden when the world lost one of the greatest dive bars with the closing of The Great Escape. BUT The Little Woody instantly shot into my top 3 favorite bars in the city. Tyler, the GM, has created an amazing "dive" bar with unique features that include an open beam ceiling, wood log walls, rustic wood tables, and and very homey lodge atmosphere. You would never notice LW's as you drive by, which makes it such a cool place, but if you do notice it, you should stop in and grab a drink. Tyler and Kristy made me feel so comfortable and were extremely friendly to me and my friend. I will def be returning with jumps of joy!
