I was so pleasantly surprised by this place.  I was worried it would have all the unearned pretentiousness of FEZ.  But the reverse is true.  The staff and patrons here are so friendly and attentive.  Every time I have gone, I have received exceptional service and great tasting food.  The atmosphere is great.  Although I still can't mentally get out of my head where the bagels used to be when it was Bruegger's.  But that's my issue and I wont hold it against them.
