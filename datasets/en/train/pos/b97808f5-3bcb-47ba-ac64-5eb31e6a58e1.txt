Being from SF, I have eaten at many Thai places & Dara Thai is at the top of my list! I have liked everything I've tried but my favorites are the Tom Ka Gai & Gaeng Kari. It's perfect every time & on top of the great food, the service is excellent. Peter, the chef always makes a point of coming out & saying hi to us & they always make us feel at home. 

This is worth the drive if you live in Phoenix & are looking around on yelp for a good Thai place. Check it out, you will not be disappointed!
