Upon walking into Citizen's PH, we were greeted warmly by the hostess. Once seated, we were promptly approached by our server, Gib, who was personable and helpful in his suggestions from the menu. After enjoying our mouth watering app of Pork Bell Pastrami, melt in your mouth Filet and the best damn Chopped Salad with Salomon I've ever had, Gib escorted us to the very hip and chill Mixology Lounge, upstairs.
I highly suggest enjoying 'dessert' AKA: cocktails, where an amazing Mixologist will perform his magic in whipping up a delectable spirit. 
We enjoyed sitting around the fireplace, enjoying our cocktails, and interacting with the Mixologist and his staff, who mingled with us.
A rare find in top notch service, food and ambiance.
