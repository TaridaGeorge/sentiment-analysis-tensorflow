Great old skool place. I've been coming here for breakfast off and on for 16 years. 
Warning: they don't got skillet specials, they don't got crepes. 
What they have is good old fashioned Bacon and eggs, biscuits and gravy and cinnamon rolls that barely fit in the to-go box. It all smacks of homemade goodness. The woman that served us has been the same person over the years, she is friendly and attentive so the coffee never grows cold. $20 for 2 orders of eggs/meat/potatoes/biscuits and gravy/cinnamon bun can't be beat.
Rolling through Cave Creek makes me a little sad these days, nothing but a tourist trap now, but the BMCS was here way back when there were nothing but cowboys around. 
The biscuits and gravy are awesome, get the cinnamon roll to go because It's FRIGGIN UGE! Nice ambiance and view as well. Don't pass it up.
