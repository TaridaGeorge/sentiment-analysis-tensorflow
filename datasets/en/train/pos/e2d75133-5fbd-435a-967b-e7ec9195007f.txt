I look forward to my visits to Scottsdale for work, especially since it means I can drink and eat at Kazimierz.  It is seriously my favorite wine bar in the US.  The place has a cavernous feel and fantastic music, not to mention top-notch wine list and delicious appetizers.  I sit up at the bar or on one of the comfy couches drinking my wine flight and nosh on pate and mini-gherkins.  Nummy!
