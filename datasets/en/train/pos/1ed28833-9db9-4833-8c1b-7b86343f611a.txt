Wonderful Absolutely Wonderful. I had the Pad Thai w Chicken and Spring Rolls. They bring you complimentary soup which is a lil spicy and good. One Drawback is they have canned soda that they bring you. It gets a little busy during Lunch but they are in Downtown Phoenix. Thats what you expect. Try the Mango Cheesecake. Nice Big Slice at a Decent Price. Will always come back here.
