Glad I stopped in today for lunch. Herb Box has been on my bucket list forever and I've read nothing but good things about the red velvet pancakes here. Wasn't going to stop in since it was lunch time but decided to see what else they have to offer. 

I sat at the bar and had very good, prompt service. I asked the bartender to order me his favorite lunch menu item so I got the brown sugar pulled pork ciabatta. Great choice! Very great presentation, big portion, and had a very unique blend of ingredients. I like a chef that can think outside the box and bring nontraditional items together in a subtle way. Sweet potato chips were some of the best chips I've had. Great bargain and value for $12....I will be definitely be back to experiment with the rest of their menu!
