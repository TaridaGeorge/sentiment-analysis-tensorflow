I'm from Denver and I am not loving it, maybe because it's a holiday and no one is here, but this place totally won me over. It's empty but everyone here is nice, and Linz is fantastic. I am a beer nerd and she hit it out out of the park on the first try. Incredible selection, fun people, and good music (sublime, incubus, and rockin the casbah in the first hour).
