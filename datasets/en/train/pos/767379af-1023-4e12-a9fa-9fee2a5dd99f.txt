Best kept secret on pet supplies in Phx.  Those hair combs that pull out your pet's extra fur...the furminator i think it's called...1/2 the price in here compared with the regular pet stores.  The staff is very helpful too if you're looking for a specific item!  They have a catalog you can look thru as well, which seemed to help me a lot as this place is a warehouse, not really a store!
