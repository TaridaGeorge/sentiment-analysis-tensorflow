I LOVE this place! If I could own a coffee shop it would be this one. Every time I go I wish I could buy the place! The food, drinks, bakery items, atmosphere- all just fabulous!!!
If you go for breakfast you HAVE to try the Papas burrito. It is just SO good! I also think their scones are the best around. They are never dry and slightly sweeter than most scones. 
I know they have had huge accolades for their cupcakes and while they are pretty and I think they are good I don't know that they are the best ever. I would pick a scone or the burrito any day over the cupcakes. 
The best thing is to get a seat outside when the weather is nice and just relax, watch the  birds and drink a coffee with breakfast!
