LOVE! LOVE! LOVE!  I had the Coconut Jamaican Rum ice cream.  It was delicious and I love the fact that they let you sample the flavors.  The service was fast and friendly and the place was clean.  We sat outside on a warm AZ evening and enjoyed our ice cream.  This is certainly one of my favorite indulges.
