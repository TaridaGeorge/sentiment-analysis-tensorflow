I've never written a review for any restaurant before but I HAD to take the time to write one for Los Faves. THIS.PLACE.IS.AWESOME! I started going here (almost daily) when I worked right next to the one in Tempe. The Carne Asada Burrito was recommended to me which was to die for with tons of asada meat and guacamole. The seasoning is great and the flavor is specatcular. I branched out to get the Carne Asada California burrito one day and that was the end of life as I know it. I have been ADDICTED ever since. I dream about those babies!  Must haves when coming to Los Faves are definitely the breakfast burritos (chorizo especially), the carne asada burritos (both reg and Cali), and the rolled tacos. Order any and all of those items and you'll leave impressed and satisfied.
