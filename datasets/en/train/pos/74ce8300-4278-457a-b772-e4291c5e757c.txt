This is my most favourite place for ramen. It's not like the kind that comes in plastic pakaging that could double as a door stop. The seasoning doesn't come in a high sodium content foil packet, no. This bowl of piping hot miso ramen is big enough for two and comes with a filet of salmon in it; bits of corn, scallions, and bean sprouts for a hearty bowl of YUM! I have had lots off the menu here as I really do love this place. The Miso Ramen is by far my favourite. My tiny always orders gyoza. The sashimi is fresh also! I have no complaints for this place. Ever.
