Art, Film, Beer, & Wine. 

This is a great place to catch up with old friends, or to bring a date. It's pretty casual, but has enough personality to hold its own. I like to order a beverage while I make my way around the venue to check out the art pieces. This place is even better if they have a DJ spinning that night. The music is just as diverse as the movies they show here. I saw a crazy weird vampire movie that I ended up walking out of, but it was a fun experience, nevertheless. The selection of beers and wines is also really great, and appropriately priced. 

I'd like to check out the comedy nights here, but I'm not sure if I'll get the opportunity any time soon. Maybe next time!
