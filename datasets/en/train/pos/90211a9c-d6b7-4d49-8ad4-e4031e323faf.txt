My hotel staff recommended this place, and I am glad they did!
The waiter (Ron) gave us time to settle in and relax before he took our order.  His recommendation on the NY strip steaks was right on.  My friend ordered the dinner special that included elk.
This place is how a restaurant should be, we weren't rushed after dinner and allowed to finish our cocktails while chatting.
Next time I am in Phoenix I will be stopping by again.
