This is the best vegan restaurant I've ever been to! Yummy soynami shakes, I always get the drunken mushroom and chicken bowl. I love the crispy mock chicken that seems to melt in your mouth! 

I also went here for the annual vegan thanksgiving lunch, which was certainly an experience worth having at least once!
