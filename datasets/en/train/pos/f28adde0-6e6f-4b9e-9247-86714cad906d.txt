I love this place!  If you want to go to breakfast... sit on a patio and enjoy the weather and the company you are with the Good Egg is the place for you.  Michael and I come here a lot; if there is  a wait list or not the seating is always prompt.  They have a large menu and I am never disappointed with my choices.  Although the menu is large they do not deviate from the regular breakfast fare much... If you are expecting something drastically different you might be disappointed.  I love sitting on the patio.. enjoying the weather, having a cup off coffee and fresh squeezed OJ and whatever breakfast entree I choose.   The prices are reasonable and the service is always good... what more can you ask for?
