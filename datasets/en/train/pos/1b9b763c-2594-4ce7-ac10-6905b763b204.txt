Great specials, they keep bringing out newer, healthier prepared food options.  Half price bread lasts about a week after I buy it.   The girl doing the sampling really wants people to try and like what they are sampling.  Very friendly staff.  There are items that TJs and Walmart don't have so I shop all 3 as needed but F and E is a twice a week place for me to go in quick, grab fresh salad food and fruit and get out.  I spend as much time driving around and parking at Walmart (101 and Raintree) as I do in F and E.
