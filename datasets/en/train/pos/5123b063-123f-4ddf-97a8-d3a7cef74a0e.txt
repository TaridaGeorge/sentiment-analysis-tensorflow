I feel like people don't give the Bungalow enough credit.  I totally love the atmosphere they have created.  Great patio and definitely conducive for lunch breaks!  

They have also hosted a Monday Night Football VIP party for Future For KIDS for the past few years-- and it is totally fun every time!  

Also, I personally think there is something on the menu to satisfy everyone's cravings!
