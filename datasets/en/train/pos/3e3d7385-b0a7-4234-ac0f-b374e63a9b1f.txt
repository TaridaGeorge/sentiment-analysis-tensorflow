This place is hidden in a strip mall (Scottsdale Promenade, near Nordstrom Rack) but is one of the best breakfast places around. I go there once or twice every week and everything I've ordered has been consistently good. My favorites are the Floridian French Toast (with toasted wheat germ and piled high with fresh strawberries, kiwis, and blueberries), the Trifecta (most delicious waffle I've ever had--my hubby likened it to funnel cakes), and the Chimichanga. For an extra ~$1.50 you can get real maple syrup with your order. Those of you that know what I'm talking about, you know that nothing compares to REAL maple syrup. Every time I go to this place I leave happy and satisfied. Try it, you won't be disappointed :)
