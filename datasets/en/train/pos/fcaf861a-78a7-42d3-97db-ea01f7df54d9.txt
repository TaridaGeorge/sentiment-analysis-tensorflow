The price was unbelievable, the portions are HUGE and the food was truly great. There's not much more to say than that. I don't give out 5 stars lightly and I was shocked to find food that good at this small, order at the counter, hole-in-the-wall.
Try the orange chicken, it's the best I've had at anywhere besides a couple of very upscale restaurants.
I will absolutely eat here again next time I'm on this side of town.
