So I have only had one facial, but let me tell you that first impressions mean everything. Very friendly, you can tell she really cares about her clients. Dosent trying to sell and sell, she just has a broad spectrum of knowlage and experience. She has veerrry fair pricing and I am looking forward to seeing her every other week untill I get my acne under control. But after one facial I can already tell I found my little peice of sanity! Thank you Vicky!!
