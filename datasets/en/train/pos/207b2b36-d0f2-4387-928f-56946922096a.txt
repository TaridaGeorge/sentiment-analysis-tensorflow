I've seen bad reviews on google and Im not sure why the others have had bad experiences with Adrenaline, but I've now taken my bike there twice and have had a great experience both times. Once they changed out my front tire on my 03 Yamaha. The second time was today where they did a full service and replaced my back tire. My bike is running like a champ! If they were really a bad place as the others make it sound, I don't understand why there would be over twenty bikes and atv's in back getting serviced??? Your opinion may vary with Adrenaline, but I and many others will be back as repeat customers.
