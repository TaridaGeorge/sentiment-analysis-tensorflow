Serrano's is my favorite Mexican restaurant when I want to go to one with table service and cloth napkins. My family has been going regularly (once every 1 to 2 months) since 1984, and it is where we take out-of-town guests for a nice Southwestern meal - especially if they've never had real, Sonoran Mexican food. It is also the first restaurant we go to after we've been out of town for more than a few days!
