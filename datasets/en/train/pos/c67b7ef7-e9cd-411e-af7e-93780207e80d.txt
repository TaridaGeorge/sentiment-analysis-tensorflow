Honey Whole Wheat, double toasted, with butter and peanut butter... 

Don't go "ewww that's gross!!"  try it. . it's delicious.

So that's my order every time I go to Einsteins and guess what? These guys are the one location that can make it just perfect.  I live right next to one and I had to ask them to triple toast it one time because their toaster was set to "warm blown air"  .. well not really, but it seemed like it.  Then the girl putting on the peanut butter, might as well have been using a tea spoon for the tiny amount she gave me.

So not to bash that location.. but yes, this place just rocked.  they are super fast and if you get there at the right time, there is no wait.
