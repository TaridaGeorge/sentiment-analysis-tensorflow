It does not get much better than this, fellas.

BS West is hands down the best gay bar in Phoenix.

Friendly bartenders, cheap drinks, good-looking crowd, great music..it's definitely got it all.

Best night to check out is the obvious 2-4-1 Wednesday. 

Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.

It definitely has a "Cheers" feeling to it... not pretentious whatsoever. Great patios too, especially the back one with the new video screen they installed.

Oh, and their Halloween bash is THE party to be at. 3,000 people attended in 2007.
