Yummy!

The vibe of this place is cool and modern.  There are two coolers of gelato, so a nice variety of flavors.  I got a small cup with one flavor (you may get two flavors in a small) and it was the perfect portion.  I wouldn't say it was as good as gelato in Italy, but I'm eager to go back to try more flavors.
