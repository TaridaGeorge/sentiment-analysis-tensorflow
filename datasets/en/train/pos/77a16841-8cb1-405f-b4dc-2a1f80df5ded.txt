This place was a fun and refreshing alternative to the conventional restaurant for date night. The menu offers creative combinations of toppings and then you pick the style of sausage you want and it's all served on warm naan. At first, I was given the wrong order, but the staff was friendly, quick to apologize and fixed their mistake. The food truck scene allows us to bring the dog and for $20, we had a delicious meal and a change of scenery. Awesome.
