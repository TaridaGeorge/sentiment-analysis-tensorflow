This restaurant is the most amazing place I have ever been! The Bartenders are extremely sexy (especially the boys), the service is great, everyone is friendly, and the food is awesome! I had a medium rare filet that melted in my mouth. They have 10 different side options from cottage cheese to baked potatoes. This is a must go, must see, must eat, drink, and dance place of the year!
