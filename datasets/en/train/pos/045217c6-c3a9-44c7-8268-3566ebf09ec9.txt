Great deals!  Being from Hawaii, and having to furnish a new house, it was nice to catch a break by finding a TV console table for about $250.  The bonus was that this table was about 6.5 feet long with a great dark brown stain on it.  Ryan and his crew even helped me stuff it into my SUV.  Everything here is affordable and quality and they will even custom build and stain pieces as well.  Like the other reviewer said, the quality here is worth coming out on a Saturday or Sunday to take a look!
