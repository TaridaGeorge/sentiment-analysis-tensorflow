Beware ... this is not a place your wife can just go into "for a minute" You are stuck for at least and hour (if you are lucky) Don't get me wrong its an amazing store (if you are a woman) but don't go there expecting to get out quickly (if you are a man) 

This place has any and every kind of decoration possible - prices are good.  I have been to similar stores (even reviewed similar stores) and these prices are a TON better compared.  

If you are needing to decorate your home - check it out.  And Yes, they have way much more than just rod and iron works stuff.  Awesome place.
