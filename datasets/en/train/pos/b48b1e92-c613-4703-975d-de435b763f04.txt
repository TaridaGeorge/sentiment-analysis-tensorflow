My husband and I have been going to Jensen Family Medicine for about a year now. We found them online after having enough of the less than spectacular care at our old general practioner.

We've seen both Dr. Jensen and his PA, Trevor. Both are excellent. They take the time to listen and ask questions. They fully discuss your treatment and your thoughts on it. They make sure you understand the treatment.

My favorite part? They send you home with a summary of your treatment and medications.

Other positives are that they usually can get you in the same day which is something our old practioner NEVER could do. They also don't leave you in the lobby or room forever waiting for the Doctor. I've never waited more than 10 minutes to be seen.

All round, we highly recommend Dr. Jensen and Trevor!
