Just came from this mom and pop restaurant. Unbelievable! We've tried several highly rated Mediterranean restaurants throughout the valley and this has surpassed them by far. The woman who owned it was so sweet, a Grecian grandma who cared about us. The gyro platter was sooooo addictive. The meat was juicy, tender, and seasoned perfectly and the tzasiki was amazing- complemented the meat beautifully. The pitas were warm and fresh- best I've had. The hummus was oh so garlicky. Smooth and perfectly made. Kids had some yummy hot dogs with fries made fresh. Go here- you will not regret it. We can't wait to try the rest of their extensive menu!
