Hal Bliss is an incredible attorney!  We would not say that about anyone unless it was 100% true!  Right now short sales are a huge part of the real estate market and they are extremely complex.  We have sought the assistance of Hal Bliss on a number of occasions and his advice has always been spot on for our clients.  He has been able to help many of them through what is one of the most challenging real estate transactions with ease and calm.  He just helped two of our mutual clients successfully through this maze.  They closed escrow yesterday! Thank you, Hal!
