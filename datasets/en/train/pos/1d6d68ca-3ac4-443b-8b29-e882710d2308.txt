I haven't had the opportunity to go to FilmBar for a couple of months.  I really wanted to see the film they're showing now about the end of the world.  I arrived 20 or so minutes before the show.  The staff recognized me and made me feel so welcome.  I had an excellent conversation with the proprietor.  The film was great, and I appreciated having the opportunity to discuss it with patrons after the showing.  Peach ale and delious popcorn added to my experience.  Great bike rake adds points in my universe.  Don't ever hate on FilmBar; talk to the owner if you have any concerns.  He's super-approachable and very cool.
