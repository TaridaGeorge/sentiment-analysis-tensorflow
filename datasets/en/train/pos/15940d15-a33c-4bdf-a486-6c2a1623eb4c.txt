I happened upon this store the day they opened a while back and thought it was great.  Then went in again a few days ago and it really is going to be a great store.  I purchased quite a bit.  They have very good used clothing from designer things down.  I think that the owner has a great eye for what she is accepting on consignment.  I did consign some things too.  It is right next to a department store outlet but I don't remember the name on Scottsdale rd and Frank Lloyd Wright.
