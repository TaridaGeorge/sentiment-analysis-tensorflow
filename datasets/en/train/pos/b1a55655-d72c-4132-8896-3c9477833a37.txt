Dr.Carr is amazing! He has been our vet for 8 years now.  The staff is great and the office is close to home and very clean.  There are several other vets in the area, but we only use Dr. Carr. Even if I lived in Tucson, I would come here. Actually, our friend lives on the Westside, and he only comes to Dr. Carr as well, on our recommendation.
He is very knowledgeable and will do EVERYTHING to help your animal. Trust me. Our American Bulldog had cancer and Dr. Carr was amazing with his care. and ultimately, our dogs passing.  Maxximus didn't respond well to chemo, so he had to leave us, but he was well taken care of while under Dr, Carr's supervision.
