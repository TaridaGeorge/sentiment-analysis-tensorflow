When my group sat down to eat (great location on Mill, BTW!), we elected to share a pizza and appetizers, but one of our friends was vegan.

They were able to cater to his needs easily. I don't normally eat vegan -- but the vegetable pizza and bruschetta were absolutely delicious!

The dough in the pizza is so incredible. It translates to all of their selections -- pretzels, et al.

Finally, the beer list is unending! They even have Papago BrewCo Orange Blossom, which you can combine with other brews!!
