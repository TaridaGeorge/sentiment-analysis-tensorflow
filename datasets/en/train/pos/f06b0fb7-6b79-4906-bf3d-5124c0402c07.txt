I've hiked Echo Canyon and the other path as well. I prefer Echo for its view and challenging climbs. It's intense enough to give you a great workout but easy enough to bring anybody with you who isn't some fitness freak. 

A couple of tips: 

#1 Go early to avoid the afternoon heat and to get parking
#2 Bring 1-2 liters of water
#3 If you go in the afternoon, make sure to give yourself time to make your way down before sundown or bring a flashlight. I made the mistake of getting stuck near the summit around 6 PM. The sun came down fast and it got pretty dark.
