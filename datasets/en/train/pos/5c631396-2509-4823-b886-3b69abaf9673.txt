You'll think you're in Silver Lake, not Phoenix.  Everything about it is cool - the DJ was so good I got his card - and the vibe was just perfect for a Sunday morning.  People chillin' here and there, keeping to themselves mostly, just the way it should be.  And I didn't even get to the food:  you must order the pancake thingy.  An A+ find.
