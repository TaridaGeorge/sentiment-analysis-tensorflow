- Can get busy w/wait times (but NYPD Pizza is right next door if you cant wait)
- Small place. They should buy the building next to it and expand, people cant seem to get enough of Oregano's but they are always a bit small inside. Even cramped. 
- Long cook times (upwards to 50 minutes) but the wait is worth it.
