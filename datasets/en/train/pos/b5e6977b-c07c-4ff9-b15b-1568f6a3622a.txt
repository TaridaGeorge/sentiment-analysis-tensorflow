The Royale is super duper, awesomely sweet, terrifically cool, fantastically awesome, and indeed, as good as it gets.

It just opened up about a month ago, and it looks awesome. The lobby is a comfortable little space to chill, with retro video games. The also have some great retro novelty soft drinks (like Faygo or Ramune) and snacks. They also sell some DVDs and CDs in the space. 

The theatre play some of the most awesome movies you'll find, and definitely won't see anywhere else in the valley. Tonight I saw Troll Hunter, but I can't wait to see The Room. The place was nice AC'd and the chairs were comfortable enough. Before the show even starts, they have awesome videos and clips to entertain you 

Definitely check out The Royale, and support indie, local businesses.
