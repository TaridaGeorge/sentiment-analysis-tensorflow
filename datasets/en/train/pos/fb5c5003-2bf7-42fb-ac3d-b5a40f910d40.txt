The best food served up by the BEST owner.  This place is family owned and run.  Half the fun is meeting Justina and enjoying her style and sense of humor.  Order ANYTHING and you will enjoy it.  If you love Pho, then this is the ONLY place in AZ where you can get a bowl that lives up to the name.  In a state that has very few truly GREAT food options, this is one of the FEW that is truly great.
