I love a good old DQ cone every once in a while. Sure they cost more than Mickey D's cones but no where as good. I went to this place couple days ago and the temp was 108F! When I saw the DQ down the hill I just had to stop and grab a dip cone. My daughter and I first had to make a potty break. The bathrooms were clean but just showed age of wearing. We went to the counter and ordered our cones. The cones were perfect! The manager misunderstood my daughter's order but without any issue quickly gave her a new cone. The manager was very friendly and nice. I am glad I stopped here because reminded me of playing baseball as a kid and went to DQ after the game.
