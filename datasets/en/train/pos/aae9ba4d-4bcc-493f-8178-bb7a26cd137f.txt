It's like most family fun places, but seems to have a lot more. It had miniature golf, batting cages, go karts, bumper boats, arcade games *and* sand/beach volleyball and a driving range. The best part? The automatic tees that come up with your ball and the fact the balls load themselves. No more carrying around a bucket for the truly lazy ;) Overall it seemed pretty clean as well.  I didn't eat there so I can't say much on the food.
