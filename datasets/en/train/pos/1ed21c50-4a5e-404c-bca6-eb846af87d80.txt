Ever since I left Los Angeles I've kept an eye out for a unique, (I hate to use the word) "alternative" store where I can drop a paycheck. I couldn't even find a place that I felt comfortable shopping in when I lived in San Diego. Didn't expect to stumble upon Fetish Falls in a place like Tempe, Arizona. More importantly, I didn't expect for the prices to be as low as they are! Lots of cute purses, good tights and skirts, punk pins and belts... they have a pretty good selection in their inventory and a pole dancing class next door. I'm sold!
