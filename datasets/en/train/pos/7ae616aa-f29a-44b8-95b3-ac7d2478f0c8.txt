I can't believe I'm the first to review my college stomping grounds and former place of college employment.
CCP, you hold a soft place in my heart. You gave me my professional start in my career in the arts, and you have North America's most kick @ss collection of photos. 
SERIOUSLY every one. If you go to U of A, you might think this is just a funky place for a class- but truly- there is something special here. Contemporary and Creative Photography would not exist with out help from this place. I try to visit whenever I'm in Tucson, but now they also have part of their collection at PAM ( Phoenix Art Museum) just a mile from where I work in Phoenix.
