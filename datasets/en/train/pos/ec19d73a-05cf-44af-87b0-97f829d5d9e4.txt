Tucked away in Desert Ridge, and near the kids play area, is CPK.  You know what you are getting with CPK, they are all the same! This location had friendly staff and was clean.  I loved my Sangria and carmelized peach salad.  My husband had the Moroccan salad and loved it.  My kids loved their pizzas and sundaes.  This isn't the fanciest restaurant in Scottsdale but it gets the job done for families who are hungry!
