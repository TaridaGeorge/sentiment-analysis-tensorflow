I loooove Kincaid's for lunch!!! They have the best bread to munch on while you wait for your food. I usually have the lunch special of Halibut with just cracked pepper and lemon. Wowomg sooo good. My mouth is watering right now. You can't leave this place without trying the Cremme brulee! It is the best I have ever had. Yummmmmmmmmm!
