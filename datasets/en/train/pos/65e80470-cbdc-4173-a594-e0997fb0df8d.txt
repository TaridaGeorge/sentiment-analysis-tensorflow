This place was unbelievable!  I ate lunch there today and the gluten free menu was awesome!  I had the lunch combo which included a slice of gluten free pizza, a salad (I chose the Asian salad) and my drink all for $9.  The gluten free pizza was to die for!  I have been to so many places where the GF pizza tastes like a sponge.  It almost tasted like their crust was made from a potato flour and was a little on the sweet side.  The portion of salad I received with my slice of pizza was rather generous.  It was definitely enough to fill me up for the price!  I highly plan on going back here and trying their gluten free pastas!
