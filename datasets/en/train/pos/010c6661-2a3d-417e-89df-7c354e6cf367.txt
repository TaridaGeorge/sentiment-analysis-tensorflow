While staying at the Legacy golf resort we ordered take out, just some appetizers and a dessert. The crab cakes, quesadillas and chocolate cake were very good. The fried calamari were just OK. The staff was nice and the food was ready pretty quick, although the restaurant wasn't very busy when I went in.
