My new favorite Mexican joint in the Valley! I'm working my way down the menu, but at this point my favorite tacos are the cochinita pibil (so very, very flavorful), the Oaxacan black mole, and the gaucho (or whatever they call it --- it's the steak taco with the Argentine flavors). The salsa bar, with about 12 selections, is mind blowing. I especially love the pecan salsa --- never had it before coming here but now can't get enough of it.
