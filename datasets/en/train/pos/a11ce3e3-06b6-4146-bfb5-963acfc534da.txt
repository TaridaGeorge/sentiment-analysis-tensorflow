Living in the Midwest around the mid eighties in close proximity to Wisconsin, I was baptized in the creamy goodness that is Culver's custard. Low and behold they are now a mere 15 minute drive from la casa. My oh my, I am thrilled, my cardiologist not so much.

The butter burgers are decent, but what I really come here for is the custard. Rich, creamy texture made with the finest ingredients. You can even go to the website to spy flavors of the day, which amount to mix ins in their vanilla or chocolate custard. 

Now I do not eat it everyday, and to compensate add an extra treadmill session when I do imbibe. It is so worth it.
