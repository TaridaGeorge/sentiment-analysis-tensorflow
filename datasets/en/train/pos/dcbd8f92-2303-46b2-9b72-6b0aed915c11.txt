The cupcakes are out of this world! I picked some up in the evening for a birthday celebration and they even tasted amazing the next morning. Every flavor I tried rocked my world, but the vanilla, brown velvet, and carrot were the front runners. At half the price of sprinkles (and tastier) they are very reasonable.  Even my cupcake-hating husband fell in love with these little cupcakes.  This local business does it right by keeping it simple and high quality. Was told they are about to roll out a different seasonal flavor every week.
