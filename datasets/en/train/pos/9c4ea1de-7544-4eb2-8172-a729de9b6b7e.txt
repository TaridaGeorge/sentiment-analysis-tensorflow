Yeah ~ Spring Training!!  This is my favorite ballpark to watch the Spring Training games.  It is close to home, the parking area is great, and its really clean.  Plus, they have the best lawn seats of any of the stadiums I've been to, not too steep, so you don't feel like you're about to roll downhill.  Lawn seats are great for kids, you don't have to try to keep them in a seat.  Even when it gets crowded, it's laid out nicely so it doesn't seem too congested.  There are lots of concession stands and team shops too.
