Amano pizza bistro is warm and inviting with an excellent everchanging wine selection. Food is delicious with positive emphasis on the rajas, pizza, fish, salads, and deserts. This restaurant welcomes all with a smile and the people are genuine. I would recommend this spot for a first date or a family meal any night!
