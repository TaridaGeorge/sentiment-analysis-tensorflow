Love it and frequent this great neighborhood place.  Way better then the other location, unless you enjoy the rediculous Scottsdale / Arcadia crowd.  No hair plugs, Botox or fake rack needed to enjoy uptown.  Food is awesome, drinks are priced right and the service is always friendly and efficient!  Try the Vigan wrap.  Yummy.
