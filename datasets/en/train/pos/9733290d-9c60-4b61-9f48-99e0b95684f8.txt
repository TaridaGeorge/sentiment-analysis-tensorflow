Hands down the best sushi in the valley!  My husband and I eat here all the time and neither one of us have ever walked out disappointed.  The food is delicious!  I usually get sushi, but sometimes my husband will order something different and it's always top notch.  I've never had something that wasn't top quality.  Sadako cares about the food that she serves you and wants to make sure it's right.  

The staff is great.  We've been sitting at the sushi bar a lot lately and Moses will make you whatever you would like - even if it's specifically on their menu!  Give Sushi on Shea a try - much better than other places in the valley!
