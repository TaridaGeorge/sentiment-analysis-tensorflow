The fun shop of all fun shops.   I've known about this place for years, but it wasnt until about 10 years ago that I finally walked in.  What a great place.  If there's something you need for a party or my favorite, Halloween.. Easley's has you covered.  

This last year I turned my girlfriends little girls into zombies (per their request!) and I went to Easley's to ask for the Death Wheel make-up by Ben Nye.  Being a popular kit, I guess I expected them to not have it.  Not only DID they have it, but the girl actually gave me some tips on applying make up and some cool techniques.  

You can easily get lost in this place (in a good way!) and spend tons of dough..  I know I did.  

The place just rocks.
