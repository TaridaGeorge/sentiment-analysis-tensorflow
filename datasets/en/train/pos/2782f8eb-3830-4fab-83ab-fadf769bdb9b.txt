Their chicken pad thai ROCKS! Beware of the spice though. They scale it from 0-5 and we never go over 1. We are sissy white folks, but 3 will leave you remembering it for sometime- if you know what I mean. (not good.. lol)
The kiddies get the orange chicken and really like it. We do order it easy on the sauce because they do deliver some sauce with it!
If you have room I highly recommend the chocolate mouse cake. 
It is divine!
