I have stayed at the Hospitality Suites 3xs. And I will come back again, when I want to do an In-Town Get Away. Its nothing fancy by a long shot. But, what is misses in style, it makes up for in Quality! Starting w/the free Cook to order breakfast, the Free Daily Happy Hour. Pretty Good Free Drinks. The 1bdrm Suite, basically looks like a little fully loaded apartment. Stove, Fridge, Micro Wave. The bedroom is small but clean. Living Room has some vintage looking decor. But for the price $45-60 base on Holidays I guess. You cant beat this place! 202E to Scottsdale Blvd, Mk a Right. Go down 2miles on the Right. Don't let the outside fool you. Oh, I had a Bar B Que party there on the lawn too. They have grills and tables. Cool little Hidden Gem
