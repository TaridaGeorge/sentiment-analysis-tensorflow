Is Slices pizza something I would travel across the globe for? No. But I love their pepperoni and cheese, hot out of the oven and crisp on the bottom. Add some red chili flakes and parm? It's lovely.

And yes, I get a thrill out of holding the slice up and letting the grease drip onto the paper plate before taking that first bite. If you're going to be naughty and eat pizza, I say, do it right.
