This place was amazing!!!  Tons of stuff to look through!  I went in looking for pastry/decorating bags and found so much more!  They had an amazing array of cookie cutters!! They had dinosaurs, cowboy, states, mermaid cookie cutters and soooo much more!  They also had a great variety of decorating tips and large sizes too which I thought did not exist!  They also had wedding cake toppers that had gay and lesbian couples, which I thought was awesome since I was in AZ and was surprised to see this! They also had chocolate molds as well. You name it this place probably has it!!
