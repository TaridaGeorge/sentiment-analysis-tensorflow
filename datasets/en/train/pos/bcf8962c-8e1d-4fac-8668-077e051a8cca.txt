My go to place when I want something delicious and quick. I always get the pho which is just so damn good! Noodles are soft and the broth is da bomb. Perfect remedy for a cold, sore throat, or an empty stomach. The other reason why I love this soup is that it has no stinky pho smell that most pho soups have. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?!
Comes in a big bowl that can be shared or have it all to yourself! A little pricey but nothing to cry about. Mmmm...craving one now...I should go before they close in 30 minutes...
