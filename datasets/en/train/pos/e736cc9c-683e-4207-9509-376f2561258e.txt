This place rules.  I have eaten twice while visiting family in Snottsdale, and was blown away by the quality here.  I am surprised that I am the first reviewer.  Picture Original Pancake House (from whom many of the menu items ie Apple Pancake, German Pancake, etc were borrowed) but with higher quality ingredients, fresh squeezed juice, and killer coffee.  The kicker is they serve the coffee with heavy cream rather than half and half.  In the land of strip malls that is Scottsdale this place is a stand out.  Haven't tried the original outposts in Chicago's Western Suburbs but if I am ever forced to go back to Naperville I definitely will.
