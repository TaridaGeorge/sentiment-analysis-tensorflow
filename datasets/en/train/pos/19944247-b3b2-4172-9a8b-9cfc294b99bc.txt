First thing you should know about Old Dixie's: It is a food truck and thus you should visit their website to find where they actually will be located when you have a hankering for delicious food.

Second thing you should know about Old Dixie's: Jen, one of the co-owners, is amazing and will happily chat with you about the source of every ingredient featured on their menu, the methodology behind the various dishes, and anything else you desire. 

Third thing: The chicken, biscuit, and gravy sandwich is amazing. Everything is locally sourced as much as possible and cooked very well--the fried chicken was moist yet crispy, the biscuit flaky, and the country gravy was phenomenal. Can't wait to try the chorizo meatloaf and arugula sandwich next time!
