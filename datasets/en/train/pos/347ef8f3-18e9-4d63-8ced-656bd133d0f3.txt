This was my first Yelp review, and now after visiting Cibo at least a dozen, I had to write a quick update to mention two very important things I didn't mention in my first review: Crepes and Limoncello. 

Yep, the Nutella crepes are magnificent. A perfect way to end a meal.... well that is unless you end it with the most awesome drink in the world: Limoncello.  Homemade and worth every last drop. It's an experience I won't soon forget. 

Also, I must mention another awesome waiter. No, not the Diane Lane look alike, but a just as memorable dude with prophetic tats and a zen-like, jedi-master spirit. Not only do you get great food at Cibo, you also get uber-friendly service. Rock on, Cibo, I can't wait for a dozen more visits!
