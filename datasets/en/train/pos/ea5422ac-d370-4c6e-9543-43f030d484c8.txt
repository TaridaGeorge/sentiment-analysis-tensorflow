Rockwell Landscape Maintenance has been my "go to" service for many years.  Chance has handled rentals and primary residence for me and has always been dependable, professional, and easy to work with.  When he installs irrigation systems, they are the best!  Doesn't matter how large or small the job, it gets done with precision.
