I've been waiting for 21 Cakes to open and today was the day!
I got there a little late (1 p.m.) so there weren't too many cupcakes left (they were a huge success!)  but the bakers were busy in the kitchen baking more and frosting away!
The Bubble Gum Cupcake has white cake with confetti throughout, topped with a fabulous bubble gum buttercream frosting (in pink and green, my favorite colors, no less!
In addition, I bought the chocolate peanut butter which was (finally!) an absolutely delish chocolate/peanut butter cake topped with buttercream frosting. 
WONDERFUL doesn't begin to describe the flavors! 
These are not the huge variety of cupcake like Caketini, but normal-sized (good, I can eat more of them) and fresh beyond belief!
