Yay!!! I needed this in my life.5 stars for your simple existence!!! I've shopped maybe 4 times now in my 4 months here and I'm never disappointed with my finds, service, and the little money that I part with.

This market makes Phoenix so much more like home. Not that I'm Asian, but I've lived and traveled there and NYC was my home and Super L is the type of market that I'm accustomed to shopping in. In NYC these markets are the meeting places of the world, filled with Chinese, Koreans, Indians, Ghanaians, Jamaicans.... 

Ranch L is close to home too so yay again! I literally freak all out in the tea aisle (green tea junkie that I am) and in the produce section (longan, durian).
