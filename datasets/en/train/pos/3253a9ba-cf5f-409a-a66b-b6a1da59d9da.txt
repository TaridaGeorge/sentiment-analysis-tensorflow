Great addition to the neighborhood! Since I discovered this place, I have been at least 4 times. The space is very  big yet cozy. It has an area for whatever mood your in. There is the main dining area, the bar section, the front patio, and the super cool big back patio. The back patio is lots of fun, but only open during the weekend. You can even bring your dog. I have tried several food items and all were very tasty. Of course, there is the beer. Too many to comment on, but the staff is very knowledgeable about the beer, and are very patient with helping you choose something new. Keep this place alive and go as often as possible.
