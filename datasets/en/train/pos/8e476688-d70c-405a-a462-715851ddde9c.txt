We took friends from out of town to Switch tonight and had a large party. Not only were the staff friendly and eager to help, but they got us in and were able to seat us within a few minutes. That is incredible as they are always busy. Tonight the special was gnocchi and it was fantastic. The service was great and very attentive too. I also tried their very own Sangria and loved it. I will be back. Next time with more friends.
