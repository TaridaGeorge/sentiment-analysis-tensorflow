This is only about the pharmacy.  I'm sure most people are not too open about their medical issues or history with anyone.  We trust our doctors and should trust our pharmacists as well.  
I've gone to other pharmacies where the pharmacists and assistants have not been sensitive to the situation by speaking loudly, condescendingly, or short.  I don't know about you, but that sure doesn't make me feel better when I'm sick.
It's nice to have friendly, intelligent people in charge of my private information.  It's obvious they are well-educated, have helpful things to say, are well-versed, show concern and a true to desire to help.  
The pharmacists and assistants here are absolutely fantastic and will drive most distances to keep my prescriptions here.
