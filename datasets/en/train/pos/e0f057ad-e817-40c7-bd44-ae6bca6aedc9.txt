I have been to my fair share of dog parks in every part of the valley, and I have to say that this one tops them all. It has two active dog areas and one passive dog area. They have agility equipment for the dogs to work on as well as a sand pit to play in. It is very large with lots of benches to sit and water fountains to stay hydrated. The best part about this park is the shade! The have large mature trees that provide tons of shade to stay out of the Arizona sun. A+ from my and my two pups!
