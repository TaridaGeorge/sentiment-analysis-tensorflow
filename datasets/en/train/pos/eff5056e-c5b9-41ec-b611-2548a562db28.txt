this place is overly cute, with a modern yet retro soda shop feel. just had some pizza next door and this sweet treat hit the spot. too bad i'm so freaking lactose intolerant....after such a great dark, white, and milk chocolate mix, my belly was a mess. but it was worth it. just under 3 bucks for a small, but by no means was this small. 

great place, great service, great price.....
