Wonderful place!  Professional, good communication, fixed the problem right away and didn't charge me when I returned back months later for additional help.  I would not have known what this place was, as the sign isn't clear from the street.  I just walked in out one day and asked, "hey what do you guys do?" Days later, I took my laptop in for some simple uploads etc.  They were the first people who were able to do what needed to be done quickly and didn't charge me a lot of money. The location can't be beat!  I can get my laundry, tan and groceries all in the same place! It was also drama free unlike going to the dreaded Geek Squad!  Hope they stick around for a long, long time!  I would also sugest they branch out Los Angeles, CA would be a GREAT place for them!
