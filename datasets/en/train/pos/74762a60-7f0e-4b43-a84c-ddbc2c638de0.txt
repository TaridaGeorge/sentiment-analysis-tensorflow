hard to think the valley can support two japanese grocery stores, especially with this one being located in the part of town that probably has almost no japanese population.  

but this store is a real gem.  i hope they stay around for a long time.  very friendly people here.  i actually think this place is better-stocked than fuji mart.  prices on the whole may be a bit cheaper, too.  it has all the japanese essentials and a whole lot more.  some unexpected finds, including certain snacks and condiments i hadn't even seen in mitsuwa.  they rent japanese dvd's, as well.
