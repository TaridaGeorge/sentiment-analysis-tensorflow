Such an amazing gem. I can't believe I never tried this place before last night. My friend and I journeyed here for the Restaurant Week menu. So glad we did. We were taken care of by Rick, who was a super attentive waiter and also extremely knowledgeable about all the offerings at Petite Maison.

Started off the night with a lovely glass of champagne. Then had the opportunity to try the lobster ravioli and a wine paring that was to die for. Followed up by the fois gras, which was delicious. Then had the braised veal cheeks with blue cheese souffle, and finally the nutella brioche bread pudding - WOW. 

I'd come here again for sure and recommend that you try this traditional french restaurant out. Ask for Rick, he won't steer you wrong!
