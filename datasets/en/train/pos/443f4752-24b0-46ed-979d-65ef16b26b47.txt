Over the years, I've found great nail tech's and followed them around to several nail places around town - But I keep coming back to Elite Nails.  Why?  

1) Every tech does a great job.  
2) Consistent quality and service
3) They will always try to make my last minute "Can you do it now?" work (especially great with my hectic schedule).  

Of course they have all the basics too - massaging pedicure chairs, fun nail extras (rhinestones, gels, etc.)
