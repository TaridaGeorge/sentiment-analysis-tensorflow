This is my favorite place to eat in the Valley. Food is high quality, portions are huge, and the recipes are amazing. The beer is great and very reasonably priced for a micro-brew, especially at happy hour. The servers are awesome and the vibe at this place is great. Plenty of TV's and they've always got the right games on.
If you're a Packers fan stay away on Sundays. This place is a big Vikings bar.
