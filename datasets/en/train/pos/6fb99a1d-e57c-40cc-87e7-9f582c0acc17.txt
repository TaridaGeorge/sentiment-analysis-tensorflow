My fiance and I go there all the time. The food is delicious! We always order the Gobi Manchurian. We have tried plenty of other restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe area, but Udupi's is by far the best! I recommend this restaurant to all my family, friends, and co-workers. We have seen many changes recently. They are great changes! The new owners remodeled the restaurant and it looks amazing. Not too mention the staff is always so pleasant and friendly. We wouldn't know where to eat great Indian food if Udupi wasn't here!
