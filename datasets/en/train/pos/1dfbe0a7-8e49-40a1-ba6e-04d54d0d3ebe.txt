I will avoid going to a pet store now that I have found Gordon's.  I have been coming here for the past year and I have never had a bad experience.  I have a dog with a lot of allergies and they always help me out on medicine, creams, and food.  There isn't a place you can get this quality of information or service in town for you animals.  The prices are very reasonable.  It is a little bit of a drive for me but it is worth your while.
