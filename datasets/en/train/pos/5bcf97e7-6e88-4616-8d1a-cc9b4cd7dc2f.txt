Pizza?  Still just as great as I remember it.  Sausage and pepperoni.... mmmm.  

The staff is always friendly, even when I have my 2 little monsters with me.

This time, when I went in, it seemed they had a house full of parents with their kids in tow.  We all sat close to one another as well.

The service really shines here, the server acknowledged both of my kids, asking them directly what they wanted to drink.  My 4 year old pretended to read the menu, as did my little mimic 2 year old, and he confidently ordered Sprite, with a smile.

I love it when servers know how to treat children.  I will be going back for sure.
