Went here yesterday and they forgot my 99 cent chicken nugget. I called and the manager said sorry and then put me down for a free 12 piece chicken nugget and frosty. He made the whole trip 100% better for me. Also every time I drive thru they always get my special requests right. This is also the first time they have ever forgotten food. When I go thru they always pet my dog and are social. I enjoy coming here.
