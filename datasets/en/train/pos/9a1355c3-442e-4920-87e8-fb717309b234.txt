A million stars to Scratch! 

I would never have found this place if someone at Modified Arts hadn't told me how great it was. 
And holy freakin' cow this place rocks. 

Dinner there was probably one of the best meals I've had all year at any restaurant. 

I tried the lamb (because I always get chicken or steak) and it was mouthwatering, served over some potatoes with a little salad. They brought out some fresh baked bread as well which could have been a meal unto itself. 

Prices were not overly expensive, but the quality was out of this world. 
I tried a new dessert they were offering, it was like an apple pie (sort of) but better. 
It's located in a nondescript strip mall, but don't let that fool you. The food is incredible.
