I love this little farmers market!  They have fresh produce that are amazing!  They have the most delicious crepes!  I love their panini's and I cannot enough.  They have fun little items you can buy from local vendors.  They have fresh seafood sometimes...I got mussells once and they were the best I have ever had!  I even enjoyed a mimosa while looking around!  It is a little expensive, but so worth it!
