The first time I went to Royal was a couple of months ago.  It is a cute little coffee shop in the Biltmore, between Ralph Lauren and Capital Grill.  The decor is awesome and they have a couple of tables inside and outside.    

Funny thing is that my husband introduced me to Royal and he does not even drink coffee.  I'm glad he did, because the coffee here is awesome.  The cool thing is that they do not charge extra for soy milk.  Most of the other coffee shops in Phoenix do.  I always drink my coffee with soy in it.  :)

If you are in mid-town area, you should head over to Royal at the Biltmore.
