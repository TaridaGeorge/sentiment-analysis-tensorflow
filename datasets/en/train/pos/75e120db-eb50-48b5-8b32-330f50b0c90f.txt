Best coffee, pastries and sandwiches in Gilbert!  

Their coffee is consistently good, made by experienced people behind the counter. Every day they're baking up something different and yummy.  Some times it's worth the stop just to see what they've cooked up that day. For some coffee places it's too much to ask for great coffee AND great pastries, but this place offers both and more.  We've tried several of their sandwiches and each was perfect. They're great at everything they do. 

On top of all that their well-manicured garden patio is a lush oasis in the desert.
