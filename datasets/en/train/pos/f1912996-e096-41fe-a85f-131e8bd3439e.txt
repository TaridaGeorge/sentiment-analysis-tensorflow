These cupcakes really are the best desserts you can get without heading to a sit-down restaurant.  If this is your first time here, get the Red Velvet as it's the cupcake the store is famous for, and of the six flavors I've tried, it's my favorite.  Every one of my friends that I tell about this place gets hooked on them after their first visit.
