Best fast food burger. I love In n Out, and I think this one is better. The topping choices are unbeatable, the Little Burger is plenty for an adult, and tastes really good.  Fries are excellent, although I prefer In n Out's more. 

Coke machine is awesome. Coke Zero Cherry Vanilla is my personal favorite.

Improvements: more condiment choices at the counter. Only ketchup available at the counter seems skimpy. Maybe decreases the clutter but different types of mustards, relish, maybe peppers would be a nice addition. I understand you can order it but I would have preferred to put the sauces on myself.

Overall an super burger.
