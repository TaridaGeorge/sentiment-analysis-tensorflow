I love the apple store!  My iphone started acting badly.  I didn't know what it was...then it stopped working all together...so I went to the At and T store and they weren't helpful at all...tried to get me to sign another contract even though I had a warranty!  I apple store Geek recognized my phone was a "bad apple":) and gave me a new one!  In and out in 25 minutes!  Go Apple!
