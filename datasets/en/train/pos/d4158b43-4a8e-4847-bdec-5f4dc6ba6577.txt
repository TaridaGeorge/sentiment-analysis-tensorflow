Ken has done a variety of small repairs for me.  Mostly things that I couldnt do while I worked on an old car.  He never overcharged, sometimes did small stuff for free.  I recently brought my car in with some mystery symptoms and he tracked everything down and fixed it.  He checked with me for every step that would add to the bill and didn't do anything unnecessary.

All of my experiences here have been absolutely top notch.  Ken and his team have gone over and above every time and they are very reasonably priced.
