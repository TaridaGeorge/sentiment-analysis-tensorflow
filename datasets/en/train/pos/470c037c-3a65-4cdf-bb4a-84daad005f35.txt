We've eaten there twice and love it both times.  On a Sunday morning I had the eggs Benedict and it was the best I'd ever had.  I could not believe how good it was.  Then we had dinner there on a Friday and it was even better than breakfast.   I'm truly enjoying this oasis in the Chandler desert!  "Yummy!"
