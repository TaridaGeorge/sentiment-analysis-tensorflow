I love going here to drink wine - lots of options by the glass that are extremely well priced (many $5/glass options that are healthy pours) as well as cheap bottle prices (small markup over retail).

Definitely a great "chill" place to go with friends, sip on some wine, order some nibbles (lots of great cheese!) and shoot the shit for a few hours.

Also an amazing selection of wines - a great place to experiment and try new things. My suggestion is to belly up to the bar and get recommendations from the bartender on what to try - they'll ask you what you like and then give you something creative that will fit that general palette.

Big ups to Sportmans!
