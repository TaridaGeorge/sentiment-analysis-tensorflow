I am a bit of a Barro's freak, and it's tops on my list for diet cheats... I've been going to other locations for years, and realized this one is actually much closer to my house.. While the menu is the same as all others, my experience with take-out pizza and wings last Sunday was a few notches above the other locations.. simply put, the food was prepared much better than other locations I've been to... As a whole, Barro's has RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME Pizza and some of the best wings I've had outside of The Great Lakes region..
