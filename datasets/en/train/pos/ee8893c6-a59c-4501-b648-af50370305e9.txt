Addicting! Anytime I want a gyro I think of this place (so like once every couple of weeks lol). I love how fast the service is and the quality. They never disappoint! As a plus, their water cups are huge! That's nice when coming from the Tempe campus in the heat! The atmosphere is nice and casual. Hommos is great - order extra pita! Their pickles are good too!
