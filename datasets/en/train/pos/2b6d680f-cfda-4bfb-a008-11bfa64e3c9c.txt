Very satisfied with this safeway. Always very friendly, helpful staff and I can always find what I am looking for. They also have a gas station out front and since I shop at safeway quite a bit I end up saving 10 cents per gallon when I fill up using the safeway card. I recommend shopping at this one, it's also right by Pei Wei so I enjoy grabbing a chicken bowl during the same visit :)
