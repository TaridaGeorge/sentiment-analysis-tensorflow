If ya'll don't keep this place nice and busy and it shuts down, I'm going to go ballistic.  With service as sweet as can be and hefty portions of what I call "down home goodness" it doesn't get much better than this.  It's what you'd make at home but don't because it takes too long, because you're cooking for one, because it's almost cheaper to eat here - I can't say enough good things about it.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  If I lived closer I'd be in big trouble.
