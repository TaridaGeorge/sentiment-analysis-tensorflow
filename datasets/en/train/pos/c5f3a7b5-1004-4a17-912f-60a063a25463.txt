Great place... One of the top sushi places in Phoenix... the best part about Zen is the fact that they serve food every night until midnight... so if you work late during the week or you just want a late night dinner it is perfect.

They have some very unique rolls that have interesting flavors... I also recommend the yellowtail citrus appetizer... it is excellent... If you go there the head sushi chef is Harold and always has something special if you ask... Last time i had some super tuna spicy something that was out of this world.  ENJOY!!!
