85 reviews in three months...not surprised as this place is teh bomb.  

Only been once (so will need to update again when I try more of the food) but loved the BLT crab cake sandwich and side of mac and cheese.  I love crab cakes and mac & cheese and both were just the right balance.  Mac & Cheese was not greasy, not overly breaded, just the right blend of cheesy with the crispy toping.  Crab cake were cooked juuuuuust right, not too much breading, just the right ratio.  Both of these items are good when done well, and dissapointing when not.  Windsor did them perfectly

Everything on the menu sounded good.  The bartenders and hosts were super friendly/accomodating and not in an annoying way.
