I was staying nearby for a work conference, but didn't check out this restaurant until my last day - if I had, I would have been here everyday! The food was so flavourful and deeeelish!  I had the spaghetti squash dish, which prompted me to buy some spaghetti squash to recreate at home.  The beverages were also so much fun and so refreshing.  Super busy for a Friday at lunch, so plan in advance! We got a seat at the bar, so it worked out for my lunch date and I.
