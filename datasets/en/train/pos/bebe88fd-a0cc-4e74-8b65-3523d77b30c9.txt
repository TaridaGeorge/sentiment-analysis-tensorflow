So, I can't leave this store without spending at least $50. You cant beat the quality of the products they sell here. I've never been a soap snob until my wife bought me some Demon in the Dark. From there I started trying a few different products and I am sold. The employees are SUPER friendly and always willing to help and give suggestions. They will also give you samples if you want to try something first. The downside is it is a little expensive, the upside is you can read all the ingredients and the quality cannot be touched!
