I had never heard of White Lion Tea until I stayed at the Gaylord Hotel at the National Harbor.  Their Green Passion Tea was absolutely INCREDIBLE.  It was light and delicate, yet fruity and aromatic.  It was a little cup of heaven.  My co-workers and I were fighting over the different flavors and stuffing them in our work bags. (Don't tell the hotel!)  Their website is full of great flavors and beautiful packaging... makes a great gift!  And they always have a special up their sleeves.  

Support this fun company that is bringing great tea to the masses!  You won't regret it.
