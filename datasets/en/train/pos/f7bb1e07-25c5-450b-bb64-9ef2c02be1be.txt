Brandon and his helper were prompt, efficient, and got the job done in excellent time. He also gave me tips on what I should get before my move (rachet straps are really worthwhile). I had rented a smaller truck than what I really needed but they were able to work their magic and got everything in. Thanks, Smooth Moves!
