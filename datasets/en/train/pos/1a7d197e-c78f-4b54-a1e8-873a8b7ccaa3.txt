Ah, I love this place ^^ We used to come here all the time. You will find tons of mostly chinese food, but they do have a good amount of other asian foods. The duck is fantastic over here! And they also have a Chinese New Year little festival (it's cute). There are also good stores around 99 Ranch Market (I believe there was a stationary shop somewhere around the plaza). Great place to buy food!
