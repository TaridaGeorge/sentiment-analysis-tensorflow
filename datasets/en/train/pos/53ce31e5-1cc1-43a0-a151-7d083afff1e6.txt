So, I live near to the Gyro House. That being said, I love this place, the staff is friendly, everyone remembers the regulars, and it should get more exposure. The food is very good and really the owners add the little touch of care that I appreciate a lot. Every time I come I am stepping into a place where I am recognized and appreciated. It is a pleasant departure. It is small, the food is good, it is what you need.
