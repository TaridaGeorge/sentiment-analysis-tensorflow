I was driving around and BAM! hit a bump in the road and spilled some coffee on my shirt.  I stopped by this place and asked if they could clean the stain out really quick and the nice lady said she would try.  A few minutes later, she returned with my shirt, spotless and ready to go.  I asked how much I owed and she said not to worry about it!  Def. recommended.  (Their regular prices seemed pretty good anyways though)
