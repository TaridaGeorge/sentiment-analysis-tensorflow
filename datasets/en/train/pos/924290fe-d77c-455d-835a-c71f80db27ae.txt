I was Frost bitten when the first location opened in Tucson. Since 2008, I have tried numerous gelato places and none have come close to the creaminess, tastiness and overall authentic fare as Frost. Each dip of the spoon is reminiscent of my travels abroad in Italy with memories that bring a smile to my face and pleasure to my tongue. 

The San Tan village location is 25 minutes away but the drive is worthwhile. The staff is friendly, helpful and armed with spoons for you to sample any flavor you wish. I went with the dark chocolate and salted caramel. Truly delightful! Word on the street is there are 3 locations to pop up around the Phoenix area. I think Tempe would be a great choice! Hint hint....
