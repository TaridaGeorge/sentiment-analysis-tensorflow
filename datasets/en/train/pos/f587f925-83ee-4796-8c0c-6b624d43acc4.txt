SO GLAD I CAN GET PHO ON MY LUNCH NOW!!! YAY Rice Paper! They do get busy around lunch time but I have never had a problem with my pick-up orders not being ready when they said they would. I have had the Pho without meat though so I can't comment on that but the Pho in general is fantastic and they add in extra noodles and veggies if you skip the meat. your common pho prices that you see around this area so I can't really bitch about the price. Cute but small inside and yes like others have said.. parking sucks baallzzzzz.

Other than that definitely  a great place for to grab so Pho.
