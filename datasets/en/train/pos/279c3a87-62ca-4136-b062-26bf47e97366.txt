Defalco's has an excellent variety of sandwiches and salads all rolled up into a cozy little Italian grocery. While the shopping selection is nice (according to my wife) the food borders on fantastic! 

Seriously, even the greatest carnivores among us (like me) that normally scoff at a vegetarian entree will buckle for the the mighty Defalco's mozzarella, tomato, basil, olive oil and balsamic vinegar on sub roll. 

The service is friendly but the shop can get extremely crowded during peak feeding frenzies. Try to go early or slightly late if possible, you won't be disappointed.
