A coworker just brought these in today as a treat for the rest of us; I have never had these donuts before.  They are amazing!  I will definitely be driving out of my way to partake in the doughy deliciousness again.  I can't say anything about the physical restaurant or anything, because I wasn't there... but I can vouch for the product.  Absolutely delicious!
