this gym is old... yes i get it...  compared to the gyms in cali you get more for your money here... my membership in cail got me the hot buff guys whos stares everywhere but their workout. here there are many people of different age groups and body shapes. the classes here are really good.. when expressing concerns with an instructor they listen... ie body pump .... the staff in the mornings are always friendly (we r always out before 2pm.) sauna pool spa steam room are all fabulous! people here come to work out not gawk at others...
