Excellent breads and cookies.  Free samples tend to cause you to buy more than you planned.  The regular reason for the 20 mile trip back to this locations is the Fruit and Nut breads.  Raisin bread was the standard, but we picked up the fig bread for a change and it might become the new standard.  If you are a bread snob, then you will like Tammie Coe Bakery.  I am certain they have something which will please any palate.  Oh and BTW this place is expensive.....
