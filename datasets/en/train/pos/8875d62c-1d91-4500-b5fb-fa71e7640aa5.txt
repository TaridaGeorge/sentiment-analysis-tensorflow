Experienced Joe's Farm Grill after seeing the mention on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Glad I went and experienced what this establishment offers.  I had the ahi tuna sandwich and sweet potato fries!  Their breakfast is also amazing!  Diners can eat for free on their birthday, with proof of identity!  Indoors or out, its a great tresure tucked in a corner of Gilbert, where Agritopia is the word of the day, everyday!
