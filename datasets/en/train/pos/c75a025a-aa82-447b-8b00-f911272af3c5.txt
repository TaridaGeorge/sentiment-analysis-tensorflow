Loved this place!  I am a huge fan of the whole flip-the-house-and-turn-it-into-a-great-restaurant idea....Now I know this place has been around for a while, but this was my first time there and my wife and I were blown away.
Being half French, my taste buds were excited upon first glance of the menu...but then I noticed hints of Morocco and other countries littered throughout the menu.  
The brie brulee with caramelized apples was a true vision and the pate was wonderfully complimented by a tangy dijon mustard.  We opted for the lamb shank and pork tenderloin ( all farm animals baby! ) as our entrees.  These dishes blew us out of the water!  
You must go as soon as possible!
