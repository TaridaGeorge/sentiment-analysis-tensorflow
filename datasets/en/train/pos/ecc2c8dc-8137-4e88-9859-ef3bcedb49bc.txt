My hubby and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary by staying at the Royal Palms Resort. We journeyed windy walkways surrounded by manicured lawns, beautiful trees and blooming flowers. Our casita was lovely, private and had an incredible view of Camelback mountain. The staff surprised us by delivering a plate of yummy chocolates that said Happy Anniversary on it. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at romantic, Mediterranean T Cooks. We relaxed in the jacuzzi under the stars. The service at the hotel and the restaurant was impeccable-everyone was very friendly favorite person was James-the bellman-he has been there many years and really knew the history of the resort. We enjoyed the intimacy of this smaller resort-it was a memorable celebration, worth the investment and we plan to go back.
