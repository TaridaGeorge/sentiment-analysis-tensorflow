Great, Great, Great. Did I mention Great? What a cool spot, I'm sure to be a regular. It's located right across the street from Filmbar on 2nd st and Just South of Roosevelt. I LOVE the huge selection of beers. I did the sampler, which cost a measly $9 and allowed me to try 6 beers (around 4 oz each). 3 of the beers were great, 3 I hated, but that's the bonus in getting a flight! I also had a sausage sampler with housemade chorizo, some germain sausage and wild boar sausage. All of it was awesome. it was served with housemade ketchup, a fwe mustards, grilled onions and some potatoes. I can't wait to go back and get the same plate. Awesome ambiance, I was suprised how bright and airy the interior was.
