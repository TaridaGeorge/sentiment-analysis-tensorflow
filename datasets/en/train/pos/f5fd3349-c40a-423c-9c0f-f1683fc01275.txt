If I ever sing to you or about you, realize that you are loved. Now, this isn't your typical, halfhearted, fleeting type of love. No, no, this love...is nothing but the purest, most fulfilling love you well ever experience on this entire planet.

Modern Burger, I sang to your sliders. Juicy, melt in your mouth, mini beef patties, and the buns, oh baby those buns! I sang to the fries too, with their fresh and crispy deliciousness. With Kosher salt too?! There isn't a better salt to use if you ask me. 

Hey, I've got plenty of this awesome love to go around! ...and man oh man do these heaven for the palate sliders and fries deserve it!
