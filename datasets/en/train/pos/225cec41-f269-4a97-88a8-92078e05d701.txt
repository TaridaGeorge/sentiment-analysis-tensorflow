Another yelper mentioned their litmus test of basic coffee to see how good the joint is. My personal test is a white mocha/velvet/whateverplacescallmydecadentescapeinacupthatsbadformeandIdon'tcare. It is very easy to get a poorly poured, improperly mixed, poorly portioned white mocha, either bitter, too sweet, etc etc. Every time I came into Copper Star, it's perfect. If I am away from my house, this is where I go.
