We have been here several times for breakfast. If you love crèpes, croissants, and typical French hospitality (always unpredictable)  this is the place to go. As we expect with any real French restaurant, the service was very leisurely paced. Our early morning butter croissants were light, warm and crisp. The cheese crèpes well cooked and crisp too. Coffee was good and strong. One morning our server (the owner?) even played the piano for us!
