I have had coffee all over AZ (and other states) and this is my second favorite place in AZ.  As far as Phoenix goes this is #1!  I love their coffee and tea.  The cookies and other baked goods are also wonderful.  Plus the staff is great.  Hayes has done a wonderful job making this a cozy eco-friendly place.
