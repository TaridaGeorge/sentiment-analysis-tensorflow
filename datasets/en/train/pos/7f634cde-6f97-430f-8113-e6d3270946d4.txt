Oregano's is a great place, definitely my top choice for pizza! They have toppings and combinations you've never even thought of plus. I'm not a fan of their deep dish pizza but their thing crust is to die for! Everything else I've had their I have loved. Cool atmosphere and great service, but do prepare to wait!
