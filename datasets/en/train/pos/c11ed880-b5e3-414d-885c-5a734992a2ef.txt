After having a bad experience with another practice, I found Dr. Brodkin.  She is very professional, cared about me and made sure I had all my questions, concerns answered.  She is very caring and knowledgeable.  I feel I can talk to her about any medical concerns.  She treated me like a friend.  My birthing experience was awesome.  I feel very fortunate to have found her and have her as my OB/GYN.
