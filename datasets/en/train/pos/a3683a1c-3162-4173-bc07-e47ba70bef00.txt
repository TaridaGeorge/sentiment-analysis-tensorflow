This place invented the dutch baby...for that alone I am forever indebted.  Rules aside this place is amazing.  Never greasy, fluffy omelets, perfect eggs and killer pancakes served with a side of 90s Scottsdale pastel flare.  A couple of words of warning: 1) Come early...the 65+ crowd wakes up damn early.  2)  Bring cash...this place, like many other small businesses, doesn't like forking over 3% to out-of-state CC companies.  This is not a new concept...get over it.   3) If you think IHOP is better than this place, I'm sorry that you were born without taste buds.  Cheers to my Chi-town family for turning me on to this place!
