The best in town! Flo's is closer to home and is not bad BUT George and Son is way worth the extra drive. The food is the most important thing in a restaurant to me and George and Son has simply the best Chinese food I have ever had. The bonus is the service. Always friendly and fast. George himself is usually there and he has a way of making everyone feel special like a VIP. Now they also have entertainment on Fridays and Saturdays its a blast
