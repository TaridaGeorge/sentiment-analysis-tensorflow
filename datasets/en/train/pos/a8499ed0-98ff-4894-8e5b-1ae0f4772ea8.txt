I have been taking vehicles to this place for 15+ years, mostly for routine maintenance, but occasionally for the other annoying things your car does to you. We have never had any problems with their service or repairs, and they have always been reasonably priced, fair and honest with us.

They also refill propane tanks.

Note -- this business has outlasted at least two gas suppliers. Previous names include McClintock Unocal and McClintock 76 :-)
