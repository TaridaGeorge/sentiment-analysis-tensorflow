Searching for a place to eat tonight and we came across Firehouse on Yelp and figured we give it a try.  AWSOME place, food was fantastic, friendly people, only negative was I ordered a large sandwich because I was starving, that was a huge meal.  They put a generous portion of meat on each sandwich, unlike the Subways and Quizno's of the world.
