I've been to this particular Outback twice in the past week due to Scottish family in town who are OBSESSED with this place

They're Scottish, who knows....

Well, at first I was skeptical.  But I thought the food was suprisingly tasty!

The second time, I'M IN LOVE!

I LOVE OUTBACK

Sweet chain steakhouse, how I love thee.

I swear their stupid horseradish crusted filet was just as good as the damned Flemings/RuthsChris/Mortons filets.  I was impressed.

Damn good green beans too.

I love.
