I was surprised by how delicious and authentic this restaurant is. (Though I did not partake, you'll be happy to know that "cubes of congealed pork blood are available".) They have done a wonderful job decorating the space, so you don't even know you're in a strip mall. They were very accommodating when we requested to have certain dishes made vegetarian, and the service was prompt and helpful. Just beware, the portions are huge!
