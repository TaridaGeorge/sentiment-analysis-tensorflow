I don't know what it is, but I just love this place. Service is awesome. Wine selection is good, although I always order the same one. Food is great, and no body beats their bruschetta. I love sitting inside and out, and it's always an interesting crowd. $5 glasses and pitchers is just the icing on the cake.
