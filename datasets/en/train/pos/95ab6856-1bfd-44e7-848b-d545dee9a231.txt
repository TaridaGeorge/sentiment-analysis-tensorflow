Unique atmosphere in the city of Glibert with AMAZING food....  

Beware some weekends the line is super long but its worth the wait... be prepared to eat outside in a nice shady area enjoying a farm like atmosphere...

Good seafood is hard to find in Az & Farm grill does a great job.... also great burgers!  

If you don't mind driving out to Gilbert its 1 of the best places to eat in the Phx area..
