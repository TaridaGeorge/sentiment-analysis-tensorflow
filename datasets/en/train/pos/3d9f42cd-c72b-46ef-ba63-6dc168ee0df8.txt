Karen did a wonderful job pet sitting our two dogs and cat. She is very intuitive with animals and our shy dog quickly felt comfortable with her. She's insured, bonded, and certified, so you can trust her in your home. We highly recommend her as a pet sitter and will definitely call her in the future.
