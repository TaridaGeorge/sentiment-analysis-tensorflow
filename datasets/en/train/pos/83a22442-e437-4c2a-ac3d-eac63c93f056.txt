Yasu has quickly become my favorite place in town. The food is 100% legit! The regular menu is really fun, but the menu of chef's features is the way to go. I cannot over emphasize the importance of eating here at least once. Get sushi or the tapa style dishes and you'll be hooked.

Yasu came to our table and spoke with us for several minutes and even sent out a free dessert. Awesome awesome awesome!!! Exactly what a restaurant of any type should be....fun, delicious and memorable.
