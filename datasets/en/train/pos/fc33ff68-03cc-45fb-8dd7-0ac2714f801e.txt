Never once have I ever been disappointed. I'm going to have to say this place is 1st ranked for me when it comes to authentic Hawaiian food in AZ. Their mac is delicious, the meat is never dry and always full of flavor. 

My two personal favorites are the teriyaki chicken or beef and the bulkogi! Bulkogi means "fire meat" in Korean. It's grilled and marinated is yummy sauces. Definitely give it a try if you're in the Mesa area- you will not be disappointed!
