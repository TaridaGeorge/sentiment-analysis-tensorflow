Oh Casey's. 

Every time I go here I remember that I should really start drinking more often. Sure, it's primarily a college crowd, and I am a few years out, but, hey, nothing wrong with sluggin' back some brewskies with the kiddies, right?

Well, maybe, but in this case, no. Most Tempe/Scottsdale bars tend to be meat markets of steroid users and plastic surgery victims, but not Casey's. It promotes a very chill vibe and a laid back atmosphere, which is what I, for one, look for when I'm having some drinks. Chances are, if I'm out, I had a long day or week and I want to unwind a bit. 

There is no better place around to do that than Casey's.
