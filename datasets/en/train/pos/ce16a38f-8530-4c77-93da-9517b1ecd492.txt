After 4+ bids for an AC Unit, I went with AccuTemp.  Matt was helpful and honest.  He gave us time to do our research and answered all our questions.  The installers were professional and although a mistake was made, they came out quickly upon realizing there was a problem and corrected their mistake.  Mike was on top of it and wanted us to know that they stood behind their work.  Hopefully there will be no more problems in the future but should there be, I am sure they will be there to help and fix them.
