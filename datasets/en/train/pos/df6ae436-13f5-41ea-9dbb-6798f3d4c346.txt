I think I am a fan to the point of ridiculous. Also, Kevin H and I seem to be in a race to empty out this place of all its goods, but at least he has someone to share his mondo stash with.

Me? 4 pints in my freezer this weekend: peaches & cream, sweet corn (that's right, sweet corn), basil lime sorbet, and mocha sorbet. 

All for me.

And I was supposed to fit into all my old work slacks by my birthday next month.

HA HA HA HA HA HA. 

Ok, but seriously. Regardless of my gut, this dessert does not make me angry.

5 stars.
