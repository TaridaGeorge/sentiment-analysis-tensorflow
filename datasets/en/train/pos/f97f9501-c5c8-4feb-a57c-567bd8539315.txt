Mother, may I? This place is delicious!

We started with the warm brie & caramelized apples.... so good. My hubs is a cheese connoisseur (that or he just eats A LOT of cheese) and he even raved about how good the brie was.

I then had the warm chopped veggie salad --- mouth watering and flavorful! The hubs had the crab cakes - of which I snagged more than one forkful. Those too were delicious.

The atmosphere is adorable - cozy, like a friend's home. The service was great as well - if you are looking to grab a bite for lunch in Old Town, you gotta stop here.
