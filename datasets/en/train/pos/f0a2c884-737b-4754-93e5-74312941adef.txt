Best place in the food court, hands down.

Great service, superior food and AM-A-ZING cookies!  (It's true..they really are.)

Being that I work in the mall, it's my go-to spot for a Diet Coke or a little 3pm pick-me-up. Free refills too, which is a nice little perk. 

They've always got a line (especially Fri-Sun), so make sure you know what to order by the time you get to the register. 

I highly recommend the Tomato Basil pasta salad, the black & white Chippers, the Chicken Walnut salad and the peach decaf iced tea!

The manager, Jessie, is also a doll. Very nice.
