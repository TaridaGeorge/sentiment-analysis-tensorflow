Every time I visit the Scottsdale area, I always make sure to hit up Don & Charlie's. While the menu is simple, what it does offer is truly first-rate. The steaks and ribs are grilled to perfection. The variety of side dishes and potato offerings is a perfect complement. The restaurant is also decorated with memorabilia from spring training of years past and makes this restaurant a unique venue in the Valley.
