This was a very challenging class.....I loved everything about the studio, but my fav part was how every instructore did it a little differently, which was good, one thing I kind of missed in traditional bikram. I also enjoyed the fact they placed top 40 and other stuff. Liked the fact they mixed it up. My fav was the 5:30 am classes, hard to get up that early but man were they worth it.

Highly Recommend
