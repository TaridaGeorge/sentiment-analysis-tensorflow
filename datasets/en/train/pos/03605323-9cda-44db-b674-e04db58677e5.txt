We really couldn't  have asked for better service, sangria or food. 

After shopping for a few hours Sunny and I needed a recess. We were thinking of going to Abuelo's at the Chandler Mall when I remembered that my fiance and I had visited Nouveau Bistro (which was previously a Pasta Pomodoro) for drinks a few weeks ago and I really wanted to go back to try their food. 

We were warmly welcomed and they had delicious sangria waiting for us. We tried a couple appetizers, the goat cheese with shrimp and the asparagus, both were mouth watering. The decor is modern and nice, they have a pretty cool patio, which I can't wait to sit and sip on some happy hour cocktails this spring.

Nouveau Bistro is gem in the mass of corporate restaurants of the Chandler Mall area, support our local restaurants!
