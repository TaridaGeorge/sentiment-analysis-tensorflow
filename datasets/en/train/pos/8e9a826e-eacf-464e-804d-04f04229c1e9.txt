I ran into this place by chance.  One of those "how about we stop.. uh.. how about there" type things.

What a surprise.

This place has a classic and high class huge wood bar.  They have huge assortment of rums and other tasteful booze to choose from.  When you order a mojito, and you really should, they'll ask you what kind of rum you would like in it.  This is a worthwhile and meaningful question.  Most of the places I've been to since just use whatever cheap crap is around, and believe you me, you can taste the difference.

The Cuban food here is exquisite.  I thought that Cuban food was mostly just like all the other Mexican trash served in Phoenix.  I was completely wrong.  You should come and see for yourself.

There is also live music here in the evenings and may be dancing on weekends.
