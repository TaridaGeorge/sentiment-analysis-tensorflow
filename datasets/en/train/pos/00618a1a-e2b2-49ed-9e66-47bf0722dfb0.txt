AMAZING!!!  We've only been here twice and both times were amazing.  I love the fact that they use high quality ingredients.  The first time we went, my hubby tried the forbidden rice ice cream and has been craving it since...unfortunately, it is not on the regular rotation.  The coconut and salted carmel is amazing.  Actually, everything is amazing.
