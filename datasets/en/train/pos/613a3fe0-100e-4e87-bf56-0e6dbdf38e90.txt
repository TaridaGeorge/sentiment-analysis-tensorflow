I am a huge fan of Saigon Nites. A friend and I regularly eat here (once weekly) and we have NEVER had a bad experience. The Steak Pho is amazing. Typically when I Have Pho I load it up with hot sauces, chili oil, etc...not at Saigon! Their Pho is ready to rock and roll the second it leaves the kitchen. Two thumbs way up!
