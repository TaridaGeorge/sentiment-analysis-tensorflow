I like target, they have good dog toys and no one bothers me so I can mill around and get stuff in the home section and where ever. They have some funny tshirts for St Pat's day and some cool costume jewelry. I had some brand new pants, Merona brand and she wouldnt give me any store credit because "they were more than 90 days old and were no longer in the system" holy cow, i was so bummed out.
