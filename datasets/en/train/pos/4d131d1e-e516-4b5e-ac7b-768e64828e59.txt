I have been having back pain and didn't know what else to do, so decided to try massage therapy. I would say the experience I had at this location was so good, that I decided to become a member. First, they were right on time so no waiting around. Second, they take you back to a very comforting room and ask you if you want the music turned down, the table heated, and if the head rest is comfortable for you. The massage itself was like paradise. I asked my therapist what type of massage she does and in her comforting voice she told me she uses a combination of types, trigger pressure and Swedish. This experience is worth any amount of money if it makes you feel better, and I felt so much better after my visit.
