A friend and I just ate here last night.  It's been awhile and I was reading reviews for Phoenix Restaurants when I got to CJ's so it made me think about going again.
I love this place.  Not fancy or trying to be something it isn't.  Just great food plain and simple.
The Crazy's are my favorites and whiile I get into a rut with ordering the same thing over and over again - I broke out of my usual "Crazy Calamari" or "Crazy Gyro" habit (two favorites of mine for years) and ordered the "Crazy Halibut"... GEEZ... YUM!
All of the Crazy's come on a big plate with cucumbers, onions, Feta and Pepperocinis and everything is dressed in their salad dressing (which is simple and fresh).  
Did I even mention the Pita?  I can't.. it'll make me wanna go for lunch.  Just try it!
