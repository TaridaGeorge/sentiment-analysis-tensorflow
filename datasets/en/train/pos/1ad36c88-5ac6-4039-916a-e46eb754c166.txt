I am visiting the Scottsdale area on vacation.  I drove by this restaurant while on the way to another restaurant.  I looked it up on my iPhone Yelp application and decided to stop in.

We ordered four different main dishes, and soup, and appetizers.  They were all great.

It is really great, food, atmosphere, and service.  The restaurant was also exceptionally clean.  I am going to do a return visit with the family tonight.

I highly recommend this restaurant.
