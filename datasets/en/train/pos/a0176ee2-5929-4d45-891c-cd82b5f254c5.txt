I've been going to this restaurant at least once a month for the past 6 years. The fish, steak and prime rib dinners at Feeney's are excellent  and include one of the best salad bars I've seen anywhere. A basket of fresh rye and pumpernickle bread and butter is included as well.  The prices are very reasonable and the service is above excellent.. They really want to make sure you're enjoying your meal and have everything you want. The Mudd Pie is incredible and gets 5 starts all by itself.
