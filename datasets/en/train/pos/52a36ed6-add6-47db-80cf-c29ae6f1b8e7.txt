I fully agree with Bil Z. --- the food is a little overpriced and not worthy of 5 stars, but the concept of this restaurant / movie theater makes up for it many times over.  It's surprising there aren't more of these places around.  The food is on par with typical 4 star hotel (Hilton, Hyatt, etc.) restaurants both in terms of quality and price.  The decor is reminiscent of art deco style theaters.  Sound and projection quality doesn't compare to a large chain, but the intimate atmosphere makes up for it.  Here's a tip -- go to restaurant.com and you can usually find coupons for $25 off which can be purchased for $5-$10.  Enjoy!
