I recently used Belly Rubz for grooming services for our dogs.  I have to say I was totally impressed.  First off, I love they let the dogs play with the other dogs as part of the experience and the cage-free/open environment.  My dogs not only came home looking fantastic (the groomers did an outstanding job) but also happy and tired (in a good way).  It's obvious the owners and people who work there are animal people and really take the extra effort to ensure your pet will have a good experience there.  I will definitely be back!
