We love this pediatricians office.  They have taken care of my 3 year old since he was born and I now have a 11 month old.  Dr. Kanagal is our primary pediatrician but we have seen a number of the doctors and they are all wonderful.  We have no problems getting last minute, sick child appointments when needed...in fact, they have Saturday hours specifically for sick kids.  The Shea location has separate entrances and waiting rooms for sick and well children.  You can't go wrong with this practice.
