WOW what an amazing property it has it all, multiple pools, water slide, wading pool for young children, multiple restaurants, EXCELLENT staff at your beck and call. The rooms are a great size and the closet is the biggest I have ever seen. They also have a private Western style sound stage with props perfect for a family Reunion or Company Event. I can not wait to bring my family next Summer. One of the BEST Hotels we have ever stayed at.
