I had a fantastic time here on Saturday. There was a great variety of produce, fresh bread, interesting (truly!) arts and crafts, and people watching. My mom splurged and bought me the most adorable handmade apron, and I bought some handmade soap. Really, I wanted to buy something from nearly every vendor there. It was much larger and more well organized than I had anticipated. Although you can use a credit card, cash exchanges are preferable. If you use a credit card, you cannot complete your transaction with the individual vendor. Rather, you have to go to a different line where all of the credit card transactions take place.
