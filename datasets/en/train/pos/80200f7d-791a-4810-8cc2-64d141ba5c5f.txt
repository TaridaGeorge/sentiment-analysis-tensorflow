Absolutely amazing!!!  I'm so excited that we have a place like this in the valley.  Simply the best freshly handmade NOODLES!  Soft, chewy, and delicious.  I've been here 4 times already despite living 40 minutes away.  My fav is 'Beef with Soup Noodles'.  You will not be disappointed.  I've traveled to Vancouver, Toronto, Shanghai, Xian, and Beijing.  This is as authentic as Chinese noodles get.  If you don't like this place, you're just not a fan of homemade noodles.
