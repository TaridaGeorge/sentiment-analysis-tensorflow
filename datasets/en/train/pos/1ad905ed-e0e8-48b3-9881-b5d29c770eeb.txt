I LOVE The Roosevelt! If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be here all the time. 

It's actually an old house that's been converted into a bar/restaurant. It's quite inconspicuous so you have to know it's there otherwise you'll drive right by. The decor is very simple, minimal and the lighting is dim, giving this place a casual yet classy vibe. It's perfect if you don't like dive bars, but don't want to go someplace snooty either.

I ordered a glass of wine and my friend and I shared the pretzel and the grilled cheese and tomato soup - both outstanding! They have a lot of other small plates perfect for happy hour and sharing as well. The waitress was very knowledgable about their wine selection, so don't hesitate to ask.  

Awesome find!
