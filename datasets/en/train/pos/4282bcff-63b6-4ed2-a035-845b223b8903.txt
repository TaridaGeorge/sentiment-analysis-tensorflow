I was wary of trusting Yelp after the debacle of culinary excrement served to me at Wineburger, but Rocket Burger delivered the beefy goods. Great soda selection, friendly service, and the BURGER. Wow. I had the Baja Burger, and it packed an explosion of flavor. I made the mistake of getting a "Rocket" burger, which was too large for even me. After a while, I ditched the bun and went to town on the meaty goods. This is a place that knows how to season meat.

Rocket Burger, I shall return.
