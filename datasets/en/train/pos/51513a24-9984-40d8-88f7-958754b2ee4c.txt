Loved everything I found in this place and so did my boyfriend so you know it's got to be cool! 

Made is an art boutique on Roosevelt Row in Phoenix. I found so many cool things here from out there books, to yummy candles, funny magnets, unique jewelry, and a huge selection of Phoenix magazines ( hell yes). The girl behind the counter was very nice and help-full she added me to their mailing list and gave me a flier about an upcoming event called mug night. Basically you bring a mug you don't want anymore and find someone to trade with you! Genius! 

I can't get this necklace out of my mind that had crystal designs or sayings on poker chips. Anyone who loves Vegas or Gambling would love those! I'll be back!
