My favorite non-special occasion Chinese place. It's good, cheap, and authentic. The authentic part is surprisingly hard to find in the valley. The menu is huge, but you can't go wrong with the real stuff on the last few pages or the options on the wall. Some favorites: tofu with vermicelli, the noodle soups, singapore hainan chicken rice, fat noodles with spareribs in black bean sauce.
