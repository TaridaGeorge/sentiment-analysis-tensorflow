We were a group of more than 25 CSers and we filled the place. Owner did a great job taking all our orders!

Combination of cold meats was excellent for the Sicilian sandwich. All the other items in the menu were tried and everybody left with a smile. Thank you for hosting our foodie Tuesday event!!
