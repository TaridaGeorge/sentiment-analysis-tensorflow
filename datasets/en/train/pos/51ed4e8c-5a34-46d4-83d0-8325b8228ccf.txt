Every time you walk in or hit the drive through you get "It's a great day for Chick-Fil-A, how can I help you?".  I feel welcomed :)

The other cool random thing... if I go through the drive through with my dog, they always ask if they can give her a milkbone... so she's a fan! just sayin.

As far as the food... I love this place - I mean I am the Duke on the iphone app... there all the time it seems.  Chicken is clean and not fatty, always juicy and the breading is never too thick. Extra pickles is never an issue and getting American cheese on it is cool too. Normal or Spicy Chicken is my pick.

My only beef w/ Chick-Fil-A is they're not open on Sundays... mormon thing. But whatcha gonna do?
