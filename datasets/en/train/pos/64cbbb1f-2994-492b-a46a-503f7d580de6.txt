Hidden gem in north Scottsdale. Happy hour ends at 7 and get there early to sit on the patio. Very unique native beers. We loved the angus tri tip quesadilla. Also our server Jade was amazing she was busting ass serving impatient families and still served us with a big smile.

We will definitely be back!
