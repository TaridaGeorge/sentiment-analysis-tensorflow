I ordered custom interiors for my new Juke. Floor mats, seat covers, dash cover, and even extra fabric to make a mat for my Standard Poodle, who rides in the entire back.

They were very patient in helping me pick out fabrics, did a great job creating the interiors, and installed everything beautifully.

And the car looks way cool. Zebra print!
