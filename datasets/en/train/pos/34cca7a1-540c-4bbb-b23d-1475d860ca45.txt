Yum...

Great Service, Great Food, and they took my "special order well. 

My special order was this:
The Tuscan Chicken Salad. YUM... but it came with mushrooms and Gorgonzola, I am not a fan of either, so i substituted Feta for Gorgonzola and omitted the mushrooms.  The portion was just right, I ate about 3/4 of it and took 1/4 of it home.  So it wasn't over done.  I have nothing bad to say about this.  

this was the most fantastic salad I ever had in my life.  

The wine list was fantastic.

Definitely a must go!
