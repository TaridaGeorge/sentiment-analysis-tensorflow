As a Professional Pet Sitter, I've seen my share of Dog parks.  This is my favorite park in the entire valley.  The location is great, very easily accessible.  The layout is very nice and spacious.  Parking isn't very difficult either.  I like to run around with the dogs as well.  We run and play like overly-hyper 4 year olds, and just have a blast.  Great park!

I LOVE it here!  Absolute Pet Care LLC, (local Scottsdale Professional Pet Care business), will also arrange to bring client's dogs here for a great Dog Park Trip!
