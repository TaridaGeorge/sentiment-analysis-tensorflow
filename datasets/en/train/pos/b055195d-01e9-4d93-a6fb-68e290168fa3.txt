I LOVE NOVOCUR! 
Novocur has changed my life. I was on pain medication, couldn't get out of bed, and so sad that I couldn't function physically anymore. NOW- I am able to move, workout, and live my life without pain. The staff at Novocur is extremely loving and kind. 
Novocur treats me like I'm family. 
I recommend Novocur to everyone I know wirh chronic pain. 
Thank you Novocur!
