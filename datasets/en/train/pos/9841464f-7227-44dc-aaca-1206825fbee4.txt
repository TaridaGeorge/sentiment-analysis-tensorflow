This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Anthem/Phoenix I really miss it since I don't live nearby anymore.  Takeout was the norm. Shrimp Chow Fun is fabulous and I really love the Won Ton Soup, just a few green onions, broth and the won tons-yum so tasty especially on chilly nights. The Crab Puffs and Fried Shrimp are always a must. I really love the Moo Shu Pork too, so if you're a fan order it.
