How I miss Delux.. the best damn burger I have ever had.  I love how they bring you the french fries in little shopping carts, do they still do that?

While living in Phoenix for a year I became a regular at this place.  Get a burger and then go do your grocery shopping next door at Safeway.

Hope this place is still serving up the best burgers.  I didn't bother reading the other reviews before posting my own, so not sure what my fellow yelpers are thinking, but it's a solid 5 stars from me.
