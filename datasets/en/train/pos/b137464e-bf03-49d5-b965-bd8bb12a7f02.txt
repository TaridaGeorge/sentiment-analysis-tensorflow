Came here for a lunch date with daughter and we had the absolute best service on top of always fantastic food! Melissa our server was super friendly, engaged us in conversation, never let us run out of drinks, promptly delivered our food and managed to not make us feel like she was lingering. she even offered us drinks to go and boxed our food for us. On top of it all, the manager (pete, i believe) bought our pizza cookie for absolutely no reason! they made my special lunch date with my daughter that much better! thank you Oregano's, Melissa, and Pete! We will see you again soon!
