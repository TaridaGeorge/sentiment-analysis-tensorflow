I love, love, love Drybar...I have curly hair which can be super hard to blowout because it's long and temperamental-it takes some skill to do it right. Let's just say, I've had many stylists who have attempted to blowout my hair and super failed. However, since my first visit (about a year ago) to my blowout last week, I love this place. I get to sit back watch a chick movie and relax while someone else deals with my time consuming hair- fabulous. I tell everyone about Drybar, especially whenever someone compliments my straight hair!

Of course, it's due to my favorite stylist too, Larysa- she is without a doubt, amazing!
