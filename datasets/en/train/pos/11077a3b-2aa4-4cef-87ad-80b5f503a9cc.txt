LOOOOOVE this place - best breakfast around.  Have been here many times, and have brought every single guest who's visited -- and they all rave and talk about going back.  Everything's from scratch and flavorful, and there are some creative takes on the old classics.

PLUS - It's right at the hockey rink, so I can lace 'em up to work off the huge portions.
