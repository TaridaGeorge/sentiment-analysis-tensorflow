My favorite hotel and Spa is Sanctuary.I get the best hair cut and color from Michael.The rooms are so great, I am going to share one with a friend.(very soon) .The place,(hotel and restaurant,) is addictive and so pleasant because all the staff make you feel so welcome. The food and spa treatments are great. If I tell my favorite massage therapists name, I will never be able to get an appointment to see her.The spa is cozy and warm with great attention to detail.Although I am not the biggest exercise fan,I really look forward to their great classes every time I visit.
