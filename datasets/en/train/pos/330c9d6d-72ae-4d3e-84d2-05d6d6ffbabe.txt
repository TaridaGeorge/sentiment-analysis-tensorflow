YAAAY! I heart cupcakes, and TopIt is a really cute shop in Gilbert that I have tried to avoid to protect my waistline. Well, I "accidentally" walked in this afternoon, just to check it out! ;-)  

The employees were really polite and helpful, even though there was a long line. The "toppings bar" (with gummi bears, m&m's and the like) is a nice touch, especially for kids! 

But the big attraction for me: daily "flavor" specials that include two cupcake flavors that are my very favorite, and can NEVER find in local bakeries--PB&J and Salted Caramel. The frosting--amazing! The cake--light, but a little dry, maybe? Overall, nom, nom, nom--they were absolutely delicious, too bad I had to share with my husband! ;-) 

I can't wait to go back and try some of the other flavors like Chai and Pancakes n' Bacon. Two BIG thumbs up to TopIt!
