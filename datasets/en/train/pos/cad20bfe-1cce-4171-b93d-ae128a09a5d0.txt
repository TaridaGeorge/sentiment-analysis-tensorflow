We have been very fortunate to have Andrea for our house/pet sitter for two years now! She is flexible and able to take care of the unexpected while we are away. We can rest easy because we know Andrea is taking great care of our dogs, cat and menagerie of animals we leave in her care. Thanks Andrea for giving us a break!
