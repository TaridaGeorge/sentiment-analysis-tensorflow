My neighborhood go-to for breakfast/lunch 3 to 4 times a week!  Everything is homemade, fresh and delicious.  Try the South By Southwest, simply amazing.  But so are their sandwiches and salads.  All baked goods made on site.  Delish!  The patio is nice when too when the weather permits.  Cute atmosphere overall.  The staff is very friendly and knows me and my order.
