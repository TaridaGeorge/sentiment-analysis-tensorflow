god
i really really don't know what to give the duce
as i am writing this spiel im still considering...
okay okay
pros and cons
easy way to make up my mind
pro:
-favorite old timey domestic beers available for $3 a pop
-great food
-awesome concept
-a real playground for adults
cons:
-bermuda triangle/wormhole/vortex/blackhole telephone booth
-trying to be everything at once
well despite being trapped in their vintage phone booth, abandoned by my carefree and ambivalent yelp friends and rescued by two chuckling meat head types who proceeded to deride my foolishness at getting locked inside a confined space and then panicking like a lost child separated from his overbearing jewish mother in a crowded wal-mart shopping center, i still happen to think that the pro's vastly outweigh any con you could dream up for the Duce. 
and ya know what
boom
5 stars.
