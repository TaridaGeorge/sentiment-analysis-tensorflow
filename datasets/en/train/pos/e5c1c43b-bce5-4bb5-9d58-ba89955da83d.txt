This place is on our list of must stops during our annual Spring Training Trip. I wish I could have two different ratings, one for beer and the other for good. My rating is strictly on the beer. Beer is definitely a 5, food is about 3.5. We usually get a couple pizzas, and they are decent. If you are not into really good beer, then don't bother with this place. This is for beer snobs only. They have an off the chart beer selection.
