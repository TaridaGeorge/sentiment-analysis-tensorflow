I thought this place was the best...until i moved to San Francisco & visited the jeweled paradise of Amoeba Records. Still, by suburban standards, it rocks! Zia stores have maybe a quarter of the selection of Amoeba (plus, twice as much of a country selection)....but you only need a few handfuls of quarters for purchases here. Those low-down dirty desert prices are everyone's style!
