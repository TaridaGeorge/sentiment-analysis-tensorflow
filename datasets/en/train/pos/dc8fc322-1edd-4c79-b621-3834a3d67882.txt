The only downside to this place is that they don't serve alcohol. 

Everything else was perfect. Huge hookahs, attentive (but not overbearing) staff, large selection, good prices. Hell, they even have Turkish Coffee. We got some free pistachio baklava samples too, holy moly were they good. 

This is a much needed hangout in the Tempe area, especially for people like me that hate Mill Ave.
