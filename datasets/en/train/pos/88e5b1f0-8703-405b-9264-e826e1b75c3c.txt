Just spent a beautiful weekend at the Biltmore and stayed in the newly renovated Ocatilla Wing. Very nicely appointed rooms with Frank Lloyd Wright inspired design. Simple and very elegant. We loved the private concierge service with a great breakfast, cocktails and appetizers for the guests. All included in the price of the room.
