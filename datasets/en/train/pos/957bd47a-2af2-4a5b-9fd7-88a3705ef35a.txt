Bought two groupons for my two sons birthdays. Few days before they were going to go on the ride we had to reschedule because the car was wrecked. Few months later and today actually they finally got to drive the Ferrari!! Boy did that put HUGE smiles on their face..It was soo awesome and they had a blast. Disappointed about trying to call them and always getting the machine and originally was a little disappointed with some hidden tip money not shown initially on groupon. People were very nice though and I feel they made it up to us and the boys enjoyed it GREATLY.. I will definitely recommend them for a fun present..
