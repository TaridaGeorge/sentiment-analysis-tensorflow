I just received a beautiful arrangement from flora unique for mother's day.  Rachel went the extra mile and called me twice when I didn't answer at the door. Super sweet on the phone, and didn't spoil the surprise--just said she had a delivery for me. When I saw the gorgeous arrangement I was truly surprised, and the vase it came with was an interesting shape, perfect for reuse. All of the flowers were fresh and bright, and her color choices were superb. Highly recommend!
