I am so happy that Groupon featured this place! The woman working on the beautiful Saturday morning that we went was extremely attentive and helpful. I needed a Mother's Day gift and she was immediately able to identify the perfect gift.  We were the only ones in there and probably stayed for 45 minutes or so. I really hope more people stop by, as it is a little hidden away because of trees out front. But it is right by the Phoenix City Grill, which is very popular. I have only been to one other tea shop, and this one offered much more in novelty items.  I will definitely be going again, when I run out of all the tea I bought!
