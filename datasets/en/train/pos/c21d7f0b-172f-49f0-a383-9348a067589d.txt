I have been vegan for almost 2 months and I am so thankful that I live close to Green! I first discovered Teese Cheese there, which they use in some of their dishes. Teese mozzarella tastes and melts just like the real thing! They sell it by the register to-go. We use the Teese all the time for pizzas and pasta dishes at home. I love their poblano hummus and pita chips for an appetizer. I absolutely adore their mock chicken; it is purse heaven. Their greenza pizza is fabulous, as is their kung pao mock chicken bowl.
