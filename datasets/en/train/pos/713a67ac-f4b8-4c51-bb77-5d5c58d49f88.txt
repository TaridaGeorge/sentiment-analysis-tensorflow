It's not as good as it gets- it's better!  We  threw a little party for a friend at C4 and the preparation right down to the finish could not have been improved upon. "Chuck" made certain that both the food and wine selection were appropriate for the time, situation and budget. "W" made sure the food was delicious, and our server "Jake" was friendly and very accommodating all the way around. Yes- think of this as a great place for a cozy cup of coffee but definitely think of it for a great lunch/dinner or get together with a group of friends-any age. "W" even brought out one of his new creations for us to try on the house "Chicken Osso Buco"-  I will be back for that!  Thank you for a wonderful experience....from all of us who were there.
