I like the beautiful flowers all outside and the cool side patio you can step out on for fresh air. The bartender staff is so great,friendly, and efficient 
Albert waited on us I believe- he's way cool. Or maybe it was Alfredo . We all had the Oregon wines which were fabulous and tasty. Crisp, light. Both white and reds were great. It was Wednesday nite so we had tastings and 5 dollars per glass. We drank a plenty and it was fun times.
