Yay! I'm a fan.

I've used City Wide Pest control many times for spraying inside and outside my house to control the bug population at my home.

The technicians are always very professional, friendly and are willing to answer any questions you may have.

Unlike many other Pest control companies, City Wide does not require you to sign a contract or agree to a certain number of months of service. You can just ask them to set you up month to month and they'll give you a call each month to see if you would like a service scheduled.

Nothing but good experience with City Wide so far. I recommend them.
