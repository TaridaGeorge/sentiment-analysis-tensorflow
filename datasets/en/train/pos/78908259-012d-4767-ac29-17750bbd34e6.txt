The Humane Society of Southern Arizona is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the general welfare, sheltering and placement of animals.  They safeguard, rescue, shelter, heal, adopt and advocate for animals in need, while inspiring community action and compassion on their behalf. 

I could feel the love as soon as I walked through the door! The facilities are clean and well maintained by the friendly staff.  They have a huge cat hotel that I have never seen in any other shelter.  The dogs have 4 separate hotels with about 10 dogs in each.  I am mostly impressed with there active involvement and perseverance in ending animal cruelty! Not only do they have the knowledge and love for these animals, they have the strong desire to educate as well! AHS post daily events and adoptable pets on their website and Facebook page.
