Camelview is the best theatre in the valley.  Small compared to the big box theatre - it is a harkins - so wear your shirt and bring your cup to get your coke and popcorn for $1 - you just cannot beat harkins!  Camelview is known for showing independent and smaller films that your 24 plex will not show.  The staff at the snack counter is always fast and attentive - more so than the big theatres.  You will always get good service with a smile at camelview.  That is why I drive in from chandler on a regular basis to see movies there.  They make you feel welcome, and that you are part of a movie experience.
