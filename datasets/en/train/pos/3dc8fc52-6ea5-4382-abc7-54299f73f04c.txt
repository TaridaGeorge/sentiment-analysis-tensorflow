Went here the other day for lunch and it was excellent. Both I and my friend had different pizzas at lunch and we were both very impressed. I'll definitely be back to try out the rest of the menu. The service was very good as well.

The only negative to the place is the seating is very cramped and it's pretty small in general. Not a huge fan of almost knocking elbows with the people at the tables next to me.  The food and service are outstanding and make up for it however.
