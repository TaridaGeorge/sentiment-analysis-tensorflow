I love this place. Best Indian food around here. And the most awesome free chai ever!

My favorites here are the mango lassi, the garlic naan and the chicken makhani! And I pretty much order the same thing every single time! But at times when I'm feeling adventurous, I go for the Goan fish curry (probably the only time I'll touch fish in non-sushi form) or the chicken biryani!

They have a big menu to choose from and the food is as authentic as it gets. They do tone the spice levels down quite a bit though - which might be a good or bad thing depending on how spicy you like your food to be :-)

I love this place and take all my non-Indian friends here whenever they crave Indian food! I'd vouch for it's awesomeness any day!
