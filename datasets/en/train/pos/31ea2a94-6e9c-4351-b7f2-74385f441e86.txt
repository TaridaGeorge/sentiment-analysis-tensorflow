I'm bumping up to five stars for 5th and Wine...
Since my initial review, I've been back at least five times and I have yet to have a bad meal... I am addicted to the vegetable salad and the butternut squash soup, but I finally branched out and tried the bruschetta last night - PHENOMENAL!

I highly recommend both the ones I tried: 
the apples, brie, fig jam, honey and agave drizzle, and the prosciutto, figs, mascarpone cheese, and tomato jam.

To top off the attentive, friendly service, 5th and Wine now has live music in the courtyard on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays!
