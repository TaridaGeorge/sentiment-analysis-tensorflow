One of the best Asian grocery stores I have had the pleasure to visit. I have traveled a lot and been in many different asian markets. Mekong Supermarket has a wide variety of sauces, fish, meats, and spices that bring the orient into your home. The prices are very reasonable and the fruit and vegetables are fresh.  I will be back!
