Go to Green... it's delicious! No, it isn't low-fat or low-calorie, so I have taken that to consideration and indulge in their food every now and then. Everything I have had (or sampled) is wonderful... with the exception of the egglessrolls. While very large, they were kinda bland with too much wrapper. I definitely preferred the crab puffs over the egglessrolls anyday. Good iced tea and decent iced chai, too. Worth the stop if eating your way through Phoenix being vegetarian/vegan.
