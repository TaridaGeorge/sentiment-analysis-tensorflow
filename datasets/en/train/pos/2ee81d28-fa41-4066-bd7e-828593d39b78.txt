Probably the best meal Ive had in a long time. The atmosphere was quite romantic (we were there for our 11th anniversary), service was outstanding and the food was awesome. We had the cheese appetizer, Heirloom tomato salad, lobster & shrimp bisque, ahi tuna steak and Gulf white shrimp with Jonah lump crab...plus the crab fried rice and the broccolini. Everything was amazing. We even received a complimentary dessert for or anniversary - we chose the pineapple upside-down cake and it was the best Ive ever had!
