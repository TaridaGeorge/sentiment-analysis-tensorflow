Great food, great prices, great hookahs, great shisha selection... Nuff said... but really, if you live in Tempe and have a hookah hobby, do yourself a favor and visit this place.  You will be pleasantly surprised by all the hookah gear they carry.  If hookah isn't your thing then come for the food.  Their chicken shawarma sandwich with fries is delicious and affordable.
