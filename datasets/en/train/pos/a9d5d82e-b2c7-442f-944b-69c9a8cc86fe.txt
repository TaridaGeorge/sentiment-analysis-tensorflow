Probably my most favorite fast food place! Their fries are delicious. I love the fact that they're shoestring which not many places have. It makes it more appealing to me for some reason :p Also, the seasoning on those fries... AMAZING. Their burgers and patty melts are tasty as is their custards. I would recommend coming here if your in the mood for some good fast food, versus going to McDonalds or Burger King. You won't regret it!
