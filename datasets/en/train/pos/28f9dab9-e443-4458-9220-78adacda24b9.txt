The food prepared by Marlene and Cassie of Pomegranate Cafe is FANTASTIC. I had the opportunity to attend a retreat that they came to be the chefs for. Everything they set out -- breakfast, lunch, and dinner -- tasted fresh and delicious. From the handmade granola accompanied with fresh-cut fruit, to the vegetarian spring rolls + peanut sauce, to the veggie burgers, to the apple + berry crisp, to the veggie penne + pesto. I know this is not a review about the cafe itself, but I am here to say that anything produced by these two ladies will nourish you, mind and body. If I ever get the chance to come out to the Phoenix, AZ area, Pomegranate Cafe will be on my itinerary for sure.
