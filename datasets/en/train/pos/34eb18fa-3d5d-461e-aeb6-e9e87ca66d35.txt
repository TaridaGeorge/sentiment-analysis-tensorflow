This Carl's Jr just opened on April 17.  I was one of the first to visit when it opened and found joy that they arr currently overstaffed.  

On a second visit I dined in and was asked by more than one employee if I needed anything and if everything was satisfactory.  It was the greatest fast food service I have had in a long time.
