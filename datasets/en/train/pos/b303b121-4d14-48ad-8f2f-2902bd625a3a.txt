i luv Flo's on 7th ave. what brought me in the first time was the $1.00 sale on mondays. i found some amazing clothes on the racks. even some that still had the price tag on them.

  this little shop is small enough that you can go thru the clothes without feeling that you have missed something. 
  
  there are also great purses, books and furniture and the jewlery, wow. 
the fact that they contribute profits to a great charity is also a plus. 

I now stop in at Flo's on 7th when i am visiting my friend in phoenix.
