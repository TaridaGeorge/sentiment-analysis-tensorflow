We found this place on Yelp! and I am glad we did. While visiting Scottsdale we dropped in and enjoyed the air conditioned parlor. We had the Oatmeal raisin gelato (heavenly) and chocolate chip gelato. It was so creamy and delicious that we stopped in the following night for dessert again! This time having the banana gelato (I'm going bananas for this!), oatmeal (yes, that good) and lemon (super tart). All in all, great except for the young rude kids that hang out at the local theater that were loud and obnoxious. Luckily, the young girl behind the counter had the courtesy of asking them to loiter elsewhere to allow patrons to have a seat! Thank you!
