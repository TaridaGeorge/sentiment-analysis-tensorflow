I have been to Casey over 4-5 times now and the most recent time I had a facial, collagne eye treatment as well as my nose pierced. My skin has never looked better not to mention if you get an hour facial; your hands, feet and neck get massaged!

After debating on getting my nose pierced I finally had it done with Casey. It was super easy and hardly hurt - she had the perfect size gauge (not those large ones which I really did not want) and placed in perfect position. 

I have another appointment next Wednesday and looking forward to seeing Casey again!
