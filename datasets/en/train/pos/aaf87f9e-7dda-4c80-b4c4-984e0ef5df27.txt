I have been seeing Suzanne for my nail care for the past 9-10 years. I have had natural nails, acrylic, and shellac manicures, and all of them have been impeccable.  Her acrylics look like your own natural nails.  Suzanne's pedicures are the most thorough and beautiful pedicures you will have in your life.  Not only is Suzanne talented and thorough at her work, but she is also a delightful person to know and visit with.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed!
