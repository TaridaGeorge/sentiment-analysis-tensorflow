This place is pretty darn Pho-nominal... I would go so far to say that this is the best pho restaurant in the Phoenix metro area. Definitely not your typical hole in the wall Pho restuarant... the decor and service are great. I would recommend having the pho and/or broken rice plates. Pho Ao Sen's spring rolls are also amazing. Last but not least... the owner is hot.
