Made the journey again to enjoy what still has to be my favorite Thai food in the valley. [I look forward to someone providing a suggestion to prove me wrong.] It had been more than 6 months since my last visit and I still daydreamed of their Thai Toast appetizer. I pretty much made that my dinner and ordered the duck and pineapple curry (again) and with the exception of a few spoons worth I took it home to enjoy later. And enjoy it I did. 

It's out of the way for many (since I moved downtown it is more of a journey), and located in a "shady" old strip mall. Don't let any of that deter you from trying it out. Many of my fellow yelpers know the "beauty" of a place is not always a good judge of character for the great food you can get.
