These sandwiches are so good, I would be willing to sit outside on those 115-degree days Phoenix supposedly gets, if that was the only way I could enjoy them. Combine it with Cowboy Ciao in Scottsdale and Cafe Elote in Sedona, and we pretty much had the perfect AZ food trifecta.

Bonus points for meeting Chris Bianco behind the counter. Yeah, I guess this place is named after him.
