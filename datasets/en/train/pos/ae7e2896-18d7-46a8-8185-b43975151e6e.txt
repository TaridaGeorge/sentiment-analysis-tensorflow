unPHOgettable is quite PHOnomenal
For being Asian, service is remarkable
Get filled up for less than ga$ in your abdominal
No MSG, no trans-fat makes it responsible

Summer rolls and pork taste so verrry nice 
Add some Sriracha and chili for that extra spice
Oh! Love me long time, I need more rice!
If ya don't have yellow fever, you'll be enticed

Even my round-eye BF began to slant
Clapping his hands in a chant
Tried ordering more, though his pants can't
Calm down cracker, no need to take a chance
On a food coma, me want some late night romance

Being Vietnamese, I'm keeping it PHO-real
Eat here for an authentic PHO-bulous meal
Situated next to an Asian market 
For that trustworthy PHO-king feel

PHO-shizzle, PHO-sho, this ain't no faux-Pho
