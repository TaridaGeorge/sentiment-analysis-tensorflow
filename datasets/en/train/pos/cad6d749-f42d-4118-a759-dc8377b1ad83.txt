Whatever happened to the good old days of playing board games or card games?  Everyone is now glued to their Xboxes or PS3s or Wii or Nintendo Ds.....I remember when I was growing up my Mom and I would play backgammon for hours!  A co-worker told me about this place because we have been playing games on our lunch breaks now for a few weeks.  He has brought in all kinds of cool games.  Killer Bunnies is a particular favorite.  

Game Daze has it all.  Chess, backgammon, cards, poker, and all kinds of board and card games for kids and adults.  The staff seemed super knowledgeable too.  I bought an inexpensive board game for my daughter an I to play.  She loves it!  So get the kids away from the TV or the hand held games for awhile and interact.  It's fun!
