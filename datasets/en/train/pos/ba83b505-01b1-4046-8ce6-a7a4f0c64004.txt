Eagle Mountain is awesome.  It's playable, and at the same time offers some unique challenges.  Not as difficult as some of the other courses in the area, but it's just as fun.  

The best thing about Eagle Mountain is the elevation changes on almost every hole.  You're hitting uphill, or you're hitting downhill... Keeps it interesting.  The condition wasn't excellent, but that's expected for a few weeks before overseeding.

The staff is very helpful and friendly... They even dropped off some cold mango towels, which is unusual for a non-resort course.  They definitely take care of you here.

If you live in AZ, make sure you book it through their website at the resident rate.  Save a few bucks that way.
