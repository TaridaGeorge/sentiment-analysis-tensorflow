Mom used to call our neighbor a 'sex fiend'. Mainly because she caught him parked in his driveway one night, making out with one of my sister's friends.
Mom's terminology makes me want to invoke the word 'fiendishly good' for anything delightful.  
Although, I never saw anything even remotely delightful about Maryanne Halston...ginormous slut that she was. 

Bosa's donuts are fiendishly good. Don't believe me?
The real bellwether is the number of police cars parked in front on any given morning....folks, this looks like a law enforcement convention. 

If the po-po only knew how I methodically extract the creme / jelly fillings from the solid donuts before presenting them to my evil co-workers, they'd snatch me up and take me into the 4th St jail lickety-split. 
 
What's really amazing is how my co-workers eat them anyway...without the filling.
Fucking hogs.
