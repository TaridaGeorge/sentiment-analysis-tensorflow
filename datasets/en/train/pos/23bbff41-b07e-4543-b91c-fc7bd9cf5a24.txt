Won't bore you with the usual "How-We-Met-Thanks-To-Yelp."  Blah blah blah. Suffice to say, I couldn't reach my usual A/C guys for the twice yearly checkup.  Miguel's team showed up the next day.  On time. Checkup cost $75, including a lecture on the right filter (for my York, cheaper is better.  Hunh.)  I was impressed that they not only went over the results but included the findings on my receipt, so I could track the unit's performance over time if I went back to my old A/C guys.  As if.
