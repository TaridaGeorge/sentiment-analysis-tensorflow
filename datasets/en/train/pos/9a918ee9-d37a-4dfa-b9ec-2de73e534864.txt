This place is great.  You can run through the automatic car wash for just a few bucks and get the outside nice and clean, but the real gem is the do it yourself area.  They have these great air guns that you can use to dry your car or also blow the crumbs from the little cracks in your car.  I am in love with this feature... The Clean Freak on 44th and Thomas does not have this feature, but this location does and it worth the drive.  I usually spend about $4 to have an outside wash and then use the free cleaning cloth, vacuums, and airgun to finish up the interior.  They also have monthly memberships you can buy, but with a busy family I don't have time to go enough to make that worth the money.
