If ever we needed  a place to party Geisha would be on that list! THe bartenders are amazing and just like the other reviews on here the Karaoke rooms are no joke! Get a group of friends together, splash in a little happy hour and you are bound to set yourself up for memorable moments! My server was awesome too! Drink kept on flowing and before we knew it it was 2AM! :)
