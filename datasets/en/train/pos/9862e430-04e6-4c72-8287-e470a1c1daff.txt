I have been in this locations a couple times, they have always provided excellent service. I took my pool sweep to them, after I got it back from Checker Pool Supply and it still wasn't working. Corey the customer service rep took it apart at the counter, replaced a couple parts and had me out of the store in less than 20 minutes. They are my new pool store. They understand the importance of service
