I lived in Texas for four years, so I guess you can say I know good BBQ.  This is not fancy gourmet BBQ, to me this is the real, home cooked BBQ I grew up on in the midwest and so lovingly adored in Texas.  Stacy's gives you that eating in your backyard kind of feel.  No fancy decorations, no fussy frills,  and yes there are DO NOT signs everywhere, but think of it as your momma's house you know the rules there so there doesn't need to be signs.  
The BEST BBQ outside of Texas and my momma's house.  
Bring Cash, ask for the sandwiches with the sauce on the side and prepare to  enjoy the sauce dripping from your chin experience.
