What a great bakery.  The breads are fantastic as well as some of their specialty baked goods.  They even have spiral rolls with spinach, cheese, etc. fillings, something like Spanakopeta, but individual.  They have a nice selection of individual sweet bakery items.  They remind so much of Greek food, especially since I make a large batch of Spanakopeta a few times a year.  Their food is great and so reasonable.
