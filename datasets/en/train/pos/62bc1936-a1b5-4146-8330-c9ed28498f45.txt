MacAlpine's has sat in the same exact location near downtown Phoenix since 1928. As far as I can tell, that's longer than any other establishment in the Valley. The cookie dough shake I had was delicious. It's not hard to forget you're in the 21st century the moment you walk in, since the only thing you'll find inside that's less than several decades old are the waitresses.
