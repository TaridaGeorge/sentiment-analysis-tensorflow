Wow, lived here for 10 years and never knew this was here.  In a Quaker building right off the 51 is one of the most Americana events you can catch.  Folk music played accoustically, by a varied group of folks.

My son loved it as did my girlfriend.  Cheap coffee for $1.00 and sodas, along with homemade baked goods round out the offering.  It really isn't a coffee house as much as a great place to hear music.

Very sparse (think Quaker) but a perfect environment for the music.  If you need to chill out for a few hours, hit this place up.  There are few places in America where you will see this environment.  Everyone is welcoming and nice, we will definately return.
