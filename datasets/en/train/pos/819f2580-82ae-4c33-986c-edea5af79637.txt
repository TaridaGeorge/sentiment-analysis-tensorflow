It doesn't get any better than Mason Mechanical. They are so wonderful in all aspects of sales, install and service. They did my rebate paperwork with me/for me as well. I had a problem with my new unit's electrical and they added a booster module of some sort at no extra charge, works like a champ. I love my Trane.
