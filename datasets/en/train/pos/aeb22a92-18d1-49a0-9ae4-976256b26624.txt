My friends and I loved the parlor from the moment we walked in the door.  The whole restaurant is amazing but some of my favorite things were the raised vegetable garden next to the front door, the bar with beauty parlor chairs, and the "men" and "women" cutouts in the bathroom door.

Aside from being pretty the parlor serves up good food too!  I ordered the pizza of the day, which was an amazing combination of peaches and pruchuitto.  My friends and I also shared a cesar salad and a yummy cheesy cauliflower appetizer.  

Our service was just right.  I will go back again.
