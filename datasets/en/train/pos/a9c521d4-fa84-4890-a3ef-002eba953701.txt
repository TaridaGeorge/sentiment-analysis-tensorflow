Highly delicious cupcakes- ordered the coconut and the red velvet which were both very good.  I think the frosting to cupcake ratio is right on par and the frosting isn't overly sugary (for my taste at least).  The husband was freaked out by the wooden forks though "they taste like a tongue depressor."
