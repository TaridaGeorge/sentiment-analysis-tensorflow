Fabulous new yoga/spin studio.   I have taken a variety of spin classes over the last 3-4 years and LOVE the RealRyder bikes.   The added benefit of working your core makes for an even better workout than the typical spin bikes.   All the instructors are great.   On Mon. and Wed. nights there is a DJ, which adds to the fun.   I have yet to take the other offered classes (Barre, Core and Yoga) but definitely plan to do so in the future.   The owners are very friendly and helpful with any questions.  In addition to all the group classes, they have a great personal trainer available, Todd Shuler (who also does the Mon./Wed./Sat. spin classes).      So to find a studio that has spin, yoga, core AND a personal trainer available, I need to look no further.
