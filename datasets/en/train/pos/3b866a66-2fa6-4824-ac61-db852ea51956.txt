I too am amazed at the personal attention from this cycle shop. I have been to several trying to get started. I knew nothing- Pat took time to teach me a ton. He also offered to ride with me to make sure I understood and was happy with my bike selections. Pinnacle Peak is lucky to have Pat as a worker- truly an asset to the business.
