I stopped in this store today to check out the latest Amy Butler fabrics. I left feeling inspired and excited about sewing. They offer classes for an affordable price. They had an awesome selection of fabric and the staff was quite helpful. I know I'll be back and hope to take their beginner's sewing class this summer when I have more free time.
