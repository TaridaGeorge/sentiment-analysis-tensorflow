We've been going to this place for at least 15 years - at 7th Street and Bell first and then when that closed, wechaged it up to the Cactus location. We travel a good 20 miles from I17 and the Happy Valley Rd one way to pick up take out or go out with freinds here. 
The food can't be matched - The place can use some updating, but when the food is this good - who cares.....
