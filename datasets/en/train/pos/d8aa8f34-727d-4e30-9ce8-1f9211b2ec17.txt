Delicious and affordable!  I stopped here for lunch after attending a meeting in the area.  Easy to find, just off Elliot and the 10.  Quick service, too.  You walk in and line up to order and then pay.  Find a seat and wait for your order to be called.  I had the Huevos Ala Mexicana - #12, the breakfast burrito.  I was sutffed, struggled to finish half, so you get more than what you pay for =).  Their green tomatillo sauce is delish and I thought it complimented my breakfast burrito perfectly. 

Definitely worth the drive if you want to try something different and don't want to break the bank.  Enjoy!
