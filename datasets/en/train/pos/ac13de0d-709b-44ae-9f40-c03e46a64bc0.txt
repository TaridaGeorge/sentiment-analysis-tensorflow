My review is for the location in Terminal 3. It opened recently and took the place of an Ice Cream spot that I never saw anyone at.

The service here is great and the food is very tasty. They offer a wide variety of choices including sandwiches, breakfast items, pastries and cookies.

It's a great place to pick up something to eat before your flight.
