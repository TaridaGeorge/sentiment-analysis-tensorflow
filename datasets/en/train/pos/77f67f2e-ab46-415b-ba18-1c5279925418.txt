What a dinner!  Wife and I took advantage of a summer special at the Wigwam and took advantage of a restaurant.com coupon for the Grill at the Wigwam.  Couldn't have been nicer.

The service at The Grill is impeccable.  The restaurant itself is very comfortable and provides a nice view of the golf courses.  But on to the food.

I had the New York Strip steak medium rare.  It was outstanding.  Nearly fork tender and super grilled taste.  Don't know the sauce it was served with but it made a great steak taste even better.

My lovely wife had the pork chop and it was superb.  She really liked the sauce it was served with.  

The house salad is plentiful and fresh.  Every ingredient was fresh, crispy and the house dressing was excellent.  

All in all, we had a dinner fit for an early summer eve's finest.
