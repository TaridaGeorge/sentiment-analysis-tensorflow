I'll never eat Y.C.'s again.

Not that Y.C.'s Mongolian BBQ is awful (although it kinda is), it's just that Genghi's does the whole build-your-own-stir-fry thing so much better, with fresher ingredients, that I don't see the point in lowering my standards for any other comp.

I'm glad I don't live closer to one of Genghi's Valley locations because I'd end up eating there more often that I'd like to admit.

My favorite concotion involves bean sprouts, beef, water chestnuts, lots of bell peppers, baby corn, two eggs, and dragon sauce over brown rice. It's just perfect.
