I work at a Spa but yet I still find myself  at T Lily.The location is perfect.There is always parking on the streets and it is easy to find.I live in old town so I enjoy walking to get my services.From brow waxing, to Microderms, to galvanic treatments, to facials that have transformed my skin are only a few of the services that I keep returning for.
