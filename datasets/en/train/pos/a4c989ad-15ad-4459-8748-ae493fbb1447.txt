When I'm not hitting up The Sugar Bowl in Old Town, I come over to the equally amazing G Spot. Yes yes that is what the locals and store owners call it, you'll have some fun with that one! Having tried Gelato in Italy, and becoming a quick addict, I was really excited when this chain popped up all over Scottsdale last year. I have to say, they got the Gelato right! Another thing I really like about the G Spot is the crazy amount of flavors to choose from. They offer a variety of fruit, European, and American choices which are all excellent. At my last visit I opted for a fruity mango and raspberry combo and I loved it! If you want some out of the box dessert definitely consider the G Spot, you won't regret it!
