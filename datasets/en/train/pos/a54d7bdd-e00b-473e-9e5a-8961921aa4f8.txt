I absolutely LOVE this place!  I've gone to several pilates studios over the years and swear by its ability to transform my body!  This place is comfy, easy to schedule, really friendly and after just a few short weeks, I see noticeable differences in my  waist, bust, arms and tummy.  I don't have much free time in my schedule, and these mat classes make it the best bang for my buck- just those hour classes a couple times a week, and I'm right on track for my fitness goals.  Even my husband goes to help his back.  Sonia is my favorite teacher, but I like them all- really nice, patient at explaining movements and always on time.  I highly recommend!
