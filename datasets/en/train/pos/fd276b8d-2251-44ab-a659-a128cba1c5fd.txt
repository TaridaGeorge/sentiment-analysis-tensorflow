Arizona Hair Company is located just East of the Walmart in Queen Creek Az. . So you can park near the two stores for one trip. 

I called ahead and asked for the most experienced stylist. I was told Jill had 17 years of experience and so I made an appointment w/ Jill for later that same day. 

I was not disappointed. Jill gave me a fantastic hair cut, exactly like I instructed. She was professional, pleasant and I will be going back here for a long time. 

Price $15 plus gratuity. I was in and out in 30 minutes. Great job Jill.
