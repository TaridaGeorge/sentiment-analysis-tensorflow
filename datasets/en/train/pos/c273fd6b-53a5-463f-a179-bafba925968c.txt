I love this place - I go whenever I'm in town! The best sandwiches with the best meats ( Boars Head-yummm) The coffee they make is really tasty and they make everything with care. The Ceasar salad is to die for - fresh, crisp, zesty and oh so tasty! I highly recommend the Itailian Combo - it is the real deal. The '5.00 sub' place cannot touch this place - it is deeelish and the prices are great....HIGHLY recommend!!
