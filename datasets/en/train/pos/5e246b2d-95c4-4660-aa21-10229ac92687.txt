So they pretty much have every flavor Tea imaginable hot or cold!! Had their Chocolate Mint Hot Tea, and my oh my it was Devine!  Not your typical "tea shop" as it has more of a modern feel.  Not too crowded for being a Saturday night, but enough people to know its worth walking into.  Cant wait to try their pomegranate tea!
