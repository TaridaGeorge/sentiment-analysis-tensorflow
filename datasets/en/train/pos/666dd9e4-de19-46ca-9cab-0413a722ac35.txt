We had a Paddy'O set that was about 10 years old and still in great shape - but we just wanted to get the fabric redone on the chairs and loungers.  I thought this was going to be a total pain, but it was easy as could be.  And since I'm quite particular, I really appreciated their patience and the options I was presented.  Everything went smoothly and was delivered on time.  Great experience and great products. Thanks!
