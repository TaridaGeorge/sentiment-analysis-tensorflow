In the Oakland Bay Area Mr. Chao's is synonymous with a Chinese fast food where everything tastes the same.

In Phoenix AZ, it's synonymous with fantastically delicious quality food.

This is a "bistro" located in a strip mall (nothing new for Arizona) that has wonderful mood lighting that is warm and inviting.

The service is friendly and knowledgeable.

The food is awesome.  General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Szechwan String Beans with Chicken and combination fried rice are so very good.  No questionable meat here.  Wonderful spices.  The Chinese Chicken salad has a bite to it that will keep you going back for more and more.

This place is a wonderful go-to for authentic Chinese food that will satisfy all the time.
