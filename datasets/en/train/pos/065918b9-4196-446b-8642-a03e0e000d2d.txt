I didn't  go for the great salad bar or even the best dinner rolls I have  ever had. We went for the steak....every one of the options(over 10) were fantastic. The fact that you get to try as many and as much as you'd like makes it great.  No this isn't a buffet like it  sounds. GO hungry and leave happy,period.
