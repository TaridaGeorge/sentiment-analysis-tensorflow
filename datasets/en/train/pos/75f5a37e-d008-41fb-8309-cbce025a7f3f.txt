I brought in curtains that I needed some alterations. I needed them in a hurry and asked for same day service but the staff said next day would be the best they could do. I actually thought that was very reasonable so no problem. Then, at 5pm same day, I got a surprise phone call that they were ready. They did same day service and really helped me out. They did a good job on the work and they look great.
