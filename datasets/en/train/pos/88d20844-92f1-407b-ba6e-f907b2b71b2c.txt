Noone does bruschetta like postino.  Figs, goat cheese, brie, salmon, capers... just some of the ingredients you might find on their bruschetta.  And, you can mix and match.

The 5 dollar glasses of wine for happy hour are great.  

The ambience in all of the restaurants owned by this group are amazing.  Its similar to Windsor, but with different food.  It's the kind of place you have a great time hanging out on because the clean/modern/hip atmosphere rubs off on you!

Highly recommended
