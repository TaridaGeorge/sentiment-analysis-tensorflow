this time we shared a craft of house wine, like it a lot,  and the goat cheese appetizer, liked that a lot too. The boy had the pork chop and it was melt in you mouth tender, about and inch and a half thick, and absolutely wonderful. I had the seafood cioppino, loved it. Ive seen some complaints about the soggy bread, but I loved it. I left it for the very last so it could soak up all the amazing broth, it was still slightly crispy on the edges, but gooey from the cheese and broth in the middle, it was the perfect end to a really great meal.  Service was good too.
