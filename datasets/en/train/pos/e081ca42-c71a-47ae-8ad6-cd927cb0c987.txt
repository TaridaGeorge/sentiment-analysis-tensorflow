This hotel is awesome! Stayed here for a wedding, rate of $85/night. Included comp breakfast, free wifi, awesome pool, apples in the afternoon, free internet workstations, 24 hr Starbucks, friendly staff, free golfcart transportation to the shopping areas nearby. 

The rooms were awes, clean, well decorated. Love it! Will def stay here again. I even used the gym which while small, has excellent equipment. If you really want a more fancier one, they have a deal for $10 you can go to the local 24 hour fitness.
