Woohooo! It was as good as it gets! 

I met Amanda a while back and fell in LOVE with her & her studio immediately. The decor is darling, she actually has the same furniture as I do! Everything is mirrored, white, clean and classy. 

Not only was the decor beautiful her facials are amazing! Amanda did her signature "Hot Date" facial on me and it left my skin looking and feeling great. 

I would recommend Amanda for all of you skin care needs. She is kind, gentle and is extremely knowledgeable.
