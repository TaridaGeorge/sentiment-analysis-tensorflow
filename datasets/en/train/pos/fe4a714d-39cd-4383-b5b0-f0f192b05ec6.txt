LOVE working with this company.  My husband and I have quite a few rental properties as well as residential property "flips" and work with Carpet World at least once every couple weeks.  They take the time to do things right, they fit us in the schedule last minute all the time, and if there are ever issues (rare)- they are quick to make things right.  They are very honest- once we paid them twice for the same check and right away they called to write us a refund!  Great quality carpet, professional installers.  Highly recommend!
