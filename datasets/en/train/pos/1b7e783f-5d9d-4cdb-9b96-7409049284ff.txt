I have been here a few times for work and each and everytime has been a wonderful experience.  Not only for their service, but their food is amazing.  you get alot of food for your money.  If you there is something ingredient wise you don't like, just let them know and they can customize your meals how you want.  I would go there again when I am in town for work.
