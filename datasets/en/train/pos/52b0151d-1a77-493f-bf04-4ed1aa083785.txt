I sit in a cubicle for 40 hours a week. My life is miserable during those hours. The one thing to lift my spiritis is Greek Pita. I dream that one day my cubicle will turn into Pita Bread with Hummus so I can eat it. I also think it is highly beneficial to have a long beard while going to Greek Pita as I came back from lunch and found a pita crumb with Hummus on my beard, needless to say I ate it.
