This is my go to and send to for anyone visiting or a local.  Love the drink selection and recipes.  All the mixologists are spot on ith presentation and palate selection.  If you're looking to get a vodka soda or something to that degree you may want to try something out of your comfort zone and go with their specialty cocktails.  It's got great outdoor and indoor seating for groups and one-on-one type convo which is great.  Days for being busy and energetic are hit and miss but it's more of a place to enjoy the people your with and maybe starting light conversation with a fellow patron.  Everyone is always very polite, professional and knowledable.  They also have a private room for rent for private parties which is great as well.  Always my go to for any type of classy or casual occassion.
