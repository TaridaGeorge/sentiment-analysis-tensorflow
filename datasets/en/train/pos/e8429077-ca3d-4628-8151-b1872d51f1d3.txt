After moving into a foreclosed home, we needed help getting the pool up and running. Doug came out to cleanup the pool, teach us to run the equipment, backwash the pool, balance the chemicals. He has since been back out to fix some broken equipment. In between visits I have called him multiple times with questions and he always is very patient, taking time to walk me through the steps needed to address the problem. I would recommend Desert Gator Pool Service to any one in need of help. They are honest, knowledgeable, quick to respond to phone calls and service requests and they are friendly as well. We feel very well taken care of with their services.
