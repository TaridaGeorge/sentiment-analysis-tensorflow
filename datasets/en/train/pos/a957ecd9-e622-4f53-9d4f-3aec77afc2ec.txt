This place is truly 5 star worthy. Every drink I've had here has been top notch, from their margaritas, to their mojitos, to their gin and tonics made with Hendricks gin. Perfection. Their food is just as good. The cornbread is a must, I get it everytime I go, and the fish is always fresh and perfectly cooked. The menu is only a page long, but everything they offer is top notch.  If you'be been meaning to try this place, get on it, you won't regret it!
