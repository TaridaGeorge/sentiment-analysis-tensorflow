Visiting from Texas, stuck in a mediocre hotel.  Checked Yelp and saw this local Tempe pizza joint as highly rated.  Ordered delivery and had a nice, smiling and polite gent deliver within the hour. 

The salad was great and the pizza was awesome.  I got a small pepperoni and mushroom, thin crust.  The crust was just a little sweet - not too light and not too heavy.  It was the perfect compliment to the awesome cheese and sauce.  I don't know what mushrooms they use, but they were not supermarket white mushrooms. 

I wish we had one in Austin - seriously.
