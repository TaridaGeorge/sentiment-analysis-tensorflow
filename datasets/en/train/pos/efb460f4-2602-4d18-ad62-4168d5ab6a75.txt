Best Tavern in the valley.  Wonderful food, great staff and management and fun crowds.  Kid friendly if it's a family night and an even better happy hour/dinner spot for the adults.  They make you feel at home everytime you visit.  My family gets to AT any chance we get.  Love the place.  Tracy always pays us a visit we come in - nice touch and sign of appreciation.  Great job AT!
