I think Luke's is great.  Best Italian beef I've had in the valley.  

I moved here from Chicago about 4 years ago and although I haven't been on a mad hunt the whole time, I have had some disappointing beefs.  Luke's is by far the best I've had.  

I think the best value is to buy a pound of beef and peppers from Luke's and cook it at home.  You have to buy your own bread, I like sub rolls.  The preparation is easy; just simmer in a pot on real low heat.  Then you can make em as juicy and messy, or dry as you like.  I find buying a pound will feed 3-4 and it's cheaper.

I haven't had anything else there.
