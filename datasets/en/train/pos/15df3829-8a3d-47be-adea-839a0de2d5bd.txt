Where I had the most delicious thing I ever put in my mouth.

This is a favorite of me and my friends, especially for sunday morning brunch. I would say we go at least one time a week. Their Quiche (especially the Goat cheese, caramelized onions, and wallnuts) is the best you will ever have and their salad dressing (which is made in house) is equally delicious. The most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my whole life was actually a rose macaroon. I have never had an emotional reaction to a food item before but I swear I almost cried and had flashbacks of my childhood being at the botanical gardens. Any way, if you haven't been here you HAVE to go. Its one of Arizona's few authentic cultural treasures.
