We went again last night and I ordered the chimi plate. We got home and I opened the box and my eyes almost popped out of my skull at how ginormous it was! I got the shredded beef and it tasted as good as it looked. I think the whole plate was something like $6.25 or so, which is an awesome deal for the portion. Plus they put sour cream, cheese, lettuce, pico, and guac on it which is usually extra at other places. I definitely recommend it!
