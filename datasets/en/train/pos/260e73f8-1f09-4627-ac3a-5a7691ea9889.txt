Ah, Chicago Pizza! It's been four months and this was a slice of heaven. You people from Chicago know what I'm talking about. We ran into this by accident and we just had lunch, but we had to go in and order a pizza anyways. Yes, we ate the whole thing. The crust was a little different but I'm not complaining one bit. Loved it!
