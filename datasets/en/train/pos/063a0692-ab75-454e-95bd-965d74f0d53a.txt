Ahhh.... The Gilbert Farmer's Market!

This is a weekly stop for me. I'm still shocked at how much better locally grown produce is! I'm definitely a convert from the big box produce sections! The GFM's use of social media really gets the word out and the market has grown because of it! Kudos go out to the Gilbert Farmer's Market's organizers!

Green beans & brussel sprouts are MUST gets when in season! Large loaves of bread along with some aged smokey cheddar cheese are the beginnings of one of the most amazing paninis you'll ever eat!

Seriously, if you're in Gilbert on Saturday mornings, hit up the GFM! While you're there, have some breakfast from one of the gourmet food trucks that attend! Their food is ridiculous!!
