New concept of fast food Sushi ... you make your own ... going through a fast line, you pick your rice, wrap  ( seaweed or soy paper), 3 vegetables, then your meat or fish.   Entire process takes about 2 minutes, and ends up with delicious custom sushi.

Portions very filling, staff friendly, and place spotless.    Price very reasonable.   Definitely going back!
