Brandy is amazing. She always know how I want my hair to look and always turns out perfect. I always feel like I'm getting an expensive salon treatment at half the cost. When you finally find that one hair dresser it makes the experience without worry. If you are new to the Gilbert area, I hope you find this review helpful when looking for a new hair stylist.
