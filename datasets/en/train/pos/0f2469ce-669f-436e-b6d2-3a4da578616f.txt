I haven't had the opportunity to pass out here, drunk, yet.... but it's on the the to do list! I love the that they have GB as the "hotel restaurant". how can you beat that? um...with an epic pool party and a roof top bar. that's how. when you combine all 3 things, you get an awesome hotel experience. topped off with friendly staff. its like an ice cream Sunday, complete with cherry, for adults. I'll be here this summer for many pool parties. when i stay here, I'll update my review as well.
