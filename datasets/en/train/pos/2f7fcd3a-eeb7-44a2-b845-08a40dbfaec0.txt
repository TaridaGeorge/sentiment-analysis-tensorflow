I finally had the opportunity to try out this place for lunch today.  I really enjoyed it.  The food was great and I found the service to be excellent.  Our waiter was the cutest guy too.  He was very helpful and cordial and kept our iced tea glasses continually filled.  

I had the miniature sandwiches.  There were three little ones and I chose roast beef, chicken salad and turkey.  Yummy!  My friend had the chicken salad and seemed to really like it.  The place is located in a renovated older home and I think they've done a great job.

I would love to return to try some other items on the menu, especially the meatballs.
