Green is by far one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.  My husband loves it too and he is a carnivore!  Our favorite things to get are the "boneless buffalo wings" and something that another customer shared with me while waiting in line that is not on the menu "the Wendy's pickle sandwich" It is amazing!  Another special they have from time to time is "the big WAC" and I must say it is better than the real thing!!!!!
