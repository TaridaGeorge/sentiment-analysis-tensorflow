I have gone to see Judee (owner) for the past two years for Halloween costume rentals with outstanding results.  I've gone to her with ideas for costumes and she's not only been agreeable to making them from scratch, but has executed them wonderfully.  It's been a win win for both of us.  She gets to add to her already extensive collection of handmade costume rentals and I get to wear a fabulous and well crafted costume to WOW people with.  In addition to Judee's warm and inviting personality, she has talent beyond measure.  Every party and club I go to, dressed in her hand made costumes receives praise and admiration.  Did I mention she also provides accessories, wigs, shoes etc?  Paradise Fabrics & Costumes is a hidden gem and I will continue to be a customer for a long time to come.
