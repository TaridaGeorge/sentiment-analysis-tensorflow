The Tempe Pita Jungle is basically a who's who of the local music scene. When I was dining on my lunch break this afternoon, I counted 10 musicians in the restaurant from Valley bands. It's also the Casey Moore's of restaurants -- meaning you'll probably run into someone you know there 9 times out of 10. And the food is amazing. The hummus is delicious and the Pita Pizza, which is topped with lettuce, hearty tomatoes and feta cheese over a pita, is out of this world. The service can be spotty but it's worth it for the food.
