Andrea has been a lifesaver- literally! She was watching over our furry monsters when our AC went out  in July and we were across the country. She not only made an extra visit just to see if the AC was broken, but helped us find an open kennel to get our cats boarded. She's been our creature sitter several times now, thankfully with less craziness.

Her rates are very reasonable and she keeps in great contact with you. Her initial visit with us went over all the little things we wanted done (like picking up the paper and bringing it in) and was very thorough. Since she offers a full house sitter and pet sitter menu of services, she's knows things to cover that we had not thought of! She's very professional and is licensed and insured. 

Your animals will thank you!
