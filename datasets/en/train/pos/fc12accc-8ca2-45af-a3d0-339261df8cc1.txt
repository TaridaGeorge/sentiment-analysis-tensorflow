this is such a great bar. they have beer, they have pool, they have that funny sliding disk game, music, dancing and part of it is even open air. 

every time we have a cruiser pub ride we come here. the crowd is laid back and relaxed and always out to have a good time. you can wear your affliction t-shirt or the cargo pants you wore while painting the house, it doesn't matter. easy walking distance to any food places to grease that beer gut. always fun, always patties!
