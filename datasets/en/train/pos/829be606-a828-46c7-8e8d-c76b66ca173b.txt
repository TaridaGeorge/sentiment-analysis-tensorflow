I sometimes forget how much I like The Rhythm Room. We went to another show last night - Griffin House - and instantly felt like we were part of VH1's Behind the Music. It's such an intimate venue, the acoustics are fantastic and it's set up just perfectly. You're a handshake away from the band, the bartenders are great, the drinks are cheap and the big patio is perfect for breaks and fresh air between sets. Take a chance on an artist you've never seen (tickets are typically cheap) and try out this Phoenix gem - totally a part of history. It's pretty fun to think about all the blues artists who've played throughout the years.
