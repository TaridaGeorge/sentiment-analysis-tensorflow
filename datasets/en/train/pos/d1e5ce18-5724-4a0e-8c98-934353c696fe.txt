Love. 

The building is great, minimal but in a comfy way and not overdone in an austere fussy kinda way. Nice outdoor seating with a yummay fireplace...Like it here, did I mention that?? 

Service was attentive and friendly. I ordered the duck club and for a side told the waiter to surprise me. He brought me delicious french fries with light parmesan cheese and parsley and were to die for. The sandwich was similarly deiish. Duck breast with a sweet, smoky tomato sauce and some applewood smoked bacon that were sandwiched between a soft, challah type roll that was a perfect foil for what was in the middle; light and lucious and not too much bread. 

It's in my work 'hood but not my neighborhood, even so, made an immediate report to the lovely: must go!!
