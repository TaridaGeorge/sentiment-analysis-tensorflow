Dear Yogurtland,

You are my truest love in Arizona. You always manage to satisfy. You can cheer me up when I am down. You make me crave the perfectly sweet, but not overdone flavors and toppings. You make me fall in love all over again, every time.

Your employees are friendly and adorable. Your flavors are just the right amount of sweet and tangy. Your toppings are always fresh, clean, and crunchy. Your fruit-flavored water always quenches my thirst. Your yogurt is to die for.

I especially love your perfectly sweet Tart because it mixes with anything. I love when you have Mint because it is my favorite color green. I love how I can shamelessly enjoy the NY Cheesecake. I love your seasonal, delicious, fruity flavors! I love your juicy kiwi and strawberry toppings.

I just love you, Yogurtland!!!!
