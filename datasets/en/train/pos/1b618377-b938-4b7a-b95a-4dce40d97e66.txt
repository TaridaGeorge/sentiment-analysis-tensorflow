Being from Nebraska, I can taste a good steak from a mile away. Up until visiting Dominick's last night, I had not eaten a good steak since moving to the Valley three years ago. The flavor, texture, presentation and everything about Dominick's steaks, along with all of their other dishes, is phenomenal. The staff really knows how to make each person feel like an elite and the ambience surrounding the restaurant is fabulous as well. I can't wait to make a reservation for pool-side dining underneath the stars up on the second floor next time!
