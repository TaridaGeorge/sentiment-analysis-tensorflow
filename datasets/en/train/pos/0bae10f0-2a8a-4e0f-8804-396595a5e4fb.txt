Remember those cool glasses you saw your colleague/friend/date/hot waiter wearing the other day that made you rethink your contact lenses?

Chances are they got them at Sassy.  Sassy Glasses is THE place to go if you want unique and cool frames in any style, from 'button down business' to 'far-outfunky', at a variety of price points.  The owners are knowledgeable and attentive, and most importantly, patient, which is nice, because the offer so many styles to choose from.

Even better Sassy is  a locally owned, independent business, so more of your hard earned money stays in town.  The only downside is that they don't take insurance (directly) and have no optometrist on site, or close by, although they will refer you to one)
