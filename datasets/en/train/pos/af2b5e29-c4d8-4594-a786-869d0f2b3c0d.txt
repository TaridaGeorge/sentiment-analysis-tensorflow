A big part of any wireless provider is the customer service. I recently switched to AT&T and ran into a snafu right out of the gate--so I crossed my fingers and headed to this store. 

Walking in the door, I was greeted by a handful of friendly employees eager to help me. A family came in while I was being served and they were treated just as well. Within 5 minutes, I was in and out, my problem was solved, and the employees had answered a couple additional questions I had. 

Definitely an improvement over the clueless stoners at Big Magenta Phone Corp, and it definitely started our relationship off on the right foot.
