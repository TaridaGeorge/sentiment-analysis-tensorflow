I almost didn't try this fast casual restaurant because the name struck me as pretentious.  What a mistake that would have been!  I got together with Norm R. for lunch here today, & my sandwich was a "Sack's Symphony", which consisted of turkey breast, bacon, avocado, tomato, alfalfa sprouts, cream cheese & mayonnaise, piled up on good-sized slices of 12-grain bread.  It was sooooooo good!!!  So was the "Oriental Noodle Salad" that I started with.  On top of that, they snuck the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever eaten in with my order!  The dining area is nice too, & the staff is friendly.  I really love this place!!     :-))

Sack's Symphony $5.99, Oriental Noodle Salad $1.05 (!), super good cookie, free!!
