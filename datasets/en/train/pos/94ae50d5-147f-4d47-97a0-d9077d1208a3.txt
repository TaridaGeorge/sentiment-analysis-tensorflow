Heather Wilson was an absolute blast to work with on my wedding day! She did an AMAZING job on me and my bridesmaids...we all looked like more beautiful versions of ourselves, very natural but with that little something extra every girl wants on her wedding day! I hired Heather for the whole day, and she went above and beyond the duties of a makeup artisit....providing us with safety pins for dresses, hairspray for flyways, and just making sure we all looked picture perfect. She was worth every penny! I will be recommending her to all of my friends!
