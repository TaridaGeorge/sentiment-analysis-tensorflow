Wow. Just Wow.

I have never seen so many items in one place that are new and exciting. My husband and I usually go to Asiana up on Union Hills and this is a pretty cool place, and we go to New Tokyo (and still will for our sushi fish), but this place has just about everything you can think of.

Japanese
Middle Eastern
Thai

African

If you can't find your specialty item here, I am not sure it exists.
Plus they have a Pho place I didn't try, but I did try the Boba bar.

Passion-fruit Boba...nuff said...DO IT

We purchased items to make Yellow Curry, Sushi, Crab Puffs, and enough snacks and flavored Sake and Wine to have a party.

I will be excited to try this place again.
