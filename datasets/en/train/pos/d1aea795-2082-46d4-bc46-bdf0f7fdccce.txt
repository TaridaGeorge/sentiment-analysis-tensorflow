What the... I came to this page to send the URL to someone to show them how awesome CPC is, and Yelp was waving the Write Review button at me. I haven't done this already?

Weird. Maybe I just love CPC so much I thought the sheer force of my gastrointestinal passion for the place would write the review for me. Apparently not. But my love for this place abounds.

I'm not a veggietarian, but I do like a good veggie dish when available. CPC has a fantastic line of veggie pasties that many carnivores like just fine. Try the classic Oggie and Bangers & Mash, or my fave the Tikka Marsala.  They have several tasty beers on tap to keep any spicy choices under control, so cut loose!
