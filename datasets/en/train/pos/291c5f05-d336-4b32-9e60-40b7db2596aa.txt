Awesome idea!  We stumbled across this gem while we were next door at the wine bar.  We saw a couple drinking a six pack at the grocery store's outdoor seating and thought - we're so there!  Not only is it a quaint local grocery store but they also serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Their baked goods from breakfast to desserts all looked delicious and unique.  We tried their pizza - which was very good - light crust and not super oily.  We also shared their hostess like cupcake - so good.  And of course beer!  I'd love to come back for breakfast as their english muffins are fresh and to die for.
