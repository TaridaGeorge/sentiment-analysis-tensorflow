This is a great choice for dinner on Mill. The atmosphere is casual, but a nice casual - definitely a nicer place than some of the other "college inspired" places on Mill. We shared a plate of brushetta and a pizza and both were great. They have a great selection of wine as well. 

The service was great - very attentive and helpful. 

Went to LaBocca in December (sorry, a bit behind on my reviews).
