What is great about this place is that well there are several reasons it's Dairy Queen without the guilt ........ it's Churn without the cost...... It's the Pink spot without the walk "for me anyway's"and last but not least I can patronize my friend Dana M.( Hula's Modern Tiki) even if I don't have time to sit down for dinner and drinks............ Til next time
