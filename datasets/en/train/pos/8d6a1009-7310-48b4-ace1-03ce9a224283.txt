This place was easy to drive by. It's right next to a small auto repair place. Parking is in back. Place was empty on Tues at lunchtime.  Jasmine iced tea was  nice starter. Spring rolls & dipping sauce is quite yummy! My lunch was a round rice noodle with bean sprouts and super tender pieces of beef. There was a fabulous sauce on the dish. Not too heavy or spicey. Great taste! If you like any type of asian food, try this place! Reasonably priced too! Most people have no clue what Camboian food is like. this stuff is really good! Friendly staff too.
