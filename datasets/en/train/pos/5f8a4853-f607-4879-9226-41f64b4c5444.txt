Had a great time. Of COURSE no pizza is worth a 5 hour wait.  The wait was part of the outing.  We sat at the bar and got shitty and ate olives.  Any pizza at this point is Divine.  This is not where you go when you are hungry.  This is where you go when you meet new people in Phoenix and want to do something interesting.  A "once in a great while" worth trying experience.
