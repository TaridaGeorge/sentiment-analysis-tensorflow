This place rocks!!  ...especially if you're used to east coast bagels!   Where else can you get 2 bacon egg and cheese breakfast bagel sandwiches plus a large drink big enough for two and all for $9!!  Plus they use Boar's Head bacon there...so it's not that thin nasty bacon you find elsewhere. Their everything bagels are the best in town. I highly recommend this place and it's worth waiting if there's a line. The owner and workers are all friendly, which makes for a good atmosphere.  My only complaint is that they need more tables ...maybe they should buy the sub shop next to them and expand.
