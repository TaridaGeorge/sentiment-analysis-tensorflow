Pizza is pizza is pizza is pizza, right? And all Oregano's are the same, right?

Not always the case. There is shitty pizza, and then there is good pizza. Oregano's falls under the good pizza category. And yes, the quality of the food is pretty much the same at each location, there are certain things that make this location stand out from say, the old town location.

Like easy parking. Getting a seat within 15 minutes. An abundance of outdoor seating (Old town has outdoor seating too, but Shea has more). Managers that come around to each table to make sure everything is cool.

Little things that make everything stand out.

Not all pizza is created equal. And for that matter, neither are Oregano's.
