This is the best dessert place in Surprise. Great ice, great service, and very clean.

I recommend the mango chocolate gelati which is a combination of mango flavored ice with chocolate custard. Yum! 

It's lighter, yet more satisfying than Cold Stone, and a fraction of the cost! They change their flavors daily, but you can sign up with your favorite flavors and get an alert when they have it. I'm a big fan of their fruit flavors - Mango, banana, pear, and cherry. Root beer with vanilla is also delicious, but isn't available as often as some of the others. 

I tried their cakes for the first time this weekend. I was disappointed to learn they didn't make them in the store (like they do the ice), but the cakes tasted great and all of my party guests enjoyed it.
