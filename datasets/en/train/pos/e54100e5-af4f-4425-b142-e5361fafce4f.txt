I had forgotten about this place until I went to the Biltmore the other day.  It's such a fun place to go, with or without someone else and they have delicious sandwiches, salads and of course, wine!  

They have a huge wine selection, and I highly recommend getting a bottle when you're here.  As for food, I love the grilled vegetable tart, the veggie sandwich and the Mediterranean focaccia.  All are very good.

Their prices are definitely reasonable too.  It's a great place to read a book or people watch- or both!
