I love this store!  I wish it was closer to me, but is worth the trek over to Old Town Glendale.  The first time I went there I was blown away by all the cute things they had at very affordable prices.  I literally had to do a double take at a top I was going to try on that I was expecting to be around $60-$70 and was only $15!!!  Amazing, amazing selection.  There is also a children's section, where I got my son some second had shoes for $3!  So awesome, I will definitely be back.
