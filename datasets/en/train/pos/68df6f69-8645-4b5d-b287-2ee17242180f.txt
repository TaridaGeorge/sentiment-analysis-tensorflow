OK, I am a little concerned that I am spending so much time here...but I can't HELP it!  It is so perfectly between club scene and dive bar scene, neither of which I am a fan.  It's new without being pretentious; it's energetic without being loud.  I like it!  I like the location.  I like the people (both the people who work there and the people who play there).  I like the prices.  And I love the vibe!
