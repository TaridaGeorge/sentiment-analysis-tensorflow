I absolutely ADORE everything about Modern Steak.  You can't go wrong with a Sam Fox creation (unless it's Culinary Dropout), and this is my very favorite of all of his restaurants.  

I'm a big steak and potatoes kind of girl, and the sweet potatoes are absolutely fantastic.  I crave them, and find myself choosing Modern Steak over its main competition, Mastro's City Hall, most of the time solely because of these marshmallow slathered, little gems. Their crab appetizer served in a little glass jar of pure, truffled heaven is also "to die for".  

Although it is a part of Fashion Square Mall, you'd never know it.  The ambiance is refreshing and beautiful.  

If you enjoy fine dining and price isn't an issue for you, then you must go.  It truly is one of my favorite spots...
