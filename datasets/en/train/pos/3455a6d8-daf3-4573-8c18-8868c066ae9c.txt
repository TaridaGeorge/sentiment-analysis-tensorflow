This is my first ever Yelp review and it is well overdue. I chose Jon to do my business head shots earlier this year and could not be happier with the results! Prior to shooting, I was nervous not only to be in front of the camera but also nervous about how well the pictures would turn out, as I do not consider myself to be photogenic (my main facebook photos are of the back of my head and my dog). However, Jon has the professionalism and friendliness to put even the most novice subject at ease - and he took so many great shots that it was hard for me to narrow down my prints! The quality of Jon's photos and personal service was far beyond what I would have expected.
