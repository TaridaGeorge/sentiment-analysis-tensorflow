I love this safeway, the staff is very nice and helpful and help you locate stuff and we found a 200 corkscrew on the back clearance table for 17.50...and also we bought a bunch of boxes of health food cereal for 50% off, so it was 2 bucks a box and i also got some hair color and some hair shine treatment back there all half off...good day at Safeway!! Always has been, always will be.
