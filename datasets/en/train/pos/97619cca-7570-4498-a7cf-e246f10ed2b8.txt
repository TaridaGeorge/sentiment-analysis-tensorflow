FANTASTICO....
The absolute best pastrami in the valley.... Really.... Better than any.... Great subs. Husband had the Italian. Son had the "George" It was Fab... The flavors... The meat... The breads... The lettuce... The dressing.... Everything was fresh and fab... I had the Pastrami.... New York style. WOW..... Mom had the greek salad which was great. Shared some cannolis etc. and the Napolean Piece. Sweetness was perfect. Did not feel sooo rich that we were bloated. Just the perfect flavor and perfect amount of richness. Love the atmosphere.... Loved the store.
