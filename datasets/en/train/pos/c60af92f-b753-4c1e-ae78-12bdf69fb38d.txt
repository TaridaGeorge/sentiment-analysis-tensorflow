Still my favorite brewery/pub. They have some of my favorite beers in the world and some of the best food in the state. 8th street is an awesome standby, but Hop Knot is my favorite. They make some amazing seasonal beers. 

Be forewarned, it's locals only during the summer. There is no AC in the place, but only fans. It's actually my favorite time to go. Less college kids and more of the beer drinkers.
