Bunna coffee is my local coffee house.  The owners are lovely, the coffee is tasty and served beautifully in wonderful big mugs, and the food and service are always and dependably great too.  Despite it being housed in a strip mall (and what isn't in the valley, right?) the ambiance here is charming and I generally linger longer than necessary due to the relaxed feeling I get while sipping my yummy espresso drinks.  Also, the coffee is fair trade, which makes it worth 5 stars.
