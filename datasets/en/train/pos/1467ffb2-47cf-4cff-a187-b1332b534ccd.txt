I live in Tempe and the Farmhouse is hands down my favorite breakfast place in the valley.
 The staff is always very nice, they even often remember my boyfriend and I from previous visits. 
Their food is all (I think all) homemade including their gigantic cinnamon rolls that are out of this world, their biscuits that are so fluffy and good and their sausage patties that are done just right.
The portions are very large so you will never leave here hungry.
The atmosphere is laid back with a kind of quaintness about it.
The only bad thing is the wait on the weekends, but if you plan ahead and get in line before you're totally starving it's SO worth the wait.
