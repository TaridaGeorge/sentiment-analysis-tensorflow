An australian theme place with a real nice atmosphere. The staff was very attentive and pleasant. I ordered the pulled pork, ostrich, kangaroo sliders, crocodile pot stickers, bruschetta and the beef and guinness stew.
All the food was excellent and my personal favorite was the Stew. One of the owners "Raul" was very pleasant, he made sure everyone in the place was taken care of.  The prices were extremely fair considering the high quality of food and service.
