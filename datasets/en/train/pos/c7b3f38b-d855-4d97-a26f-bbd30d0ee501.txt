My team of 54 people left well fed and commening on how effecient and friendly the wait staff were. With our large group they worked with us on price and selection. Way too much food in the end. The shrimp brochette over tender and spicy dirty rice- excellent. I hated the fact that I ate soo much of my key lime pie but even though I was bursting at the seams I couldn't help myself. Good food. Good service. Very pleasant atmosphere.
