I went here the second time that I got my nose pierced. They were very informative. I didn't know that they suggest having them change the ring instead of fighting to put a new one in. 
After having my rings a month I lost it. I went in and they gave me the discounted jewelry price and put the ring back in . No problem. I started getting a little bump and was told that I needed to soak it in warm salt water more often. he was right. the bump is gone....it took a month, but its gone.
I highly recommend HTC!
