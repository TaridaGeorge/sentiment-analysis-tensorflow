I have used On-Time to replace A/C units on rental properties and repairs to my own home system.  The guys come out on time, of course, evaluate honestly, give an estimate, give you CHOICES and recommendations, don't try to "hard sell", work professionally and efficiently, leave a system operating properly, and have never had to come back to fix their work.  And the follow-up and customer service from the staff at On Time has made us very happy.  When we have a question, they care!  They make sure you get what you paid for.  I'm a Realtor and offer On Time as my top choice for A/C service companies to my clients with confidence.
