This place is super awesome! Lamb and Mint was delicious, I recommend trying something new each time... I received excellent service, and every staff member I encountered was unique and friendly; and really seemed to fit in with the "mood" of the place.

Seating inside is a little awkward, I believe there's just a bunch of pews lined up and from time to time you'll get sat right next to a family that likes to use their elbows.

Deserts are to die for: Try the Peanut Butter and Jelly Pasty!
