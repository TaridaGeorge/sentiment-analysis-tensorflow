I have been back two times in the last 2 months. The slices were large and tasted great. Not Like Before. 

I had a pasta dish (Chicken with red and white sauce combined) and while it was a tad boring it was executed as they said it would be, I guess I needed something with some kick that day. Still giving a 5 star review because they deserve it. 

Lunch service is quick and servers can be fun.
