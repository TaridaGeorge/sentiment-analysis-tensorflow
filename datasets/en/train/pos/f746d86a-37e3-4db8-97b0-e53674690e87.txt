First off, Rocky, the owner, is such a nice guy! I bought a dozen Bundtinis (Red Velvet, Lemon,  White White Chocolate, and something else) for another meeting i was going to.

I travel a lot for work and am always looking for new 'goodies' to bring in to the meeting we are having. The small Bundtinis were perfect! Super moist, the frosting is amazing and the bite-sized cakes are impossible for anyone to pass up.

Wonderful service and the next time I'm in Phoenix I will definitely be coming back to this establishment.

Thanks Rocky.
