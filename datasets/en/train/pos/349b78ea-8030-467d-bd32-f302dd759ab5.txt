I LOVE TARGET!!!!!  

Ok, now that I have that out of my system, lets review why I love this one so much.

A) its target and they carry everything
B) thier awesome
C) I want to buy everything in sight, despite the fact that I only came in here to get shampoo
D) its organized!

Aside from parking, this is one of the better targets around, but the parking sucks here, so beware.  Go and shop your heart out...
