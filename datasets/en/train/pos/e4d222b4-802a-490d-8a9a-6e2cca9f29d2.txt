The Baristas Justin and Anthony make my day everytime I go there. They are so cute!!! I love starbucks but the fact that this one has a drive through makes it all the better. I like how they know me by my voice or my order. There is one guy there that creeps me out... He is an older guy with this weird stalker voice. 

It does get crowded in the morning though... But they get you in and out fairly quickly. BTW did I mention how ridiculously good looking Justin is? He's the Barista with that wonderful smile.

Can't wait to go there tomorrow morning!!!

My drink of choice: Iced Venti Americano no water lite ice and sometimes I get a splash of soy if I am feeling like being on the crazy side.
