Let me start off by saying: I'm a New York girl who loves her NY Chinese. Thick egg roles, big meaty spare ribs - you get the drift. After moving to the southwest I had to give up my two loves, real pizza and tasty Chinese...

UNTIL I DISCOVERED GOLDEN GATE CHINESE on Baseline in Mesa!

GOOD LORD! THICK egg rolls! HOT & SOUR soup with a generous amount of heat and spice. GARLIC CHICKEN THAT CAN NOT BE BEAT! And the owner, Sue, has been there for 23 years - her chef has been with her for 22 of those years. This is, far and away, the BEST CHINESE FOOD I HAVE EATEN WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI.

RUN, don't walk, to GOLDEN GATE!
