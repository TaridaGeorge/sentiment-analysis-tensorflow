Kathy was amazing. She did a wonderful job with my wedding dress. She took it up a few inches, made the bustling for the back and also took off a whole bunch of beads and crystals that would have thrashed the inside of my biceps if she had not noticed and know it might do that.

She is experienced, reasonably priced and super nice. She's also a very busy lady, so it's not recommended to call last minute.
