Had a great breakfast here.  The biscuits & gravy were better than you usually find this side of the Mississippi.  The gravy was seasoned just right and had plenty of sausage in it.  The biscuits were fresh but just dense enough to provide a good foil for the gravy.  The accompanying bacon was crisp & delicious.

Coffee was surprisingly good--much better than you usually get at restaurants like this.

The service was excellent & friendly--my coffee cup never got close to empty.

I look forward to returning and trying some of the southwest specialties.

Oh yeah, in the interest of full disclosure, my cousins own and manage the place but I take breakfast too seriously to give false praise.  If I hadn't loved my breakfast, I just wouldn't have written a review.  Nick says go forth and enjoy a great breakfast!
