FANTASTIC Happy Hour (HH).

Affordable. Delicious. And a great selection. 

The steak tartare with quail egg is my go to pick. 

Great view of Camelback mountain if you sit on the patio... Though with the upcoming summer months, that sounds pretty miserable. Nevertheless, the bar area is great. Huge chairs and a classy, laid back vibe. 

Service tends to be pretty slow. I've been a handful of times for HH and it seems like there's only 1 server scheduled to handle the HH crowd. When you sit down, quickly look at the menu and order your drink when the server comes by... Otherwise you might be waiting a bit for your drinks and nibbles. 

The wait is worth it !
