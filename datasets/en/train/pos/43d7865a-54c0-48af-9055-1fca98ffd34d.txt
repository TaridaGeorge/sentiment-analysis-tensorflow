I have been seeing Dr. Grossbard over the past eight years. He is a wonderful vet who is honest and lets the owner decide the course for the patient. I have never felt pressured to buy anything extra or do any unnecessary procedure. I think that Dr. Grossbard does a great job explaining problems and the potential outcomes. And when I make a choice I feel supported by him.
