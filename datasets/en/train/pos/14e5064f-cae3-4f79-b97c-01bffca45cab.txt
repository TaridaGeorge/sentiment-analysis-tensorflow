I have used K-9 Games for both training and boarding for some years now and have been completely satisfied with both areas of service. My dog has had both behavioral and health issues, both of which have ranged beyond my knowledge and abilities as a long-time dog owner. The staff at K-9 Games has helped me not only address these issues, but, more importantly, helped me better understand the behavioral issues and my role in them. I've become a better dog owner and I today have a bond with my dog I never thought possible.
