This is a great gelato place.  They have  a pretty good selection of gelato, and the staff is very nice. The flavor and smoothness of the gelato was awesome. I've had gelato that has been more icy then creamy, this is SO not the case.  I will DEFINITELY be back to try other flavors. It is in the same area as Zen 32 and they share the parking problem. (I went on a weekend night, so that just might be a bad time) You can also check out their "Flavors of the Month Calender" @ gelatospot.com.  Also in case this matters to anyone, they have wifi.
