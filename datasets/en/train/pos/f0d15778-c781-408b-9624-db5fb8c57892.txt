I once had a friend who dreamt of cheeseburgers. In fact, she described that in her dream she was standing in front of a hotel made out of a cheesburger! Drippy cheesy goodness made up the swaying curtains that pulled away from the windows. Each condiment represented a different floor of the building--and that it smelled like the bestest cheeseburger ever! 

The day I ate a Culvers Double Butter Burger with Bacon, I knew exactly what she was saying! Buttery Delicious Goodness are the words that come to mind! And... after surviving on a 500 cal/day diet for 3 weeks I even admit to having dreamt of a cheeseburger to this caliber! 

The custard is fab--the customer service is the best you'll see at a fast food place--its your down-home kinda joint--for every family to enjoy! Go in deep---and you'll come out smiling everytime at Culvers!!! :-)
