This is my favorite brunch spot in Scottsdale.  UPDATE as of 1/7/13:  Came here for my anniversary and they set us up at a fire pit, and provided a bouquet of roses in a vase AND a bottle of water FREE of charge.  And after all that, the server was shocked when I gave him a really good tip.  Easily the best customer service I've EVER experienced at a restaurant.  If I could give this place 10 stars, I would.  The Wildberry Pancakes are unbelievable, as are their mimosas and bacon.  In the words of my girlfriend, "we should come here every month for the rest of our lives."
