I was looking up papa johns to order some pizza and I saw some really bad reviews on google so I was second guessing ordering from here but my friend from to Tucson and says they have really good pizza so I order the pizza anyway and it was the best pizza I've ever had! ( they were saying they got sick and they were throwing up and not only on just 1 review) I don't know what the people on google were talking about but I will definitely be ordering pizza from papa johns again!
