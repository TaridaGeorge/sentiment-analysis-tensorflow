Yogurtland is sooo tasty!!!

 They are so much better than mojo. Let me give you a few examples why:
1. They have cut up bananas in the topping section. Everytime I would go to Mojo they would ALWAYS be out of bananas. No joke. I think it's because they have to cut them as customers request them (no banana topping container) and they're just too lazy.

2. Cheaper. 

3. PLAIN TART. Nuff' said.

4. Ghirardelli syrups.

5. More toppings.

6. Their mochi isn't flavored, which is a good thing. Mojo's creepy lime and strawberry mochi tastes too artificial.

 Yogurtland rocks!
