Prior to eating at Grimaldi's Pizza in Peoria I was a fan of the Scottsdale location. I was very excited to learn that a location would be opening up near our home.

This is the best pizza that I've had in the Valley, hands down. We always order a large Pepperoni Pizza with the occasional purchase of a White Pizza. We've also ordered salads and and antipasto and have been pleased every time.

The crust is thin and a little chewy and the quality of the toppings come shining through.

No, the pizza isn't weighed down with tons of toppings, there are enough toppings for every part of the pizza to sing.
