I am a sushi snob.

I live in Chicago, but used to live in NYC.  This sushi spot has NO BUSINESS being in Arizona. It could hold its own in NYC, and certainly would stand out among the best in Chicago.  Yasu is a very serious contender against any sushi spot you can think of. I would recommend this as a terrific spot for sushi snobs, no matter where they hail from.
