My girlfriend and I went to Avanti tonight for an anniversary dinner.  It was because of Oscar, a 12 year veteran of the 37 year old restuarant, that we had such an incredible experience.  His thick Italian accent was a great kick off to the experience.  He not only helped steer me between two wines I couldn't choose between, but he also placed the bottle far enough from our reach to make sure that he was the one topping us every time.  He made impeccable recommendations on the menu, and timed the delivery of our food, dessert, and check perfectly.  We felt important; not rushed.  I made sure to ask for his weekly schedule before I left so that I make sure he is there to wait on us for future visits.
