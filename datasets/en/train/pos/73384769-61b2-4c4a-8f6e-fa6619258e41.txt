I've never actually stayed at the Biltmore, but I've had many dinners here, as well as attended many wine tastings and alcohol conventions. All were fabulous.

The hotel is impressive, from the attentive and helpful staff to the modern decor.  I have also had a few massages at the spa and they've all been amazing.  Everyone is so professional and they cater to your every desire.

The pool area looks great- I always see people out there relaxing with a tropical drink.  I've never heard of anyone having a bad experience while staying here and it's in a good location. If you are looking for a nice hotel to stay at, definitely check this one out!
