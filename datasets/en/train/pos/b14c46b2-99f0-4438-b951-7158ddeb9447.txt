I love love love The Keg!! Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!), amazing happy hour, and delicious drinks!!! Can't say enough about this place! Since the first time I went, I've been addicted and have had EVERY special event diner there since... college graduation, anniversaries, birthdays, etc!!
