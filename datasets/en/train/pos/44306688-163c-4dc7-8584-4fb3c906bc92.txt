Best mall ever! Growing up in Scottsdale, I have watched as SFS has expanded into the super mall that it is today. The great thing is the size - you can skip cardio that day and instead power shop the entire mall for a couple hours and leave with lots of goodies, it's a win-win situation!  

 According to Wikipedia...

Scottsdale Fashion Square is the largest shopping mall in Arizona and the American Southwest, with approximately 2 million square feet of retail space, and is among the top 30 largest malls in the country. It is one of the top 10 most profitable malls in the country with over $740 sales per square foot, more than $400 over the national average.
