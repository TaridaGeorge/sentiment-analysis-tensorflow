We went around 8 am on a Thursday, and we had immediate seating. The coffee was amazing. We had the eggs benedict, which were quite good and the hashbrowns were extremely crisp. I had the waffles which melted in my mouth. The batter was not salty but sweet. We were really impressed. Matt's has a tiny parking lot next to the building but parking can be a problem.
