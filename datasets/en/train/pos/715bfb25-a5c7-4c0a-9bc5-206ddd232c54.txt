These people can cut hair. I have lived, and visited all over the west coast and it is hard to find people who can cut hair good. All the barbers here can cut hair great. They are super friendly, professional and consistently turn out good hair cuts. I don't usually leave feed back but, felt compelled to because of Eric B, who gave them one star for being closed on Mondays! Wow...what does being closed regularly on Mondays have to do with rating how well they cut hair??? Haters gonna hate I guess....as far as hair cuts go. This place is five star!
