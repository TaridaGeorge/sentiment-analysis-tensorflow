well this one beats the other one in Chandler they have a few more trays and a nicer atmosphere. Everything I ate was real good from the creamy clam chowder to the desserts.This is my new favorite Chinese buffet in Arizona.A couple of things wrong were,my cake was still frozen and all the trays were not out at opening. They are new with new staff so I hope they iron out these problems quickly other than that it was a great buffet experience and I am going to put them on my top ten list for buffets.
