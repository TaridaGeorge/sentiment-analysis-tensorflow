I can't thank "Cheech" in appliances enough for the tremendous help he was to our family. If it weren't for him, I wouldn't have even known about a great sale on refrigerators. Then, after purchasing the fridge, I received several updates from Cheech via phone regarding the possible delivery of our appliance. They were really back-ordered, but I never felt like we were forgotten. This sales rep made the whole experience possible with the utmost kindness, respect, and communication. I didn't expect that kind of customer service from a "big box store," but I wouldn't buy a kitchen appliance from anyone else now. Seriously- if you need a kitchen appliance, go to the Chandler store and ask for Cheech (his real name is "Harry" if you happen to call).
