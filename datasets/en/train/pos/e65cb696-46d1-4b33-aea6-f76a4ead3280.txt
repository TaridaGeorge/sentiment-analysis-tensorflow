For 2 years, my husband and I have been wanting to go to Glendale and try Haus Murphy's...a long wait, but we were pleased with the autheticity of the food!  My husbands father is from Remscheid, Germany and so many of his summers were spent in Europe enjoying European food and Great German bier!

I give it a 5 star, the atmosphere was enjoyable, the bier garden was fun and their strudel was incredible!
