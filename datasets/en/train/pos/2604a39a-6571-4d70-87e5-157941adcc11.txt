My friend had taken me here, i have been to plenty of sushi bars and restaurants, but this one is special, this one is the best. 

First off, the prices. They are unreal fair. When i looked at the tab, I actually said, that's not bad at all. 

But more than that, the sushi is simply amazing, my unagi plate presentation was crazy, served on a sizzling plate, it defiantly had the whole restaurant staring. The crunchy tuna roll was fantastic along with the sashimi.

If you have friends that don't like sushi and have never tried it, take them here, it will make them think twice!
