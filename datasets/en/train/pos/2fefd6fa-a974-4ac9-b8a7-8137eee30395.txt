Love this place! I am addicted the crab puffs! My burger of choice is the "green" burger. I tried a little bit of everything. I enjoy the people who work there, they are very nice. I also tried the buffalo wings, but I couldn't eat them because they looked very much like real chicken and also had the texture. I don't know why but I had a hard time convincing myself it was vegan!! LOL! My b/f tried and he liked it and everyone else does too, but it freaked me out how real it looked! Everything about this place is great!! And, Nami next door makes it even better. YUM!
