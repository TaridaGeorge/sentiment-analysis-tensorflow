Scramble is my favorite place to eat with friends, family, and a good place for a business meeting that isn't at Starbucks.  I come here fairly often now and am trying anything on the menu.  

Items I'd recommend: The Gouda Brizza, the BBQ Chicken Pizza, and the French toast.

Items I'd be wary to have again: the Turkey club (compared to the above, it's just not as delicious) and the Caesar salad.  I asked for dressing on the side and got a lightly coated salad on top of a warm pizza bread at the bottom.  Also lots of croutons in this so it's carb loading - but I hate warm salads.

Items I want to try: the Vegan Breakfasts, eggs benedict, pancakes, and cinnamon rolls.  

One item I wish they had: frittatas!
