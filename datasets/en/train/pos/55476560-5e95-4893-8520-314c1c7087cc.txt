By far the best tapas in AZ. Perhaps the best tapas i have ever had. Great Spanish wine list. Wifey can eat veggie (which I can sample) but the meat dishes are out of this world. The Pollo Colonial is a must. The staff is personable and knowledgeable. The crowd, atmosphere and music make it a perfect place for eats, drinks and fun.
