Was visiting friends in Scottsdale last night and they said Ocean Club was a must experience as they made reservations without me!  They were right!!! Our server was Darin and his knowledge and attention to detail really made it an amazing experience, the wine and sides he suggested for us were out of this world and my Seabass....the best!! (the tuna was great too!!!)
