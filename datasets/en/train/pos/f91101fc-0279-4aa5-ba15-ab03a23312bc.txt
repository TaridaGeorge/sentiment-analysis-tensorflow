There is huge difference between a franchised or chain restaurant run by accountants and a restaurant run by a family focused on quality food. 

Eden's Grill definitely takes a lot of pride in preparing and serving some of the freshest and finest Mediterranean cuisine in the Valley.

The prices are reasonable with the best value, of course, at lunch time.

I highly recommend them!
