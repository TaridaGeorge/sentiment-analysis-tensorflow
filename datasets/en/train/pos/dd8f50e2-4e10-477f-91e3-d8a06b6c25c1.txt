Dear Slices Pizza,

Thank you for offering a yelp check in discount!  Also, your baked potato bacon pizza is just as good as my beloved Georgios in East Lansing Michiagn.  Thank you for using russet not red skin potatos.  The only things you were missing was a sour cream topper.  Your Gyro pizza is also the bomb, very similar to my Georgios.  I was only in town for three days, but you are one of the reasons I will make the 2 hour trip to Tempe any day.  You are delicious....my only regret, is not eating more of you.  I really appreciate your thin crispness...Parting is such sweet sorrow.

Till we meet again,

Christy R.
