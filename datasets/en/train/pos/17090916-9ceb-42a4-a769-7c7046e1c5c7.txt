What a pleasant surprise!!  I have worked in many fine dining and restaurants that put an emphasis on pairing foods and sauces that compliment each other, and being recently transplanted to the Scottsdale area, I am very pleased to find this jewel.  First, this place starts on a great foot by letting you buy wine next door at about wholesale prices, because all great food has good to great compliments of wine.  
I am used to the smaller portions and having many of them, my date and I both got the 4 course tasting menu allowing us to sample many of there plates.  It was a couple of weekes ago that I dined but standing out still were the endive salad, OsaBuco style short rib, and an amazing apple and fennel dessert.  I was very pleased to have found the Atlas Bistro
