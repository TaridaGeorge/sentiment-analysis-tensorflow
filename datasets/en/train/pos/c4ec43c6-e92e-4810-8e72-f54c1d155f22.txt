I stopped in here again one day after lunch.  I had a craving for some really good chocolate for dessert.

The dark chocolate cake ball was awesome.  Super rich melt in my mouth goodness.

I also bought a dark chocolate goey bar to go.  That night I intended to only bite off a small piece of the bar.  I ended up eating half of it.

JBC rocks!
