Been a fan of Frank Lloyd Wright for many years. I've visited Falling water and Knob Hill (which is simply fantastic) both in Pennsylvania. Also toured his home and other locations in Chicago. I've yet to be disappointed. The guides are always extremely knowledgeable and they have great anecdotes which help to make the tours fun. My parents have recently moved down (snow birds) to Arizona and I look forward to taking the tour again in the future.  

It is expensive...actually when I went last year my parent's waffled on whether to spend the money because they weren't terribly interested.  In the end they decided to go and they were fascinated and glad they took the tour. It's worth it to support Taliesin and the conservation of these wonderful works of art.
