I've been eating at Casella's for years!! I used to live down the street and go more often then I do now but even when I'm in the area, I try and stop by. The decor is old but if you look past that, you will discover the family friendliness and food are incredible! I usually order the turkey sub but their chicken salad sub is THE BEST! Unfortunately, this place isn't super healthy but boy is it tasty!

Just remember to bring cash because they don't accept anything else!!
