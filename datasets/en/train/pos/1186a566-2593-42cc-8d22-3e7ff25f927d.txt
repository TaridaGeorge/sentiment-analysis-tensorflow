I've been here a total of 3 times now and the food never disappoints! This is my boyfriends favorite restaurant and now its mine too! My favorite things are the beef beer bread sandwich YUM and the calamari and the tartar sauce.. omg amazing! The service isn't always great (once we had a wonderful server, the next time our server was inattentive). Also the place doesn't have AC but it doesn't take away from the experience at all. Anyways I love love love this place and its always the the top of my list of where to go to dinner!
