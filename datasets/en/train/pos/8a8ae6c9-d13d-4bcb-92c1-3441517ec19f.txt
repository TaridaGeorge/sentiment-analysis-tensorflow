Now this is spot that I will make frequent appearances. I went there on a Friday night for a cigar and whiskey. They had a very relaxed atmosphere with a live jazz band inside and a live bluegrass band downstairs at the Herb Box. A bit pricey, so expect to drop a chunk of change if you're going to stay for awhile. The service was very friendly and their bartender made ice that has been smoked. Id recommend if you'd like a slightly smokey flavor to your preferred alcoholic beverage.
