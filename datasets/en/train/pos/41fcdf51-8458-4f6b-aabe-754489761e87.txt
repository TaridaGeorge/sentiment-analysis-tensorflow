I thought it would be weird but it was really good! 

The staff was great and gave me a bunch a free samples to help me order for the first time. They were also super friendly and helpful. 

A lot of the stuff is spicy so make sure to be careful what you order.

Wish I discovered this place sooner, too bad I'm moving in a month.
