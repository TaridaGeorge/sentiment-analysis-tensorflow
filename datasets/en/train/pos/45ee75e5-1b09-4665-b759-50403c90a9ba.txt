went back to Kobalt last Thursday for Trivia night and I'm telling you this place is a blast. Trivia cost $5 per team. Bring 5 people on your team you guys only put in $1 each. You can win over $100
The questions were hard, I didn't know the answers to any of them, haha good thing I didn't get on a team.
Had a $3 mojito though, so good. 
love this place
