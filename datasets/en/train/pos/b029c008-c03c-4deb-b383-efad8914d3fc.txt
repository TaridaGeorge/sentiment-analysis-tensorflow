I'm officially in love with this bar. Drinks are so cheap, it's mind-boggling. I actually had to get package booze to-go so I could use my credit card to make the $10 minimum! 

You can order food from Little Chicago Pizza - which is in the same strip mall - and they'll deliver it to you at the Roadrunner. 

It's super-dark, nicely air-conditioned, with pool table, darts, juke box, and the requisite sports on tv. The bartender was fantastic, and the patrons were friendly. I recommend riding your bike or taking a taxi - the drinks are seriously that cheap.
