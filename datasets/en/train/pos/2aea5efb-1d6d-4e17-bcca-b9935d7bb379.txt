"American Breakfast Staple Done Right"

Skillet corned beef hash is delicious.  Belgium waffles cooked with perfect combination of crispy outside with moist center topped off with there signature "Butters" syrup.  It is clear why there is always a long wait on weekends.  Our waitress very cordial and aware of her table and cleanliness of the table.  There was little spillage from our orange juice and she quickly alerted another wait staff to help clean our table.  She came to check on us twice.  (Once is considered standard).  The decor is Clean and modern and impressive.  On a first impression Butters delivers a strong showing on what is basic of American breakfast staple.  I would have to go again to check on consistency.
