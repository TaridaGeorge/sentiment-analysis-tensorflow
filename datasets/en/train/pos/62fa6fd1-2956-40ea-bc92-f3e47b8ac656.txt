I absolutely love this restaurant. I have so many memories. My friend and I use to go there every Sunday for lunch. We would save our lunch money during the week so we could do this. I was in high school at the time. My aunt and uncle took me here when they came to visit me. My dad threw me a birthday party one year. I love the food and the service.
