Had a contractor break one of my Milguard windows and called Arcadia about replacing it. I talked with Joe and he asked for the serial number and offered to call Milguard to check into it for me. Called back about 30 minutes later and said it was covered under warranty and gave me the phone numbers and contact info for my replacement. Was very pleased to see someone actually take the time to help me out  probably knowing that there would be no business for his company. Next time I need windows, I will remeber Arcadia and patronize their company.
