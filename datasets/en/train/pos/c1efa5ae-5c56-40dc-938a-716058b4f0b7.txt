Tried Sushi Ken for more than 10 times, I love their sushi(Rainbow roll,Dragon Roll) and Ramen!
Great family restaurant,I have to say this is a slam dunk 5 stars.

Japanese owner run this business, absolutely authentic Japanese Sushi.Green-Tea Tempera ice cream is the best,make sure you order  that for your desert.  

Tip: Always crowed Friday& Saturday night ,better to get your table is call them for a reservation.
