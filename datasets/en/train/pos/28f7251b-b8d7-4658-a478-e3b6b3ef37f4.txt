The summit trail has always been one of my favorite hikes in the Phoenix area.  Offering beautiful views of all of the surrounding mountains as well as the skyscrapers of downtown.  It's somewhat challenging, but only takes about 15 minutes to reach the summit.

The parking lot south of Greenway on 16th St is relatively small, but no worries about finding a spot to park your car.  The mountain isn't used and abused like it's cousins to the southwest(Camelback, Squaw Peak).  So not only do you not have to fight for a parking spot, you don't have to worry about people getting in your path on the way up or down.  Quite peaceful if you ask me!  I only hope that it stays this way as the Phoenx metro area gets larger and more spread out.
