Freakin' yum.  Let  me give you the "skinny" on this place.

My wife and I were looking for a place to eat on St. Patrick's Day that didn't have a huge drunken crowd.  Then she suggests this place, saying that she ate there before with a co-worker.  Hoping that it wasn't "Smello's", I took her up on the suggestion.

OMG--we got the "Skinny", an ironically named pizza with about 6 different kinds of meat.  We also got it deep dish.

IT WAS SAUCY--just the way I like it.  The bacon (not the Canadian variety) was the taste that made the pie.  The three slices left over made the perfect lunch the next day.  Just the kind of pizza I've been looking for.  Knife and fork or by hand, this is my favorite pizza in the Valley so far.  Go here.
