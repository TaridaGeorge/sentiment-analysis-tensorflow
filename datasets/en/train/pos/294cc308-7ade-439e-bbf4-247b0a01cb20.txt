In order to avoid waiting for a table, my friend and I went to the bar. Then we found out that they serve the full menu at the bar, we decided to skip the wait and just eat at the bar.

The service at the bar was phenomenal. I was famished and borderline grumpy with a slight headache, but the waitress at the bar immediately brought out delicious bread sticks drizzled with olive oil and basil-bits. We ordered and the empathetic waitress came by later to check up on us.

The garlic pizza and the mushroom truffle pizza melted in my mouth.

Great food, great service, great atmosphere. When I come back and visit the area next time, I will definitely be stopping by this place.
