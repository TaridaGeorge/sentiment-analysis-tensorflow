Visited for dinner and while it was not very busy on a Saturday evening.  We ordered a Pizza and a Strumboli and gosh we were pleasantly surprised.  

The personal pizza was wonderfully presented, excellent thin crust that was well done and with topping that were both fresh and bursting with flavor.  The size of the pizza was more in ines of a Personal Plizza Plus :).  

The  Strumboii was a piece of art.  Never have I seen such a thin crust hold a plethora of sausage.  Most Strumboli's are quite hollow inside and lack much of a meat, but this was certainly one for the history books.

Gotta end on a sweet note and tis been ages since I have tasted a cannoli that is so fresh and so flavorful.

I will surely visit again when I am in the area as it truly a hidden gem.
