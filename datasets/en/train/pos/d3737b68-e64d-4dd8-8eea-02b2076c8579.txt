Darn good pie! We got the groupon deal for an appetizer and a three topping pie. Man, am I glad we did! The toppings are high quality, the crust is the perfect consistency, and generally the pie is just great. We got an order of garlic knots as our appetizer. They were fun, even if they were a bit over oiled and garlicky. Absolutely delicious! We will definitely be coming back here! Oh yeah, did I mention that they deliver for free within five miles?
