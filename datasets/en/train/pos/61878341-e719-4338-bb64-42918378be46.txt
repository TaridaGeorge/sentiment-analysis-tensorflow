Great family venue. And the pizza is pretty good too. The history and scope of the place is pretty impressive. It really is a bit of yester-year that is becoming harder and harder to find.
Just know to bring cash and some tune ideas for the organist to play. I'm guessing they'd prefer a little more variety than is usually requested.
Most the crowds (with small kids) tend to eat earlier in the evening, so it's usually pretty spacious in the later hours.
