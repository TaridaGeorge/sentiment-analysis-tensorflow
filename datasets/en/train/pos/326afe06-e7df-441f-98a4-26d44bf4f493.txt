I'm from New York and since moving to the west, I've really missed having a good deli. I feel like some places really skimp on the meat and their bread-to-meat ratio is just wrong. Miracle Mile however does it right. They pile their sandwiches with great quality meat and their breads taste just like home. The best part is how quickly they get you in and out. I never have to worry about being gone from work for too long. Great experience!
