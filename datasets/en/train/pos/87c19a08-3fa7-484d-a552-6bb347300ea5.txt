Awesome environment, great beer selection, tables in the back in case you want to bring in outside food. Seriously, could this place get any better? I've seen a lot of obscure films here, all for a very reasonable price (anywhere from $3-$7). Besides the bar in front there is also a cool lounge perfect for discussing the film you just watched. It's easy to miss so I really hope this place stays open.
