yes, i was a bit frustrated during our landscaping project (see other reviews), but as far as the nursery itself, none better!

every time i stop by (once or twice a month) they know everything about plants. where to plant, sun/shade, fertilizer, what type of plants. i've often just stopped in to get pruning tips or insect control tips and they always have a productive answer. they point me to products that work, but never try to sell me anything. 

this is, as usual, a great nursery. much, much, much more knowledgable than the box stores.
