This is my favourite resort to stay in phoenix.  it is a bit pricey, but you pay for the wonderful views, excellent pool and relaxing atmosphere.  I used to visit here when it was owned by another company, but the name is still the same.  Quite a few professional atheltes have also stayed when I have visited.  Do rent a car if you plan to leave the resort, but why?... you have everything you need =D
