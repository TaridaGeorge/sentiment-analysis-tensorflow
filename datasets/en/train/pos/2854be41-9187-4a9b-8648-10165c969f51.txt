Finally, great BBQ in the neighborhood. I went in for a nice simple dinner of a large brisket sandwich with a side of baked beans. Both were simply awesome. 

The brisket was hot and fresh with a great smoke flavor. I added the spicy sauce which had a nice but not overpowering kick. Baked beans have a very tomatoey flavor and are good and not overly sweet.

The service was very friendly and helpful.

It was nice to see a steady stream of customers coming into this new location. Thankfully, I can put that Texas chain BBQ down the street away for good.
