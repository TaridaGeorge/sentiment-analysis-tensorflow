I have never seen so many cute vintage peices in one place! I walked out with a wonderful purchase; a teal floral sheer dress. I have already worn it once! LOVE IT!
I like that they alter the items to be more fashionable and that design interns work there - -
I could of spent hours in this store!
*Disappointed I just now saw the Yelp discount in store :(
