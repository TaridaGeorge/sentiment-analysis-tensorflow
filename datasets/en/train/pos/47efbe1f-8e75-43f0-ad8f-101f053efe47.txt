This place is GREAT! 

Talk about a divine menu and vino list. 

Their scallops are superb, and their cheese tray - that includes a local honey - is top-notch. 

The only thing that would make this place beyond stellar, is a few additions of comfy chairs and high-back lounge seats. It would take this place from restaurant to chic lounge.
