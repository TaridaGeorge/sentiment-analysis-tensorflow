On a Thursday night this place is crowded but plenty of open tables available. Being a Margarita Queen, I ordered one, which offers freshly squeezed lime juice, Mm. It was delicious! Made me pucker but I couldn't stop drinking them! So pulpy and totally awesome. The white pizza was superb, maybe even better than Cibo (downtown Phoenix)... Yeah, this pizza was the best. The ambiance was relaxed but intimate with dim lighting, candle lit tables, and good service. I'll definitely be going back for this perfect combo :)
