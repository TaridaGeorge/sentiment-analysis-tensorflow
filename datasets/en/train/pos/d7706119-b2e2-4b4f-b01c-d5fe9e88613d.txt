Why go anywhere else when you can come to the fantabulous, wonderous Eggery.   I've been a local patron for almost 14 years, and it's always consistent.  All of the employees are fantastic, and the host's, who could ask for more.

If you're in the mood for down home, good, well thought out Breakfast items, don't choose anywhere else.  

I love this place, and hope that you do too!
