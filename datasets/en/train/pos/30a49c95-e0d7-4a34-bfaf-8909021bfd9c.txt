I have been banking with DSFCU since 2000, and I can honestly say that I LOVE my bank! I hear my friends complaining about their banks and telling me about all of these problems, and I can't sympathize with them because I have never had a bad experience with DS. This is my main branch and I love it, the staff is always friendly and the drive thru is always fast!
