This location has the best merchandise out of any BE I've been to so far.  Of course they're not going to take your Wet Seal shirt from 2 years ago, deal with it.  When you look at their selection, you know why they're so picky.  And yes, some things could be a bit cheaper, but when you find the smokin' hot deals on the designer brands it's all worth it.  (I got a pair of True Religions for $45)
