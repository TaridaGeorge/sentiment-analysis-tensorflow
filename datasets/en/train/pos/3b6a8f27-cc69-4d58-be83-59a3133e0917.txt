Why the high rating? Because this is one of those places that care about their products. And really, I don't understand why it doesn't have a better rating. They have fresh amazing buns, tons of options, and great sides. 

What I enjoy so much about this place is the creativity. Before I ate here today, I could have never told you I ate a pizza hot dog. I think the prices are great. I think the quality is spot on. But I would have been more happy if the onion rings and zucchini sides where homemade, but you can't ask for everything, and they are good none the less. 

Eat here. You will like it 100x better than Daphne's next door, where all the food is low quality and not fresh. I will be back, and I will bring all my hotdog loving lovers.
