One of the best dining experiences ever!  The service is top-notch.  The food is amazing.  Each dish has a subtle mixture of flavors that is complex and oh so delicious.  I loved the buffalo.   I was surprised by how large the portions are.  I could barely eat dessert, and on top of that, they brought out some delectable truffles compliments of the chef to end the meal.  Try to get a seat where you can see the sun set behind the mountains and lake--absolutely gorgeous--what a serene setting.  Oh, and I love the attention to details, such as the artwork on the walls and on the menus, the silverware cooled or heated to the proper temperature depending on the dish it comes with.
