Another place I have been going to for quite a while, Bongo's has the best weekend breakfast!!! The place is fun, the service is great, and the food is awesome! The Karaoke on Saturday and Wednesday evenings is always a blast, and they have live music every now and then on Fridays! And even better, the drinks are cheap and cold!
