I recently took my 2006 Lexus into be serviced.  Adam and Mark were very friendly and helpful.  I feel like the price was quoted for the work to be done was accurate and fair, the communication about my repair was excellent and the timeline I was given for the repair was spot on!  In addition to the work which I took my car in to be completed, they showed me how truly low the treads were on my tires which saved me from a potential accident.

Definitely a fan of the personnel and service at Wilhelm Automotive Litchfield Park
