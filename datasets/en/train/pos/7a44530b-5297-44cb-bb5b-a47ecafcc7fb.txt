Wow. I had the Lasagna this time, and let me just say one thing about it: Amazing. What's funny is the kids spagetti was good too lol - I think next time I will get it ... It was good AND big enough of a serving after eating all the bread and stuff.  I love Brio and can't wait to keep going back and trying more on the menu.
