The value at Grilled Ave is through the humbly-sized roof. For under 7 dollars, you receive an easily-storable bento box that's good for a meal and a half. 

The pasta salad is candy. $0.59 Hansen's soda. Nice natural light. Service is always on point.

This is the only establishment in the area that offers individual servings of Kimchi, another incredible value at $0.50 that you can feel good about adding on top of the already large meal.

This is the perfect neighborhood joint. Bring cash if you're a nice person.
