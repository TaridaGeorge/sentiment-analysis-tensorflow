If you're in the market for a fabulous (and I mean FABULOUS) sandwhich, or a big, flavorful salad, you must go to Urban Picnic!
If only this little storefront was a tad bigger! There are tables outside where you can sit and savor the wonderful sandwiches and salads from this delightful eatery, but be prepared to stand in line to order. 
I had the turkey and stuffing sandwhich and it was huge and tasted wonderful!
The roast beef with parmesean cheese and horseradish creme was awesome, and the BLT is a traditional sandwhich made with lots of yummy, thick-cut bacon.
YUMMY!!!
