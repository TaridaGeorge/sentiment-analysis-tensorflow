We've never had a bad time. It's our favorite sushi place at anytime of day. The set-up inside is contemporary, but not too much. Great staff, great food & with happy hour & reverse happy hour, it's happy hour literally all day long. They now serve for lunch too. Our favorite is the Firecracker roll. We get it every time even though it's one of the more expensive one's, but be careful with its habenaro sauce(use sparingly. You can also order that sauce as a side anytime). The sauce is bomb! & all the rest is always fresh and good! The sake bombers are a decent price & my friends always have a few while I have an icy cold Kirin. Totally worth checking out, but leave a place for us on Fridays!
