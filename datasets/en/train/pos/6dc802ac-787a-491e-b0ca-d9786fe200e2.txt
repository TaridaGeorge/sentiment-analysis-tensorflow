My entire family have been long time patients of Dr Boor.  He is very professional and his staff is amazing.  He listens to what you have to say and is intuitive to your needs.  There is rarely a wait time when I go to the office, and I can almost always get in the same day for appointments.  Their office is now a part of the JCL network which is great when I was seen at the hospital Dr Boor was aware of my problems once I was seen in the office again.  

I never feel like a number in the office, his staff is very friendly I feel like they are more like family.
