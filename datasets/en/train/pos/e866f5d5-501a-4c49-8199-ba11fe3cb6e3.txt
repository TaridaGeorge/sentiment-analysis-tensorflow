This shop is a small specialty Korean grocery, not a mega mart of all things Asian. Despite its size, Paldo is super well stocked and efficient. Their pre-marinated bulgogi is awesome. Veggies are always fresh and they carry hard to find Korean peppers (jalapeno look alike, but more of a cucumbery taste). A few Japanese items are also sold. Don't skip the ice-cream freezer! My favorites are the sweet corn (best ice-cream flavor ever) and melon bars.

The in-store restaurant is pretty good, too. They usually have a few packaged dishes displayed in front. Great if you don't have the time to order food. I often grab a Korean roll to eat on the go.
