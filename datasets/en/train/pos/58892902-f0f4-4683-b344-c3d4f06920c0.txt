Lucky Boy's is a true family-owned old-fashioned burger place.  The cashier is the owner and the cook is the wife.  The great flavor of the burger takes your taste buds by surprise.  Very juicy, dripping with flavor, char-broiled outside and perfectly cooked in the middle.  Add the fresh ingredients and Lucky's own version of their ranch sauce and it goes down as a true favorite.  Looking forward to trying their real ice cream shakes next time.  Had no room though after the burger and fries.  Oh yah... the price for burger and fries around $4.  Great deal!
