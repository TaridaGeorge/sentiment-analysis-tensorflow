My review is on the Sprouts Sandwich Counter only.

I don't shop here or at any of the locations at this point because none are in walking distance of home. 

But I was in with a friend and we grabbed SANDWICHES at the counter. They were made to order and they were good!  They were so fresh too! I had the Chicken salad on Multi-grain bread. Yummy, can't wait to stop in again for one.  And the full sandwich was $2.99 ( w/o cheese). 

Maybe I will shop here after all from time to time.
