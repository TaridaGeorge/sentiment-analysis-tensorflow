Great little place. I was there for a wine tasting with the Arizona Wine Bats last night and had a blast. The owners are really nice and very accommodating. Although I didn't try any of the food, from what I could tell, every seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. The have a very nice wine selection for you to try and buy by the bottle at very reasonable prices.  Definitely a nice little place to go for a quick drink or before a night out on the town. Give it a try :)
