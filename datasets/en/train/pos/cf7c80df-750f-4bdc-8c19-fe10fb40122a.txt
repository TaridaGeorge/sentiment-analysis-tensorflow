Hurry in and try this Ginger Cinnamon Latte!! I added carmel sauce and soy milk over ice in their large, a whopping 32oz size, Delish!! The flavor combination was amazing! I would drive out of my way any day for this place. 

Tucked behind Fox and Hound Pub & Grill this coffee shop is small, but warm and inviting. The staff was very helpful and friendly, my barista even asked me to try this unusual concoction, upon pickup, to make sure I liked it. I was in love! I may have found my new coffee stop. 

Comparable to *bucks pricing but has a much truer taste without the burnt espresso taste = worth it! They also have a convenient drive up window. (Yay! now I can pickup this coffee goodness in my pjs!)
