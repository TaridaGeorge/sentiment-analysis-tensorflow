Made the trek from Mesa many times over the years.  Brought out of town family, scouts and just for fun with the kids.  It is always enjoyable.  Do try to get there during the week as they will actually be making yummy confections - otherwise you get an older, dark video to watch.  Either way - the chocolates are YUMMY!  My fave are the carmels!!  Hubby's fave are the  green cho. mints.  We even included them in our wedding favors that took place in NH.
