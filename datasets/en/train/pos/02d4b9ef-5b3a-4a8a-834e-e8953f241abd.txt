Amazing!, I crave see on a daily basis! They are absolutely delicious, it's weird, they are like cupcakes from heaven! Sure 3.50 is a little pricey, but they truly are the best cupcakes I've ever had. Everyone there is always so nice and friendly, my only complaint is I wish they had one closer to my house! Get the red velvet...you won't be sorry. The lemon, cinnamon sugar, and peanut butter chocolate chip are also very good. Yum!!
