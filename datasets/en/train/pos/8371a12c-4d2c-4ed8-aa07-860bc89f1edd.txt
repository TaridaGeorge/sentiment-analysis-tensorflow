Been here twice.. I LOVE IT.  

We ordered the Papa K which was excellent.. the ham and cheese.. so savory, every bite i took in super slow.  I ordered it with a fried egg on top, which i recommend.

Also got the Turkey crepe which was even better! Flavors so good you don't want to spoil them with any kind of hot sauce or even salt and pepper!

Also their latte art is really good and cute =)
