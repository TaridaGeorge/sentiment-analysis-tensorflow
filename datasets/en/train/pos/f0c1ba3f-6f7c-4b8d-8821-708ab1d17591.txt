This place is the best restaurant in Arizona. They have the most friendly staff everyone from the hostess, bartender, waiters, cooks, you name it this place is ran like a business should be. Oh and did I mention the FONDUE!! WOW I took my wife here for our anniversary and it was awesome I would have spent 10x what I did to bottle that night and save it forever. Flowers table side, a photo with a frame to remember our night. It was the best. We will now be spending every anniversary from here on out with them. Thank you The Melting Pot, you made our night.
