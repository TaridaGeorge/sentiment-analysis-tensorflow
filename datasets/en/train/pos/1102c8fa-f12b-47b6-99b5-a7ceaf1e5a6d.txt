We have been going to Phoenix for sometime now, but only recently learned of Joes Farm Grill. We tried it out, and let me tell you, it was awesome. Their portions were just right, and even though I was full when we left, I didn't feel gross like I do at other restaurants. I had the BBQ chicken pizza, and I loved it. Thin, flatbread crust made for a light pizza, very tasty pizza. My wife had the chicken Caesar salad. She gets that salad so often that she knows her Caesars, and she said this was her favorite dressing. And the chicken of course was amazing as well.
