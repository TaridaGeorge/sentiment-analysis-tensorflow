Five stars.  

Any organization that dedicates themselves to a subject like this that makes our students smarter, our country stronger, and our community more educated deserves five stars.  

The volunteers, the employee's, and the sponsors of the program, rest assured that WE APPRECIATE YOU!

My son has attended a number of programs here, as well as had his birthday party here with a space simulation, as well as even met authentic NASA Astronauts.   Folks, listen up - the work they do gets our youth interested in engineering careers.  We need more efforts like this.  

Thank you Challenger Space Center!
