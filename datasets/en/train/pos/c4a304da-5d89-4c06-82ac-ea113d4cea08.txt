My new diet plan requires I eat like a hyena on the Serrengetti. 
Meat.
And lots of it.

One teensy problem. 
I don't like meat. 
But then I also don't like the idea of my looking like an old man poolside this summer, my swimsuit hiked up to my nips.

For this reason, I choose TJ's as part of a sensible weight loss plan.
In the frozen food section, you can get a 360 calorie portion of Lamb Vindaloo for a few bucks and voila, banana hammock, here we come.

With any luck, I should be down to a svelte 250 in no time.
Or, I suppose I could always get a metric scale, where I'd trim down to 115 overnight.

Nah, go get the Lamb Vindaloo.
