Suk in the Fitness Center was a treat to work with. He cared about making fitness a lifestyle habit and something you could continue with long term. The gym itself is nice, plenty of circuit and cardio equipment, as well as some free weights. What made it five stars though was Suk checking in on you in your workout when she was around.  Thanks!
