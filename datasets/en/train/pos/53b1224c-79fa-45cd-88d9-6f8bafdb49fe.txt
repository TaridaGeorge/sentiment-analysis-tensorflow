I discovered these pies last September and feel in love with them. The are very tasty and professionally made. Andrea is committed to providing a really homemade, healthy, comfort food. 

All the pies are great but I prefer the larger pies because they have crust all the way around them. The Sassy Pie is absolutely amazing...

Check out the website to see what markets they are at and information about ordering pies. I would suggest going down to a local market and meeting Andrea of one of the people she has working for her.
