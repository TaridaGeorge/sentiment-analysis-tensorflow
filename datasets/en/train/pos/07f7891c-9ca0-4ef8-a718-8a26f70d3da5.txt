Not only have I had other personal trainers in the past , I am also a seasoned chiropractor and certified strength and conditioning specialist (CSCS).  So when I was searching for a new trainer, I wanted someone who new even more than I did.  That's when I got introduced to Dan Siegal at Peak Performance in August of 2008. It's functional training at it's finest.  Body weight, balance, bands, kettlebells, etc...  they use functional movement to produce strength that I never thought was possible for myself.  They have showed that you could be in the best shape of your life at any age.
