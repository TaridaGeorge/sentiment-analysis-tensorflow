My husband works close to the area, and we are scouting out a move to the area so I've really been happy to see what they are doing here. It's reminiscent of outdoor shopping centers like Desert Ridge. It seems like about 1/2 the shops seems to be open and that new things are opening each week. The nice thing is that the stores here don't seem expansive and huge just because they have the space. As such, it's decently close to us (although there are other places to shop that are closer) but it has a nice mix of shops and such that I think I'll be making the drive a bit more often.
