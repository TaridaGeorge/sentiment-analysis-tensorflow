Still one of my favorite places for breakfast. 

The new location is OK, I've had some minor issues during lunch time but our breakfast the other day was Hot , Fresh and Delicious!

I Love the California Benny, An English muffin layered with spinach, bacon, avocados, tomatoes and two large poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce, Served with Crackers Country Potatoes(see pics) 

The Husband always gets the Vatican Skillet which is A layer of Crackers Country Potatoes mixed with breakfast sausage, bacon, mushrooms, onions, bell peppers, topped with cheddar cheese and two eggs any style (see pics) with a side of pancakes instead of toast, I think it's .99 cents more.

Crackers is just a great place for home cooking with a huge menu and tons of dessert, I have several favorites!
Check it out I think you'll agree.

Open 7am -2:30pm.
