My morning ritual Monday through Friday is a trip to my local Starbucks.  The employees there are very friendly, knowledgeable and always treat me like family.  They make it a point to know your name and your drink preferences.  We often have our drinks waiting for us when we arrive because they've seen us across the street....now that's service.  What an awesome group of individuals, Starbucks should be proud.
