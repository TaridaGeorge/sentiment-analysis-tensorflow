I have been going to Rock and Roll Fingers for about 3 years.  Its located near the ASU campus but it seems many college student don't know about this hidden treasure.  By far the best chicken in Arizona. It is always tender crisp and not to greasy.  The owner Allen is a real nice guy and often makes small talk to returning customers.  I love the 60's rock posters on the wall giving it that old diner feel.  As you wait for your food which is usually delivered by the owner himself, there are checkers and backgammon to pass the time.  I always bring my visiting friends to Rock and Roll to show off one of Tempe's truly great eateries.
