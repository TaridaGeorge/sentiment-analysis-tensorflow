Well-executed coffeshop.  Plenty of seating and unlike most places they have free wireless; comfortable and light atmosphere.  They stated they are able to make lunch soon.  I have yet to experience that but by their coffee would think they are going to be a lot busier at lunchtime.  The owner pays attention to details making this place a long term Tempe gem.
