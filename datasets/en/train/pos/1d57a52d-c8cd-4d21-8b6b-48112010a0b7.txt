My taste buds actually gave a standing ovation after having their jade red chicken and jerk fried rice. If you tell them it's your first time there, they will provide you with samples, which in a way served as an appetizer that made me even more excited to try their food. 

Their blend of Mexican, Chinese, and Cuban flavors is a very unique and delicious combination and for the money, you get a very generous portion of food. The Jade Red Chicken is a favorite; I'd also recommend trying their pollo diablo if you want some more kick.

Also, in addition to the awesome food, is their awesome service. They strive to satisfy their customers and that shows through their overall friendly demeanor and their passion for their food. This is definitely a must-visit for anyone who lives/visits AZ.
