Since going Organic and Gluten-Free, I'd say Trader Joe's has absolutely made shopping soo much easier and not a chore. With a variety of options and everything clearly labeled and categorized, I couldn't be happier with my shopping ventures. 

The staff and management have been absolutely friendly and helpful, anytime I've had questions or needed assistance in finding something.

You can say I'm pretty much a neighborhood regular now!
