This was such a fun evening.

Family friendly, so take your kids, take your girlfriend on a date, etc etc.  The owner, Jeff, is always there, always entertaining, and I was leave with a smile on my face.  It takes so much talent to do an improv show, and this is by far the best I've seen.  Can't wait to go again.
