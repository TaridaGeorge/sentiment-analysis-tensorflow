Our son in law brought over a great sampling of foods from Guanaquito for us to try, and I have to say it was especially good. As a gourmet cook collecting recipes for 45 years, I appreciate the homemade quality and attention to preparation and ingredients. I don't mean to seem arrogant, but it's been a rare expereince for me to enjoy that sense of satisfaction from foods prepared by others in Phoenix. This has got to be one of our best local restaurants.
