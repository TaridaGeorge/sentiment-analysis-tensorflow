I took my daughter to see Dr. Kwan to find an alternative medicine solution for her ADD. Dr Kwan made her feel comfortable talking about herself and the triggers that set it off. I knew my daughter felt safe in her office because of how openly she shared what she goes through on a daily basis at school with Dr. Kwan. We have just started the medicine and are excited for her to heal from the inside, so she can feel normal and not have to take a controlled substance to keep up with her peers.
