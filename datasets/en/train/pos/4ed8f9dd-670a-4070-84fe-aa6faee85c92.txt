LOVED this place!!!

We went on a Saturday night and it was so fun. The music was loud, but it was really fun.

Got the 18yr mojito or whatever, but I liked the regular one I had. The Key Lime Martini was great too!

If you do anything, get the tasting menu for $60. 
It's so much food, but worth it. You get the tuna tartar, calamari salad (awesome!), beef spring rolls, sake with raspberries (to clean your palette is what they told me), the fish, short rib, rice and fabulous desserts! We walked out as happy campers! 

Service was excellent!

One of the best meals I've had! Great setting. Sit inside, the patio didn't look that great.

If you are in Scottsdale, check this place out.
