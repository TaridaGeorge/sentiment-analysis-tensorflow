If it weren't for this store I'd own a house by now.

Great selection of old vinyl, fair prices on buying and selling,  and if you can't find it there you might as well have them order it cuz you won't find it anywhere else.  They also have interesting rock n roll knick knacks, every time i go there i leave w/ a new band bio, patch, or random piece of memorabilia. They also have turn tables, and will help you fix the one you already own. 

Probably the best blues selection around, and very helpful how they seperate the reprints from the originals for the punk/rock genre.    The owners are super knowledgable and you can blow a whole afternoon there talking about the good ole days.
