Good Morning 
I am really Old and have used many Dry cleaners before BUT I really want to Give Corporate for Delia's along with the Great People that you have at this location, that insured me that the problem I had on a new shirt that they caused would be taken care of and WOW did they take Great care and Quickly. I received a check for the correct amount in a short period of time.
Also we use to live at Greyhawk and the people that you have a DC Ranch were also great.
Thanks Delia's great crew for such Great Service.
