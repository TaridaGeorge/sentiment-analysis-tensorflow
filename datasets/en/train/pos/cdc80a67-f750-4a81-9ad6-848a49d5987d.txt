I do love AJ's when I stay at the Courtyard hotel across 54th from AJ's. Their selection of fresh fruits, vegetables, etc... is fantastic. I love how fancy and clean the store is too and it feels good to support a local business as opposed to find a Whole Foods. 

I love their fresh cut fruit, I love their beer selection, I love how good the flowers smell when you first walk in on the right side.
