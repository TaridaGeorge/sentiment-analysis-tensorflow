I have been shopping at the Lowe's in Surprise for over eight years.  They have always had great, competitive prices and helpful staff.  I was there today having paint mixed with codes from a competitor paint brand that they do not carry; however, they match the paint using the codes perfectly!  The guys and gals in the paint department are always very friendly and helpful.  There is usually a little wait to have paint mixed, but not outrageous.  Also, if I need help finding something or figuring something out, they have always been great in directing me.
