I love this boutique! They have great clothes and great sales. The stuff is reasonably priced and very cute! The girls are very nice and great, not too pushy but there when u need them.

I go back every month for bags days where u get a free gift and discount... and usually a free cocktail or snack :)

I highly recommend this shop for fashion forward, stylish people who don't want to wear the same stuff as everyone else.
