-WOW! These are the friendliest folks I have ever met! The store owners were very cordial and friendly. They really have a passion for antiques.

-COOL 1930's building with original wood floor and peeled away plaster walls, revealing cool old bricks...how rare to see in Phoenix! Love the old vintage glass door.

-Neat products, decent prices...not a big store, but a one worth visiting for sure!

-Parking is convenient, on the side street.
