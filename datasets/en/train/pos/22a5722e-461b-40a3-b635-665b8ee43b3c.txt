I love beckett's table.  a welcomed addition to the neighborhood.  nice bar, community table.  cozy interior, very well designed.  modern and comfortable. screams comfort and comfort food.  reminiscent of the old radio milano.  The food is excellent, but i always gotta go for the short ribs, their specialty.  Consistent food and service.  Make reservations to avoid disappointment.  i usually don't want to leave.
