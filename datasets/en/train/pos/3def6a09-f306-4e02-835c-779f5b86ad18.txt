The bomb, The best Mediterranean food . he place is really awesome and the Combo plate was amazing specially the falafel and the rice. Let me begin by saying I *love* Middle Eastern food. I have tried many restaurants is search of great examples of this cuisine. Flaming Kabob serves excellent food from a family owned, local restaurant. When you walk into this place, you get a feeling that you've just stepped into the Twilight Zone. Not because of the food or the service, This restaurant offers friendly, knowledgeable service and help navigating the menu. There was a lot of selection available for vegetarians including hummus, tabouli, stuffed grape leaves, moujadara, falafel, spanikopita and more. Come here, you won't be dissapointed!!
