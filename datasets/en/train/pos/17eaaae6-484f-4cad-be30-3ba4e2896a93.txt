I love going here. From the food to the staff and service, this place is perfect for watching games and hanging out with friends and family. I'm not a beer drinker, but husband and friends are and I always hear about how great the beers are especially the seasonal beers. 

Can't for get a growler when you visit. It is so cheap for the amount and types of beers available.
