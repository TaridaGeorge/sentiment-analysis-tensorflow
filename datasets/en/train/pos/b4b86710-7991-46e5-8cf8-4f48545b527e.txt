Wow. What a great workout! As a devout SPX fan - I've trained religiously at the Beverly Hills studio for the last three years. It is honestly the only workout that has given me results. I love it. After a recent stay in Phoenix, I was worried that I'd miss out on training. But that was before I discovered that a new spx studio that opened on camelback. I briefly met the owner, Jenny, and she was great. Super nice and welcoming. The studio itself was light and breezy so it didn't get too hot in there. But the class was intense. I highly recommend this one. Just a tip, it's located in the back of the aj's strip mall so give yourself some extra time to park and find it.
