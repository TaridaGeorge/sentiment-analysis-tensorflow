This was undeniably one of the best steaks I have ever had in my life. Almost every element of this meal was pure heaven. The Strip Steak was so thick each bite must be masterfully cut (beware your eyes and stomach will betray you, eat slow), fresh garlic and butter dripping from every perfectly cooked inch onto a sizzling hot plate that their dapper and attentive waiters place before you. 
The steak was so juicy and so tender you need only use a butter knife. Paired with a nice full bodied Cabernet, which the waiter recommended...I couldn't have asked for more. O wait but I did, I had a side of mashed potatoes (regular not the lobster) that was forgettable. It was not cheap, but honestly I cannot remember how much I paid...what I do remember is that amazing meal. Indulge and savor the steak at this Mastro's.
