Can't go wrong with Az Comptech... My computer started to be really slow. To even open up a program, it would take a whole minute. I suspected that I was infected with some type of virus. I called up Az Comptech and talked to Scott who told me not to worry, he would be able to get my computer running at the normal speed.

I took the computer over to Az Comptech, and the next day Scott called me and told me it was ready to go. We booted it up right there in the shop so I could see that the computer was running normally again.

Overall it was a great experience. Az Comptech is a great computer repair shop!
