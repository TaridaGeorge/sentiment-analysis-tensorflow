A great little place to see shows, very small, very intimate, a great setting for seeing a band. If a band you want to see is playing here, be sure to go, it doesn't get anymore up close and personal than this.
There is no seating or alcohol, so if you don't mind standing and being sober, it is well worth it.
The art here is some of First Friday's best, as far as I am concerned, leagues above all the other galleries. Be sure to stop and see the art here if you are out then.
