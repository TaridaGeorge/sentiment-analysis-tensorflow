The first impression I got was a very welcoming one! The sweet man at the front greeted us and was SO sweet and nice! I liked how clean the restaurant is too. I ordered the Mongolian beef and my boyfriend had the orange beef, they were both delicious! I went because this place was highly rated on here and I'm glad we did. We will be returning very soon to try other things on their menu!
