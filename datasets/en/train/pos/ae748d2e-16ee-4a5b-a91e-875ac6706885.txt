I tried this when they had the food truck event in The Whole Foods parking lot last Thursday- so good!! I believe they have these events on the 3rd Thursday of every month- I will be going back for sure. I had the 3 tacos combo- it was excellent. I first had an asian-mexican fusion taco at a famous food truck in Austin, Texas- and Shinobu was just as good! Go try this place out, you won't be disappointed!
