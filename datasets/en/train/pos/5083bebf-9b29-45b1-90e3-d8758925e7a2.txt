Sally's is a great store. Tons of beauty supplies: haircare, skincare, nail care, you name it. Their prices are extremely reasonable and the also have sales and in-store coupons. The staff often seem pre-occupied but usually ask if I need anything-and in this place I prefer to just peruse around sometimes. Bottom line: great selection and great prices.
