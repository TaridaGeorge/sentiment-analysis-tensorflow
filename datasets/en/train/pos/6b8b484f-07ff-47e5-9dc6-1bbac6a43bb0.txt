Love this store for all the organic green produce. Pricing is reasonable, but what else can you expect from a quality organic store? Ever since I started my juicing routine, I find everything I need at Whole Foods, just wish it was closer to my home. 
Love the wide selection of organic products they carry, even the ambience of the store is 'organic'.
