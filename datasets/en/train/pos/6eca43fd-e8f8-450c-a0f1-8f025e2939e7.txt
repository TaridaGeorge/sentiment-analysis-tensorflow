Wag N Wash is the place for dog lovers to shop in central Phoenix.  Friendly customer service every time, a great selection of dog food (and your 10th bag is free) and dog toys that you won't find elsewhere. My dog is a fan of the Elk Horns, a wonderful and eco-friendly toy that is cheap and keeps him happy for 6 months!

Also, this is the place to give Fido a bath. While I'd rather do it at home and save a few bucks, we did a bath here once and they make it super easy to get your dog super clean.
