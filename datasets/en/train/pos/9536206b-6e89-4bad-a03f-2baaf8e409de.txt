I have been to this place many times and the food and service is always great. I am so excited to have found a place where I can get freshly made, good food out here in Queen Creek. My favorite is their home made mozzarella cheese. Its great on anything. I frequently order the tomato, basil and Mozzarella pizza and I recently discovered their vegetarian plate which was delicious. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Don't forget to save room for the amazing ice cream they have.
