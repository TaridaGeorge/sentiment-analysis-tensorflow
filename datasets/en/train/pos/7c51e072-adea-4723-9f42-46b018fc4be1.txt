I absolutely loooooooove this place!  I was hesistant to try a new nail salon since I had been so faithful to mine for over 10 years but I'm glad I did.  It truly does feel like a spa and the customer care is top notch. 

After each pedicare & manicure they give you a complimentary 2-3 minute massage on your neck.  The nail techs are very friendly and helpful.  It may be a few dollars ($3 to be exact) more than your normal nail shop but it's worth it.
