Went here before a show at Stand Up live. The happy hour had blue moon's for $2!! The frozen margaritas are our favorite! I got the Chicken Parm which I think was better than Carrabba's. Wife got a burger for some reason but said she loved it a little better than Joe's Farm Grill. We had a great time with an attentive waiter. We can't wait to go back. 

PARKING TIP: Eating at a restaurant gives you a two hr validation while stand up live gives a three hr window. We only parked for less than 5hrs but they will only accept one block of hrs for free so we had to pay $5. The way to avoid it would be to pull out of garage and then right back in to get a new parking pass for the comedy show.
