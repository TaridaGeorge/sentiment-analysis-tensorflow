Bruchetta and wine!  The best part is that the food is ridiculously reasonable for superb quality food. The open restaurant concept keeps the place lively as there is always a good crowd soaking in the fresh air at the open bar or on the patio.

I've never had a bad experience here and the complimentary valet really helps as Magellan couldn't find you street parking.

Be sure to take a group of friends so you can sample as many types of bruchetta that you can.  My standard meal is the Autostrada sandwich and the Raspberry Chicken Salad (Half and Half deal for $9.75)

Indulge and always go for a bottle.  The light rail is just steps away.
