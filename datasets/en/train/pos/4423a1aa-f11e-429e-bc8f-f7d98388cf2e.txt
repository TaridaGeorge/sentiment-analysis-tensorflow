This is by far the best Trapeze school I've ever been to!! Not only is this school less expensive, but more fun, positive and uplifting. George is an amazing instructor and keeps the line moving so you get a ton of turns. I've already learned so much in the short time I've been going here. I would recommend this to anyone from the first time flyer to someone more advanced and out of safety lines. Plus, it is a good workout which is just an added bonus.
