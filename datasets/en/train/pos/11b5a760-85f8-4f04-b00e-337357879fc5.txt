If you are in the mood for a fast fresh prepared as you order burger this is the place to go.  I recomend doing a google seach and looking at their 'secret' menu that list multiple different options and variations ontheir food.  I am a huge fan of the mustard grilled cheeseburger.  Fries are delish.  This isn't gourmet but they dont pretend to be.  The decor is 50-60'2 style throwback drive in.
