Truly an Oasis in the Desert!! 
Nutritious and satisfying - every cell in my body was applauding the meals we have had here. 
Chef Sarah comes out to greet her costumers in person and truly care about your well-being and experience while dining. Everyone working here contributes to the ambiance. 
P.s: To prepare these foods takes time...., is the freshest and tastiest I have had and we live in the Bay area CA where fresh produce is abundant! I will pay the dollar amount over and over again.
