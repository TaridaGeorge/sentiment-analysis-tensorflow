Ok so this place definitely deserves 5 stars.  Been here a about 4 times now and have had multiple things on the menu.  They are known for their Jalepeno pancakes, which are excellent, however I would recommend sharing them with someone as they are VERY rich and filling.  A whole plate of them would likely push you over the edge if you are already teetering on type 2 diabetes.  The corn beef hash is also excellent, and probably my favorite here.  The fabulous coffee and friendly wait staff we have always encountered here is what seperates a great local business and chain restaraunts.  We'll be back.
