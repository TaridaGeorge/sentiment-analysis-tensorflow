I love this place! Especially since they added the Hawaiian section. Most people would be skeptical, but the meat selection and quality here is really good and their produce prices are awesome.

I'd also have to say that their alcohol selection is wonderful - more often than not, alcohol (especially beer) ends up being cheaper here. The thing I like most is the nice ladies that work here at the cash register... there's always a lane open or a short wait, and I'm not sure if they do it all the time but usually they give a 10% discount even when you don't show them your Lee Lee's card. And if anything else, just come here to try something new - like mochi ice cream (freezer section)!
