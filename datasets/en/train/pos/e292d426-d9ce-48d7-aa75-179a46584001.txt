Been to this cafe several times for breakfast and lunch.  Food is very good.  Eggs benedict on Sunday mornings are my favorite.

Last visit had a mix up on my order.  Not 100% the cafe's fault, but the staff handled it very professionally.  Comped the entire order and provided a coupon for a free breakfast.

Very impressed.
