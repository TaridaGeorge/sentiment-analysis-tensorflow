This place is just so so rad. It was about time that AZ has a high end sneaker boutique.

The selection of sneakers as well as clothes is above all. No kidding. I bought a pair of limited edition Jordans as a gift here. All of the sneakers here a so unique and fun, and it really puts the fun in sneaker shopping again. 

Sure, you can go to finish line and get a pair of sneakers there. And you will see various other people wearing the same ones. If you really want to find funky stuff to express yourself with, this is the place. AND to make it even better...they sell for retail! So markups? Not an issue.

Do yourself a favor and check this place out...
