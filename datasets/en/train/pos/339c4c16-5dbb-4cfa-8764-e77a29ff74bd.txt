I stumbled upon this place on a recent trip to Tempe. It's in a strip mall, but don't let that fool you. The food and pastries are top notch. The ingredients were fresh and the food was amazing. I ordered the almond croissant and a potato cake. The only down side is that they have an espresso machine that looks like it's for home use so if you order a latte, it will take 10 minutes to get it. Just go for the coffee or a water and stop at Starbucks next door for your latte or espresso fix.
