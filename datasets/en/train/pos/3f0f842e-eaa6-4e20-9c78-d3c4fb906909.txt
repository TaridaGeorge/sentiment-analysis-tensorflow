Yes, it's Olive Garden, so most of us know what to expect but.... For the last year or 2, have been going to this location. Almost always go on weekdays for lunch. We dine in the Bar area, and always always ask for the same young waitress (Tamara I think but I'm so sorry if I got that wrong).  She is fantastic. And its so funny. The Bar if full up, with people like us, that love her so much, they are her regulars. For a waitress at an Olive Garden to do that is pretty impressive. She also works on the new store set up team, so it's fun to hear hear little stories about the good time they have setting them up.

Food is always good, but the service is FANTASTIC!!! This girl deserves a raise! ;-)
