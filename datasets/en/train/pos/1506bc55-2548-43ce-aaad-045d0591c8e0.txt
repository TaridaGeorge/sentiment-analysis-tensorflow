The owners are very nice and friendly.  The atmosphere is professional and clean...booths seem to be a bit tight though.  The food is fabulous and the prices very reasonable.  I've tried the yellow, green, and panang curries, and the Pad Thai and they are all wonderful and nicely presented.  If your lunch time is flexible, I would suggest going a bit earlier (11:45) or a bit later (12:45) as this is a very popular lunch spot.  BY FAR the best Thai place I've tried in this area and I eat out A LOT!!  

By the way, it is now called Thai Dressing.
