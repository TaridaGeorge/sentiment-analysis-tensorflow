Run, don't walk to Andreoli. Fantastic! On the last visit we had a sausage, pepper and onion sandwich with grilled calamari and a side of fresh anchovies. The sausage was spiced perfectly and cooked to perfection. I'm not sure I'll brush my teeth tonight so that the taste lingers on and on. This is the real deal. We've been back many times with consistently the same result: great! And the owner and waiters are very friendly when it's not busy. Highly recommended.
