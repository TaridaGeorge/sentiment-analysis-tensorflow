sprinkles, sprinkles, five little stars
is how we rate your cakes so far
we have only tried a few
yum! is what we say to you

sprinkles, sprinkles, deduct one star
all the kids' crumbs in our car
tore open the box and ate
your delish eggnog cupcakes

sprinkles, sprinkles, cupcake czars
sweetest cakes we've had by far
your rv is off the chart
the black and white, out of the park

sprinkles, sprinkles, five little stars
can't fault you for our 'crumby' car

-a collaboration with my daughter. much better when she sings it. trust me.
