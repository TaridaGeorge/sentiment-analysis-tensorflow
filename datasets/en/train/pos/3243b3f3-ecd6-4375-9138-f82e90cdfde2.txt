We're NYers who love food & just moved to Glendale from NYC. The biggest change for us being here is a) not being able to walk places & b) lack of GOOD restaurants (chains DON'T cut it..). 

Went to Sakana on a friend's recommendation with low expectations.. fish in the desert sounded pretty grim to me.

I was shocked by the freshness of the fish, great service, creative special roll concoctions & the price. Sakana's food compares well to high-class Manhattan sushi,  but at half the price. We've been back twice since that first visit. 

Stoked to come back again!!
