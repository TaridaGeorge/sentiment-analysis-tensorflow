We have loyally been taking our dog to Animal Hospital at Grayhawk for more than seven years now (since our she was a puppy).  We have primarily been seeing Dr. Howard, although on a couple recent occasions we have seen his associates.  Dr.  Howard is a friendly and knowledgeable veterinarian.  We think he isn't overly conservative nor overly aggressive with treatments, and he always does a thorough job explaining treatments and options.  His staff has always been supurb and very friendly as well.  Our dog has been seen for regular exams as well as some sick visits.  Although we have only seen his associates a couple times, we actually had one call to see how our dog was doing on a new medication.  Very impressive!  The office is clean and comfortable and we would recommend them to anyone!
