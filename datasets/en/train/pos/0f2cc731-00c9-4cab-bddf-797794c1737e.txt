I love Black Bear! We were stuffed on our cinnamon roll french toast, eggs, bacon, biscuits & gravy, and pancakes, on our platters, not plates. The service is always great, fast, efficient & the food is amazing. You just might want to share a platter. I always want to roll myself out of there after I'm done cleaning my plate.
