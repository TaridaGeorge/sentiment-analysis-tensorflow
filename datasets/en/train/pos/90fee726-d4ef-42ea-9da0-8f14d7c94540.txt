Be sure before you come here that you like the work of Frank Lloyd Wright, because the guides are all true converts, and so you had better be at least an initiate. 

The property itself is beautiful in a down to earth (haha, inside joke for FLlW fans) kind of way, and perfectly illustrates much of his philosophy where everything in the environment is the domain of the architect, not just the building but the landscaping, the furniture, the lighting, the decorative art adornments. 

Our guide had been with the fellowship for over 20 years. She was informative, cheerful, and funny. She took the time to answer all our questions and to allow us to take photos. Your mileage may vary depending on who you get for a tour guide but in chatting with some of them I got the feeling they were all very good.
