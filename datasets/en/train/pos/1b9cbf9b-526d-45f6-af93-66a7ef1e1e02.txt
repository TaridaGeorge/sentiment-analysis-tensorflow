Old Navy isn't usually a place where I buy clothes for myself but it's great to pick up shorts and swim trunks for the toddler and the Ahwatukee store is by far the best because not only did they give me a price adjustment when everything went 30% off, they still honored the $10 off coupon I had used when I made my original purchase which had expired by the time I had gotten the price adjustment. To top it off, it took a little while for them to figure out how to get the computer to take an expired coupon so to make up for me waiting (and they were doing me a favor, I didn't mind waiting at all), they gave me a $5 gift card! They're so accommodating, what's not to love?
