Wow! Extremely nice people. The owner was very helpful with suggestions and tips on how to dress the soup. Everything was so prompt without making us feel rushed. The #16 Tofu Pho Soup was delicious. Perfectly warm broth and fresh veggies. I will definately be visiting this place regularly, especially in the colder season. Can wait to try their unique looking dessert drinks.
