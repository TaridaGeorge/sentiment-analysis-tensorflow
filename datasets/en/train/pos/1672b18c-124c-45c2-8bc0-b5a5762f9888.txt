Citizen Public House is one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale. Everything is cooked perfectly. The ambiance and service are also excellent! All this at very very reasonable pricing.  it is worth mentioning that the drinks are great here too!

I know it did not originate here, but this was the first place i had the "original" chopped salad. While it did not quite blow me away, it is different and delicious. 

Over the course of my business trip, i was able to try most of the entrees here . I had the wagyu burger, the filet, tenderloin, and also the short ribs. 

If it is your first time here, i would start with the chopped salad and the pork belly pastrami and choose the filet or short ribs as your entree. 

Everything is good here though! The burger is excellent too!

stop reading and make that reservation!
