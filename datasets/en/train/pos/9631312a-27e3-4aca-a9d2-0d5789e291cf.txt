Oh, Cheba Hut, how I love thee...let me count the ways: 

1) One word: Griefo
2) hemp brownies - did you know that hemp seeds have the highest, natual concentration of vitamin B12?
3) Funky, eclectic decor & employees
4) Seeing business men in suits, walking into the psychadelic & delicious restaurant
5) Being able to introduce my kids to the goodness

Love this place!!!
