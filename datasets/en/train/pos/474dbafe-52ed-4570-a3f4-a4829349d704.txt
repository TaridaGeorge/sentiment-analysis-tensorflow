Good stuff! Went for lunch a couple days ago...get there early or be prepared to wait! 

Had a brisket sandwich, beans and hot link. I loved everything except the beans...nothing wrong with them, just not my taste. To me, the beans were a little bland. But the BBQ was top notch! 

Will be back again, and again, and again.
