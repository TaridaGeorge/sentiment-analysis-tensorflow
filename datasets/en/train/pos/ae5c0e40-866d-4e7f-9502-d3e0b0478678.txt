Delish! 

I can't even begin to tell you the number of different dishes I've ordered here, but each one always satisfies. There's always plenty to take home for second servings. 

The service is average - definitely nothing to complain about, but certainly nothing to wow you. But, that's ok. The food is served in a timely manner, as are your initial drinks. Try the Thai Tea. It's a treat.
