I love Solo, have been coming here when the owner Chad, was the only employee. We would talk LOST theories and what not. Really chill place to grab amazing coffee. They have more baristas now, and I've had some of them not be consistent on the quality, but lately it seems that they have gotten it down.

The best part is that they sell Cortez coffee, which is fair-trade. Our favorite roast is the primo, which is the same roast they use for their espresso. It is fresh and delicious.

I definitely recommend coming here for coffee, as other reviewers have said, it's not the fastest place, so if you are in a hurry, you may have to come when you don't have to run out the door. But if you aren't in a rush, enjoy!
