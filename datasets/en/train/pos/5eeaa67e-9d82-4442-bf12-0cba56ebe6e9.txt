Always a pleasure eating here. I am not one for chain restaurants, but this is great quality all the way around. Food is outstanding, service is friendly and attentive. I give these servers kudos for keeping the quality up in a high-volume restaurant. Lobster Mashed Potatoes are the BEST. You can't go wrong with the steaks, obviously. Great Wedge Salad as well. 5 stars baby!
