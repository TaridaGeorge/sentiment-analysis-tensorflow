As Amanda B already updated, Leap's is, indeed, closed down. 

No explanation was given except that they had violated something in the lease. Notice was dated 11/29/2008. Everything's still inside, like a little ghost store. 

I could cry. Really, I could. Not even Jetta R's usual wit and charm could cheer me up again. 

BRING BACK LEAP'S!
