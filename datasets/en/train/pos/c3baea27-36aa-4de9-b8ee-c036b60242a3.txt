Covet is an excellent clothing store.
In Arizona, there is almost nowhere decent to shop. 
unless of course you loooooove Juicy Couture, in the event of which, you should probably not even bother reading this review, because this kind of fashion forward clothing won't appeal to you. 

Acne Jeans? check.
Endovenera? check.
Ksubi? check. 
Nike? check. 

Covet starts off with an excellent men's shoe section, 
continues with an excellent men's clothing selection, 
and finishes off with excellent women's wear. 

It really is a shame if you haven't been to Covet yet. Do yourself a  serious favor and support a small business at the same time.
