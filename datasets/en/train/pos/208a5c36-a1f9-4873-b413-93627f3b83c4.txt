Beautiful park! 

Make sure to stop by the vistors center and beautiful new library right before the park.

If you come here often - make sure to get the annual pass or they have a coupon book for multiple visits. It's nice to drive around and look at the beauty or get out and hike one of the many trails.

The waterfall trail is probably the most popular and easiest trail (about 2 miles) although you aren't guaranteed that an actual waterfall will be at the end!

If you're in the area - stop by and you won't be disappointed!
