MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE PIZZA. Hands down. I am not much of a marinara fan so I LOOOOOOOOVE the White Pizza w/ Pepperoni! MM MMMM MMMMM We live right next to San Tan so we come to this one frequently and also do take out. I have been to the one's in Scottsdale and Ocotillo also and they are just as delish. On a weekend night there will be probably about a 30 minute wait so get ready for it. But they are always very nice and welcoming. I LOVE this pizza. I cant say it enough. I have never had a better pizza.
