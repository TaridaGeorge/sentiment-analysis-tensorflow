To all the carnivores who have been scarred by vegetarian friends brutally forcing you to "just try a bite" of a rubbery Boca burger or flavorless beans-n'-sh*t burger, know that there is hope for you yet. 

LGO has perfected the veggie burger. The Shangri-La is filling, big, flavorful, healthy, and cheap. Plus, you can get it wrapped in lettuce instead of a bun. Take that, carbs. It also comes with a piece of fruit, so your sugar cravings will be somewhat satisfied without ordering a 6-inch cookie to-go and crying while eating the entire thing in your car. 

I love that burger so much I want to take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant.
