After 2 years of living in AZ, I've finally found a stylist that I will keep coming back to. Alex is incredibly talented, warm, and a great listener. Her consultations are in depth so that you can explain all you want, and if you don't quite know what you want, she knows how to ask the right questions to help get you to that point. She not only gave me a great cut, but a very easy to manage one as well - which is awesome in my book b/c I'm so lazy about doing my hair.  =)
