Fantastic service!!! Everyone we encountered from the manager & servers to the busboy, was very personable and welcoming. Even my 5 yr old son was treated with kindness and smiles - not typical at this caliber of restaurant and it was so appreciated. 

The food was excellent. I especially enjoyed the appetizer of yellow fin tuna cups - so light and a perfect bite to get my taste buds going.  My filet was cooked perfectly and I could have eaten ten of the crab-stuffed tomatoes. The chocolate dessert recommended by the waiter was also divine - and I don't even like sweets or chocolate! A 5-star experience all around. 

When in Fountain Hills, I'd skip the stay at CopperWynd but dinner at Alchemy is a must!
