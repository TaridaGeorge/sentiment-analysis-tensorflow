I just feel compelled to again state how much I freakin' love this place

I think its super.

Last time I branched out and ordered a filet (my bf ordered ribs and then we split to make for a delicious mixed meal)

OMG
THE FILET WAS AMAZING!

Like, better than high end steakhouses.
I love this place.

Just wish it were closer to me!
