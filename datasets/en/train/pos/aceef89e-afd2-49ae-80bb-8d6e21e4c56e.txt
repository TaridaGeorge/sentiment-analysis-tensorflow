Unlimited is the only coffee shop in town I consider myself a regular at. It's the opposite of pretentious, has good coffee, delicious gelato, friendly service, and tbh the real reason I come here is my friends gather here on Mondays for "coworking" and shenanigans.

So the furniture is a couple couches, some four seat tables, and a big ass table with plastic chairs. Not exactly pretty, but it kicks ass that a bunch of us can show up with our laptops and comfortably work and hang out here.
