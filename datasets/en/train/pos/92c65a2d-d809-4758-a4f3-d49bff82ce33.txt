This place is seriously amazing.  I sampled the date and blue cheese ice cream and it was phenomenal.  I'm not sure I could eat an entire cup of it but it is definitely a must for sampling.  I got a small cup of the peanut butter ice cream with chocolate chunks in it.  I definitely did not regret this post lunch decision.  I seriously can't wait to go back and try more of their ice creams, sorbets, and milkshakes!  Read their framed newspaper article on the far back wall.  Really cool story!  I definitely hope this business sticks around for a long time!
