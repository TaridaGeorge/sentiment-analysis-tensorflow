This place is soooo good.  Nice sour flavors (and others too)  the ice is very very finely shredded, and they really pile on the ice and the flavors.    Customer service is top notch too.  I had a sour cherry with cream in it, and it was absolutely devine.  I would and will go back here in a heartbeat.
