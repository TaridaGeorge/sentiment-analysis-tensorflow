Had a dinner party here in one of their private dining rooms.  The food, drinks, and service were all outstanding.   Started with the calamari, Antipasto (w/cured meats, artisan cheese, marinated olives, Marcona almonds, quince paste and flat bread), Crispy Calamari with aioli and 
Lamb Merguez Sausage; followed by the Caprese; mozzarella, tomato and basil; and for the main course I had the Flat Iron steak, fingerling potatoes, shishito peppers, piperade sauce (cooked perfectly).  I finished off my meal with the Julia Baker Chocolate Mousse Cake.  I have to say everything was 5 star: food was fabulous, service was excellent, I'll  certainly be back again!
