I've been really impressed with John Skiba and his professionalism. He is always up to date on everything in bankruptcy law and I've enjoyed reading his blog posts. It really shows his expertise and passion for what he does. Hopefully I will never need his services but if I ever were to need an Arizona bankruptcy attorney I would go to him first for sure.
