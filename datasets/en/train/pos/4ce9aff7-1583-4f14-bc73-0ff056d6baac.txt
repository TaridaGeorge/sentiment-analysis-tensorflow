Love Fletcher Heights Chiropractic. The staff is friendly, the office looks nice and Dr. Jay is awesome. I had chemo and a bone marrow transplant, and he was very gentle. You feel so good after an adjustment instead of feeling beat up.

He also isn't one of those chiropractors that tell you to come a bunch of times when you don't need it. He is honest and caring.

I few times I have walked in without an appointment and they get me in without a problem.

I highly recommend them!
