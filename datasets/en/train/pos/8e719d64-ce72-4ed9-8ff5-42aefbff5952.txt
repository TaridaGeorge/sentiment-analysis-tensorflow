I'm glad that my boyfriend and I went hear on our Halloween hunt.  There were lots of good ideas creeping and crawling around each corner.  It was pretty busy as it is the week before Halloween, so they have a guy working in the parking lot to get customers in and out of parking without too much hassle.  What a GREAT idea!  I really appreciated how easy they made it.
