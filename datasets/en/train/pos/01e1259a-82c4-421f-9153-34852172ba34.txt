Nice place!  The servers, and staff are all very friendly.. The food was really good!  My favorite is the chocolate crepes... My husband had the Joynt Benny, and he really liked that.  My kids had strawberry french toast and pancakes and the whole group was happy..  It's a busy place, but worth the time, and wait.  The owner even came to our table to make sure we were all enjoying our meals.. Family place and I can recommend.
