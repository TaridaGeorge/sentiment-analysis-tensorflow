The fact that I have yet to write my review of Nami should be an insult to vegans and sweet lovers everywhere!

Nami, short for Tsoynami, is heaven on earth. or the moon. jupiter. wherever there is heaven, there is Nami.

Soy "tsoft" serve ice cream. Winkies. Snickerdoodles. Various cupcakes. Various cakes. Coffee with a choice of soy, almond, rice, and even hazelnut milk!

Although they have only done it once, Nami is planning on running a regular Sunday brunch in February. I thought it was amazing when I went to the beta test. Multiple scramble options in addition to chilaquilles and other brunch creations. 

Do yourself a favor and stop by. If not for the treats, for the awesome dancing and singing always taking place!

PS... Cheddar and Chive Scone (thank me anytime)
