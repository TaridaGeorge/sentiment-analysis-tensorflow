I've been a Village member for 4 years. Although it has been criticized for its high membership fees/dues, it is WELL worth the money and I have never thought otherwise. The amenities, equipment, classes, and customer service are all TOP NOTCH (to say the least)!! I really feel like a superstar anytime I visit the club and even just a brief visit can put me in a great mood. I love how this place is more than just a gym- It's a spa. It's a restaurant. It's shopping. Its a great place for networking. Could go on an on about this place.... LOVE LOVE LOVE.
