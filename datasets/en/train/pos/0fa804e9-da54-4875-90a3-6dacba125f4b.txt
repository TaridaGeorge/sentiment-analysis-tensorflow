Everyone else Yelping about Cornish Pasty has already said it, so let me just echo the resounding chorus:  Pasty is the best.  The beer selection is beyond compare (plus, 3 dollar "car-bombs?"  YR KIDDING ME), and the food is amazing.  They can make vegan pasties if you call an hour ahead, so don't let dietary choices stop you from stopping in an enjoying the great service, dimly lit decor, and wonderful drinks.  Yeah, it's crowded, so if you're with a large group, you might have to wait to get the back table (it's worth it).  Certainly in the running for my favorite place in Tempe.
