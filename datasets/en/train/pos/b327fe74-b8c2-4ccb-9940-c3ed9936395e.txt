went there the other day for the second time, we happened to have coupons for a free burger, I ended up getting the Albacore Tuna sandwich with the sweet potatoe fries. Both were very flavorful and the tarter sauce on the sandwich was awesome. My husband got the Charburger and was equally as tasty. Last visit I got the tri-tip sandwich and was just as pleased. I would HIGHLY recommend it!
