I lurve me some Cornish Pasty Company (see previous Yelp) and new location doesn't let you down.  Food & Service as great as ever and considering they had only been open for a couple of hours when I got there, everything was spot on.  
I think I may enjoy this location better because of the look of it, definitely more open, bright and airy with great benches and long tables to accommodate you and about 6 other pals at a time.  
Oh dear, I've done it again.  Yelped about cornish pasties and now REALLY want one for lunch...must resist.
