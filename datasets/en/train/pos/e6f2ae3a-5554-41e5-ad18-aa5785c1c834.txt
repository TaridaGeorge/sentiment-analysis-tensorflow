Fantastic. I'm so excited to see these guys succeed. I went on a week-night with a friend, and the owner's parents were running the bar. They didn't know a heck of a lot about beer, but the brewmaster was on hand to answer questions, and they were a pleasure to chat with. The tasting room is nearly open to the production floor, so you can see the operation in action. 

The beer is rock-solid, especially the imperial porter. I was a little confused by the watermelon wheat beer, but I was glad that I tried it. And their flagship unfiltered ale is scrumptious. Too bad they're not in a better location, but clearly the emphasis is on making great beer, and pushing it around the valley. Great.
