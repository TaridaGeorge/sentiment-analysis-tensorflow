Hard to argue with the rest.  Being a weirdo and confined to a $30 limit on my expense report, I ordered the Salmon Nocoise Salad and was pleasantly surprised to receive a nice half filet with a great assortment of veggies.  Washed it down with a nice cool Stella.  

Service from the barkeep was great and the manager stopped by to say hi, even though they were a few minutes from closing.  Impressive.
