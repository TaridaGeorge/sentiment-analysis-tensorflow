The BEST cupcakes I've ever had period.  Perfectly moist, perfectly sweet.  Plus they are organic!  I picked up some organic cupcakes from Whole Foods over the weekend (just because I was there), and they were awful...The lesson?  Organic cupcakes can be delicious if you get them here.I think I would do anything for their Brown Velvet cupcake--not that the other flavors aren't good, that just happens to be my favorite.  Go here NOW and get yourself some!!!
