went there this morning after my spare tire went flat.  2 flat tires!  anyways....this place got me in and out in less than an hour and they actually stood by their warranties. i thought for sure i would get scammed but it never happened.  the service was great and everybody was very helpful. i will most likely only go to discount for now on.  what i thought would cost 300 bucks only ended up being 68 bucks.  included my new tire...a patch on my spare...2 more warranties...and balance!  not bad.  trust me.  my tires always hate me.
