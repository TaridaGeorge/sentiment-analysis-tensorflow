LGO is THE BEST pizza place in town... wait, in the country... wait, in the world!!! It is as good, if not better than Pizzeria Bianco too (minus the 4 hr wait). The sourdough crust is what makes the pizza, as do the high quality topics. My fave are avocado pizza with prosciutto, the mushroom one, and the gladiator (with sausage). Their breakfast, sandwich, and salad menus are excellent as well! It's fun to hang out in the "grocery" store next door where you can get good cheese, wine, bread, and little kitschy things. Their white sangria is the BOMB! And you can't beat the $6 bloodys and mimosas on the weekends. With the family-friendly laid back atmosphere and fun for all, this is a true Phoenix gem.
