Thumbs up Dutch Bros! 

It has come to my realization that I've been frequenting this place about twice per week since the sweltering heat began. 

I must say... they're stuff and they're staff is not bad. I'm a big fan of the blended Kahlua Kicker. I'm an even bigger fan when I get this drink for free, which happens as often as my visits here. You should try it. 

Despite the long line that forms during the nighttime, the gregarious guy with blonde hair never forgets to entertain with a liqueur bottle trick and good conversation. 

See ya!
