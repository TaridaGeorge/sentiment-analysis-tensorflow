We just came here yesterday for the Grand opening of This PetsMart, this is the one at 1140 W.Elliot Rd. Tempe.  It is very new and clean and shiny.                              They have absolutely everything you could want here. They have the Banner Pet Hospital, Dog training, Dog and Cat Hotel, and the Grooming station.  I was so impressed with everything that they carried.  They even have a wonderful little set up for all the poor Kitties that are up for Adoption.  We bought a great Kitty Carrier for our Cat and a wonderful leash and collar for our dog. Very clean, very nice, and no weird smell,as  some Petsmarts get.  Lots of parking in the lot as well as nice clean Human bathrooms.
