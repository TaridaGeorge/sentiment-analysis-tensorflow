In general, just a great NY style deli experience. I wish they would open in Boston,. Haven't been in years but went this week. Despite having an air head for a waitress you cannot beat the sandwiches, the depth of the menu and the quality of the food. yeah, sandwiches are 12 bucks or more, but you can get a half. The pickles are great. Soup in good., desserts are good. yummy yummy yummy.
