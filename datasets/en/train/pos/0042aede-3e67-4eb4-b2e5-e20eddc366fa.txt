If you're a hiker you'll love how convenient this park is.  The trails are in great condition and the views are spectacular.  My favorite is Siphon Draw including the trek up to the Flatiron.  The ranger at the station felt bad for my puggle, saying that it was a tough hike for the animal, but I beg to differ, my little "animal" pulled me up the mountain.  I recommend this park for families, dogs, and all types of hikers.  Also, make sure you bring your camera and start out early morning before sunrise to get great views.  Also, the park arranges a moonlight hike during a week of a fullmoon...I highly recommend this because the desert is so mysterious at night.  It has to do with the shadows from the moonlight I think.
