I operate the "Hot Dog Guy" Cart in Cave Creek, and have been using Suzanne's "Hot Stuff" Original Habenero Sauce on my menu for many years.  The guests LOVE IT!... It not only adds heat, but also imparts a very original and tasty flavor to popular menu items.... 

1. "DOGINATOR"... Polish Sausage, Spicy Brown Mustard, SUZANNE's HOT STUFF HABENERO SAUCE, Giardiniera, Onions, and sport peppers.  

2.  "BADA-BING, BADA-BOOM":  Like the Doginator, but instead I use a mega-jumbo Italian Sausage...  MMMMMmm!

"Thumbs up", to Suzanne's for offering this quality, fresh product! Suzanne and her staff are also very knowledgable about any of their sauce selections!
