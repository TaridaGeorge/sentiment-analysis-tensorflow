Two words: Celebration Champagne.

Start with that and go from there to enjoy a fun night out in Old Town. This place is always hopping with locals who know where to find this hidden hot spot. 

The prices for food are really reasonable, and the portions sizes are generous. I would sell my favorite pair of jeans for one of their grilled cheese sandwiches. The waffle fries are also delicious, as are salads, desserts, and the other sandwiches. 

I love the rotating art showcased, the sexy bathrooms, and the unique music at AZ88. When the weather is pleasant, sit outside and enjoy views of park and soft breezes. 

One complaint might be that it can get loud, but that's because people are drinking celebration champagne (or beers, wines, or just plain water). AZ88 is fun with fantastic food. Go on, celebrate.
