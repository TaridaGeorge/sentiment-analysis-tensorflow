YUM!!!! This place has the best bread, especially the 140 calorie a slice variety, which is loaded with seeds and grains.  Soooo good with peanut butter. I also love the Trek energy bars, I could eat these 24-7 they are so tasty.  I highly recommend the pumpkin cookies with white chocolate chips and also the gigantic snicker doodles.  Everything is so darn fresh and delicious, can't wait to go back for more!
