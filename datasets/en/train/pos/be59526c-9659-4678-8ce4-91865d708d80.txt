this place is very good what is not to like bowling alley next door u can get your toes down on the other side of the place if u want all within a 50 feet radius. seriously the food is great very cheap ok details beef broccoli very tender beef not like other places like your chewing a tire. they add mushrooms which is interesting but is very good with the combo of b/b i never been disappointed with anything here. the egg roll is ok really cant find a decent egg roll anywhere. always have take out so i dont know how the service is. if u like panda which is disgusting u will luv this place
