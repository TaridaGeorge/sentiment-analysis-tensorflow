I think you must be my most favourite coffee shop in North America. 

You bring that homey continental feeling to your locale, the kind that is hard to duplicate. 

I can envision your place in just about any country I have ever been to. 

And your food and beverages have that same feeling...

I am a loyal customer and fan!
