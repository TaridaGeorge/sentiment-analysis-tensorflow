Whoever said that British food was gross and bland has never tried this place. The owner Dean is an amazing person with a passion for his food and it shows in everything that is served. The best Guinness in Arizona to go with a filling Oggie, the traditional pasty. I found this gem while at ASU and make a stop there every time I'm in the valley.
