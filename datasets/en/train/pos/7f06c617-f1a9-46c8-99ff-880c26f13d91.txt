For that day when you want to eat healthy and are feeling a little adventurous, head over to Mandala Tea Room for lunch.
It's not crowded, and the servers are attentive and fun.
My meal at the vegan eatery was a "raw pad thai salad." Sounds odd, tastes great!
My friend raved about the "b" l t.
Enjoy your "adventure."
