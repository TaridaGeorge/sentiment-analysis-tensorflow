Love this place to go get a Mani/Pedi. Clean, nice decor and the owners are super nice. They do a great job and prices are great! I had walked by thi place for years and finally decided to go. I shouldn't of waited to go becuase they are fabulous. The place is packed all the time, but stil has a relaxing atmospere. I took my Mom there and she loved it, she states ...best Pedicure she had in her life.  I am a regular there and will continue to go there!
