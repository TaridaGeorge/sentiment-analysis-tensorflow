If you are looking for "posed", formal, stuffy photos, Danielle is not for you.

If, however, you are looking for artistic, creative, candid, beautiful photos that perfectly capture the moments in your life that you want to preserve forever...Danielle is definitely for you.

I can't say enough about how pleased I am with our photos.  Here are a few on her blog:

And I can't say enough about Danielle--the marriage between her talent and her desire to creatively capture you/your family/kids/pets/wedding exactly how you want them (and then some) is nothing short of perfection.
