This Event was a mixture of so many very good things. It was so good in fact that I will be trying to attend as often as is possible. There was great music , comedy, variety acts  and well beautiful women. I love that this show has real women, I did not see one breast implant there was thick and skinny but they were all very lovely. All the women on that stage exuded amazing amounts of confidence and sex appeal. If you are going, make sure to take lots of loose bills to throw up on stage. This show is worth every penny you pay for it and then some.  Romantasy Cabaret is definitely one the best events to attend in Phoenix Area !
