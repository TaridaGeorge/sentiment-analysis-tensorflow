THE very best wings!! 
The raspberry-chipotle wings are unreal. If there is breading on this, I can't tell! Tastes like premium white meat chicken that is cooked to perfection.Truthfully they are so good, I have yet to eat anything else at this place and have been going for years. 

The beer is served ice cold and the wait staff and bartenders are very friendly.

This is a great place to hang out and catch a game.

Doesn't matter if you come with a group or roll here solo, this place serves up quality food at great prices...especially  happy hour!
