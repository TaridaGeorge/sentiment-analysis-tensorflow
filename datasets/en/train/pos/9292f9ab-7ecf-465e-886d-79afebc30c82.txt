Love. Love. Love this place. Yummy cheese, nut & fruit platter is my fave. Super yummy and very filling. But also shared the Nine iron and it was great. Happy hour is the best time to go to try it out first to see if you'll like it. But really, you don't need a test drive with this place. It's a "sure thing" that you'll love it if you have the taste for casual dining with class. ENJOY!
