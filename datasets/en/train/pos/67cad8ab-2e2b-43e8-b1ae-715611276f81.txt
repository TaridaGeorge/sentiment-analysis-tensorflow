I've looking for almost a year now for a great spot to get manicures/pedicures.  I FOUND IT!  Am very impressed with my experiences at 8 Pretty Nails. 

Have been here (3) times, alone, with GF, and with teenage daughter.  The employees are polite and professional.  It is very clean and attractive.  They have spa liners which they replace after each customer.  They have new instruments in package for each customer.  

Great, relaxing experience each time. Great job and manicures and pedicures, usually last 2 weeks.  LOVE THIS LITTLE GEM IN SURPRISE for pampering!

My nail technician is Angie: SUPER!
