Can I get a "god damn" for the best New Yorker in town.  I think its the cold slaw that has a sweet flavoring that matches well with everything.  If you haven't tried the New Yorker....get it done already, if you haven't tried Rocket Burger.....then you are neglecting yourself.  It's great food at super great prices!
