When given a list of places to go for an x-ray, I chose this location for the simple fact that it was close to my home.  I called ahead of time and they let me know there was no wait, so I headed on down.  Quick processing time and friendly staff!  Everybody was courteous and quick, and they let me know that my x-rays would be delivered to my doc the next day.  Thanks for the pleasant and timely visit!
