I took my 2 yorkies there a couple of weeks ago for the first time. They hadn't been groomed in about 4 months and spend a lot of time playing outside so they were looking pretty grungy. When I brought them in the owners were working and were so polite and nice. I could tell that my dogs were going to be well taken care of. They put into the system the specifics about how I wanted my dogs groomed and were helpful in explaining the different cuts they could do on yorkies. A few hours later they were ready and they looked great! It was a great deal at $30 each and they looked awesome! I was so pleased I will definitely be bringing my dogs back again. I'm so glad to have found an affordable groomer nearby!
