This is an amazing little treasure in downtown Phoenix. Being from Houston and frequenting NYC regularly, Breadfruit is the perfect little mix. It is situated on a quiet street reminicent of midtown in Houston. The authentic food is so NYC-spicy and savory.  I had the Jerk Shrimp and it rocked. The spice was hot enough to satisfy my appetite. The sweet potatoe pudding was a great way to top off the spicy shrimp.  The staff is super friendly and accomodating. I loved the sidewalk bistro set up. Coffee is served in a French press.  Between the charm and wonderful food, I am going to crave this place all the way from Houston.
