Thankfully this is more than a leap away from me, you see, I have little or no control when it comes to custards of the frozen persuasion. 

The flavor of the day on my recent visit much to my delight was coconut custard. I was transported to a coco-nutty paradise of creamy delight. Rich tasting, smooth, with just the right amount of coconut.

Service was most friendly and efficient, although we were the only customers there, so not sure how they perform under combat conditions.

Awesome!
