My preconceived notions of Scottsdale as a place where you have to dress nice to get any service got stopped here at Guess. Walking in with jeans and old converses, I didn't expect to get much help. I haven't actually gone shopping in a long time for myself, so with a $400 gift card in tow from Christmas, I was ready to blow it. Blow it all. 

I was like a kid in a toy store. The sale reps were really helpful and was able to find my sizes and colors. As trendy as this place can be, it has lots of variety as far as casual dress, party dress, and clothing for almost all seasons. Love it.
