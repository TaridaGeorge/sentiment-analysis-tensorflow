Of the three different music supply stores I stopped in, Central Music is the only one I would go back to. 

Their selection of music is extensive and their staff are friendly. If they don't have what you're looking for in stock, they will either download it for you on the spot or have it delivered in a few days. 

I like that the staff left me alone to search through the racks. I never felt like someone was hovering over me but I always felt like there was someone available to help. 

The racks are extremely easy to understand and locate what you're looking for. And of course they have step ladders every to aid the vertically challenged. 

Happy music making!
