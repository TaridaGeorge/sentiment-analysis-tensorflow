I LOVE southwest!!  One of the only remaining airlines in the states that gives you free snacks and drinks for your flight.  Attendants look like they actually like their jobs, and also look under the age of 35, which is a rarity these days.

I love the comedic safety info, as it really gets you to listen.  The seats aren't the most comfortable, but the flights aren't actually that long, so I was fine.

I actually love the no seating assignment rule, too.  You are still, to a degree, getting to choose who you sit next to/where on the plane you sit.  I personally tried to avoid people with babies (sorry, I like to sleep).

One thing I'm dying to know, though, is why southwest passengers take longer ton disembark from the plane than any other airline?? Hurry up, people!
