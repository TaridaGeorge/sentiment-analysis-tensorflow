D'lish is a GREAT breakfast and lunch spot in Tempe. Thus far I have had the Turkey Club and Kitchen Sink salad. All ingredients are fresh, healthy, and made to order, and I've been very happy with my meals! And what would a coffee shop be without great coffee? NOM. Very delicious coffee. I like that there is inside seating, a patio, and a drive thru. My classes are at the law school in Tempe and I can zip over there in between classes to grab a bite. Not to mention that the staff is SUPER and super nice. Very happy that D'lish opened a tempe location!
