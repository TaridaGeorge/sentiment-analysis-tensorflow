Best restaurant / best pub food I've had in the greater Phoenix area.  I got the salmon BLT sandwich and it blew me away.  The bread is really what set it apart from your ordinary sandwich.  I wish they had a Four Peaks in Manhattan.  I would be a regular... I will go back every time I'm in Phoenix fo' sho'.
