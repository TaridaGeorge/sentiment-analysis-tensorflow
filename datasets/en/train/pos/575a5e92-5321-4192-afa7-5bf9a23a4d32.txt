This is where all bottles of liquor aspire to reside! Imagine a warehouse of spirits of all flavors, colors, families. The wine selection is wicked good. Head to the back for a local AZ selection (yes they craft wines in our home state!). 

There's an abundant selection of fine spirits, beer, and alcoholic "trinkets". I'd love to see Total Wine run a 5 cent wine sale like their competitor does. It's a great way to try something new without breaking the bank. Staff is extremely friendly & knowledgeable. Never be afraid to ask them a question or make a recommendation. There are "hints" throughout the store to spotlight new labels, and top scoring wines. 

When in doubt for gift hunting, a gift card from Total Wine is almost a sure fire hit with any friend or family member who enjoys a drink after a long day of work. Cheers!
