I can only comment on the food and delivery here, since I haven't been inside this particular location. 
The delivery was fast (under 30 min) and everything was just as I ordered. The pizza was hot and really quite delicious. Soft crust and the perfect ratio of cheese and sauce. I also had a salad that was fresh, crisp, and had lots of toppings (crunchy croutons, chopped onions, finely sliced mushrooms, fresh green peppers and cold dressing on the side). 
It all really hit the spot and I was impressed by every aspect! I recommend giving it a try for the quality and freshness.
