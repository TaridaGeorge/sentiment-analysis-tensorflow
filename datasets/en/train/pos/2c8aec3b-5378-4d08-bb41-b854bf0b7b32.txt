IN-N-OUT is the -KING- of fast food burger places! I am from SoCal is so is IN-N-OUT.  They are a HUGE hit there, but it's not as much, here in Phoenix I've noticed. Double-Double is a like a backyard burger..delicious! Crispy lettuce, lots of fully-melted cheese (not kinda melted like at most fast food places). Fresh fries from potatoes that they chop up right there in their store, thick shakes made with real ice cream! ....The prices are very reasonable because they stick to the basics: Burgers, Fries, Drinks & Shakes...That's it... No salads or chicken or fish sandwiches here! ....The Best over ALL others!
