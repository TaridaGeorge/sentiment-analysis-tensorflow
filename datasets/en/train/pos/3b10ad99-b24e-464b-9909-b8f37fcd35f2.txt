I got my brakes checked out here and i feel they were very nice and explained everything to me honestly, usually I feel pressured to get more done than what I intended when I go to auto shops but they weren't pushy at all and they even let me use the coupon I had for $50 off. I will def come back here for any further service needs. Nice people here for sure.
