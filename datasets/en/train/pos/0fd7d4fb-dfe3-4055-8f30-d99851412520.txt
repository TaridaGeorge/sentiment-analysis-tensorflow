Wow. Wow. Wow.

I am done with CVS, Frys, Walgreens, Target and Walmart pharmacies.

One of my medications was not covered anymore by my insurance. A pretty important one I might add. Anyway, we are trying to figure it out and I stop by to let them know what is going on. 

You know what they did? The nice man GAVE the medication to me. For real. Just handed it to me. I have never heard of such kindness and generosity in this world. I would have never had this happen at any of the pharmacies above.

I am stunned and so overwhelmed by their caring staff. Life is good.
