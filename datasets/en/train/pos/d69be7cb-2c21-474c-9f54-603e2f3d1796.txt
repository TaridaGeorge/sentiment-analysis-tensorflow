Ok what people say about service, ambiance and all that is right. But the staff is friendly and they fill up the water diligently during the lunch buffet! And they get 5 stars. The food is delicious. I've been at least 8 times-- basically every Sunday I am in Arizona. Consistently great vegetarian buffet.
