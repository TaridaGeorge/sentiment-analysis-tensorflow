LOVED going to this place when I lived in Phoenix! Always thought it was a bummer that they were only open for lunch M-F.  Never had a bad meal and always looked forward to the next lunch with co-workers.  It was always worth the wait for a table.  Recommended to everyone that was looking for good barbeque.
