This is my favorite spot in Phoenix and as such is my "go to" place for everything (bdays, brunch, lunch, just because, etc).  Typically my order looks like...
Honey Cucumber Lemonade, Chicken & Mozzarella on Ciabatta & Bruschetta (Salami w/Pesto, Mozarella w/Tomatoe and Basil, Ricotta w/ dates & the Bacon one). 
However, I will say that the french toast is awesome (I crave it often)!  To be blunt, I haven't tried anything I didn't like here.  

I've been to the Arcadia location, but this one (on Central) has a better vibe during the day. Its brighter and I've found that the servers and patrons are friendlier.
