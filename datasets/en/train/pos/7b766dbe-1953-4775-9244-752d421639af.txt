Five stars for Yogurtland.  The red velvet, peanut butter, and peanut butter cup flavors are all fantastic.  The original tart is also good.  Toppings are self-serve, so you can get a sampling of a few toppings and just pay by the weight.  They did not have mini m&ms or mini chocolate chips but I happily settled for regular-sized carob chips.  The packaging is also worthy of five stars: no evil styrofoam, and they even have special biodegradable spoons.
