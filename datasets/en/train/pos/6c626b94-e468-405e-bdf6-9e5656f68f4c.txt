Anyone who knows me understands that about 97% of my time in Phoenix was spent at Lux. Fantastic atmosphere, friendly regulars and staff, overall one of the best coffee shops I've ever visited.

Right next to the lightrail and in a newly renovated  (and might I add: very nice) spot, Lux is usually extremely busy, but I've never had a problem finding a nice spot to sit. Great location for an exceptional cup of coffee and a chance to make a billion friends.
