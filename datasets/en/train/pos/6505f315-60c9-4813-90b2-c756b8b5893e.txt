I found this place on OpenTable.com and went there for Valentine's Day.  Gorgeous views overlooking Fountain Hills and the fountain.  Food is very decently priced (less than $30/plate), and the menu is simple; but don't let that fool you.  The food is wonderfully prepared, and the special(s) are wonderful! They have a wonderful wine area just inside the resort area as well.  Highly recommend it for a romantic setting! Great patio area as well!  Not recommended for kids tho
