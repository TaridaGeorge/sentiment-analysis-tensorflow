I've worked with Lara a couple of times now.  She took some photos of my husband and I with our dogs as well as being the photographer for my sister's wedding.  She does a great job!  She is sweet, relaxed, and makes you feel at home.  Edits and proofs are in your inbox before you know it!  I can't wait to do maternity and newborn shots with her in coming months.
