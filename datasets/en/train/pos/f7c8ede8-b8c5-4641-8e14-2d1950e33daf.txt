Great customer service, very good deals to be had, and a constantly revolving inventory make this one of the best stops to make in Phoenix.

I try to make it here a few times a month to catch some of the deals they consistently have.

Check out their crossroads of the west booth if you can; it is when they bring out the best inventory and often the best prices.
