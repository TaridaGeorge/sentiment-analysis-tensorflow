We were fortunate enough to have our hotel just a couple of blocks away from here (hubs would disagree with me on this  LOL).  Beautiful mall, great architecture and quite the eclectic mix of stores.  You have the high end icons like Neiman's and Barney's and Jimmy Choo but you also have Forever 21 and H&M.  There is the mandatory food court as well as some other nice restaurants attached and even nicer ones across the street.

If nothing else, this place is great for just walking around in (and sometimes getting turned around from it's configuration) and browsing which I would imagine is a good thing when its searing hot outside.  Wish I had had more time to explore but I got hung up in a few stores.  When we return to Scottsdale I will so be returning here and with more space in my suitcase!
