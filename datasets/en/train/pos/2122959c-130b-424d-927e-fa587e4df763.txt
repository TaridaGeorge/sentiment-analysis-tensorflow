I LOVE Noble Beast! If you have a dog who eviscerates normal toys, check out the deer antlers...they last forever, don't make a mess and are only taken when naturally shed so they're cruelty free.  They also have tons of natural and organic food options and super cool collars and leashes. Phoenix needs more places like this.
