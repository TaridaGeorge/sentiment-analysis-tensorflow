I love this place. The only downside was that it was hard to find parking but that isnt surprising since it was a Friday night in a college town.

These popsicles/ paletas were amazing. I have tried the frozen ones that you can buy from mexican convenience stores but I have never had it fresh like this. I tried the mango one and it pretty much melted in my mouth. I could taste the fresh mango and it was gone before I knew it. For ~$2.50 each it is cheap considering the quality. The shop is cute with articles about itself all over the wall. The staff was super friendly and helpful. I wish this place was in California but it is probably a good idea that it isnt otherwise I would be broke.
