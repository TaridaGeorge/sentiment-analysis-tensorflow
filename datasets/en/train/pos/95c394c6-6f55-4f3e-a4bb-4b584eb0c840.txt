I was in town with a couple of buddies for the Dodger's spring Training. This was the only restaurant we recognized back from Cali so we stopped by. 

1.house brewed  Hef
2.Hummus and Goat Cheese Salad
3.Pulled pork.

Enough said :)

Before we drove back to Cali we had to stop again for take out ..and I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. yum.
