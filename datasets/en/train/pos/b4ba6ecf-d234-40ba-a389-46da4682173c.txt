Growing up in PA, I had no idea that "Philly Cheese Steaks" really were only in Philadelphia. I just always assumed they were one of the basic food groups, and took it for granted that everyone had them.

Not so. 

Corleone's is the only place in Phoenix that makes them for real. Maybe they could use just a little more grease, but they have wiz, which almost makes up for it. Also, the guys working here the night I visited reminded me of the beefy guidos who work Reading Terminal Market.
