I love this place. Starting with the ambiance, which is small, dark, cozy, and Italian, I was impressed. We came on a cool rainy night and sat at the bar, right in front of the wood-fired oven, and the owner made friendly conversation with us the whole time.

We split the Biaggia (prosciutto, goat cheese, fig spread, EVOO) and the Dona (mozzarella, pancetta, roma tomatoes, parmesan, and tomato sauce). The crust was perfectly chewy and had a slightly sweet flavor, which I love. The toppings were fresh and high-quality. I just wish we had more room, because we also really wanted to order the egg and pancetta pizza. Next time... and there will be a next time!!!
