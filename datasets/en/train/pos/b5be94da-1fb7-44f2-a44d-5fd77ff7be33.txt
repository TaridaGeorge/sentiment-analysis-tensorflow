The rating is for their macarons.  Finally made it to the bakery when they were open.  Bought the package of mini macarons so that I could try a selection of flavors.  Oh, they are little pieces of heaven...  You must eat them slowly and enjoy the experience.  The raspberry with the filing that is flavored with rose petal essence are my favorite.
