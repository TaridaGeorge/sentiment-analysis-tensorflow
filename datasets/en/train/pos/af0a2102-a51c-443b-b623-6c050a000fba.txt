I'm the kind of guy who just cant get my day started without a cup of black-as-tar coffee, and nothing compliments coffee better than a good donut!

Sweethearts has a great variety of many delicious donuts. Of course Walmart, Fry's, Safeway, and the like all have bakeries, but none compare to the selection and quality of Sweethearts.
Service is always excellent as well!

Although their donuts aren't the cheapest, I'll remain a loyal customer as long as prices don't creep any higher.
