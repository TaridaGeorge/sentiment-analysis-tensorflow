Lot's of choices on sauce. My wife who absolutely hates BBQ will not step foot in this place. When I bring home the spare rib and tri tip combo she locks herself away in the bedroom. But the day I brought home babyback ribs instead she seemed intrigued enough to try them out. After eating half my slab she changed her mind about BBQ. Awesome portions, great price, great food. The one in Tempe off Dobson is just as good too.
