For the price this place is awesome.  The service you may find a bit slow, but if your not a scottsdale brat, and dont expect someone else to wipe your ass for you, you will love this place.  The lunch prices are unreal, and I've taken my kids here for there birthday at the teppanyaki tables - which we all loved.  The sushi is better than Ra for the price in my opinion.  So let me say again if you're not a snobby scottsdale brat you will indeed love this place.
