I absolutely adore this place! The food there is just exceptional! 

My favorites are the beef (and chicken) cold noodle and tuna bowl. I have to say this place serves the most tasty cold noodles that I haven't had in years! The tuna bowl is also my favorite. I recommend the sushi rice when order this dish. The tuna is fresh and the rice is very flavorful. 

The sushi and Udon there are also very good. I strongly recommend this place as it has the best Japanese food in town.
