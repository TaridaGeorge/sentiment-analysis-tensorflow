All I can say is YUMMY! Yesterday I went to lunch with a friend at Thai E-San. I got the Pad Thai noodle lunch special. All the lunch specials come with a soup of the day and egg roll for a great price. The soup had tofu and cabbage. I'm not a big fan of tofu, but the flavor was really good! It was sweet, sour and spicey and I didn't mind the tofu at all! I got the pad thai noodles "medium" spicey.... wooohooo, the medium spicey cleared my sinuses! It was on the little spicey side for me, but flavorful enough for me to keep taking another bite! The meal ended with a few slices of watermelon, which was perfect to cool my lips and mouth with. I can't wait to go try another dish. The food, service and value will make me come back!
