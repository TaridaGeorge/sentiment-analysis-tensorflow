We arrived before 3  on a Sunday, so technically they were not open for dinner, but we were warmly welcomed and treated to some sakis left over from a tasting held last night. We had the Shabu-shabu, which was amazing, and the yellow tail sashimi was melt in your mouth delicious. I had soft shell crab, and we shared the spicy salmon roll...fantastic dinner beginning to end!!!  At the end of the meal, we were treated to some soy milk dessert saki...great send off!
