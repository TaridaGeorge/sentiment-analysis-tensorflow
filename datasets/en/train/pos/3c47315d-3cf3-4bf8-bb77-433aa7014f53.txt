I had NO idea that a place called The Arrogant Butcher would feed me one of the best meals I've had in my life on 11/18/11.  I was giving my friend the side-eye when he suggested it.  Cuz I already know meat eaters look at us vegetarians crazy when we go someplace OBVIOUSLY meat-affiliated then want to complain, "There's nothing here for me to eat!"  But he insisted, so I went with it.

Umm...the Sweet Potato Tortelli is the BUSINESS!   Sweet potatoes, mushrooms, brussel sprouts and hazelnuts?  Who'd a thunk it?  Wow!  The combination of flavors and texture play...I could eat this all day...like for real-for real.   For dessert, we had yummy "hot chocolate" cake.  I left belly-full and grinning.  Just a few blocks from Stand Up Live, this was a great way to end a night of comedy!  The bonus:  they validate parking.
