I have been here a couple times now and thoroughly enjoyed myself both times.  First time I came for drinks and the bartender there is awesome.  The atmosphere was great, sitting at the bar with other patrons it is very easy to strike up conversations with others because the bar is so small:).  The first time I came I only had drinks at the bar (pomegranate 40 martini... so good!) the second time I had drinks and appetizers.  For the appetizers we decided on the crudo, the days Italian fresh fish sashimi which was a ahi tuna, this was really good.  We also had the artichoke with bread crumbs appetizer, this was awesome!  I can't wait to come back and try some entrees!
