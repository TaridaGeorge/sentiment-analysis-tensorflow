Wow! Just wow! Totally worth the cost of all you can eat. The sushi was my favorite and the entire reason I will return and recommend anyone who doesn't like buffets to give this place a try. It's definitely not the average buffet with hit or miss options. The spread was amazing with crab legs, oysters, tons of dessert. Kid friendly selections as well. Our waitress was very nice and we even used the $5 off yelp check in coupon.
