We attended a private event here on the upstairs patio, which they had rented out. My review pertains to this experience, which included drinks and appetizers. I can not comment on actual meals, or wait service. 

The patio itself was cute ,with its own bar upstairs, and the ambiance was lovely at the sunset hour. Everything here is TRENDY and we liked the lollipop chicken, bacon/Ruben melts, and artichoke dip. 

The drinks were great and I liked my margaritas a lot. The bartender was friendly and made drinks quickly. I think this woukld be a great area t consider renting out for a rehearsal dinner or work event.
