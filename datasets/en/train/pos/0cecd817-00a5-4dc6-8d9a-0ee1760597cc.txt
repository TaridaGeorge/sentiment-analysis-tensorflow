I had such a great experience at this location yesterday! I went in to get a Nabi tablet or a leappad2  for my son. I wanted some hands on usage before I spent so much. They did not have the Nabi, but the clerk (Merissa) spent a lot of time explaining what they did have, comparing different kid-friendly tablets and when they would be available. She was busy in the electronics department and had others with questions waiting, and she did a good job of juggling all of our needs. She went the extra mile and actually found the tablet I finally chose altho she did not think it would be available for several days. 
I was also helped by another friendly employee, who located a hard-to-find item for me but I did not get his name.
I will visit this store more often because of these encounters.
