I have been going to Mama Javas with my daughter  since she was was 9 months old. I love this place. Seriously!
 The coffee is awesome, the location is as well. And the big table in the back room is perfect for spreading out a bunch of light plots to review. 
 I just stopped by earlier last week and saw they had re done the back room a bit, and it had a much better layout.
 The food is good, especially the potato knish. I wish they had an actual kitchen, but since they are a coffee shop and not a restaurant, I can give them a pass.
 And the live music is great as well, really I wish we had more places like this, but then again, I guess that you shouldn't mess with perfection.
