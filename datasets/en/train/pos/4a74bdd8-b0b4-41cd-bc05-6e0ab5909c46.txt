Had an excellent brunch Sunday.  Just a warning the wait is a long and I was one of the lucky ones that found a seat inside to wait. I did notice a lot of people waiting outside in the heat for well over a half an hour.   Service staff was super friendly and our server Michael had stopped in several times checking if I needed anything which was nice cause the place was packed.  Got the number 3 lo lo's combo with chicken and waffles, opted for all white meat which was a couple of dollars extra.  Chicken and waffles were perfect! Portion sizes are huge, I only got about 1/3rd down, and took the rest home for dinner.  Very good food here, I probably will only come back once or twice a year though cause it's such naughty food.  I will take visitors here for a splurge though!
