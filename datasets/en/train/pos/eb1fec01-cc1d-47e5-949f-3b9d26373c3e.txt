i would seriously take this place over any chinese food mega buffet. those places usually smell weird and are horrifically humid. am i wrong?

yes, the buffet is small. but the food is excellent, and all the meat dishes are accounted for. the sesame and orange chicken have a crispy texture and just the right amount of sauce. they have a decent almond shrimp offering. i also thought the chow mien was very fresh.

the owner is extremely friendly. they only opened a few months ago, and so far they're breaking even. i hope everyone will stop by and give this place a shot so these nice people can actually bring some money home for their hard work.
