Seriously - as good as it gets! Amazing menu and great food to boot! Myself and friends got vegan chili fries, crab puffs, no chicken parm, and it seemed like lots of other things all EXCELLENT! 

The same person owns the ice cream place next door...great soft serve and treats. Be sure to check out the "winkie" (a vegan twinkie!)
