My family has been coming here since I was a little girl. For over 20 years now...

Ray, the owner, feels like a family member. I love that he chats it up with his customers. The guy is hilarious and makes you feel like a valued customer.

On to the food...did I mention I've been coming here for at least 20 years? I have had EVERYTHING on the menu and LOVE it all! It is authentic and delicious. I lived in Hawaii for a few years after college and whenever I'm missing the islands I head over to Aloha for some ono kine grindz :)

Simple place, casual, no frills. Classic plate lunch style. 

The best Hawaiian food in AZ, no question. You need to go.
