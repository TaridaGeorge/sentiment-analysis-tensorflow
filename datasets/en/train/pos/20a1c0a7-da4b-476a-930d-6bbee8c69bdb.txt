GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.  At first you might feel like the portions are small but they are doing you a service and saving you room for dessert.  Some of the best food I've had in ages.  I went with 3 other people and everyone's meal was great.  Salad superb,  the scallops to die for.  The duck just melted in your mouth.
