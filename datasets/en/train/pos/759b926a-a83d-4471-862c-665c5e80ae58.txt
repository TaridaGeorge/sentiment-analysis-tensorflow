Was first introduced to Penzy's by my sister with Chip and Dip seasoning. Then some English Prime Rib Rub, Cayenne Pepper... and I'm definitely hooked! Recently bought some vegetable soup base, and I highly recommend it. We have a vegetarian in the house, so this really helps so we can all enjoy soups together. Very easy to find at Tempe Marketplace. On the pricey side, but worth every penny for such wonderful flavors!
