Wow!  Best sushi I have had in a while.  

I went here with 4 colleagues after a round of golf at GrayHawk down the street.  We were seated promptly and the staff was super friendly.  

We had close to 15 different rolls, some wine, and sake.   It was the best dinner of our trip and can't stop thinking of how good it was.  Highly recommend this place.
