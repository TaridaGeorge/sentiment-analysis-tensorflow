Okay, the 5 stars is for one thing and one thing only. My diet coke first thing in the morning. I don't know why McDonald's diet cokes are so good, but they are the best fountain cokes around.

This location is nice in the early mornings to get in and out. Be careful later in the day as the drive thru gets very congested due to the location.
