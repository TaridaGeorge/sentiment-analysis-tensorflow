Get the Omakase (It means I will entrust you with my food).  Literally mindblowing if you don't mind shelling out a benjamin Koji-son will rock your world.  Also ask what fish they have in fresh.  It's one of the very few sushi restaurants with fresh never frozen fish.  (That also means it's not shipped frozen)  Insane food and incredibly small location so plan ahead and expect a wait.
