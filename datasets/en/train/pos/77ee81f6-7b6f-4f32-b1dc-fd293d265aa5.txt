Thai Basil is the best Thai food I have ever had.  If you are a fan of Thai or have never tried it..it doesn't matter because you will love it.  My favorite thing is the Peanut Curry (Spicy).  It is so flavorful and large portions.  The service is very quick and they remember you when you come back.  One of the best restaurants in the Valley!!!
