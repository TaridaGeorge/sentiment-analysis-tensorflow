This is my favorite place to eat and hang out at in Chandler. The food is amazing and the people who work here are fantastic. I dont even know where to start with the food and beer because everything is seriously to die for. Brian, Mallory, Haley, Lindsay, Kim, Amanda, to be specific, are amazing, and blow me away with how friendly, courteous, and sweet they are. That is why I come to this place almost everyday. It's hard to find places nowadays that make you feel like your at home, they value your business, and care about what they are doing. The people who work here and owners definitely know what they are doing. If you have not been here yet, GO NOW. LOL
