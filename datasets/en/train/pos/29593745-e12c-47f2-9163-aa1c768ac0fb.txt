5 stars all the way!!!!
We came here after our NYE celebration.. and it was one of the best choices we made that weekend! It's located in the beautiful mall of Scottsdale and on a nice day, you can sit outside by the water. Our entire group left wanting more.
The ambiance is great.. they even have live music on Sat's/Sun!! I ordered the vanilla bean yogurt parfait and the Greek chicken salad.. and It was to DIE for! I was also excited to find out that they have one in Newport Beach.. can wait to check it out!
