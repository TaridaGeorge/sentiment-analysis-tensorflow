I've now been here quite a few times, most recently last week for lunch with a coworker. This place is solid and consistent in every aspect. Great service, the food is amazing and tastes like "home" - every time. I love being on their mailing list, as they often send updates on off-menu specials, live music and more. Can't remember if it was May or July, but I know their one-year anniversary was recently. The first of many, I hope!
