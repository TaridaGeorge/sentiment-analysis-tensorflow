I think it's called a lab so that we know they take coffee seriously.  I almost never drink coffee black, but theirs was so flavorful with a hint of sweet spice, I went without my normal dousing of half/half.  Plus I ate an awful lot of cheese while I was in Arizona.

They brew a fantastic product, and serve it up in an environment that is edgy and artistic without being dirty, overbearing, or pretentious.  A terrific feat, that.

I feel compelled to mention that while my boyfriend's fancy Mac suffered serious sluggishness on their wireless signal, my cheap corporate Dell performed beautifully :P
