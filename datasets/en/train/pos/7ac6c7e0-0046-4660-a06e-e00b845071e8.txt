I love this place! Coming home from San Francisco, this it's the only delicious thai food that comes close. The green curry special with avocados and chicken is to die for but it was a tad sweeter than I had expected, so if recommend medium spiciness.

Their portions are medium to large for the price and quality.

The bar tender/server we had was older but she was as excited as if she were 21 again and she let us take advantage of happy hour by buying drinks right away but not getting then served to us until later.

Overall, great people, great service, delicious food!
