We've been eating here at least once a month for years. Family run business, very friendly. The Dad gets a little grumpy at times, so do I. The Gyros sandwich and Falafel sandwich are good. The french fries are the best we've found in the area. Like the BBQ Ribs and Chicken. The sauce is not real spicy, but good. They have lunch specials that come with fries and a drink.
