If you have ever been to one of these do-it-yourself frozen yogurt places then you know exactly what to expect... they are all the same. 

I have to give a shout out to Yogurtland though as they were probably the most friendly, clean and inviting yogurt places I have been. The spoons they use are biodegradable which is pretty awesome (and in two bright super saweet colors hot pink and neon green), and they have this spectacular water they offer for free that had strawberries floating around in it to give it a little flavor. Great idea! So good!

I'm totally, butt crazy, in love with......Yogurtland! ---- haha that one was for you G. ;-)
