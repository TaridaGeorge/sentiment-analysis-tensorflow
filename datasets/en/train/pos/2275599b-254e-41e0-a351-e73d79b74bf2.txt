My friend and I  purchased a visit to the Bliss Spa on Travel Zoo a very nice surprise.
I am so glad I went to this Spa, it is very small but people there make it very special, you feel like you belong to the Bliss Family. My first service was in June. I had the Ginger Scrub and the Hair Treatment, both very nice, my skin was very soft and the Massage was great. My second  visit was in July I just had to try the  tripple  Oxygen Facial, Cynthia explained all the steps and she did a fantastic job, I liked her very much.  
The Food at the W is good, the Pool area nice very comfortable Chairs and service 
was  very good.
I love to come back for some more service and I would very much recomend this SPA.
