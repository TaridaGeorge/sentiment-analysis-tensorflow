Cheap, fast, great quality food. I'm from the east coast and never understood the in n out hype but now I can say I am officially a convert. I think my boyfriend saying "this tastes like a burger I would take off the grill at home" sums the food up perfectly. It's not your typical frozen, preservative laden piece of meat. On top of that, the fries are fresh cut daily and are delicious. Would eat this over the other big name fast food joints any day of the week.
