This place is more like a restaurant than a museum cafe.  No foil wrapped burgers here... 

Yum, for the tostada salad and the chicken tacos.  Prickly pear lemonade was refreshing.  

The grounds are beautiful and with the outdoor fountains, you get a very serene feeling.

We ate here before entering the musem, but you can certainly just go here for a meal since it is in a separate building.
