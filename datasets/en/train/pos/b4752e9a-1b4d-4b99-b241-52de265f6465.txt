This place is so neat! Yes, I realize i just said neat. It is an outdoor classroom and nursery offering only edible fruit and vegetable plants. So much potential for growth not only for the space, but for sharing of information and ideas. Looking forward to many years of the Urban Farm Nursery and what it can teach me! Thank you Greg for always moving forward. You have taught us so much. Good people. Good work.
