The Clarendon Hotel is a great place to hang out all summer and winter long, even if you're not staying over night. Killer restaurants, awesome clientelle, always some good music on the rooftop and almost ALWAYS something to do.
Its cozy, down to earth, eclectic, with a high fashion type risk and somewhere where anyone who is anyone loves to lounge by the pool for various events summer status.
I recently won a one night stay, as it's been a hell of a year, and Ben Bethel is "just like the rest of us" trying to get by and help get by,
I'm highly impressed.
