Get the pampering you deserve with a manicure from Bernadette at Guilty Pleasures Nail Salon.  I started going to Bernadette in 1999 and only stopped because she tried the corporate world for a few years and temporarily left the nail business.  I am happy to say she is back in the nail business and looking to build her book of business.

Competitively priced in a convenient location in downtown Scottsdale, Bernadette will take great care of you and your nails!  I highly recommend Bernadette and hope you will give her a try.  She has a full array of nail services, including Shellacking and acrylics.

For great looking nails, fabulous service, and someone who truly understands you and your nail needs - go see Bernadette!
