Jen has been our pet sitter for a year now and we couldn't be more thrilled to have found her. She is very professional and always takes notes on the care instructions. We have 7 indoor cats and 2 outdoor ferals so it's great that Jen doesn't charge by the animal! She is reliable and great with our cats. They are all from the streets and even though they have been socialized they're not really friendly with people they don't know. But they all seemed interested in Jen and let her pet them the first time she came over - they must have sensed she was an animal person. We used to swap pet sitting services with friends prior to finding Jen but it's great to know we have a professional that spends time with the cats and really cares for animals.
