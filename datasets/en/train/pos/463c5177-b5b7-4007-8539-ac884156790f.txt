I LOVE this place!  I've been here a handful of times now, for both lunch and dinner.  Everytime I've gone, the staff has been super friendly and the sushi is terrific.  When it first opened, they used to bring out all sushi orders on those big boats, which I found kinda funny because sometimes there would only be two orders on there but they'd still make a huge presentation out of it.

They don't seem to do that anymore, at least not with the smaller orders.  I kinda miss that.  Maybe they don't have enough boats or something.  ;)
