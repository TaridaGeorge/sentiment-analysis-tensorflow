I can't find another library with the same feel as the Tempe Library.  Maybe it's because I grew up going to this library, but this is what a library should feel like.

It's quiet, the set up is fuss-free and simple so that it is easy to find what you are looking for and easy to browse!  It's been a couple of years since I've been there, but they had a new book section (fiction and non-fiction), and I really appreciated having that when I was just looking for a random book to read.

And there is plenty of parking.

Living in California now, I really miss the simplicity of going to the library, sitting for a while to read and then checking items out.
