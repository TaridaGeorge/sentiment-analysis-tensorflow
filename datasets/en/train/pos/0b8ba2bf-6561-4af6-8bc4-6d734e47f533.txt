I came in here during opening hours 11:30 am.  They were not set up and was going to be hours til they did open around 2:30p.m.  On the good note this must be very fresh and that is nice to know.  Vincent was very friendly and Gave me a card to return for one on the house.  When they were ready later in the day, I was surprised to see that he really cared about his customers and was very glad I made it back.  Now the gelato was Panna Cotta and Zuppa.  Both were very unique and delish and worth the wait on a very hot day..  Would surely return... This is true Gelato!   I am indeed a fan of this place even if I had to wait..
