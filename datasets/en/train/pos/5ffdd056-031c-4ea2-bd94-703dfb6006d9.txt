There is no point writing a full review with all the good things people have already said (accurately) about Cornish.  I only write to rank my favorites:

1) Carne Adovada
2) Peppered Steak (omgcreamybrandysauce)
3) Spicy Asiago Chicken
4) Pesto Chicken

P.S. GET THE BANOFFEE- I DON'T CARE HOW FULL YOU ARE.  
Only request- more beers on tap please!
