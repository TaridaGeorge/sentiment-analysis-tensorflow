What an amazing hotel! The complimentary breakfasts rock, the rooms are spacious and just perfect! Our room had an awesome side view of camelback from the balcony and the quiet environment was the best. Though it was quite chilly to go swimming, I do regret not swimming in their heated pools during my stay. I would definitely stay here again!
