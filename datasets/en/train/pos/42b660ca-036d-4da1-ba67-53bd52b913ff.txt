I guess it's 5 stars.  It's the only one in Arizona.  I assume they stock most of the kits available now, there's a giant wall with bins of parts you can purchase by the cup (2 sizes), and lots on display (behind child-proof windows).  The store is clean and adequately staffed.  What else do you look for in a LEGO store?  Although there were plenty of kids there, they were well-behaved for the most part and engaged, not out of control little lunatics.  My husband seemed pleased-and he's 34.
