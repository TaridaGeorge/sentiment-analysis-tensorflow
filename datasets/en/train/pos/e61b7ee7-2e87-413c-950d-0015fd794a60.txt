This is one of my favourite spots in Tempe. The staff is friendly and the food is excellent. I highly recommend the Thai Hummus as I have never been disappointed. If you go with the giant plate of nachos I was recently turned on to the fact that they are best with the blackened chicken on top. The bar is the best place to sit as all of their food is available at the bar and their bartenders are top notch. I often sit out on the patio as well and it is my experience that the waitstaff is not as knowledgeable as the bartenders and I have had disappointing service from them a few times as well. I go to the 8th Street Ale as my beer of choice but the RAJ IPA is also excellent and I recommend trying it if you see it on cask!
