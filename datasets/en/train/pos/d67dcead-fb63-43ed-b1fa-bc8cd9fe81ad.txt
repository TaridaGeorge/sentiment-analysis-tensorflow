I absolutely LOVE this event. It is truly something special. You must visit and if you can as an annual ritual during the month of December when the Luminarias is featured. There is a lot of work that goes into making this place so lit up and beautiful including all the volunteers and all the live bands and cooks for this event. If you are a Phoenix resident it pays to join the yearly Botanical Gardens membership. FREE parking. The entrance fee for this event is $25, however you are honored a $5 discount as a member.  I also recommend their buffet. It is only $17.95 a full course dinner meal, desert and beverage. Their spiced apple cider is addicting! Gorgeous grounds at night while it is lit up and they change the sculptures that are featured throughout the event from a particular Artist. I LOVE this place! :)
