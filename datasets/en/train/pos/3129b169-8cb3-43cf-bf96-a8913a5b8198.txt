I had an absolutely stellar experience at All Smiles.  

I finally got dental insurance, and made an appointment based on Alicia's review.  It helps that it's right down the street from my house too!

Everyone was just great.  The hygienist was sweet and chatty, and let's just say the dentist isn't too hard on the eyes, ladies....  He has some beautiful blue eyes!

I am just so pleased with the cleaning and service I received.  I will recommend All Smiles Dental to anybody!
