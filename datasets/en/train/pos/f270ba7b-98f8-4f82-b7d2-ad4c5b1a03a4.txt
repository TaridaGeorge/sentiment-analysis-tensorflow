Always a great experience here! Nearly all the staff is knowledgeable about pet food and treats and what is recommended for your breed.

We bathe our dogs here regularly and they always leave so soft and fluffy and smelling great. The music and fun, vibrant colors on the walls makes it a fun place to cross off one of your weekend chores!

There is also a great selection of supplements.
