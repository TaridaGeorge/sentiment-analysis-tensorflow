This restaurant was a great finding.  I would have never guessed it was located in a shopping mall.  The decoration and the designed of the place was amazing.  

Considering the fact that I'm not from AZ and I've read other reviews where people had mentioned they didn't think so highly of this restaurant because its part of Fox's.  The services, the food, the apprezitiers, the drinks and the staff were excellent.  

The food gets pretty pricey.  Be expected to pay about $150 for 2 people.
