Went to San Tan last Friday for the weekly EVFN. The place was packed but they blocked off a few tables for us and we were able to all fit which was very nice and things went great. 

The reason for the review is the Pretzel!! Order the Pretzel! You get two big Pretzels and trust me you will love the experience. It is one of the best Pretzels I have eaten and will order it again. In fact, if you go with someone you may have a hard time sharing that second one. That good!

I also had the sliders. At the Happy Hour price they were a a good deal and the taste was great!!
