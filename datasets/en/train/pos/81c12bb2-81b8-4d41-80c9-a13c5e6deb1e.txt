i wish we got out to see movies more often but with our new tv and netflix and recent addiction to entourage, we mostly watch movies at home. 

the movies are always fun. especially when the theater is not that full and you go for a matinee. otherwise, you're spending at least 20 bucks, more if you get food. sadly, matinees are now more expensive too. sign-o-the times...

this theater has tons of options and we've never had to wait long in line. patrons tend to be cognizant of the limited talking and cell phone use.
