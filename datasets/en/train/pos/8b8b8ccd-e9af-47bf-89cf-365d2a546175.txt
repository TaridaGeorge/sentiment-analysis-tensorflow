I have been eating here for years and have never had a bad meal... Super friendly staff and you can tell its family owned everyone is always happy to see you come in to dine. I always order the same thing the Gang Pang Chicken (Szechwan hot! Battered chicken with spicy hot peppers and green peppers) Lunch combo comes with an egg roll, fried rice and a crab puff... I really enjoy this meal each time I have it and trust me I have had it a lot I highly recommend it.
