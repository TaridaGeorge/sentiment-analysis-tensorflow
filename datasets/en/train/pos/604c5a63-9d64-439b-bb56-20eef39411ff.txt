Not obvious where it's at from the road (it's tucked back deep inside where it says (Farm At South Mountain) on the sign.  Cool atmosphere, birds chirpin, dogs running around.  Get your own coffee or water.  Food is farmed right there so everything is fresh.  Had smoky apple bacon, scrambled eggs, homemade biscuit, and russett potatoes which was mixed with beans or something, but REALLY good flavor.  If your near sky harbor, ya gotta go to this place for breakfast!
