High Tea...this is one of the best in the valley!

The beautiful environment, piano playing, and exquisite service is topped by no other place.

The chairs are so comfortable and the china so fine.

We started with high quality Darjeling tea followed by an array of tea sandwiches including egg salad, cucumber cream cheese, smoked salmon and a few others.  You can eat as many as you want!

The next course was two scones a plain and a cranberry served with delightful lemon curd, fresh strawberry jam  and my favorite clotted cream that was whipped!

The last course is the desserts.  Mini chocolate cake, raspberry cake,  lemon dessert,  chocolate covered strawberries and shortbread!  It's a nice place for a birthday they sing and make a big deal with extra dessert...

We left full and pleased!
