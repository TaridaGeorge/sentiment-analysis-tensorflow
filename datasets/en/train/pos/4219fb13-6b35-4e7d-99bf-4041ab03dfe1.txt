Just went to Boa Bistro/Caffe Boa today. They have an awesome outdoor seating area that is great to enjoy this wonderful weather. The Caprese panini, So cal love salad, and Voodoo penne vodka were all amazing. No, I didn't order all of them in one sitting but I did do a bit of sampling. :) I would highly recommend going because it doesn't seem to be too busy and they have a huge list of wines I'm looking forward to trying.
