This is no average Jo-Ann. I mean, yes, there are old ladies pushing by you to cut in front of you in the fabric line. And yes, there is a lot of fabric. But there is also a lot of other stuff! Very fun stuff, in fact! They have a ton of paint, including glittery spray paint (yes, I bought it). The clearance fabric is very reasonably priced from $2-10 a yard. The only downside is that there is so much stuff I basically have to ask for help anytime I want to find anything.

There are also classes! They cost about $25 each but they'll teach you fun skills like painting, sewing and quilting.
