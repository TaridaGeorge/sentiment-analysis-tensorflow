I love this little spot. 
Decent local coffee spot. The raisin bran muffin is to die for. USUALLY pretty friendly, knowledgeable staff. Though I think I've walked in a couple times to an upset irritable manager? It happens. I get it. I too, work in the industry. I live on 7th ave and the ambience is just beautiful for the area... Keeps me coming back again and again and again.
