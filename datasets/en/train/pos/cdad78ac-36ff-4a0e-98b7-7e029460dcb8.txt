My family and I have been eating here for at least the last decade. We always order the "house special dinner." This includes soup, egg rolls, chicken wings and several entrees depending on the size of your group. I can't speak for the other dishes but the ones we get with this are always superb. The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside but I would recommend this place to anyone.
