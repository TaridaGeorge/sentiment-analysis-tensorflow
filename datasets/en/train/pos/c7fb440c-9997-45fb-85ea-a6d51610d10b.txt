If you live in the SW Chandler, Ahwatukee or South Tempe area this is a great place to come for a glass of wine.  The food is superb, the cook formerly was employed at T Cooks at the Royal Palm, they have a nice happy hour and they have music on the weekends.  They also have a wine club that you can belong to and members get 2 bottles of wine monthly for a reasonably low cost.  We are also hosting a client event there in the next two weeks and the owner Zoya has been great to work with. We really enjoy the staff and all that MWC has to offer!
