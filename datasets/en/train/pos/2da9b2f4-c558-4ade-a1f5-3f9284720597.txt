If you're looking for a super chill bar to sit, relax, and enjoy a few beers with friends, Boulders is the place. Started by avid rock climbers who used to be employed at the restaurant that formerly occupied the business space, this place is a Tempe gem. 

Delicious food, a large drink selection, great happy hour prices, daily specials, and one of my favorite things to do while the night is young on Saturdays--Trivia.

Grab a group of friends, pick a horribly offensive team name, and get ready to play TRIVIA with some of Tempe's... smartest? Er-- People with as much useless random knowledge as you.

My only gripe is that this place can get HOT during the summertime depending on what area of the bar you're in. But hey, this is Arizona, you should expect this anywhere you go.
