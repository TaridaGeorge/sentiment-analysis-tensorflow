Oh the deliciousness. I am so happy that they opened a Fry Bread House closer to where I live. I love, love, love Fry Bread House's food. I normally get the Indian tacos, but in an effort to branch out, I recently tried the combo tacos with green chili beef and beans. It was, as expected, incredible. A taco so large and overflowing that I cannot finish all of it (that's what the husband is for). And this location is much larger than the Phoenix location- hope it catches on in the east valley and stays around! I love not having to drive in to Phoenix for Indian tacos! Yummmm.
