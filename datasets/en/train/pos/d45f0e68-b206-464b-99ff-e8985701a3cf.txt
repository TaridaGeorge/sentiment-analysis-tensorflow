I finally went to Palette. I loved it!  I'm not sure what I would say about it on the weekend.  I imagine the vibe is quite different than 7:30 AM on a Wednesday morning.  I had the "Egg", which was a layered creation of puff pastry, bacon and fried eggs, which was served with a generous portion of very fresh fruit.  The coffee was great and my cup was never empty.  The restaurant itself was beautifully decorated.  There isn't a single bad thing I can say about it.  I think I am going to go again this weekend.  I sampled my friend's choice (the seasonal french toast creation)... it was so good I have to go back to get my own plate.
