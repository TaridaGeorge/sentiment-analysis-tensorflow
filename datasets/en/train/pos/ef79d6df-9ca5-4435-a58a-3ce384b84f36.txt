Excellent second visit. Servers were fast, beer was served properly, and everyone was cool to hang out with.

My bill came to an even $20 (thank you for including tax in the PRICE) for three pretty darn good beers, including one 22oz Arrogant Bastard.

Sidebar...you're on to something good. Please god don't screw it up.
