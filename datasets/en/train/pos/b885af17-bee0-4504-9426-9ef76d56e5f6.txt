Had a delicious vanilla honey latte and a bacon jalape√±o frittata. Great place to meet with co-workers. I really appreciate the staff at Steve's. I left my iPhone under a napkin on the table but didn't realize it until I was at the airport and didn't have time to go back and search for it. It was found by the staff and Nima held it for me until my co-worker was able to pick it up & ship it to me! I will be a Steve's customer for life!!! Thanks Steve's Espresso.
