I love this place. my favorite is the Baltimore Suite or the Villa which is about $550-$1,600 per night depending on season.

Very professional and very clean. I always stay here for business and baseball tournaments. There are several pools and great food. The cost is well worth the service and clean rooms and comfortable beds. If you like being pampered, clean rooms and clean bathrooms with marble and granite, then this is the place for you. Money is well spent here.
