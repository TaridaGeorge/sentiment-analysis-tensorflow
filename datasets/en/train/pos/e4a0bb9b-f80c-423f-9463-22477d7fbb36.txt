Gelato is the new black.  It goes with everything and makes you feel skinnier than regular ice cream.  Which is why I can justify eating it almost every day.  

The fruit flavors are even sugar free (or is it fat free?  Whatever) so you can enjoy gelato without the guilt of DQ.

My staple favorites are the cookies n cream, snickers (ok so shannon and I go together once in a while), mint chocolate chip, and the oatmeal rasin.  Trust me.  

Despite popular belief (and all joking aside) The "G" Spot isnt as hard to find as some people think.  And you'll never want to leave once you get there.
