4.5 stars or nearly perfect (-1/2 considering the hefty price tag). The facilities are top-notch, however, my massage left me a little unimpressed.  (Obviously, the actual treatment will vary from person to person.)  Also had a classic manicure on a separate visit.  very happy with the results.  For both the staff were nice but again service will vary.

The facilities included the usual steam room, jacuzzi, and sauna.  In addition, there was a waterfall pool and eucalyptus aromatherapy room,  Despite being busy the service was pleasant and helpful.  Also, the fitness center was well equipped and the outdoor rooftop pool area was cozy.
