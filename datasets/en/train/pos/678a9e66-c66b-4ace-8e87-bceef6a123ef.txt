I love this place! The coffee shop itself has a lively, bright, open atmosphere.  I love coming here with some friends and talking and drinking or just coming with my laptop to catch up on some work while not being stuck in the house.

My favorite drink here is the Matador, but they are all good. And their drinks are served with homemade chocolate whipped cream. I would be a happy man just ordering a cupful of that! 

With as busy as they always seem, I am surprised parking is so easy. Especially with all the great shops in the strip Lola's is in.

I can't wait to come back. I might have to being my laptop so I have reaon to stay a while which will give me a chance to order two drinks. The Matador and something new....
