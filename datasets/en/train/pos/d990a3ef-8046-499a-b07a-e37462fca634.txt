Wow, just Wow! One of the best meals I've had in a looong time. Ordered the "Greek Pasta"  melted butter, garlic , oregano & fresh cut tomatoes , topped with feta cheese. This comes with a small side salad and a piece of garlic bread. The pasta was so tasty & fresh, the salad itself while unremarkable was made outstanding by the house dressing on the side. I've been here many times, never been unhappy with the food or the service. And such a reasonable price too. Give it a try you wont be disappointed.
