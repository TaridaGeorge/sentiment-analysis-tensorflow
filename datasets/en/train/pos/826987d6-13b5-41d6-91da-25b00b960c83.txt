The food and service is awesome.  You must try the pretzels with provolone cheese they are the best.   I have had the fried chicken and cuban before must haves.  The wife had the grilled cheese sliders she loved them.  Get the caramel popcorn for dessert.  One to eat there and one to take home.  Great prices great eats.  Oh yeah you can get beer in a paper bag for like 2 bucks........
