Just have to update my review because I had some awesome customer service last night. I showed up early for my movie last night and got my ticket and went shopping durring which i some how lost my ticket. I talked to customer service and the lady there was super nice and looked up my purchase on my credit card and told the ticket checker to just let me in. I am sure they get plenty of people trying to pull a scam and get in like this so I was honestly surprised when i didn't have to pay for an extra ticket for my own mistake (which i was fully prepared to do). This was just unexpected and nice to see.
