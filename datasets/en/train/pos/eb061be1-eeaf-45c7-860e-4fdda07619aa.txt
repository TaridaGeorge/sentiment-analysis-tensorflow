What a great website!  And it doesn't lie!  I was so happy to receive credit for most of the books I brought in and was extremely grateful that you took the rest of them off my hands anyway.  It's wonderful that you donate those unwanted books to non-profit organizations!  Your selection of "gently used" books is by far the best I've seen in any 2nd-hand store, and the way you've organized your shelves made locating my favorite authors very easy.  As a final note, I'd like to thank the pleasant staff for taking the time to help me find everything I was looking for.  You will be seeing me again, and I will be recommending your store to all my friends!
