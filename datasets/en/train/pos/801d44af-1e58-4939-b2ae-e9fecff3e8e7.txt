Freshest, tastiest, Vietnameesiest food around mesa! :)
I started going there while attending MCC and got hooked. No other Vietnamese joint has tasted as good since. The staff is always courteous and provides good service. The prices are just a nice bonus. Note that this a pleasant, family run dining place, not an upscale restaurant to go for a date or celebrate an event.
Try the Pho (noodle soups), Lemongrass chicken, Mongolian beef and the fresh rolls. Don't forget to top it off with some tapioca drink.
Once you're hooked, they do take out (call in the order and pick up in 10 minutes). Have fun! :)
