Perfect pizza. Plain and simple, I have had none better. Grimaldi's in Old Town is almost exactly my envisionment of a perfect restaurant. To die for food, a romantic yet lively interior, a great jazzy soundtrack, dimmed but not too dark lighting, professional staff, varied drink list and wonderful outdoor seating. Geez, it's always such a treat to come here. Grab a bottle of wine and and a pesto pizza with ricotta and sausage and soak up the intoxicating atmosphere. Five big fat stars.
