I have been waiting for Cupz N' Crepes to open and it was worth the wait.  Their crepes are delicious!  Try the turkey pesto for lunch and for dessert the almond and honey.  The owner is gracious, the staff is delightful, the ambiance cozy, and the wifi works!!!!  Thank you for bringing a little taste of Paris to Ahwatukee!  A must try!!!
