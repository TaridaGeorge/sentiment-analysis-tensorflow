OMFG, so gooooddddd.  I love it.  Better than any gelato in San Francisco, even in N Beach (Italian neighorhood)... Pistachio + Roasted Almond + Tiramisu + Stracciatella + Hazlenut; the list goes on and on!  Last time I was there they had oatmeal cookie flavor that I think was a special... it was surprisingly good!  This place has definitely been a contributing factor in the 5 pounds I have gained since I have been traveling to Phoenix .... oh well, worth it!
