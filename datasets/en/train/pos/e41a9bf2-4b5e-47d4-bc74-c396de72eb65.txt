it's apparent that this place use to be a bank, but after stepping inside you don't even notice you just stepped into a bank. it's like you just stepped inside a restaurant in italy. haha not really but the feeling takes over.

the service was great!! they were so nice and very knowledgeable. when i was there one of the servers dumped a whole tray of drink on to this customer's table. the customers were understandable about the whole situation. her co-workers helped her out and didn't leave her hangin', that's always nice....

the food was great!! it was VERY good!! i had the Veal with Lemon and Artichoke YUMMMMY!!! and my sister had the Cataloni that was heavenly good!

i'll post pics later, but that place was really good. i would so go back there for dinner.

WAY TO GO RIGATONY'S!!!!
