This is the BEST of Cave Creek! 

My husband took me here for my birthday. It was a pricy meal!! However, my taste buds have never.. EVER been as happy as they were at Cartwight's. Everything from the appetizer to the desert was truly amazing! Better than you know what!! 

The ambiance was very comfortable, and relaxing. Something that is truly a rare find in a restaurant of this caliber. 
(I didn't feel as if someone was looking at me and judging me for using the wrong fork. :)

I can't say enough about this place. Everytime we drive by- my mouth waters! I can't wait to go back!!!
