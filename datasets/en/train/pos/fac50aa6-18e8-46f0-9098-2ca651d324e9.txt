My favorite place to eat =) 
Their food is sooo good. I have never gotten anything there and not liked it. I usually get the huge baked potato stuffed with chicken and a put lots of the bbq on it and i get the beans too (really good) if Im really hungry I get mac n cheese too.  I always get the homemade rootbeer. Their rootbeer was the only thing i craved while i was pregnant...LoL.
And we always buy a couple bottles of the bbq sauce. 
It is a great, casual, fun place to eat.
