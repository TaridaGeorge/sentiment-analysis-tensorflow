Perhaps the greatest Little Middle Eastern market & restaurant in the valley! The Hummus & Lebni are to DIE FOR, the Lamb is out of this world and the Feta cheese may be the freshest I have ever experienced. My favorite Med. cuisine location by far. I love that I can Buy everything I have just eaten at the market next door and prepare it at home as well. Only One Issue, PARKING IS TERRIBLE during busy hours.  This is a MUST SEE for anyone seeking this type of cuisine! GO NOW!   P.S. Dont  know why this review shows up in 2 places, oh well this place is worth it!
