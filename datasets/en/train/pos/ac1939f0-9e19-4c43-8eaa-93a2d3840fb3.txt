Excellent service and food.  I started out at the bar.  Friendly bartenders and patrons.  The bartender (sorry I forgot his name) made me a Dark and Tan (I think that is what it was called)  and it was great.   It is two beers combined.   Then the bruschetta, excellent.  We had 4 different pizzas and they were all great.  The desert was just okay, but most people wouldn't have room for it.  Oh, and the service from Paul was fantastic.  I will definitely recommend and be back.
