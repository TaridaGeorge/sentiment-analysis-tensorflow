I was brought here by a friend of mine who raved about the Veggie Grilled Cheese sandwich.  I had fully intended to get the same sandwich myself until I saw that they offered a Monte Cristo.
I haven't had a Monte Cristo since the last time I was at Disneyland (at the Blue Bayou) so nostalgia won out.
My sandwich and home made potato 'chips' were fantastic (I added a little malt vinegar and salt to them) - and for a drink I had delicious iced green tea (which somehow tasted like fruit loops).
I'll be back next time I'm in the area.
