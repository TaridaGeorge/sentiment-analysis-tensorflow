There's nothing really to say that hasn't already been said about Merc, but i wanted to add my 5-star opinion to the lot.  

The music is good, the cocktails better, and the ambiance the best thing about the place.  

I don't know how they manage to avoid the d-factor, but they really do.  Maybe the music, low lighting, and classy vibe settles the buckle-shoe wearers down, so, to that I say, "well done, merc"

The drinks here can really add up, tho ... and its not a complaint, just be prepared for it is all.
