My FAVORITE pizza place.  I am not a big fan of pizza yet I could eat here daily.  I prefer the white pizza with tomatoe slices but I will eat any vegetarian variety, including just cheese.  The eggplant sandwich is to die for and enough for two meals if you aren't a big eater.  I have to save room for the Ba Da Bing Chocolate cake.  The best cake I have ever had in my entire life.
