I got their products from a boutique in santa monica, ca...

The whole line is SO nice, now I'm addicted. I use everything from the Blue Flame line - the mask is amazing, it its the only clay mask that really works on my skin. I love the green papaya mask and the yellow one, I forget what it's called but it's niiice.

Also the glycolic peel and the marine treatment are dank.

I LOVE the toner and the blue flame botanical face wash, it's like washing your face in rose petals and lavender, it's so gentle yet has exfoliating qualities to it... super nice stuff - not too overpriced for the level of QUALITY.
