My friends and I went here on our last day in Arizona, and we ended up staying for about 3 hours! Sitting outside under the stars waiting for our pizza was amazing. The pizza took a little while to cook, but we ordered caesar salad and quite a few beers while we waited! The deep dish pizza is ridiculously good, but my favorite part of the meal was the cookie pizza! I ate so much food that I needed to unbutton my pants afterward, but it was so worth it! Great food, and an overall fabulous time. This is a place that everyone should try!
