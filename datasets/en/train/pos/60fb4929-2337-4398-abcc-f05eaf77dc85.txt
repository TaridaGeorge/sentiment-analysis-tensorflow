By far this is the best sushi ever! The service is also great. We drive all the way from central Phoenix  there just to enjoy some quality food. Last night we sat where they serve teppanyaki and our chef cooked our food to perfection and offered us a great show as well. Don't forget to tip your chef if you sit where they cook teppanyaki. Our friend had his birthday and we asked for the birthday dessert. That song was the real deal! Highly recommend this place.
