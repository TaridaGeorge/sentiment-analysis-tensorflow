David and his crew have been nothing but wonderful to work with. My realtor recommended him for my home inspection two years ago, and have since used his company's services for monthly pest control, and now for our termite visitors. He and his company are great to deal with and can usually accommodate a same-day or next-day appointment. They'll even call me back to follow-up months later when I tell them to call me at a later time. Have recommended him to family and friends, and everyone has just been impressed. Highly recommended and I wouldn't do business with anyone else in this field.
