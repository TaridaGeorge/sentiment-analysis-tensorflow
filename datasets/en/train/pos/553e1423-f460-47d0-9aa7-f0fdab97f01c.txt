I have nothing but good things to say about Yume!! I have recommended this place to many people and everyone has said they love it, including me!

A friend introduced me to this place about a year ago. The restaurant itself is tiny but the food is awesome!! You can custom create your own rolls (which I have yet to find at other sushi places) and every roll I've had on the menu is amazing! I love the atmosphere of sitting up at the bar (the guys behind the counter are hysterical and great to talk to) while you wait for sushi. 

I would recommend going during happy hour for the cheaper prices. I've also had some of their main dishes aside from sushi and those are delicious too. 

Yume is my favorite "hole in the wall" sushi place and I will keep coming back!!
