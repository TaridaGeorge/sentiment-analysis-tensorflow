I was so excited when I saw a second location of d'Lish opening! The Tempe location is bright and open with much better parking. There were two guys working the front (one who manages the places) and both were super energetic, helpful, and friendly.

I got the croissant sandwich, which was fantastic. It has eggs, tomato, bacon, and - I was skeptical at first - pesto. It totally works.

The sandwich with a small hot coffee ran a bit over $8 which isn't bad for local, organic food. I'll definitely be back!
