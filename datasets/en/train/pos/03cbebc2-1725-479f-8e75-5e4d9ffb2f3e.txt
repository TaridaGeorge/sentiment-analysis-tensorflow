Outstanding food, top notch menu.  And if you get there for happy hour you'll get $5 drinks and $9 Big Ass burgers.  The patio is lovely but you need to get there by 4:30 to get a seat.  It's first come, first served.

You can order from the dinner menu starting at 5PM.  The salmon is delicious, as is the bacon-wrapped pork.

A delightful dining experience. If you aren't going for happy hour, be sure to make a reservation a few days in advance - it books quickly.
