HELLO GROCERY STORE CHINESE PLACE!!  OK, so this sounds weird, right?  I thought it was strange when I saw the mini-restaurant inside Basha's.  Normally you see an overused Subway or McDonalds, or at least back in North Carolina that is completely expected.  A Chinese place would be next door in the shopping mall, but not in the grocery store.  WASSSSUP BASHA'S!!  You have created a masterpiece.  Fresh Chinese with Chinese workers, yea, I'd say it's fabulous.  I could have eaten an entire plate of rice alone.  It was that good.  I also ordered the orange chicken and the spicy chicken (general tsao's), which were exceptionally good too.   If you like Chinese food and if you enjoy saving money, I highly suggest Rice Garden.  Your taste buds will thank you later.
