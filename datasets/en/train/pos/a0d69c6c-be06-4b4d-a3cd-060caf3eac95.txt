If you are a fan of the old tried and true meal of teriyaki chicken bowls, you will absolutely love this family own restaurant. Even though the food is spectacular, the thing that always stands out the most about The Blue Fin is the unbelievable customer service. I cannot think of a time I have been here where the owner was not behind the counter giving me her heart-felt thanks for being a customer. 

The place may not look like much from the outside but just know that you will be taken care of once you are there and will have some incredible food for dine in or take out.
