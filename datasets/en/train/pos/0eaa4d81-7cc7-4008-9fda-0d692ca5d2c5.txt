After wanting to try Lux forever, I finally stopped in on a perfect Arizona Sunday Morning.  I like the set up as they have a table, covered with pastries and employees waiting to take your order.  Everyone was friendly and service was quick.  

Previous reviews talk about how urban, trendy, hipster this place is.  While that might be true, I found Lux to be confortable and friendly.
