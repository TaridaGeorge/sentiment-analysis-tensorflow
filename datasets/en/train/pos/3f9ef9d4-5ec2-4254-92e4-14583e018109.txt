How. How much do I love this place? Lots! The staff was enjoyable. He was wearing ASU garb and we were in our U of A shirts. He has helpful. The food was spectacular. I had the red chili and will gladly have it again. Me two young sons enjoyed their food. They especially enjoyed the chocolate fry bread. Parking is a challenge but totally worth it. Do yourself a favor and stop by when near by.
