Ordered 2 dozen cupcakes with a Groupon voucher.  From beginning to end, it was a superb experience!  Brittany answered my email immediately answering all questions.  Called and placed order the next day.  She was professional, courteous, friendly and a complete pleasure to deal with.  She delivered exacltly on time as discussed.  The cupcakes were GORGEOUS beyond description!!!  Strawberry shortcake and cookies and cream were absolutely scrumptious.  Best cupcakes EVER!  Not too sweet, with the freshest of ingredients.  And delicious frostings - nothing like the icky, synthetic, overly sweet frostings you get almost everywhere else.  Bittersweet will be the ONLY company for all of our future cake needs.
