lots of outdoor seating and an awesome jukebox selection! this bar is tucked in and if you don't look close enough you'll pass it! the scenery is awesome at night with the patio lit up in little christmas lights and the tables with candles... the bartender pours a pretty heavy drink and introduced me to some yummy shots that night!!

oh yes folks... it was "hammer-time" for me here... got pretty wasted!! :)

because of the hot nights in AZ there are also misters outside and that is a big plus!!
