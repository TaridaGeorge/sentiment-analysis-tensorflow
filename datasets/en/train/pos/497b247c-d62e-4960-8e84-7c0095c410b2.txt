The Phoenix food truck scene is finally taking off. We have almost every kind of gourmet food truck that other cities are proud to showcase. The first thing you will notice when approaching Short leash is their huge line, while virtually every other food truck doesn't have a line. Don't be tempted to leave. The lines are long- but completely worth it. Just a mustard dog kind of person? Don't be boring! Shortleash aren't just any hot dog...don't be afraid! My first glance at the menu, I was intrigued. Mango Chutney? Mayonnaise? hmmm...

After my first Short Leash- I was sold! I love trying their special of the day in order to try the latest and greatest concoction. I just had one that I still talk about that included a pretzal bun and apple cole slaw. Yum! Try it once, and you'll be hooked!
