I found the cutest vintage book today, its called "Eleven Blue Men", and it was only 1.95! What a sweet deal for such a wonderful book, now I have something to fill my time with while I wait for Graduate school to start.

I've been to this store a few times, and the people that work here are so wonderfully friendly. I love just strolling about the store and looking at everything. It reminds me of things I saw when I was kid, in the homes that my grandmother use to work for in Palo Alto. And I saw the cutest silk pseudo kimono on the women's clothes rack, you know I was wishing I had some money about then! So classic, so fun, so incredibly retro and vintage. If I had my own place, you know you would fine atleast one of these furniture pieces up in it.
