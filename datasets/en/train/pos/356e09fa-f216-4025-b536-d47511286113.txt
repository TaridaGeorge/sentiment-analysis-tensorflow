Skip the chain hotels and hit this place for a unique stay. Awesome refurb of a nifty motel with some really sweet rooms. Simple lobby, but fantastic service all around. You'll be hard-pressed to find something this neat-o anyplace given the history of this place. 

I had setup a corporate event here, using conference rooms and the pool area for drinks and dinner. Everything was great, with a truly retro feel on the food/drinks/cocktails.

P.S. This place may cost you, but surprise! You're in Scottsdale, fool!
