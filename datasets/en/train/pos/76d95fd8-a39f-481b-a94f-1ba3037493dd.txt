Everyone's right -- there's not much of an ambience at this 2/3-grocer 1/3-restaurant nestled away in a stripmall, but what Haji-Baba lacks in ambience, it more that compensates for in fresh, delicious, authentic Middle Eastern food.  My boyfriend and I split the non-veggie combination platter, and everything was fantastic: the falafel was light and fluffy, on par with the NY street vendor fare I'm accustomed to, and the gyro was so delicious that I managed to finagle 3/4 of it away before he noticed there'd been more under a piece of hummus-y lettuce.

I would not recommend it for a first date -- hipper joints like Pita Jungle across the street would better fit the bill -- but if you're in a comfortable relationship and craving a delicious meal after a long day's ridiculous lightrail experiment, Haji-Baba's got your back.  And your belly...
