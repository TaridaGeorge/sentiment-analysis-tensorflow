I love everything about Essence!  The decor was beautiful, the hostess was really nice, and the food was absolutely delicious. 

I had the Croque Madame sandwich and fresh-squeezed orange juice for breakfast the other day, and it's been hard to keep myself from going back every day since.  Not only was the food great, but I felt good eating it because all the food is farmed locally.

The price is a little steeper than you might be used to if you're the typical Tempe resident -- for example, my sandwich and orange juice were $11 -- but if you like to treat yourself, this is the place to do it.
