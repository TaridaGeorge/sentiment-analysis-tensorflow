I had the pleasure of experiencing Off Da Hook during its first week of business at the new Glendale Avenue location. Without a doubt this is THE BEST soul food restaurant in Phoenix!  

You first notice the cleanliness of the establishment upon entering. Not your typical hole in the wall joint that you expect. Nice large booths, tile floor, bright colors, and that oh so sweet aroma of soul food !
 
I experienced soul food at its best. I concur with another reviewer that Off Da Hook by far exceeds Lolo's Chicken and Waffles.

The serving sizes are HUGE so go with appetites ready to be satisfied with all the traditional eats we are familiar with.  Prices are extremely reasonable, service was fast, and staff was very friendly.

Glad to finally have a place to call home for good soul food in the valley.
