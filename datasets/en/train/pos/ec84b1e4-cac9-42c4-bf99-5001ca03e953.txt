I give Epic Salon a 5 star because of Becky!  She is an exceptional stylist/colorist!!!  We had a BAD experience with another stylist at Epic Salon that turned my teenage daughter's hair green and didn't want to fix it.  Becky came to the rescue and fixed my daughter's hair.  She went so above and beyond I decided to give the salon another chance and booked my haircut and color with Becky.  I've been going to her every since and have so many compliments on my hair that 3 of my friends and family have changed from their own stylists in different hair establishments to BECKY!!!

Wanted to let you all know the stylist that turned her hair green is no longer with Epic.
