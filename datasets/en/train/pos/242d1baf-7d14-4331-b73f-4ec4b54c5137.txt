I like this place even though it is a chain because they are pretty consistent. They are connected with Changing Hands Bookstore, so when i typically go i eat and then go search for books with my daughter.  I love their Oriental Chicken Salad which is a pretty generous serving, and i will never forget their chocolate croissants.  I crave those everyday now.  Food is made pretty quickly and there is usually lots of seating but is pretty busy of a place.  I know if i move and go to one of these places i will be happy.
