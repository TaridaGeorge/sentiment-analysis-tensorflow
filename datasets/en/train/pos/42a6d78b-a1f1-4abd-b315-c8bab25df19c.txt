The Sun Devils are back in the discussion this year finally and are off to a 7-1 start. Jahi is the real deal. This was my 2nd game at Wells Fargo arena and I liked this cozy arena. It is draped in ASU yellow and maroon and since ASU is the only tenant, they went all out with the pretty colors. Currently, the arena is barely half full, so walking up to get tickets, parking and managing crowds are not a problem. It is also very easy to parlay your $12 ticket into much better seating so far this season. Most shocking event of the night: saw a handful of scalpers out front, but they were white!
