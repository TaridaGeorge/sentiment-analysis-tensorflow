I was feeling under the weather while in Phoenix, and a friend recommended his Doctor.  I called and got in to see Dr. Riley.  His staff was friendly and efficient, and he was very warm and friendly.  He asked lots of questions, and made sure it wasnt anything serious. While I was there he also recommended some new heartburn meds, as my insurance ran out last month.  He was really understanding about the no insurance thing, as I was laid off.   After 2 days his staff called me to see if I was feeling better, which has only happened once before from a Doctor's office.  I deffinetly recommend seeing Dr. Riley.
