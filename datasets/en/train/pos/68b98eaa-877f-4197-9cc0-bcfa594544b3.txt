Only 8 calories an ounce?  You'd bet that something that low fat has to be bland/blah/tasteless right?  WRONG. 

Desert Swirl carries the Only 8 brand of frozen yogurt, the healthiest frozen yogurt in Phoenix. There are 8 flavors to choose from, rotated daily from more than 200 flavors and more than 40 extra toppings, but keep in mind these will add calories.  But at 48 calories for a small you can afford it right?  My favorite is the circus animal cookies. Yum!

I'm addicted to the frozen yogurt so I haven't tried anything else, but they offer smoothies, shakes, sundaes and ice cream. Judging by the yogurt I'm sure you can't go wrong.  

If you want a satisfying sweet treat that's also healthy give Desert Swirl a try.
