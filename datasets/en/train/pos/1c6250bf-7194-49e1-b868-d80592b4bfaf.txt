What a little gem in Gilbert! Didn't even know it was there until a friend invited me out to meet her there for "80's Night" of all things. 80's night at a wine bar? A DJ at a wine bar? But it all worked, and I really dig the place. 

Servers and bartender were all super friendly, met the owners who were also nice, bartender gave me a free glass of wine, and overall just had a really nice time. 

Looking forward to their $20 tastings on Fridays. Sounds like an awesome deal (4 or 5 glasses plus an appetizer)! Oh yeah - and they have Yappy Hour/Brunch where you can bring your pooch (check their calendar). Awesome. Will be back here for sure.
