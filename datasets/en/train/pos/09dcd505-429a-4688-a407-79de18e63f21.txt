You really don't think about your insurance, let alone your insurance agent, until you need assistance.  This is exactly what happened when my son and I were hit head on in SE Chandler by a driver in a pick up truck going well over 60 MPH in a 45 MPH zone.  The police and fire personnel were first on the scene, then my State Farm agent, Scott Thomas arrived to make sure we were ok and to assist us with what we needed to do next.  I'm thankful that there were no injuries and was very grateful for having Scott there to walk us through the insurance claim process.  In a time when good customer service is hard to come by, it is great that Chandler has an individual that goes above and beyond to provide great service.  Thank you Scott!
