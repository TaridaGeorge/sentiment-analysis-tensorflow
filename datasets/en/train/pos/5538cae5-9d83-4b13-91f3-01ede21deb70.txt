Off the Grid Fitness is the best choice I ever made! Having belong to another gym I came to Off the Grid and found that the instructors worked with me to meet my goals. They also challenged me to create new goals. I immediately canceled my other membership and joined Off the Grid.  I have been a member since July, 2012.

Both the classes and instructors are great! The gym facility is always clean and has a lot of equipment needed to challenge my body. 

If you're looking for a great gym make Off the Grid part of your New Years resolution.
