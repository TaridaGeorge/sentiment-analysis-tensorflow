On a Friday night this is the perfect place to go after work for a nice drink and a quiet dinner.  I like to sit at the sushi bar where my buddy Johnny comes up with some crazy sushi combinations that are definately not on the menu but should definately be.  Reasonably priced sushi + saki bombers = a great dining experience.  I can't speak for the Teppan tables, but the show Johnny can put on is worth it.
