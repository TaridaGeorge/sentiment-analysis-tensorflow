I have had laser hair removal done at other places, and Laser for Less is seriously the best place I have ever been. I have had the best results seeing Kristen and I have recommended her to many people, including my Mom when she was in town visiting. Their prices are amazing, an you even get a free touch up between treatments for any hairs that didn't fall out.
