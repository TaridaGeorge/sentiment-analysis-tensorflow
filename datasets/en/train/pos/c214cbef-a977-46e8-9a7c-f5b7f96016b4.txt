We frequently dine at the one in Sacramento which is close to where we live and were usually not a fan of chains but this one always makes the cut. Great energy in the restaurant. Must haves are the dip duo, skillet of corn bread, caesar salad and their martinis. We've never had a bad meal at any of them. Great service too
