Tried the new NoRTH this Sunday in Arcadia and we sat outside and loved the atmosphere!  The fondue bread appetizer was awesome and to die for! I could have eaten the whole thing myself! We shared the Italian Salad and the beet salad and both were delicious. We also shared the beef short rib gnocchi and the rock shrimp pasta and both were great. Save room for the Italian donuts in cheese cream sauce. Extremely decadent!  Great place! I would go back and sit at the bar if I were by myself. The bar is nice and opens inside to the outside just like Hawaii!
