Eating here almost made me feel like i was back in the bay area! Upon walking in, i remember my co-workers exclaiming in excitement,
"There are other ASIANS HERE! WOH! You even pay at the register!" 

That's authenticity roite thar.

I didn't think that i would be able to find an authentic asian restaurant in the phoenix area but this place proved me wrong. Not the best pho ever, but the best by far that i found in the area.
