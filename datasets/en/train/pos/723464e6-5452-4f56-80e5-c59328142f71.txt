Th staff at It's A Grind are very warm and friendly.  The atmosphere is very peaceful and my favorite place to sit down with my favorite blended coffee and my IPAD and relax.  The staff is fast and efficient.  They can make you I am always blown away how they all remember their usual customers orders by memory. The establishment is very clean and all the coffee condiments are available for you.  Restrooms are nice and clean as well.  Free and dependable WI-FI with plenty of power connections too.  Did I mention they even have a fireplace.  I highly recommend them as your one-stop coffee shop.  (My favorite is the 32oz blended white chocolate, all toddy with whip cream.)
