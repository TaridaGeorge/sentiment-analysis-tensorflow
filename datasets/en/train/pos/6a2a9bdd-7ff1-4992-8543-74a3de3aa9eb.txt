Update: Okay, okay I get it. I came back yesterday and ordered an iced Velvet with whip cream. That.whip.cream.kicks.ass. And they SCRAPE it on as if it were frosting on a cake! I was mesmerized. They had a lovely and friendly barista taking orders, pastries are now safely tucked under a pastry case as god intended. Very nice.
