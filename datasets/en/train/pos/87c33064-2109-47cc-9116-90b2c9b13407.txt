Phenomenal food without the unreal price. I used to go with a Persian co-worker, so he did all the ordering and also could critique the food from a position of proper knowledge. 

The ghormeh sabzi (a delightfully light stew that you will desire in the future after your first bite) is incredible and said coworker claimed it is the best he's had. The chefs special is 3 meats (chicken, steak and beef) platter that is great too, just be warned it is too much food for less than 3 people. Their sides of rice are served on a platter that could hold most Thanksgiving turkeys, and again it is great.

If there is one thing to note, be prepared for a dinner over 1 hour due to some of the dish preparation time.
