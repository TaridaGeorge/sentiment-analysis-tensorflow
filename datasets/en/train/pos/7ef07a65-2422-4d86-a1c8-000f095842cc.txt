Finally got the chance to check out PastaBAR last night and man am I glad I did. I decided to get takeout. I started with this crostini dish that had farm fresh eggs, braised greens, anchovie and pecorino that was TOTALLY AWESOME!!  For my meal, I decided on the Chitarra alla Carbonara. The pasta was cooked to perfection, but the guanciale was somewhat done an injustice. It wasn't as crispy as it should have been so it could have been anything, but my plate was still awesome. If your looking for a nice place to get a great plate of pasta, this is for you!  *** They are having a huge pig roast with with $20 bottles of wine and some other stuff on 4th of July weekend, if your interested***
