Every employee at the store located at 1357 South Power Road
Mesa, AZ 85206 is SO friendly and knowledgable, and they always ensure that my MINI gets in and out, quickly. If ever there is a delay/line, they give an honest wait-estimate. I appreciate their honesty, no one belittles me because I am a woman - these guys are AWESOME! This last time, I went for my monthly air check, and they offered to rotate my tires - they checked in the system and it turns out that I was due... 30 minutes later my car felt 100% better! I bought my tires at this location back in 2010 and have ONLY gone to this store for my monthly follow-up...would not have it any other way! Thanks guys!!!
