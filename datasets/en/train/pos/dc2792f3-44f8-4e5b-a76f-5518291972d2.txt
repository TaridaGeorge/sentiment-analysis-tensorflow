Just moved here from Michigan in August and had to find a salon.  I was looking for someone good with short hair & color (as I have red hair which is difficult to color keeping a natural look).  I found what I was looking for with Eric.  He takes the time to listen to what I want and has excellent tips for my hair care. The salon itself has such a friendly atmosphere.  You're made to feel very welcome.  I've been there twice and will definitely continue to use this salon.
