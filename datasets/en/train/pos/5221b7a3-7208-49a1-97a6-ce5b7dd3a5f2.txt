Went to Joe's last night.  Not my first time at all, but my first time seeing the expansion and it looks AMAZING!!!!  I love it!  The place looks amazing, the employees are always so nice and are so helpful and friendly, and the bands (especially Money Shot) are awesome.  

I HIGHLY recommend going to Joes.  It is a great place to make your usual hang out!
