This restaurant is the best kept secret in all of Phoenix.  It is a family-run Chinese restaurant in a strip mall, so it is unpretentious.   And, the prices are very reasonable.  But, the food is exceptional.  Everything on the menu is something you can recommend to your friends.  It is the standard by which all Chinese restaurants are measured ... literally.  You will notice that I have given this restaurant five stars.  Any other Chinese restaurant that I review here will be measured against this one.  It's that Good!
