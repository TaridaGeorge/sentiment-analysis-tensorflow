This place is intimate and has a cute trendy vibe that adds a lot of flare to the neighborhood. We came here on a date night and had fantastic bruschetta, salad with awesome (pink) balsamic dressing and the dish of the day which was an enchilada. Large beer and wine selection as well as fun drinks. We ordered espresso with our gelato dessert and loved it so much we came back in the morning for coffee.
I will be back here for sure!
