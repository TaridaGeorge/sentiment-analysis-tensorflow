I had lunch there on Wednesday, and I still cannot believe it was as amazing as it was. Justin Y is dead on, it is by far the freshest sushi I've ever had, and I used to live 20 minutes from San Francisco! The rolls are fun inspired and unique. The seaweed isn't overpowering. The portions are perfect! Their lunch menu is awesome! 4 pcs Hamachi, 4 pcs Salmon, 1 philly roll, a daquari and edamame, 27.00 out the door.  Great value in my book, especially for something so fresh! The guys at the bar are men of few words, but they crank out quality! I'm still beside myself with joy!
