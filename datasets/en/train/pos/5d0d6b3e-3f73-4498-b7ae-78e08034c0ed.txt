Great Dim Sum!!! I recently moved to the Phoenix area, and was looking for good Dim Sum.  After going to a few different places, I came across C-Fu, and my search was over. Not only is there never a wait, but the service is second to none.  Usually stone cold servers at other Dim Sum places.  The carts come by right away, and the Dim Sum is always hot and fresh.  They have a larger selection than any other place I have tried.  I have been going every Sunday for the past 7 months, and make the 45 minute drive knowing I will get treated like family.  I highly recommend C-Fu to anyone looking for the best over all Dim Sum in the valley.
