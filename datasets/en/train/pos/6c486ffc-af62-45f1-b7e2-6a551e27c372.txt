Never been in here physically.

I have used their services many times via their easy to use website. Phoenix Flower Shops is much better than online services that "box-up" your flowers for shipment - then the recipient has to "set-up" the flowers themselves... My girl certainly appreciates their professional delivery service.

Local company, great selection, reasonable prices, and on time delivery.
