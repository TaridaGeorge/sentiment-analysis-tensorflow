This was my first time ordering from a butcher and I am now hooked. The meat is less expensive than the grocery store and the quality is so much better. You have the option of ordering grass fed beef or regular beef and the prices can't be beat. I needed the meat sliced paper thin and they did that with all 15lbs at no extra charge, which was great. They are very friendly and helpful unlike some other butchers I called. I highly recommend this place.
