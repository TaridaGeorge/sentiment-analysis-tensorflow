Loved my experience here!  Used a Groupon for a specialty car wash, which involved vacuuming and shampooing the carpets, washing the interior and exterior of the car and buff on the outside.  Other than a little bit of lack luster office knowledge and ability to communicate (didn't fully articulate questions causing unnecessary confusion), the work was superb.  My car looks and smells great!  They completed the work in less time than estimated and I couldn't be happier.  Bravo!  Will definitely return!
