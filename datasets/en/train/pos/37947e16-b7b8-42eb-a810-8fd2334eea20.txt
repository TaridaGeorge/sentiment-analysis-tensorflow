Amazing, but expensive. I've only golfed here, so can't speak for the rooms/accomodations but I'm sure it is spectacular.

Pros:

-Immaculate course. Just beautiful. 
-18 hole will wear you out in the heat. Go during prime times when the weather isn't too crazy and you will have a great time.
-I'm not too experienced in golf but went with an avid golfer who said the course was one of the best in AZ.

Cons:

-None, except there are more snakes, critters, etc than I've experienced at other courses but that's to be expected in AZ.

Verdict:

-It is very expensive at $200+ per person. I would go here to entertain a client or on someone else's dime.
