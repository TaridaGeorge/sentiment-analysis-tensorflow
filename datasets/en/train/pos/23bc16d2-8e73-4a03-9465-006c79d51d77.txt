Dr Dachs and team totally rock!  This is the best dentist I have ever had.  

First of all, my hygienist is so nice.  She does a good job of encouraging good habits without being a total floss-Nazi (which I can't stand)!  

Then there is Dr. Dachs.  He has done a filling for me and it was the most painless shot/drilling I have ever experienced.  

The other think I really like about this Dentist is that they aren't always up-selling everything.  I went to another dentist in Scottsdale and I swear that every time I was in there they were trying to up sell me on something.  Not appropriate if you ask me.
