My brother had his wedding here, and it was a great experience all around!  We stayed with my whole family for about 4 days.  Staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  They even opened the shop in the lobby after it closed and made me a Starbucks latte!!  I will 100% revisit this hotel my next time in Phoenix.  A gentleman by the name of Douglas (worked in the banquet hall) was also very kind, polite, and helpful during the wedding reception.  Thanks for a great weekend guys!
