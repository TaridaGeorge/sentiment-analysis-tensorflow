5 huge stars for this perfectly organized scrap booking store. Huge HUGE paper selection and anything else you could possibly need for your scrapbook. Books, ribbon, stencils, stamps cute little adornments... I can't wait to go back! I was with a friend and we shopped for wall letters along with paper to scrap them. She left with a full set of letters and a huge assortment of papers and adornments for under $35. Impressive.
