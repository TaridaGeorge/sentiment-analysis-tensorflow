Joined a friend here for a late breakfast, and it was really great!  The place was packed, always a good sign, and I found out why.  We sampled the edamame hummus-AMAZING!  Who knew hummus would work with edamame?  Well, it does here, its got a kick with cilantro and jalepenos.

I had the turkey sausage eggs benedict, really yummy!  First time I've seen turkey sausage on the menu for a benedict option.  The potato wedges were the best I've had in a while.  

My friend enjoyed the veggie omlette with a side of cottage cheese, and it was just perfect for her.  I would love to go again and again, it is 30 miles from my home, but next time I'm in Old Town Scottsdale, I will go again for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Big menu with interesting choices.
