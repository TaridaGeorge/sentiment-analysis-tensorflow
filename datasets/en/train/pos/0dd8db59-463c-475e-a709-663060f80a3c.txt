I've only been here twice, and both times were to see Next to Normal (which was excellent, but that's a totally different review that belongs on a totally different site) this past October. And I'm not going to lie and say "OH! There's no such thing as a bad seat here!" because honestly? That isn't true. If you sit on the extreme left or the extreme right, your sight lines won't be the best. 

The best thing they have going for them would definitely be the $10 student rush tickets. So, yeah, you're stuck up in the nosebleeds, which kind of sucks. But it's better than nothing and is great for the theater goer on a shoestring budget. Add in the $3 parking validation for across the street, and I (and my wallet) am smitten.
