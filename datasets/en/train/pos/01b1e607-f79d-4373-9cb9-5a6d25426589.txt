The Arrogant Butcher was one of the best meal experiences I have ever had!  If you are in Phoenix, you must go.  We had the mussels as apps and pretzels - both were amazing(and I am not a pretzel fan). Both the swordfish and rib entree we're great.  My son had the ravioli dumplings. The flavor was good, but it was a lot of very filling food.  The atmosphere is cool and casual, but their commitment to food is serious!
