It is rare for me to find a place that has such a relaxed atmosphere that makes you feel welcome the moment you arrive.   Then almost never do i find a place like that that also has great food, service and good prices.  This has become one of my favorite lunch spots and also a favorite dinner spot.  We even had my friends birthday there.  Strongly recommend.
