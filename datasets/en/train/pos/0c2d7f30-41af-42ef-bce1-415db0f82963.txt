Exceptional service, unique selection of teas and high quality coffee. Can't beat the free WiFi and melodic background music. The atmosphere completes the overall experience of the perfect space to enjoy a refreshing beverage, a good read, and conversation. There's even an assortment of books and board games for customers. Also very cool art that provides an urban feel. Any interest would appreciate a Solo experience :)
