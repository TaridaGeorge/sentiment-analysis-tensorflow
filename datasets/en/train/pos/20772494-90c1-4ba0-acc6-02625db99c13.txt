I'll be honest...I'm not a food connoisseur, but I know a good Chicken Fried Steak. Theirs is similar to how my mom makes it, and wow the portions are huge. And for the price? You just can't beat it. No wonder they are so popular and have been around forever. Love me some TexAZ, but be prepared: you get what you pay for, and for under $13 for a dinner don't expect some 5 star meal. Be realistic folks!
