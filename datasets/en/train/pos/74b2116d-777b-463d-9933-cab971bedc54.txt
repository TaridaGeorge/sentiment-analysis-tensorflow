Hmmmm, I'm saddened by the other reviews. I love the sushi here and everytime we go somewhere else (zen32, ra, stingray, some little place in Chandler that was supposed to be THE BEST) we always wish we had made the trek up to Sushi Brokers. Sometimes the service is just ok but Saturday at 4:30 pm its perfect.  The Cowboy Roll is out of this world.... we usually go during Happy Hour pricing and arent big drinkers so our bill isnt usally too high. Oh, and the people watching is awesome.
