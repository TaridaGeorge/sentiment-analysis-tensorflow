Yes, please!  This place has seriously great sandwiches, yummy cookies, fresh and tasty salads, pleasant and prompt counter service, China Mist iced tea -- what more could you want? I went for lunch with a co-worker on Monday, and returned on Saturday so my beau could enjoy the joint.  I recommend you give it a try if you're in the neighborhood.
