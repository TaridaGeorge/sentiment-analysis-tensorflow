My boyfriend and I  have been coming here for almost 2 years now and we love it.

The first time in, I mean I was intimidated by the menu and not knowing much about tea at the time. Not to mention, that I went in thinking it was like a boba cafe, asking for a Avocado milk tea with boba.
They looked at me like "what?" lol
I just ordered some herbal tea and killed it with sugar because at the time I wasn't a tea drinker.
So yes, the tea menu was intimidating to me at first.
But, the more I tried, the more i loved. So now, I'm like the ultimate tea drinker.
This is definitely my most favoritist tea bar and even place to hang out. I just love the vibe.
There's always so many regulars and
