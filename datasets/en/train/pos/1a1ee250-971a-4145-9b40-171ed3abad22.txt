We went back of a long overdue visit, and were surprised to find that they really spruced up the place! They have expanded into the space next door, and dressed it up with bright colors, a fanciful bayou-themed mural, and tablecloths. Yes, there is even now some zydeco to serenade you while you eat.

As always, the food is just as good as I remembered. Maybe even better.
