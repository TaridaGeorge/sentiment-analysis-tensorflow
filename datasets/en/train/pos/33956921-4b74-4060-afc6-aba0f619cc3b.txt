Yesterday was my first visit.  I'll return every 3 weeks.  All of the other 4-5 star reviews are accurate.  Kevin did fantastic job on pedi.  Perfect!  Meticulous!  French gel - prefect.  French gel manicure by Hannah.  Again, perfect and meticuous.  Everyone there was friendly and helpful.  Excellent cuticle trimming.  $64 for mani/pedi.
