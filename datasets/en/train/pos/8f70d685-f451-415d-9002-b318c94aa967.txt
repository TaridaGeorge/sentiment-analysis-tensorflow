I been here once and I loved it!!  Food here is amazing! Decor is cute, felt like walking into someones home!  It's communal seating so get to know other guest!  Service was great, but before I continue....They're closing this weekend due to the lack of business!  OMG!  I recommend going before you miss out - take care Lola - what ever you want - you get :)
