This place is wonderful.  First went to the visitor's center, where they couldn't have been more friendly and helpful. Maps, tour of their snakes, helpful tips, etc. Even bought a t-shirt and hat because the vibe was so good (plus a fuschia women-cut v-neck AND awesome owl hat? whoever is buying for this place is doing a good job).

Hubby and kids used the archery range while I hiked the Wind Cave trail. We were all happy-as-clams when we finished up and decided we need to come back here again and again.
