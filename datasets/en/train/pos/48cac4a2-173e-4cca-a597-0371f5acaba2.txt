Lived out here for almost two years and finally tried this place...can't believe we waited this long, it's amazing. BEST burger we've ever had. You can build your own burger which is easy and you get exactly what you want. We did ours with the kobe meat and it was delicious. The buns were even great. The burgers are huge and fries are good too. They have a nice little outdoor patio, clean/simple/modern decor and a friendly staff. Yes, it may be a little bit more expensive than the average burger place but you get what you pay for. This is a gourmet burger. I'd rather spend a few extra dollars and get an awesome/huge burger than spend a few bucks and get a dinky/tasteless burger. It's a must try!
