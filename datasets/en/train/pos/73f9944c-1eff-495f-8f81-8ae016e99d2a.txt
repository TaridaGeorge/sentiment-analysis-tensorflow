A really cool experience.  Located on a large property that takes you instantly from the city into this quaint goodness of organic gardens and Pecan trees.  It's a dining-out experience, so the best time to go is on nice days.  The food is perfect, picnic style food.  I had the tuna sandwich which was fantastic.  Overall, the whole experience of dining out in a picnic setting was  most memorable.  Take your friends and family !!!
