mellow mushroom is hands down the best place for beer in the north(westish) valley. great craft beer selection (a ton of rogue varieties) on draft and even more in thebottle and can. happy hour or reverse happy hour  is the time to go, all alcohol is half off and all the appetizers are half off. grilled jerk wings, a capri salad paired with a tasty brew, you cant go wrong. oh ya the pizza combinations are awesome too.
