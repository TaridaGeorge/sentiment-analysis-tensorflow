Thank You Al !!!  We finally have REAL Chicago Food---Awesome Italian Beef and Hot Peppers!  

For us transplanted Chicagoans... this is fast food nirvana!

After watching Food Wars on Travel Channel, I regretted the fact that I lived in an area with NO Portillos, Buona Beef, Al's Beef or Mr. Beef around. I don't care that Al's came in 2nd to Mr Beef on Food Wars-- I prefer Al's flavor. 

We have a real contender in Al's...The place is brand spanking new, cool graphics on the walls (for us native Chicaaaahhhgoans), and the menu goes far beyond standard Italian beef. It's tough to make choices when the REAL Vienna hot dog bun packages are staring me in the face.
We will go back...and often... to check out the burgers, dogs and chicken too. And oh yeah... the BEST fries anywhere!
