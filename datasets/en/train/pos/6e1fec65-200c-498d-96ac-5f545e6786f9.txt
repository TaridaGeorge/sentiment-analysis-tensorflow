As an avid cook, I am always in need of spices.  The Asian markets like Lee Lee's and Tan Phat pretty much cover my need for Indian spices and star anise for pho, but for everything else, I've fallen in love with Penzey's.

My favorite thing is their smart packaging.  If you want 4 oz+ size, they package in large ziploc bags, making it easy to refill your spice jar without having more cumbersome glass to transfer over and recycle.

Try their Chile powders...lots of variety and lots of kick!  Their black peppers come in a wide assortment. I love the Indian black pepper that is extra spicy.

Their prices are also very reasonable.
