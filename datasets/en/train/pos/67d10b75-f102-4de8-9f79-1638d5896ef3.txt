The Farmhouse is a wonderful gem of a place. It's small and cozy, and filled with antiques. The location is just as quaint, in downtown Gilbert's Heritage District. BTW, the Farmhouse restaurant is not to be confused with the Farmhouse Village. There ARE restaurants there, but they are not the original Farmhouse, and not nearly as good. 

I have never had a meal here I didn't like --- from cinnamon rolls, to scrambled eggs and gravy, to a BTL sandwich and soup. They serve simple American fare, but do it right. They also --- amazingly --- have some of the same cooks and servers who have been working there for years.

The only downside I can think of is that due to it's growing popularity, there can be a line out the door. 

It's worth the wait.
