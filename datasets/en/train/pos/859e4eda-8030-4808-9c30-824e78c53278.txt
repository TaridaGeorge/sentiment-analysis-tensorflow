Tonight, for the first time, after being distracted by her mildly competent competitors the last two times I was there, I made sure to stop first at Buzznbeez and get the catfish po' boy with slaw on the side.  The catfish was absolutely gorgeous, both crunchy and creamy, and the sauce was sublime.  I am seriously in love with this sandwich, and I may very well be in love also with the exotic beauty who made it.  Seriously, if you go to Food Truck Mania at the Phoenix Farmer's Market or if you encounter Buzznbeez about town and you don't at least try the po' boy, you're a fool.
