just had dinner here and I have to say this is one of my new favorite spots..I feel bad telling people because it will be hard to eat here after but here goes..From the moment you sit down until you push back your chair you will be in food heaven..everything is full of flavor and presented in an amazing way..get the duck to start but look the portions are on the small side and the fresh fish starter is skimpy for the price but really good.  This just means you have to splt a few plates.  Pasta's and meats were excellent..cotton candy, awesome gelato, cookies and milk just the thing to end a great meal..go wednesday for the lobster roll...service is very good.
