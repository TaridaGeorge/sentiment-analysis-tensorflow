Used a groupon for a massage here. I wish i remembered my masseuses name - she was fantastic. I have really bad back issues - she knew where to push and was able to do deep tissue. She was able to get the knots and the tension out but without leaving my back in pain - it's a fine balance. Very knowledgable, professional and relaxing experience.  The room was also great - private, large and well decorated - an oasis to relax in. 

I would definately return here for a massage and recommend this place to friends. I just wish I could remember the masseuses name....
