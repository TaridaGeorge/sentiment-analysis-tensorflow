Very good Italian food!! Don't waste your time standing in line downtown Phx for over an hour for even better pizza here. Lasagna, speghetti...everything is packed with flavor. They may want to make sure the music is suitable for the setting of romance or family dinners...one day a staff member had rap on. Will come back though!
