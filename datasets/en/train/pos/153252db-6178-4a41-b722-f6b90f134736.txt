Totally agree with M M R's review.  Well done.  I'll try a short and sweet version:

One man band - Christopher does it all...and I mean all.  While food is fantastic, the experience is what makes this a one of a kind place.  Bring cash and your own wine.  Don't be picky, let him bring you what he is making.  You won't regret it.
