This place is wonderful -- great drink and food menu. Where to begin, the gin/blackberry drink with the naked lady swizzle stick was both tasty and entertaining (nice added detail with the stick).

The patio is great -- misters were a little heavy, but in a few weeks it won't matter! The crab cake BLT was delicious -- perfect amount of mustard remoulade. We also had the smorgasboard -- perfect amount of salty snacks before our meal -- loved the kale chips!

The laid back atmosphere and comfort food theme worked well for our date night. Would love to take friends for a happy hour soon!

Another hit for Craig DeMarco!
