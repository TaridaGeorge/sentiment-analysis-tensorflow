Went to House of Tricks to celebrate the following, as the following occur on weekdays for us in 2012, and the weekend is the best time for us:

My Birthday on 9 April
Our Marriage Day on 12 April

My wife and I celebrated both, and this was a wonderful place.  

My wife got ahi tuna with a Southwest & Asian flare
I ordered lamb shank with a French/Italian flare

Both were very good.  We also had a wonderful quail for our starters.  This is definitely worth it in the Mill Avenue District
