I don't even know where to begin. If you need a costume, come here. The employees are so friendly and very helpful. The rental fees are very reasonable considering their costumes are stage quality. 

The store used to be an old bank and the way they transformed it is just way cool. It's fun to come here even just to look around. 

Actually, even if you don't need a costume go check it out. It's a fun experience no matter what.
