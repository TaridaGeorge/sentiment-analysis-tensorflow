I can't believe the mediocre ratings of this place.  We've been 4 times now, and the service is impeccable.  I can't believe how fast and organized they are.  Prior to this we went to IPIC several times, and why it's very nice and trendy, the service has always been horrible and it's way overpriced. In fact the last time I went to IPIC, my food was not served until the end of the movie.  This is my new place to see every movie.  The food is good, the drinks are reasonably priced and the service is amazing.  They have a team work system.  Our server took our order and entered it in an iphone type of system.  She still was taking other orders, and our food was delivered to us in less than 5 minutes!  I hope this place succeeds.
