Well, we were sure astonished to find a great rib joint in a mall! 

The sampler was more than enough for two people -- everything was good, but especially the chicken.

I like most BBQ, but Shane's reminded us that the stuff we have up our way (Seattle) is pretty lame. Shane's does a classic Southern style BBQ, which is complex and spicy. Like another of the reviewers, I thought the greens were a little on the sweet side.

The staff does a great job of getting the orders out quickly, and keeping the place clean and appealing. If we lived in the Phoenix area, we'd be regulars.
