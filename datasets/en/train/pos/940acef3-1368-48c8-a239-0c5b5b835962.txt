This is the first time I've been to a Cheesecake Factory in AZ.  We brought a party of 9 on a Saturday around 6pm, so we were afraid we'd be waiting for hours.  We arrived and were greeted by friendly, organized staff at the front desk.  A manager quickly walked the restaurant and found a section that we could be seated at within 40 minutes.  We expected the wait and waited only about 30 before we were seated.  I had 2 small children and 4 teenage girls...I thought dinner would be mahem.  The waitress was attentive and the food quality was wonderful.  She even came back to make conversation with my daughter and her friends and explained menu items to them.  The value was great too, we fed all 9 people appetizers, dinner and desserts for less than $200.
