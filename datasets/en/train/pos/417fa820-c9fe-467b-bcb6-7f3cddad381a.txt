Loved this place!  I don't go to laundromats often so I was a bit clueless upon entering, but the staff was extremely helpful and friendly.  

They have a wide selection and number of machines along with deep basin sinks for hand washing items, vending machines with all the laundry supplies you could need, vending machines for refreshments, and movies playing all around the place. 

The entire laundromat was extremely clean and welcoming.  I would highly recommend to anyone!
