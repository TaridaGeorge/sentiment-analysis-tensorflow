If you are a vegetarian or vegan - you must try this place.  I am neither - but loved this place.  

The "noritos" were awesome - wonderful colors and flavors.  i will never eat nachos again!  The roasted cauliflower soup was also delicious along with the Black Bean wrap.  Of course, we had to end the meal with some homemade dark chocolate with hemp seeds on it.  Very tasty!

If you are looking for clean, healthy food - this is the place.

Service was good and they have improved on the length of time it takes to get in and out of there.  i can now fit this in as a lunch spot.
