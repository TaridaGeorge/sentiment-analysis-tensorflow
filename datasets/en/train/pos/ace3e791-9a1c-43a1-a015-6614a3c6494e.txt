We just sold the car we bought at Carmax that spawned the original review here almost three years ago.

As with the purchase, the sale was ridiculously simple. The appraisal took about 20 minutes, and came in ABOVE Kelley Blue Book "excellent condition" trade in value -- and the car was in good - very good condition, but certainly not excellent.

A fair price, and no hassle. At a car dealership. Who'd have thunk it?
