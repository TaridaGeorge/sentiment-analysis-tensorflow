This place is in a great location - next to the Boulders and all of the beautiful scenery. The mountains up here are gorgeous and worth the drive alone. But top that off with great food (especially the salads!) and great service well that just makes a night out (and go at twilight!) to die for. It is fairly easy to get to - just straight down Scottsdale Rd. And you can do some shopping around here too. I am impressed but a lot of things are impressing me about AZ. This is definitely one spot to check out.
