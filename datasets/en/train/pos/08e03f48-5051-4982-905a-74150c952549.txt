Uhm OK, I might be a lil biased just because I've been getting my coffee from them for more than a decade and a half but there's really no comparing Seattle Espresso to any of the other places in that part of town.

Their staff is friendly, the coffe (contrary to one reviewers opinion) is not burnt, their WiFi is OK, and the place is well maintained for it's age. 

I've had coffee in all kinds of places, including major cities in Europe and this stuff ranks right up there  with the best of it.
