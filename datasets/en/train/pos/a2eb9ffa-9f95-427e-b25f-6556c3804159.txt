If you've read my other reviews, you know I have a soft spot for family-run businesses and this one is no exception. Having tasted a LOT of pho in my time, I have to say that this is among the best! It's wonderfully friendly proprietors and delicious options for both carnivores and herbivores! I recently had to make some changes to my dietary habits and tried their vegetarian pho for the first time today - absolutely delicious, super-flavorful, and loaded to the brim with crisp veggies. If you're a vegetarian and looking for a yummy vegan pho, check 'er out. If you're NOT a vegetarian, try the pho tai (rare slices of steak). Egg rolls and rice paper spring rolls are also tasty times, indeed!
