A colleague took me here on a recent business trip, and on my next trip I will definitely be back. The thing that impressed me about  Cibo's is the food is all very fresh and very high quality. I don't know if they cure their own olives, but it wouldn't surprise me - it's that kind of place. You just can't go wrong on that menu. Portions are generous but not absurd and service was great; friendly, thoughtful - eager, even. The staff seemed proud of the place.The surroundings were very nice, too.  I may share the secret of Cibo's with my other colleagues when we visit Phoenix next month...if they're extra nice to me.
