The land of "yes."  Make any request and it will be done.  Killer infinity pool.  Amazing view.  Lovely rooms.  One of my all time favorite hotels.  Expensive.  Go during off season.

Update:  Hmmm... seems to be turning into quite the celebrity hideaway.  The bartender used to tell me about Britney's stays.  And I did see chef Mario Batali leaving one night.  But most recently Vince and Jennifer were guests.
