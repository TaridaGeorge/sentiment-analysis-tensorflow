I purchased about 100 plants from Jackrabbit back in 2006 when I was landscaping my front yard. These guys are absolutely the best - they know their plants, they can give you expert advice, they deliver and are local. Today I needed to replace a dead Palo Verde tree in my back yard (landscaper got it somewhere else) and the folks at Jackrabbit took my credit card over the phone and will deliver me a new tree in 30 minutes. This is amazing service!

Folks, stay away from Lowes, Home Depot and Moon Valley. They sell low quality plants and nobody at Lowes or Home Depot knows anything about desert landscaping or what type of care different plants/trees need. Keep your business local and invest in the local economy and real mom-and-pop businesses who need us in order to thrive.
