Truly a perfect place......small plates, amazing food, good for the environment. We talked to the lady chef, rather than just chef, during the meal. She shops for fresh ingredients at local markets during the day. That is why the menu changes almost nightly. We loved it and it is good for you too. Not a better place in Scotsdale.
