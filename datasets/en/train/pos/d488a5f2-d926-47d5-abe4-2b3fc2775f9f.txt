my three kids love this place. 16 year old hangs out with friends the 11 year old does the same and the 5 year old does his own thing in the under 7 section. someone said it was like jumping on the bed only safer. i agree. its fun. i did see the sign that said no outside food or drinks including water, but if you are a parent it seems it doesnt apply. i saw lots of starbucks cups around but only where the parents were waiting. over all a great place to go, and its in the "hood"
