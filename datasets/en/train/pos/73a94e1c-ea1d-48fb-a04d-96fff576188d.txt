I love it here. It has a really unique name and I had the best time. 
Went here on the first day of Restaurant week - and I had several dishes. 
Started with the chop salad which had a very unique flavor, crunch and dried corn. It was interesting. 
Moved into Halibut and dessert - all was awesome. 
I sat at the bar and had an awesome time. The service was great and I will visit again.
