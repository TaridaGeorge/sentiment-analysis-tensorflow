Just there.  Had the mixed grill.  There were two of us.  Mixed grill came with two skewers of lamb kabob, two skewers of chicken kabobs, flavorful brown basmati rice, chopped salad.  This portion was too much for two people but it didn't stand in the way of us finishing it.  We tried one beef and one chicken samosas.  It was a draw.  I liked the beef, hubby liked the chicken.  We had baklava and firni for dessert.  Everything was fantastic.  I will definitely go back.
Thanks to yelpers who lead me to this place.  
Congrats to the staff who did their best to fill all the orders even on a busy Saturday night.  The place was packed.
