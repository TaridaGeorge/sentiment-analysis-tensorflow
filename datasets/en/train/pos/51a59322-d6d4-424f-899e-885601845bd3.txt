This place is a hidden gem in the Phoenix area! It's a true family-run place where all the food is fresh and authentic. The caprese includes mozzarella made from scratch by one of the owners, and is to die for! The pasta is all made in-house, which is a rare find. The wine list was created by the son of the owners, who is a sommelier living in Italy. If that wasn't enough, the desserts are all home-made and excellent too! I can't say enough about this place, and can't wait to come back!
