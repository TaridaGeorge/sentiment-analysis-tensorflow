I have been going here for years. I always thought that the decor was a little much but when we were visiting my wife's parents in Bavaria I found a place that I would swear is the twin of Zur Kate. I think the food is spot on for a German restaurant. The staff is always friendly. Jager schnitzel and Rahm schnitzel are my favorites. The menu is very typical of a small restaurant in Germany as is the beer selection...both are limited in options but generous in size for the price. The atmosphere is what it is all about and they have that part down.
