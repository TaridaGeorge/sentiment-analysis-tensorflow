I have no shame giving Chipotle the elusive 5 stars and here's why: this is essentially a "fast food" restaurant, but they use fresh ingredients and make everything in-house. That is something I truly respect and want to see more of in the food industry.

Okay, so it may not be "authentic", but who comes here for authentic food? It just tastes damn good. You can't go wrong with a ginormous burrito stuffed with chicken, rice, beans, peppers and onions, corn salsa, pico de gallo, cheese, guacamole and whatever else your hungry heart desires. Their customer service is also very on-point. 

On my budget, I consider eating at nice restaurants a luxury, not an expectation, so it's comforting that I can get great, fresh food at an affordable price.. Truly a college student staple.
