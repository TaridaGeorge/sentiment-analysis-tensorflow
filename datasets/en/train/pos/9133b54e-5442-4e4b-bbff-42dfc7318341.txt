This review is for the BLT Steak bar. We went on a Saturday night to hang out in the R Bar lounge, but with it being a rainy Saturday night, there was not a seat to be found, so we headed back to the BLT Steak Bar and sat on a pair of very comfy couches with one huge table in between us.  We had a great time and enjoyed the fantastic service and prices. Our server was wonderful and she even made sure to check on us just before the happy hour ended so that we could order another round. Unlike an experience I had in the past at another location where we ordered well before happy hour ended and the waiter wouldn't honor the happy hour prices.  We loved this place and will be back!! I hope our next visit is just as nice.
