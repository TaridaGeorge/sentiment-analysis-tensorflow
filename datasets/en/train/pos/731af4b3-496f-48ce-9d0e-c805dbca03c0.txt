Yes Go to China Chili! 
I was tipped off by a friend to this place...a little bit out of my "hood" but what the hey. 
For starters they are good about QUALITY, Yeah I said it QUALITY. We could make wonton soup and let it get mushy and bland. China Chili's is very fresh tasting...lots of mildly crunchy cabbage...YUM! 
My husbands new love affair with Singapore Noodles was once again renewed. He ate almost the entire (giant) portion. 
I was intrigued by Pillow Chicken (where do you find this at other places?...you don't!). Chicken and water chestnuts wrapped in a light almost rice dough...with black pepper sauce. All the right combinations working together to make a great dish! 
Will we go back..YES! Now we just have to drive a bit further to great Chinese cuisine.
