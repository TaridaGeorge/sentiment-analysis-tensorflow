My fiance and I have gone here twice for dinner. We have been seated right away and the hosts were very nice (opening the door for us, saying hi/bye as we came in and left). The rolls are indeed the best! Mmm, honey butter... My fiance has liked his seafood ok the last couple times and the little mini "porkies" are delicious. They are served on those yummy buttery rolls. They may just need a side of bbq if you're used to sloppy bbq as opposed to dry. Not sure how I feel about those peanuts. We used to have  Lone Star Steak House back in Illinois that was not allowed to do that due to health code violation?
