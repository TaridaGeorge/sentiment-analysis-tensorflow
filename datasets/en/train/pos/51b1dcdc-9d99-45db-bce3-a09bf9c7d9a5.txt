What is not to love about this wonderful Bakery. It is in a great location right on Southern in Tempe. If you did not know it was there however, you might not realize what it is.
 Lots of parking in the lot. Very clean and wonderful smelling inside.
Their pastries and baked goods are fabulous. Fresh and wonderful.
 Plus you can order almost any type of cake that you would like. 
My girlfriend got me a Tiramasu Birthday Cake here and it was one of the best I have ever had, short of Italy itself.
Fresh , creamy, and smooth. The lady fingers were fantastic!
If you ever need a cake or even some lovely morining snacks. This is the place to go.
