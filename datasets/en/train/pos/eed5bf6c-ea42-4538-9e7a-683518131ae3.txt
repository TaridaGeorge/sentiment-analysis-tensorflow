My boyfriend and I are pizza fanatics and we recently moved right down the street from Nick's and they never disappoint! Their prices are unbeatable and the quality of their food is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. We recently had their canolis and we are hooked! We can't eat any other pizza now. The service is always quick and super friendly and you can't beat the free delivery within 3 miles (which we are). Would totally recommend to anyone!
