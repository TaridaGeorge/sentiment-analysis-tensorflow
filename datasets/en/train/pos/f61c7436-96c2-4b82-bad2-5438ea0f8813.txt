I love sushi eye. I've been eating here since I moved to AZ on the recommendation of friends, and it's better than most of the places I frequented when I lived in So Cal. My gang thought it had closed one night and were super sad when we went to the location in Tempe, not realizing until we read the sign on the door that it had relocated--but it's good enough to remain our only sushi haunt despite its location being less convenient now.

The food is good, the atmosphere is nice. The music rules (I love trance, though, and seriously, most restaurants, I think, have the song "soul sista" on a loop--the trance rules the schools), and the service is always good. I recommend this place to anyone.
