When I first saw Swensens in Phoenix I had to stop by and get some quality ice cream.  I decided to order a Burger and Fries, for dessert I got a Vanilla Sundae and man was it good. Staff was friendly, good food and decor has that old Ice cream parlor look. Loved it. give it a 5 stars and hope it stays in my neighborhood for a long time.
