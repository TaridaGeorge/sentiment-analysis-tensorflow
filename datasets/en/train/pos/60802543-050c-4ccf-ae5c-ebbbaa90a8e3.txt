Went hiking here in January and loved it! It is located in the McDowell Sonoran Preserve (access to the Lost Dog Wash Trail is from here also).

The view is truly beautiful! It is well worth the hike. The trail is moderate  in difficulty with beautiful views along the whole way. There are many photo opportunities throughout the hike and dogs are welcome. Don't forget the water, sunscreen and protein bars : )
