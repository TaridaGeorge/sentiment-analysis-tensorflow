This is the cutest and yummiest place! Came here for a sat afternoon birthday party for my friends kids. It is sosososo cute!  They have double rows of picnic tables, and trees. Then several small places to eat, gardens, (you can buy fresh eggs in diff colors! and other veggies/fruits dep on what is in season). There is a little house with art exhibits. When we went, they were showcasing a local artist, and had an exhibit where you go through close-lines of white linen sheets. Just like the movies. Never did that before. That day, they had fresh bread baked and sold there.  It was so charming, and so cute.  I think there were 2-3 bridal showers and 2 other birthday parties. We had a great time. And the food was sooo good (we had a steak sandwich and fresh lemonade and apple pie.  yummm)
