I LOVE Trader Joe's. I don't really like the other customers since they always seem to leave their carts in the middle of the aisle so that no one else can pass.....you know who I'm talking about! BUT the staff is always awesome, and the place is immaculate. It is easy to find things (except for olives) and the food is sooooo good. I always look forward to my shopping trips:) Thanks for being Awesome Trader Joe's!
