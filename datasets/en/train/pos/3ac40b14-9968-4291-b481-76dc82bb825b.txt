I like to think of myself as a library connoisseur because, well, I like libraries and I've been to a fair number of them.  This library is awesome. It's clean, well maintained, and has lots and lots of computers.  There are sections for DVDs, blue-ray, series on DVDs, and of course, books.  But I'm going to let you in on a secret: you can go online and put anything you want on reserve for yourself (assuming you have a library card), and they will email you when your item is ready to pick up. And it's free!

The staff has always been great. We love this library. I wish more of our tax payer money would go to fund services like these!
