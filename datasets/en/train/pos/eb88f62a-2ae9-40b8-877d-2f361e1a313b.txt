I love this place, favorite place in scottsdale!! I love true foods yum!! It has everything ipic studio for a one of a kind movie experience. H&M love love!! As well as bath and body works, the apple store and niketown its like San Francisco in scottsdale, well maybe more of a walnut creek for my bay area yelpers, lol! Free parking as well as a nice ambience. Cool one of a kind stores like dry bar a blowout for the ladies and mini bar ber shop for the men.
