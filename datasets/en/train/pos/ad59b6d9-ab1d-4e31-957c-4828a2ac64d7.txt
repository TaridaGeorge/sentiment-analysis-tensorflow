Scottsdale snobs go else where! This is your good ol' fashion, traditional hole in the wall Thai restaurant that has one focus...Make some darn good Thai food. I love me some Pad Thai and Red Curry and this place was MONEY! Sure the decor is out dated and English might not be their first language, but are you here to sight see and carry on a long delightful conversation or are you here for some delicious grubbin'!?! This is my go to Thai place from now on and I will definitely be back!
