I really don't give 5 stars that often (ever?) but I absolutely love Pappadeaux.

Both times I have eaten there, I've gotten absolutely delicious food across the board.  Typically I will have appetizers (mussels, clams, some gumbo, etc.) but I've also had the trout (which was delicious).  I find their food seasoned well, balanced in flavor, and visually appetizing without tasting too greasy or obnoxiously oily/buttery.

They are open late as well, and the drinks are outstanding.  Fresh lime juice margaritas, not too sweet, with Patron where they don't skimp on the booze?  What can be better?

Pardon my brevity on this review, but just go and you won't be disappointed.  Hats off to the Pappas' group for bringing a great restaurant to Phoenix.  Please don't expand and ruin a good thing either!
