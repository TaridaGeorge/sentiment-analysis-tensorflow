When In Scottsdale.....  Only place to have Gyros.  

Great price, great FRESH food, great service. 

 I went during lunch and got my food pretty quickly.   I know I will always have a great experience here.  I've been to other so called Gyros joints and have been disappointed.  

 I have literally tried everything on the menu and I'm giving in my review today.  You will not be disappointed.
