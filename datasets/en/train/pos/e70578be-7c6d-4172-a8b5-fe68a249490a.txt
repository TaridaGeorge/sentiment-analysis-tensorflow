My new review is 5 stars - I have grown to really love this place. They have wonderful food, mostly good service and are in walking distance from my house. The move to the new location made a HUGE difference. 

My old review  was 3 stars - I met girlfriends for breakfast here last weekend.  I didn't love it, I didn't hate it.  I didn't really think much of it either way.  I probably would not suggest going here again but would go if someone else invited me.  The food was okay and has some untraditional & interesting twists.  The wait was very long.
