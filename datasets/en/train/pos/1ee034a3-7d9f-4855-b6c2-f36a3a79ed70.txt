Wow, this place rocks! I have been there twice, once for lunch and then again for early dinner.  They have a full menu for happy hour which runs most days from 11:30-6:30 and an outstanding wine list, many of these wines are on special for $5 during the happy time.  The menu itself had so many choices it was hard to decide on what to order.  We ended up with Rigatoni chicken that I had to come back for with a second visit, and we also ordered the manchego sandwich, recommended by our waiter.  They have a nice seating area at the bar, and also an outdoor patio.  They have only been open 3 months but this one is a  winner with outstanding food and reasonable prices!!
