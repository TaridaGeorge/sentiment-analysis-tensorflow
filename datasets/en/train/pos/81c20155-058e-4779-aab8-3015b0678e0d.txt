This place is a little hole in the wall who serves the best pho. The environment is very simple, but you will be impressed on why this spot is completely packed during lunch hours. Their food is tasty, flavorful, and it comes at a cheap price ($4-7 per gigantic bowl of pho). This location also got featured in Phoenix Magazine (July 2012) Cheap Eats across the valley!
