Met some colleagues for lunch on a Wednesday.  The server was prompt, polite, and perfectly engaged.  

Our spinach salad came out quickly and was perfectly tossed in a lovely presentation.  The lettuce was fresh and the vegetables were fresh.  

We ordered the Funghi and the Yukon.  The pizzas were slightly burned at the edges, but the burn actually enhanced the flavor of the mixture of vegetables on the pizza.

We had the donut hold type dessert.  Amazing.  Delicious.  I cannot wait to go back.
