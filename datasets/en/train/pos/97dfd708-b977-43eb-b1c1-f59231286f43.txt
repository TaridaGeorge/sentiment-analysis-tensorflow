I'm new to the area and have been to a couple of Arizona Hair salons in the valley so thought I would give this one a chance...even with the not so hot reviews.

Went in with mid length hair, and wanted a layered short cut.

Jill did exactly as I asked. I mean EXACTLY. I showed her a picture and I don't even she looked at it again. It was exactly on the mark!

Everyone was friendly ... No gossiping about co-workers and Jill didn't even talk my head off...I probably did hers.

I love it. I will go back for every cut going forward. I am so glad I went.

Thanks Jill for a great job.
