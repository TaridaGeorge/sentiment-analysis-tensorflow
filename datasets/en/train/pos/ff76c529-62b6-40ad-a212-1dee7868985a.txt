Al's new owner in Scottsdale is doing an excellent job.  The beefs are excellent.  They are juicy, flavorful, great bread, and perfect with the hot peppers or even without.  I like my sandwich super dipped.  The french fries are excellent too.  They are fresh and crispy.  I'm hungry now I think I will head on over :-)  Thank you for hearing my opinion.
