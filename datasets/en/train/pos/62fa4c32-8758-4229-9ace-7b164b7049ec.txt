Fabulous Greek food at a fast food restaurant WITH A DRIVE THROUGH???  You betcha!

I ordered the lamb souvlaki platter with a Greek salad which was covered in feta so thick you couldn't see the lettuce or tomato!  The dressing was rich and creamy.  They served thick pitas (not the flimsy store bought kind)  with thick and creamy yogurt sauce.  The lamb was tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned!  The sum total of it was A-MAZ-ING!  My brother also ordered the souvlaki, though he substituted fries for the salad and he was thrilled with his meal also!

I was only in town for four days, so I didn't have a chance to go back, but even now I'm having fantasies about a return visit!  I think I may need to schedule another road trip to Phoenix to try some of their other offerings.  This city has the best food!!!
