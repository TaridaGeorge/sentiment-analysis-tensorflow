Anyone been to St. Nick's Pub in Harlem?  The best jazz bar in the country, at least in NYC?  

This is really nothing like it, but definitely the closest thing to a great everyone's here for the music vibe, with great soulful musicians doing both originals and covers (who can actually pull off a cover of Lauryn Hill).  People dance like they feel it, not like they're being watched.  Didn't think it could happen in Phoenix. Barely a cover charge, drinks are reasonable.
