I was in Phoenix for 4 days and ate here twice for lunch.  One of the best burgers I have ever had (samburger both times) and amazing milkshakes (kit kat and butterfinger).  The service was excellent both days.  Ate at the bar the first day and all the bartenders were friendly and timely, even the girl who was on her first day.  Brought the wife and we ate outside and our server was excellent there also.  Great place, please open one in Chicago.
