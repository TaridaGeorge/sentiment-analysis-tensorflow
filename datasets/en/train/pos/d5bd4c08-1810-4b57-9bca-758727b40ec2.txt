Such a great unique venue for a wedding or corporate event! I am a planner in the area and I have worked at numerous venues and there is no other venue out there like Monorchid! I highly recommend checking it out if you are looking for an event space. Not only is it a unique and beautiful space, the staff there is amazing to work with and goes above and beyond to make sure each and every client has an amazing event!
