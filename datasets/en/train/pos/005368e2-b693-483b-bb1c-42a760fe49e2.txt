What can I say...I was here for 5 nights on a business trip and fell in love the first time. I returned again and was not disappointed. Awesome Gym and very clean and large rooms, great food as well. Great gambling too.

Well worth $400 per night. They also have rooms for lower price as well. give them a try. You won't be disappointed
