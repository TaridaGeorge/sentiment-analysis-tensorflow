I love food....I had the steak roll ups and some potato salad.  Steak tips had mushrooms and carmelized onions in them and this delicious dipping sauce that I kinda felt like drinking it was so dang good.  
The coolest coke machine ever is here (we need some in Text) it is a touch screen coke machine. 

I was watching th people in front of us do it first so I didnt feel too stupid taking my turn.  It was way cool...wish I would have gotten a picture.  The area is great, next will have to try a different place in same area!

They also have pictures up around the entire restraunt that were drawn by kids at the Childrens hospital was a very cute touch!
