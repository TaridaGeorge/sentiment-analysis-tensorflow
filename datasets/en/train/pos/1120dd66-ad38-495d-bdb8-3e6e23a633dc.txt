I've been physical all my life. Paid tons of money for personal trainers, memberships to local giant gyms and felt I've always struggled to get to where i want to be. After joining the PITT, my body made some great changes and it only gets better. The training here is very unique and every class is different. The classes are awesome and as hard as you train you always feel challenged. The instructors are very in tune with each and every person in the class. There's a lot of sweating, a lot of laughing and most importantly a lot of pay off! I am completely hooked!
