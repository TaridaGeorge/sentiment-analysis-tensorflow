The most convenient Farmers Market in Phoenix for our family. This is a great farmers market but if you do not arrive early forget getting the harder to find items like the first produce of the season, leeks, fresh eggs, or bulk worms for your garden or composter. A few of these vendors also sell at the Ahwatukee Farmers Market on Sundays. There is no live music but the people are friendly and the produce is far better tasting than what you get at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods.
