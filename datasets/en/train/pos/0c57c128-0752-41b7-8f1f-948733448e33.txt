ive eaten here and to-go, for both dinner and lunch.

their meatball parm and chicken parm sammiches are awesome! and the lunch deal is a great value . . . you get the sammy, chips and a drink for like six or seven bucks.

the best thing about this place is the bread. they give you a mini loaf with your pasta dish and they serve the sammiches on it. seriously, it might be the best bread ever!

the pasta dishes here are also delish. they even do some interesting things like pesto-based raviolis topped with marinara. sounds weird but really good. also had an excellent veal dish here.

the white pizza is also i go-to fav. i havent had the red sauce pizza but i love the white. i think they only do that to go, though.

great local business to support. consistently good food.
