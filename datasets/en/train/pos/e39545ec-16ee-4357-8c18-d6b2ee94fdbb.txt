Never say never i know, but this place NEVER disappoints!! This place is the best place for great beer and great food. Always have been a fan and i'm finally writing a review, sorry! 

Just make sure you get there early and be prepared to wait for a table, its always packed on the weekends.

*SIDE NOTE-Make sure you show the server the amount and methods of payment before you hand back. We placed a twenty and debit card in check folder, but she lost the twenty between our table and the register and she charged us all on the card. Luckily she believed us when we mentioned the cash and corrected the bill.
