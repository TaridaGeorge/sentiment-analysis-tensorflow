I love this store.  The people! The service! The way this business wants to help you and actually wants you to come back again.  It is worth the trip anywhere in the East Valley to come to this ACE Hardware location.  They care about people over profits, they want to help you and they act like businesses use to when folks cared about each other in a COMMUNITY! I do not work for them and do not work for Yelp.  I am a real person and this places get 2 thumbs way up!
