Amazing!!!  I took my four boys yesterday.  We arrived at 9:40am and there were almost 50 people lined up for the presentation.  The lady doing the presentation was great.    It's educational, fun and tasty as they give you plenty of samples.  At the end of the tour, you can make a chocolate pizza.  The kids loved those and now that we are home, they are really enjoying them.
