Been here several times and have always enjoyed the file mignon or prime rib, creme brulee and attentive, professional service.  Atmosphere is nice with some younger (late 20s, early 30s) customers and not too stuffy and overrun with older businessmen/ppl like some other steakhouses.  

When we made our reservation, were asked if we're celebating a special occassion.  Server presented a Godiva-like gold box w 4pc chocolates and a 'happy birthday' which I thought was very sweet.
