I love playing soccer here indoor with my wife in a coed league. We play on Fridays with friends & it's great exercise along with being able to play inside. Kids have leagues here also and it is a large place with 2 indoor fields and 1 outdoor in back.  They have a snack bar area and a little store that sells soccer stuff as well.  Pretty cool place to have in the Northwest Valley.
