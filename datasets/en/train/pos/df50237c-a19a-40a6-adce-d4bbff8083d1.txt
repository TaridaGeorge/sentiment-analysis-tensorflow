Once your able to get a seat at the bar, your golden.  The bartenders never let your drink get empty, and the food is great.  We had a couple glasses of the house pinot, and a few beers.  The stand out here is the duck conftt flat bread.  Sooo good.  I had it about two weeks ago, so to describe the flavor now wouldn't do it justice.  All I have left is the strong desire to try it again.  Seriously good!  Get in with the staff here, and you just might be able to reserve a table on a busy Friday night.   Fondue party anyone?
