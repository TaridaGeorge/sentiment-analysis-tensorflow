Ahhhh...it's nice to be back!  We hadn't been here in a while, and had actually forgotten what delicious pizza tastes like.  I love their menu, simple and to the point...salads, pizzas and calzones.

We started off with a small caesar salad, which could feed 3-4 people.  It was tangy and fresh tasting, with crunchy croutons.  We couldn't stop eating it.  But, then our pizza arrived...a large with ricotta, fresh sliced tomatoes and half meatball...mouth-watering!  I've never been a big fan of overly sauced pizza, and this always has just the right amount on it.  The crust is the perfect vehicle for their fresh ingredients.  My husband finished off his slices, and I took home half of mine (to be enjoyed later).

The staff was very nice, but the food was "MWAAAH"!!  We can't wait to come back.
