This is a very authentic Chinese restaurant.  I am not rating it on its pnash - it has none.  This is a restaurant and food as you would find it in China.  I love the food and have had many of the dishes.  This stuff is great.  Be warned, there are people that have difficulty getting over some of the textures, decor and presentation, but I love this stuff.  Amazing and exotic.
