Love this place. Even though it's stalking me. I used to go to the Tempe location when I was an ASU student. My office now is near Scottsdale and Shea so Sabuddy closed its Tempe location and moved up here as well. Psycho!

Seriously though, the food is great especially if you want a light but delicious lunch. Their tasty lentil soup with a bit of hummus and pita bread is enough to keep me going for the rest of the day. The soup is probably one of my favorite soups in the Valley.

A good buddy of mine is Israeli and he's taught me a few words in Hebrew, so I try and impress the waitresses with an occasional "toda" (thanks) or something. It never works.
