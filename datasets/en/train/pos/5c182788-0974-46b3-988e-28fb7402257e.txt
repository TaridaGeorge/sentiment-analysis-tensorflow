Hadn't been in North Scottsdale in a while, recalling quickly all that I had been missing. As i walked in a lovely was coming out in her high heels and all dressed up ready to go hit the town.. oh yeah.. the food the food.

This was an EVFN event, they extended the Happy Hour for us for a couple of hours, and buy was that a good thing. The sushi is incerdible, the miso soup, the salmon the tuna.. all fantastic. I even tried the little burger for $2 ... amazign tastes all around. 

Leelani was our server, sweet and pretty gal who could tell you everything about the menu and what to get..  still see her smile. 

Hope to get back there again one day.. although they knew it was my bday....an no real deal.
