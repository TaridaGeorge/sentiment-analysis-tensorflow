Yeah even though its not super easy to find it the food is great.  Everything seems to have a Southwest flare.  The Mashed potatoes are great and the creamed corn is amazing.  The Short rib's are a must try.  If you are in this area and looking for a great dinner or lunch you should really check it out.  It is very small so a reservation wouldn't be a bad idea.
