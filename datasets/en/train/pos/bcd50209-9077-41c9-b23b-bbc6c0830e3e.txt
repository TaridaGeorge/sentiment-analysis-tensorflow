Arrived on a week day with my 5 year old son, They were nice enough to give us a free upgrade on our room to be closer to the water park. There was a female bartender poolside who really made my sons day (strawberry smoothie with gummy bears) and our experience memorable. I was very impressed how friendly everyone was in 107 degree heat. Im really happy with our experience and we travel to phoenix a couple times a month and now well make this our regular spot!  Every dollar was worth it. I really liked that you can charge things to the room and not have to keep pulling your card out.
