This place has served the best Mexican food of my life.

At 70 miles or so round trip, it was a serious pilgrimage to make it down there, but if one could arrange an outing, the pitchers of margaritas and fiery entries made it very much worth doing.  It is inexpensive as well, so you may be surprised at the smallness of the bill when it arrives for the amount of fun you have.

It is very far away from most of Phoenix and don't stray too far from the beaten path out here or you might end up in sketchy neighborhood land.
