Best ACE in the valley! I'll fight you if you say other wise.

I've been coming since I was lik 5 years old! The ppl have changed and the name has changed almost 4 times ...Berry's, Charlie's..i dont remember. 

But what has not changed is the friendly service. I have a soft spot for jovial and sarcastic employees. Probably because that is the kind of employee I am. The resounding implications of happy employees is a quick indicator IF I will return or not. The product maybe sub-par and the place could look a little torn up...but the ppl get me every time. I am sure I am not alone in this.

Thanks ACE!
