As most men out there... bbqing a good hamburger is my ultimate task, and therefore I rarely find a burger that comes close to what I make at home! But here you go!! This place is awesome...!!

I had the Kobe burger, that I got to customize myself! What could be better other than putting fresh toppings of my choices on my perfect burger! Just down right awesome. Definitely will be going here again... next time im in Scottsdale that is!
