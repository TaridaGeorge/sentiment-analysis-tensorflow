After trying out the grooming facilities at Petco and Petsmart, we tried Kelly's Kritter Clips. They are fantastic!

Our dog (short-hair dachshund) does not like getting his nails trimmed, but especially hates when the groomer tries to Dremel them (like Petco insisted on doing). At Kelly's, he behaves like a gentleman and they get him in and out within a few minutes.

We occasionally opt for a full-grooming and when we make an appointment, it only takes about 20 minutes from arrival to departure. This is a huge improvement from the "drop-off" policy at other groomers where your dog is put in a kennel to wait their turn and end up spending a couple of hours there.

We highly recommend Kelly's Kritter Clips in Queen Creek!
