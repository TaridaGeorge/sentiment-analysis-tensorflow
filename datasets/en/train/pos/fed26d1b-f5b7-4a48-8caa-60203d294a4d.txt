I've eaten in Indian restaurants all around in the U.S. and in Europe.
A Taste of India's food is Superb and is at a great value.

I have tried many different dishes in the restaurant and all of them were great.

The service is excellent.  We have brought friends with us and recommended
this restaurant to many people and they all love it . The restaurant is also 
very accommodating in terms of preparing food to individual's tastes.
