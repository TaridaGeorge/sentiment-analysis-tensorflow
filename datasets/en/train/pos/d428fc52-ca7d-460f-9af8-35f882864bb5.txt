This place rocks!  When they opened I was skeptical because years ago there was another yogurt place there that failed...They have done a great job of advertising there with specials in the local West Valley View and in the mailer you get with the local stores.  The store is always clean, the personnel is helpful and friendly and yogurt is yum!  I love to see a business do it the right way and applaud their success.  The store is always busy after the dinner hour with people out on the patio and inside and there is a nice vibe there!  

Way to go Yogurtini!
