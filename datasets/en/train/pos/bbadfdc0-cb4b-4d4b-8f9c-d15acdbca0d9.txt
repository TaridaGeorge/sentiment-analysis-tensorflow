Through the years, I have purchased many things including a wedding ring for my wife from The Jewelsmith. This is not your typical jewelry store. This is the place to go when you want something special. You do not have to buy a big diamond here. They have custom pieces new, used and estate jewelry.

What I really love about the Jewelsmith is that the owners give back so much to the community.
