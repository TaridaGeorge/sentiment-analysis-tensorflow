I have such a love/hate thing going on when I eat at Lo-Lo's. I love eating there then I immediately hate myself for doing it. The waffles slathered in butter are so damn good with my drumstick coated in hot sauce. Man, I could really go for some this weekend. Too bad I'm out of town :-/ To top it off, it's only $20 for two people!
