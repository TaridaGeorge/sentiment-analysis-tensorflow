Just the facts re: full dinner experience:

Ambiance: Thinking about redecorating the house to look just like Trader Vic's - unbelievable.
Service: perfectly charming, informative and attentive.
Drinks: I don't drink, so read every other review for a review of drinks.
Appetizer: Beef Cho-Cho - amazingly tender, it melts in your mouth. Great flavor.
Dinner: Trader Vic's Calcutta Curries: good & better when you mix in the variety of garnishes.  fun to play around with the flavors.
Dinner 2: Chinese BBQ Flat Iron Steak: Amazing.  Crispy onions, mashed potatoes and tender/flavorful steak will make you close your eyes and wish it would never end.
Dessert: (don't know the name) vanilla icecream covered in coconut
 on a bed of chocolate sauce: simple, beautiful and tasty. 

Overall experience: the best darn dinner experience I've ever had.
