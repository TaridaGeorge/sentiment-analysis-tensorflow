Ate there last weekend.  We waited 3 hours and could not have been more pleased with our pizzas.  We ordered three:  Sonny Boy, Wise Guy and Margherita.  All were amazing, a flavor we have not had since Naples and never had duplicated in the states.  Service was warm, kind and fabulous.  Would go again to Phoenix just to eat here.  It is a special kind of crowd that will wait three hours for pizza.   A crowd that knows it is worth it.
