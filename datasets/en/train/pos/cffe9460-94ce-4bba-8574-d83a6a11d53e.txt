YAHOOO!!!! 

Trying to voice my excitement over finding a boba place around university drive. I tried EVERYWHERE and there's no boba place EXCEPT this one! YAY! Score! After one hour attempt to find my craving finally I got it. The service was EXCELLENT! The owner was very friendly, she really making sure I got what I want. Great boba, great service and great chicken teriyaki with macaroni salad. YUM! I will definitely cruising down to this place again to get my Red Bean BOBA.
