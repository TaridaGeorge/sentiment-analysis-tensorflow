This place is part of chain in the metro area, so several people I know spoke of it by reputation.  I was advised that it was a good place to watch a game as it had good bar food, a good selection of alcohol, and young, attractive scantily-clad women.

I endeavored to patronize this establishment.  

Finally made it, and I was impressed with the layout of the place.  No matter where you sit, you have a good angle on a couple of televisions (the key to a good sports bar).  Typical bar menu, but the food was good.  Had a number of good beers on tap, and the bar was stocked with premium liquors.   

And the service was excellent.  I'll definitely go back.
