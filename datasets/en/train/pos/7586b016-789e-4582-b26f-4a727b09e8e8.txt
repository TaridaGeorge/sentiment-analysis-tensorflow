If you want bar food, this is the best place in town!!!

Teakwoods was started by the owners of the ORIGINAL Long Wong's on Mill Avenue in Tempe. Long Wong's is long gone but the tradition continues- best wings in town, hands down. Every flavor, always fresh, try the suicide wings, I dare you!

BOTTOM LINE: I drive accross town for wings. The fool I am.
