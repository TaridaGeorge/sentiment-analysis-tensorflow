The pastas are a hit - the carbonara is covered with the angriest, most intimidating chunks of bacon I've ever seen. Cheesy smokey bacon heaven. The garlic breadsticks are yummy, too.

If your service sucks or you have a bad experience, try tipping more. This holds true to just about any restaurant. 

Behold the power of the 30% tip.

To recap: I know no one that works here, have only ordered here 4 times, and they treat me like a close friend when I call.

My food gets here incredibly quick (20 - 30 minutes when they quote an hour) and they usually hook me up with free delivery and little odds and ends they think I'd like (free mozzarella sticks, some breaded mushrooms).
