Cowboy Ciao is the best restaurant in Scottsdale. The food is amazing and their wine list is impressive. This restaurant has the best overall dining experience in town. It can be a bit pricey, but it's worth it. If we're feeling frugal, my friends and I will go in and sit at the bar and drink martini's with blue cheese stuffed olives all nite long if we wanna save a buck and eat at home. Which still isn't cheap. This place is just that amazing.
