I love the fact that I live 5 minutes from this restaurant.  Outstanding singapore rice noodles, very tasty chow fun.  Chicken fried rice made to order tastes great and the portions are huge.  I find the quality of the food just as good as it's higher-priced neighbor (Wongs).  Give this place a try if you're in the area.  Also, if you shop at Fry's kiddie-corner from this restaurant, there's usually a coupon on the backside of your grocery receipt.
