At first they're standoffish and a little reserved, but I think it's having to deal with some of the fussiest jewelry designers and metal artists in the Valley. They try to assess you as you walk through the door and try to anticipate your type of personality...that's a good thing.

While it may look like a hole in the wall or a place that won't carry more than an ounce of silver, Lonnie's Inc really has so much more going for it....whether you're into enamelling or beading, this place is it.

I miss their other location out in Mesa, but that got closed down last summer.

For now, I make the drive to Lonnie's in Phoenix and each time I've gone, I've yet to be disappointed.

The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.
