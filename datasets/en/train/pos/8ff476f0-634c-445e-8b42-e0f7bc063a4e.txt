We went to the Apple Store and as always, we recieved help from one of the great customer service represensatives before we were too far from the entryway. All of our questions were answered and we walked out with exactly what we came for. The Apple Store is arranged aesthetically and helps me think clearly even if I don't understand everything about technology. Thank you Apple!
