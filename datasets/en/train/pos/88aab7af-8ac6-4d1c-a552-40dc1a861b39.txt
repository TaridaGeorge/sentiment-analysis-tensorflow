I've been there 3 times now and it's just fantastic. 

I got Bob's big burger. 2/3 pound with a nice, big bun. it's very good. 

it's a nice, southwest feel inside. quality wood, nice bar, nice wine area. 

If you have guests in town, this is a nice view into our southwest style food. 

Suggest you make reservations if it's thur, fri or sat night. Can be hard to get in. 

Highly recommended.
