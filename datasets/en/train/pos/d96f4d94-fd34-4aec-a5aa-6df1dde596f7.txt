While I have raved about this place in the past, I wanted to once again extol the virtues and, more importantly, the family feel of this place. Ernie lights up the room with her smile. Once that happens, the coffee is served, and the service begins then the rest of the breakfast is just a wonderful continuation. Peg and I went for my birthday (actually, we try to extend family occasions so that we can visit the family of chefs with whom we have grown since we moved here in '97). The OJ was fresh, the specials are always superb, and there is a continuity in the kitchen that virtually assures that the quality will be stellar.  We can't wait for the new addition this month, and Peg and I always will support Matt, Ernie, and of course Christopher!  Dr. B
