So I show up with some friends at 9:48 fully expecting to not be served, considering they close at 10. Not only did they seat us and serve us, they were friendly, the food was amazing, and they honored a coupon that we didn't even have printed out. Great Sushi, Great Service, and the lady who works there is really pretty.
