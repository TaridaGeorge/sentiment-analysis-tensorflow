For the record we did not eat here but I cannot wait to try it out! 

As we were walking back to our car from strolling through Old Town we stopped at Olive and Ivy for a beverage and bathroom break. 
I went with the tropical ice tea and it was AMAZING and unsweetened! 

While poking around the market side I decided I needed to use the restroom. Okay so the next time you go, you HAVE to check them out! They are so unique! Huge doors dark woods and a really cool sink! No worries, I am not one to make a big deal about restrooms at all (unless we are talking about the freaky doors that fog up at TAO in the Venetian in Vegas) but they are just really cool and add quite a bit of character!
