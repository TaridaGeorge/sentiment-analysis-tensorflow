I walked in there all wide-eyed and innocent and said, "I wanna buy a plant." 

Now, most customer service agents would likely eyeroll a newbie and say, "Okaaaayyyy...what kiiiind?" and I would be like, um, "green." Here the lovely woman did not even flinch at my newbieness but just started asking questions - Indoor/outdoor? Flowering/non-flowering? Sun/shade? etc. Wow. So easy!

My eyes landed on a cute little braided ficus tree, and I fell in love. That and the pot came to just $49, about $30 less than the fake ficus I was considering at a store nearby. Priscilla (the plant) and I are now very happy together. Highly recommended.
