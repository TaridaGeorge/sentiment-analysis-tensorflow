If you are looking for a great pizza at a great price, then you can't miss by going with Mamma Mia's. Although my husband is all about deep dish pizza, I however  love the thin crust New York style pizza. So when push comes to shove I usually get my way and that is how we discovered this place on a Saturday night. We went with just the classic pepperoni pizza and we weren't disappointed. On top of that they have a super nice staff to boot. Can't go wrong with this place.
