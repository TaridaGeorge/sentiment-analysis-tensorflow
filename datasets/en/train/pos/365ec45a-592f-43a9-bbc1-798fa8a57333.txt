I purchased a house and needed all the locks rekeyed as well as some adjustments to a couple bad deadbolts.  I scheduled an appointment for next day service.  Stormy showed up and provided great service with a friendly attitude.  Along with the rekeying, some lock components were replaced and a little drilling was done to correct existing alignment issues.  Very reasonably priced and excellent service.
