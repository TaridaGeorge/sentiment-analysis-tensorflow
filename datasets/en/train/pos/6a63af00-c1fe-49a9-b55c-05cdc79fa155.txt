This is one of my favorite places! I've been there tons of times, and always have a great experience. The beer is awesome, and the food is really good too! Best chicken fingers around. The hummus plate is a great variation on the regular bar food too. The service is always good, the crowd is friendly, and overall it has a nice laid back vibe. (Prices aren't bad either)
PS You MUST try the brunch!
