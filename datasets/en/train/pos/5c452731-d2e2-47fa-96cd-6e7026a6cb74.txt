One of the best steak restaurants in the city. I have consistently been treated to top shelf food and service here. I prefer the Indian Bend location, though the Camelback spot is convenient for business dinners.

Sorry to hear about Sarah's misadventure, I have not yet tried their seafood -- Ruth's Chris is all about premium aged steaks to me.
