One of the coolest restaurants I've been to in a long time. I entered through the kitchen and immediately turned around when I saw the kitchen staff - but they assured me I was headed in the right direction. We sat in a comfortable booth and looked over the amazing menu. We ordered a majority of their apps - the spinach dip being my favorite. For my entree, I ordered the salmon with the side salad and garlic mashed potatoes. Big portions, big flavor. Immpecable service. My next visit won't be soon enough!
