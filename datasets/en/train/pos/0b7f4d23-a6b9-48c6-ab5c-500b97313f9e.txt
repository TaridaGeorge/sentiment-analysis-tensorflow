I always walk by and think this place is cute, well marketed, and just a great idea.  I don't really have the $ to spend on getting my hair styled often, but I did have some photo's taken last week and wanted to be sure the hair looked good.  I had Jessica, and wow! she was amazing my hair hasn't come out this good in a loong time... it's such a shame I can't do this every day.  Keep up the good work here, definately would recommend and do it again.
