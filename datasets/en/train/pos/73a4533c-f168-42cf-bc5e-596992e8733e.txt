I have loved spicy Asian food since my trip to Thailand many years ago.  I found the food here to be very good.  Very diverse menu with a great taste for a decent price.  It is also nice to see a new place to eat downtown Phoenix, AZ as well.  I will be putting this place on my lunch rotation for sure.

Thank you Thai'd up and good luck to you all....
