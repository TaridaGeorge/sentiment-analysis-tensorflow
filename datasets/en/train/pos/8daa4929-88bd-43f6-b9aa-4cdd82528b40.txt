This has to be one of my favorite places to eat! They have great tea and coffee and delicious food. I have yet to have a crepe I didn't like here. The place itself is warm and welcoming and has a great atmosphere. I recommend the turkey pesto- its one of my favorite savory, and split dessert, any sweet crepe i have tried here has been a winner, even something as  simple as powdered sugar and lemon juice. Bon appetit!
