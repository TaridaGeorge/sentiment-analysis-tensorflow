I am very happy that I found this place. I have been searching for a great rice bowl restaurant for a long time and I finally found the place! However it's not just a rice bowl restaurant... they also have a whole menu of Chinese/Japanese dishes.

We went for lunch and ordered the chicken teriyaki rice bowl combo, which comes with an egg roll or salad and a soda! We were stuffed and it was only $14!
 
Even though other yelpers were recommending other dishes, I decided to play it safe with the chicken teriyaki bowl. The chicken teriyaki was fresh and piping hot! And they put just the right amount of teriyaki sauce on the bowl.

My fellow yelpers got this one right! Excellent food, excellent prices! I can't wait to go back!
