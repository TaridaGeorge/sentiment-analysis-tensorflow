we bought a groupon for fuego bistro. we had never been there. went for dinner on a wednesday. nice private patio. service was excellent, very attentive but not annoying. we had sangria and the house red for drinks, both were excellent. the scallop appy we had was great except the scallops themselves didnt taste like to much alone. i loved my main which was the tuna with green bean (super fresh) and the fuego salad. the salad was excellent too. my husband had the strip loin with corn and the corn bread. he thought it was great but would try somthing different next time. we will forsure go there again!!!
