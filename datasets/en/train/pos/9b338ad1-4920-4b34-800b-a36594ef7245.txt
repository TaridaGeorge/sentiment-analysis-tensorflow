As there are already 200 reviews let me be brief:

Vegetarian sandwich, I love you!  
Tasty onion bread, slightly sweet and moist, with just enough texture
Perfectly roasted yellow bell peppers
Cheese...can't remember what type but delish
Perfectly cut cucumbers.  Who talks about the slicing of a cucumber? Me.
