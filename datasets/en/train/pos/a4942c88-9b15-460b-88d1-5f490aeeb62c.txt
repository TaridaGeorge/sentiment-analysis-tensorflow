I had lunch here today with my mom and I was pleasantly surprised. The food is really good and reasonably priced. Of course, we had to try a cupcake, so we split a cookie dough cupcake and it was to die for! I can't wait to go back and try another flavor. The staff is really nice, but honestly, my favorite part was the music - Elliott Smith, Beck, Radiohead, Beatles...it doesn't get any better than that for me. I could have sat there all day listening to my favorite music while eating delicious cupcakes :)
