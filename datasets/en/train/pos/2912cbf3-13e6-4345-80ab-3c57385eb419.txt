Kim Jarmin and her team are FLAWLESS.  My husband and I worked with them for our engagement photos and for our wedding and we could not be happier.  The sneak peek photos are stunning - we can't wait to see the rest of them!  We look forward to working with Kim in the future as we build a family and capture the memories!
