Consistently comes to my rescue when I need a place to chill. I wish they were open for dinner. Today is what made me write the review. Went to one place, line was out the door. Went to another- same deal. Went to Einsteins and they were busy but not crazy busy. More like steady. Next time I'll go there first. Love the cranberry tasty turkey on a cranberry bagel. Love their seasonal food too!
