Something I enjoy about Lola's (as opposed to some of my other CenPho coffee favorites) is that it is CONSISTENT!  I do not have to worry about which barista is working or what drink I order - it is always good. 

-The staff is always friendly and takes time to get to know their regulars.
-They always have great music playing.  
-Aside from their pastry case, they usually have some hot food you can order. 
-They have the best whip cream around - seriously.  I never order whip cream at any other coffee shop, but I really don't mind those extra calories here.  

My least favorite things about this place: their seating.  Yes, those old metal school chairs look fabulous - but they are cold and uncomfortable!  If I'm going to hang out there for a few hours, I don't want my butt to go numb from uncomfortable seating.
