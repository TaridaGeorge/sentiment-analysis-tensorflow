I'm obsessed with this place! Best bruschetta I've ever had. I love all the flavors but you must get the fig, marscarpone, and prosciutto. The flavors mix together so well. I even like the salmon one, although I was a little scared to try it.  I got in to their Facebook fan party recently though and it was a great way to try some things on their menu I hadn't had before.  Also tried their mojito at the party which I would have never ordered since I generally go their for the wine selection, but it was delicious! One of the best I've had.

The Happy Hour is also awesome! Totally recommend giving it a shot if you're in the area and it may even be worth the drive if you're coming from outside of Tempe.
