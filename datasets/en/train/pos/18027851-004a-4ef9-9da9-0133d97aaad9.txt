I go here with my girlfriend and I had the very best ribs ever. It's called Galbi, basicalli it's sliced beef ribs with korean spices and flavoring.

The restaurant owner is extremely friendly, and offers great service. We've gotten takeout before as well as we got extra Kimchi at request at no extra cost.
