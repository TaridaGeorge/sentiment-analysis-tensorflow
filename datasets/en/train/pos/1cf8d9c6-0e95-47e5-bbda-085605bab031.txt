I love the PITT. I have never been the type of person who works out or played sports, but I finally had to give in and get in shape. I have been going to the PITT since December and I have lost 20 pounds and have been finding muscles I didn't even know i had! The trainers are great and extremely encouraging no matter what your athletic ability is. The workouts are never the same and they are always challenging (in a good way). I never get bored with what we are doing and love the atmosphere. I would recommend the PITT to any person who is ready to be committed to a workout routine and wants to see results.
