I try to buy all my cds at Zia simply to keep indie music stores like this in business. I spent many teenage hours flipping through the LPs at record stores in England and I would hate for the likes of Walmart (what were you thinking ACDC & Eagles?!?!?!) and itunes to become the only places I can buy music.
I want selection, new, used, music mag's, tee shirts, posters, all the stuff that Zia does so well. 
Stop buying music at the corporations and support Zia ... only when they are gone will you realize how much you miss places like this.
