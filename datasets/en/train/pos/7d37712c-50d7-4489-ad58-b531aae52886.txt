Eddie and everyone is always friendly and ALWAYS does a great job when I go there. I love to get the old fashioned shaves with my haircut, because they use a hot towel and warm shave cream... I would defiantly recommend them to every one in the area looking for  a haircut, shave to even eyebrows in a very nice shop with very nice people
