Postino rocks!

It's a great place to grab a light and relaxing dinner and drink. The place has a chill feel to it, so it's a great place to take a date. 

Postino has an extensive wine list and also offers an awesome variety of beers. Their beer list includes your basic domestics, higher end domestics, and a handful of tasty imports.

The food is amazing as well, with the highlight being the bruschetta. When ordering the bruschetta, you choose any four of eleven yummy choices. None of the eleven are bad, however my favorites are the brie and apples with fig spread, Mozzarella with tomato and basil, salami with pesto, and the warm artichoke spread.

The outdoor seating area is the place to be and the prices are very reasonable.

Great food, awesome wine list, good beer selection, nice ambience, and reasonable prices give Postino five stars.
