ZuZu has the happiest hour on earth from 5 - 7 (Monday through Friday). Sip on a hot and dirty martini for $3 with the Zombies as your soundtrack and take in the retro-sheik surroundings. Then cool down with the bramble (something yum involving lemon juice, blueberry and gin). The cheese plate and spinach artichoke dip are both a-m-a-z-i-n-g and will help you keep happy hour from becoming hammered hour. It's a must-do for reals.
