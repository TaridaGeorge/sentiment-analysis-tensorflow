Postino's is simply a great place; great ambiance, great wine, great food, and great staff.  I like how they are knowlwedgable about wine in general and often switch the wine menu to mix things up and keep it fresh.  If you find that your favorite wine has been replaced, the staff will suggest a comparable wine that will make you forget your previous favorite.  Can't beat the specials and Happy Hour.  Salute to Postinos!
