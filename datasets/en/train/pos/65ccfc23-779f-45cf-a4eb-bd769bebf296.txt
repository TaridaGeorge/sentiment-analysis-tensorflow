With some hesitation in my part, my wife and I drove from grandale to check this place out. I'm glad that we made the trip. Only good things to say. Great food, great service, clean store. The one thing that did suck was that I could not make my mind up on what to order. When I settled, I chose the Italian chops, the best pork chops that I have ever eaten. I am looking forward to our next 30 mile trip to rigatonys very very soon
