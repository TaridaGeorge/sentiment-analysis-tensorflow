Love love love!!!  Great service, great food, great drinks, great wine.  We sat outside on the patio on a Saturday night, listened to live music and shared some wine and food.  Very romantic setting, and peaceful.  The appetizers are not truly appetizers...they are MEALS!!  Had the ahi tuna tostadas...couldn't eat anything after that.  The portions are large, so split if you can.  The food is very very very very good.  We ended up taking some friends there a few days later.  They loved it too.  Love the atmosphere.  This is a perfect place for a nice romantic dinner on the patio.  Absolutely make reservations first.
