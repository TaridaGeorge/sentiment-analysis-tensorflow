I am writing this review strictly on the cupcakes, I have not and do not wish to try anything else, but the cupcakes are amazing.  

My friends and I had a cupcakes and champagne party for my birthday - everyone brought cupcakes from different places around town for a side-by-side taste test and Tammie Coe's Ooey Gooey's won hands down.  Warning: If you do not like frosting, you will not like Tammie Coe's Cupcakes.  There isn't a ton of frosting, but a fair amount so if you are one of those that likes scant amounts of frosting, this isn't for you. 

Other notables from Tammie are the Coconut and Red Velvet - they are always crowd pleasers.  Great frosting, great cake and wonderful colors/designs, Tammie Coe's are great to take or have at a party....or even have LGO deliver to your car on your way home from work. :)
