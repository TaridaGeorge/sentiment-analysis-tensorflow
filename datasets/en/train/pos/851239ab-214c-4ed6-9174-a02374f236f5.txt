I am a very happy Vegan at Big Buddha! If I ever stop craving the curry the other vegetarian menu items are just as delicious. And everything on the menu can be adapted and made vegetarian upon request. The orange tofu is perfectly crisp and satisfying to share or with the addition of some vegetables. My family especially enjoys the orange chicken, sesame chicken, and the beef chow fun. I also appreciate the graphic design and attention to aesthetics, even the carry out boxes. The delightful owners/servers love what they do and take pride in it, which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.
