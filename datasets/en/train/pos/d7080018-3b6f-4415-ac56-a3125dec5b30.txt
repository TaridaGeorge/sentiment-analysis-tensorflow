I first visited this location yesterday. I was shopping around for a Galaxy S3 for my mom. The associate I talked to recommended I look around at Walmart and Fry's to check prices, and said they could price match. Because they don't sell T Mobile phones in store, it needed to be ordered and sent to the house. 
I came back today and decided to buy two of the phones. I talked to the same guy, Roman, and he was EXTREMELY helpful and kind. He didn't charge us for shipping or anything extra. After price matching, we got two phones for what T Mobile wanted to charge for one. We got great customer service here and I would definitely return!
