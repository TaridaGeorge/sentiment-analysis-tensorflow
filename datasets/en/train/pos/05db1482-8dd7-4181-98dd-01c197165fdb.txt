Anthropologie is a more feminine boutique style version of Urban Outfitters. They are owned by the same company. This Anthropolgie is open and very easy to navigate. I usually just shop the sales here, but I make a point of going in every time I'm in Kierland because it's really fun to look at all the random chic things they have. They have beautiful designer clothes, housewares, cooking supplies, books, trinkets, stationary, furniture and much more.Also a great place to find something cute and unusual for decorating or cooking with.
