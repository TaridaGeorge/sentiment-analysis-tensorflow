Spotted Donkey Cantina is amazing!  They have delicious Mexican food, and fantastic margaritas to wash everything down with. You do have to pay for chips and salsa here, so there probably won't be any of that four bowl snacking before your main entree's come, but the medley of salsa's it comes with make it all worth it.

I've tried quite a few of the dishes here, and they've all been excellent.  In no particular order are my favorites:
cheddar enchilada's with hatch chiles and rice...spicy!
santa fe macaroni and cheese...again- spicy!
cod and shrimp tostada's- delicious!
shrimp fajitas
shrimp tacos

And for dessert:
fried banana wraps or the mango margarita sundae!"
