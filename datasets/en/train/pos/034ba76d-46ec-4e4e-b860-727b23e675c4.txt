My husband and I recently went to Sunrise for the 1st time and the experience was fantastic. The customer service was spot on & the food was delicious. We both tried what each other ordered & agreed we would love to come back. Thank you Sunrise for making our 1st time, a great time. We will absolutely be returning soon.
