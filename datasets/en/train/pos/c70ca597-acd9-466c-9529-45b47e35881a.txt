Not only do we love this place but all of our five kids do as well! fresh, hot and yummy Mongolian food cooked in front of you in minutes and I can say not only is the food great but the price for a family of seven is great!   Kids are charged by their age so for less then a happy meal the kids get chicken/beef or fish and noodles, soup and frozen yogurt with a drink. Lots of food for a great price
