The new Harkins Cine Capri, one of the first things to open in Tempe Marketplace, boasts 16 theatres and offers more than the norm when it comes to movie snacks. Moviegoers can order brownie bites, mozzarella sticks and pizza.

The theatre is super spacious and the seats are plush and comfy. And the screen is huge. This is my new favorite movie theatre.
