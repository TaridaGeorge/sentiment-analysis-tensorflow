The salads and pizza at Market Bistro are maybe some of the best I've ever had in Phoenix. Four years of coming here and I still have yet to run across something that's disappointed me. Anytime the temperature dips below 70 I start craving some vegetarian corn chowder.

Off the topic of food, but still worth noting is how cool the bathroom mirror is. If you stand just right you can get a perfect white ring just around your pupils.

My only complaint is that the lunch rush can get crowded and loud. There is usually always seating available at the bar or on the patio, though. And the staff (at both locations) has always been accommodating and friendly.
