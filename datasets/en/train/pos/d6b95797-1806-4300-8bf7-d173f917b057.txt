Love, love, LOVE this place!!  Like others, I'm strictly gluten free.  Coming here and being able to choose between more than just a couple of items is always a treat for me.  I've never left this place hungry or disappointed.  The GF Shanghai Noodles are unbelievably good...and I love their flourless chocolate cake.
