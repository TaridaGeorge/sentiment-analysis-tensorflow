I used to live in Tempe and really enjoyed hanging out at Tempe Beach Park. It's clean and I never got the feeling it was overcrowded. My sister and I rented one of those paddle boats once and that was fun until we started getting a little sweaty. You'll always see people walking their dogs or running so it's a great place to just to relax and chill out. Also, if you get hungry you can always walk to Mill Ave where there are a bunch of awesome restaurants just waiting to help you cool down.
