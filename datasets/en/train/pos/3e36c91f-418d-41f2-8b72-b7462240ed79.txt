What a delight. We were early to the Phoenix airport and decided to find some place nearby for dinner. We stumbled upon Wong's. Yes, the interior is run down, but the place is clean, the staff is friendly, the portions are huge and the prices are very reasonable ($7.95 for a typical dinner entree).  And the food was really good - all four dishes that our party of four ordered were really good. I'd go back again, but I live in California!  If I am ever in Phoenix again, I swear I'll make another trip to Wong's.
