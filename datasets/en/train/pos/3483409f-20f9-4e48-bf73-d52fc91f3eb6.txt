I had the pleasure of dining at celebrity Roy Yamaguchi's chain-restaurant:  Roy's!

I had enjoyed a Roy's Trio [Hibachi Salmon, Blackened Ahi, and Misoyaki Butterfish with steamed rice and baby bok choy] with a Flirtini on the side.  

The Hibachi Salmon was cooked to perfection which Arizonians seem to love to over-cook.  The Blackened Ahi was moist.  As for the Misoyaki Butterfish, OH. MAH. GAWD!!!  The butterfish supplied an explosion of flavor where I literally closed my eyes during that first bite.  Phew, is it me or is it getting hot in here?

The staff is super friendly and the ambiance is perfect for a date with your significant other!
