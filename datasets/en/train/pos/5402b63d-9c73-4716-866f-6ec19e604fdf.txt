I have been to this store several times over the last few years, Sami and his guys are the best!  I expected all Sprint Stores to give the same sort of customer service that the guys at Queen Creek & Alma give.  Boy, was I mistaken.  The corporate store at Chandler blvd. & price freeway is the extreme oposite of how good the service is at Queen Creek & Alma School.    I was "educated" on the difference between the 2 stores by 3 employees at the corporate store.  They "corporate store" should be embarassed at the lack of customer service.   I think that the lackluster employees at the corp store, need to be "educated" by Sami and his staff of how to help a customer!
