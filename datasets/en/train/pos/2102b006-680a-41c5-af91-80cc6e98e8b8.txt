We're planning our wedding on the fabulous rooftop at this modern wonder of a hotel.  Did you know the W modeled themselves after the Palomar? Yup, I said it.  

The staff is, as everyone else mentioned, amazing.  Beside being super-friendly, they are extremely attentive and actually show genuine interest in their guests.  The concierge chatted up my fianc√© and I, wanting to get  all the 411 on his proposal.. How cute is that?  We have looked at a plethora of venues, and I'm pretty sure nobody cared before.

Beside the five-star service, this place is gorgeous.  Attention has been paid to every last detail.  After waltzing into the impressive lobby, I promise that you will forget what city you're in.  Funny thing is, we looked at Kimpton hotels in Chicago and San Diego as well, but they really outdid themselves with this one.  Stay tuned for wedding updates!!!
