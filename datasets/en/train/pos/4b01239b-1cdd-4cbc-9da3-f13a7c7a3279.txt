This is, hands down, my favorite spa in the Valley.  The whole experience is simply spectacular.  My favorite thing about Aji is that the spa is separate from the rest of the resort, so it has its own facilities (including a spa-only pool), which makes it very peaceful and not crowded.  My facial was also fabulous!
