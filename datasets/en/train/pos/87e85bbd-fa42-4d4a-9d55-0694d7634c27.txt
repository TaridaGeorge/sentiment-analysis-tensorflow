Came here Saturday to watch the SC game with a friend.  I hate SC and he loves them so he was excited to see all the SC alumni packed inside.  It was too filled with Trojans inside for us to grab a table so we had to sit at the outside bar.  Our bartender was amazing!  Her name is Savannah and she is my drunken soul mate.  I loved hearing about her night, and we compared pictures of our drunken times on our cameras.  She's really cool and attentive, and a little bit of a drink pusher.  But I don't mind, I love getting drunk so I'm happy!  I am definitely coming back again, just for her!
