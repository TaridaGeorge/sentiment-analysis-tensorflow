I still HATE going to the dentist, but I do enjoy the service I receive at Thompson Peak Family Dental. All the hygienist are great but today I received the best cleaning every from Deena (sp?) My teeth seem extra shiny/white and she worked her magic for almost an hour to make my pearly whites pearly lol. The bad news in all of this is that I do have a cavity :( Oh well. I enjoy going to see Dr. Dachs' and will continue to do so. I mean as much as I hate going to the dentist at least I go to the best!
