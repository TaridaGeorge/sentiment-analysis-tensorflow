I love this place! Especially this location! I recently went for happy hour to celebrate a late Valentine's Day, and omg! My mouth is still watering from the delish dishes we had! It was definitely a comfort food evening for us, and we were extremely comfortable. We were seated in a corner booth, for privacy, without even having to request so. I wish I remembered our server's name, but he kept both our iced teas full, and he never kept us waiting or looking for him. The buffalo chicken wrap things are my new favorite guilty pleasure food. I can't wait to go back! And the turtle cheesecake! MMMMM!!
