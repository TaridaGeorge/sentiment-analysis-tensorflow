The atmosphere is amazing. They play great music. The girls working there (especially the little one with the glasses) are ALWAYS so friendly. 

The food has been consistent since the first time I've gone. I've eaten there over 30 times and I've never once tasted anything off. I've never once gotten sick from it either. The Yellow Curry and Tom Ka Soup are my two favorites. I love all of the happy hour items as well. 

They have a full bar. The bathrooms are super clean as well.
