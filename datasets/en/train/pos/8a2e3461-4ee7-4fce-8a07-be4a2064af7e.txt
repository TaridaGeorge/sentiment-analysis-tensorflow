I love Roy's.  I have been to this one and the one is Scottsdale 4 times now.  I like the Chandler location a lot more.  Inside they are both really nice, but the Scottsdale one is located in an upscale shopping center and it felt a tad odd to go to dinner as all the other places were closing.

Every time I have dined at Roy's, I have ordered off the Prix Fixe menu which is a steal for such quality food.  The seafood is excellent and my fiancee who doesn't care for a lot of seafood always finds something she loves.  The waitstaff is amazing and the chocolate lava cake finished off every meal nicely.

Get the mojitos.... they are amazing!
