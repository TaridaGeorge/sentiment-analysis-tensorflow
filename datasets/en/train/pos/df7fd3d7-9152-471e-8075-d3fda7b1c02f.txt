Susan was very nice as she checked me in - a great start.  The room was clean and breakfast was hot and well stocked.  All in all, I was very happy despite having gone out of my way a bit to stay there.  Nonetheless, it was well worth it because I felt the area was safe and the room was just what I needed after a long day of driving - clean and comfortable!
