I love this studio. So many different teachers with different styles to choose from! The studio itself is clean and welcoming, the staff personable and helpful. The benefit of also getting to practice at the beautiful Phoenician Resort is a definite PLUS!! I don't feel like I am just "going to class", but rather that I am part of a yoga community; I have made friends here and am learning to feel my wings!
