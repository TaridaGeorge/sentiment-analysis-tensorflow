Dr Lee saw me for a shoulder rotator cuff injury. The staff was friendly and efficient, I got a quick X-Ray then a PA gave me a careful examination before I saw Dr. Lee. Based on my MRI and history, Dr. Lee did not feel surgery was called for at this time and instead gave me injections in two areas right then and there then prescribed six weeks of physical therapy. I had instant relief form the injections and  the physical should help me get back optimum shoulder joint motion. After the therapy, I will again see Dr. Lee to reevaluate but at this point it doesn't look like I'll need surgery. Both Dr. Lee and the PA explained the problem well and I'm very happy so far with the results.
