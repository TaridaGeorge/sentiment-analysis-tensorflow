We showed up at the Mesa location on a Friday night around 6:30 and even though the restaurant seemed full we were seated immediately. I must say that I really appreciate a nice hostess and the service we received from the time we stepped in the door to the time we left was always above and beyond. We were seated in the back corner of the restaurant which was lovely because we were able to observe the lively staff and take in the design of the restaurant. Our server gave us great recommendations on drinks and food and we left satisfied and already planning our next visit back! This restaurant gets an A++ for being delicious, friendly and having a great environment. I can't wait to dine at the Blue Adobe Grille again!
