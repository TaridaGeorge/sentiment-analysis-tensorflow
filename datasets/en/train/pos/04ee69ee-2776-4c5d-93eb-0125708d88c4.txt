Cannot contain my love for the Bikini, both the bar & the item of clothing.

Went (last night) on a Tuesday. It was bangin. Will be there again & often!

The Bikini is dive extraordinaire, full of tons of random, super friendly & awesome people chilling and sharing their seemingly endless pitchers of beer with both new & old friends alike.  In the world of grown ups it is a rare place that deserves the title of being full of friendliness.

 Oh, and the music blasts at a reasonable level for both dancing &  talking.
