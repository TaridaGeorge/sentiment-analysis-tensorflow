This might be my favorite place in the state of Arizona! Who needs the Grand Canyon or Sedona when you have HoHoKam Stadium?? (okay, maybe a little bit of exaggeration there..haha). I love the Cubbies, baseball, sunshine, cold beer, and hot dogs. I honestly think that HoHoKam is the best spring training stadium in AZ (and I've been to them all)- mostly because of the atmosphere. This place is the only park I've seen that has ACTUAL tailgaters, complete with bags (somewhat like horseshoes, for those not from Chicago), coolers, and radios blasting. 

I can't wait for March! I've got my tickets! :)
