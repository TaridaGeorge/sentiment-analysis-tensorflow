I come here once a week to indulge in a Boston Cream doughnut. Oh, let me tell you...their version is heavenly! The dough is pillowy and fresh. I close my eyes whenever I partake in the sugar goodness to really savor every bite!  The chocolate glaze and custard filling is light (for me at least); I don't feel heavy or bogged down afterward. I love this place!
