I have been coming here since I moved to "Tukee in 2004.  One of the few places I have ever reivewed that didn't involve me EATING my way to a Star!

They have never lost an item. Never.  Once when the string in the shirt slipped inside they took it back and retrieved it (oooooh, aaaaaah)

They patiently explain which items are Dry Clean and which ones would do better in Laundry.  Over and Over. and Over. 

Friendly Service Night & Day Shifts.  Show respect for their Sraff by closing on appropoirate Holidays.
