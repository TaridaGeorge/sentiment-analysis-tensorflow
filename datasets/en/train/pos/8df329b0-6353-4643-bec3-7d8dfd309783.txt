Okay, so it's not their fault that the parking sucks like no other....it makes me feel like I'm back in L.A. though!
The atmosphere here is fun. It's noisy, it is great for people watching and there are a lot to see (and, if you're like me, BUY)
The staff always seems to be smiling, and are helpful when asked, BUT this will never be the Nordstrom of restaurants.
So here are the things you have to try! They are WONDERFUL!
Mia's French Pancakes
Croque Madam
Commuter Sandwich (either with avacado or salmon, both are great)
Jersey Girl Omelete
The Cubano Sandwich
The Rueben
Guacamole BLT
I forget the name, but its either a Spanish or a Mexican Latte is wonderful!

I also love the little pickle slices  they serve!! So good!
The Tammy Coe cakes are so good too! I love the designs! very creative use of fondant!
