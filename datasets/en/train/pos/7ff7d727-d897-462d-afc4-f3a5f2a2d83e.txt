Dr. Greenberg is by far the best eye doctor I have ever seen. He would not settle until I had the perfect prescription for my contacts. I have been wearing extended wear contacts for years, and I have astigmatism. I had resolved myself to needing reading glasses along with my contacts. 

After seeing Dr. Greenberg, I no longer need reading glasses, and have never been more comfortable in my contacts. My vision has never been anywhere near this good!

I cannot recommend him highly enough.
