WHY, WHY, WHY TRADER JOE'S?! WHY ARE YOU SO PERFECT IN EVERY WAY? 99l9% of everything that you guys sell is perfect from start to finish. And the ONE thing I've purchased there in the last ten years that wasn't to my liking? You gave me a NO QUESTIONS ASKED refund, without me returning the product OR a receipt. 

If the world was more like Trader Joe's we would all be much better off.  The one on McClintock & Guadalupe in Mesa - I have to say - is the best in all of Arizona!
