I am a giant fan of this place and their service. You pull in and they tell you where to park, they pick you up right there at your covered car and take you to your terminal, always helping you with your bags. I always feel like my car is safe there. When I arrive back in Phoenix it is always easy to find the pick up spot and most of the time a bus arrives as I do. You get dropped off at your car, pay and they give you a bottle of water. And trust me I always need a bottle of water after a flight. Use a coupon that you can find online, almost always prints with my boarding pass, or with a coupon mailer book, to feel even better about the experience.
