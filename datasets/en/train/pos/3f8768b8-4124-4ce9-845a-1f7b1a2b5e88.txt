I've been getting spoiled by Vicky for about a year now. She's been keeping my fingers and toes very well manicured with gel and traditional polish. The gel trend is getting more and more mainstream and I love that Vicky keeps her color collection fresh and up-to-date. I get compliments on my gel polished manicure almost daily and I HIGHLY recommend Vicky!
