This place is ah-mazing.  It's a family-owned business and they came from LA to Arizona to setup shop.  

The sushi is so yummy.  We had Toro and a rainbow roll.  The quality of fish is excellent.  I also had the udon noodle soup which I split with my mom.  It was the perfect accompaniment to a chilly winter day.  You can split it easily, and they bring you the bowls and spoons to do so.  It even has a soft boiled egg in it! Yummy

The menu has more than standard rolls, there are a lot of fusion rolls to choose from!

They also had hot green tea that was so good.

This place is intimate and welcoming, definitely worth becoming a regular at!
