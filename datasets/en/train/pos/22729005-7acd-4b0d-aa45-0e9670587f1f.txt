Don't eat here just because the meat is some of the best we have ever had. Eat here because the staff and service are terrific. Manager, Jes Maverick Smith went out of his way to make our evening memorable. Our server Andrew couldn't have been better. We and our friends will definitely be back for both the food and the service.
