If you plan on dining here on a weekend night call and get a place in line.  That said this is one of my most favorite restaurants for the best steaks ever.  My young daughters love the food and the great atmosphere!  Don't miss this restaurant if you're looking for a kick back, casual restaurant that has supreme steaks!
