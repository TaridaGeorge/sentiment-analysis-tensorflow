This hotel exceeded all of my expectations! You will be treated by friendly staff, the concierge has hook ups all over the state for anything you can think of, the rooms are very comfortable and well appointed, and the pool is the best in Scottsdale! HVH is a block away from all of Old Town Scottsdale. Kevin and Kheri took care of us by the pool by day and a number of other staff took care of us in the ZuZu lounge by night. They will even set up a private SUV to pick you up or drop you off at the airport for a flat $30 fee! If you're looking for an experience second to none, this is the place to go!
