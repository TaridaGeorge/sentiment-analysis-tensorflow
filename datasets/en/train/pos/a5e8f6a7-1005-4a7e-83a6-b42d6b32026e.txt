Update: PTC's prices are now $3 per movie.

I'm going to second the five stars on this place.  Yes they're second run films.  You could pick them up on DVD, but who are you kidding? Nothing beats sitting in a theatre to see a movie for the first time.  Personally, I'm too broke to enjoy a film I am only kinda interested in during a first run.  For three bones, I can go and see a film as it was intended to be seen.  On a gigantic screen with a sticky seat and two kids making out three rows back.  I call that movie magic!  The fact that their showtimes are advertised on their website is also a big gold star.

In the lobby, they have life size statues of Laurel and Hardy, Batman, Storm Troopers and a few others.  Who doesn't love that?  I know I do.
