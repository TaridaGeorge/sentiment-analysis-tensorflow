Why oh why can't there be one of these closer to my house?! I would take them any day over Subway. Their bread is fresh, their meat and cheese is sliced perfectly thin. This may sound strange too, but every Mr. Goodcents I've been too has the BEST soda fountain Coke. Okay...I said it. Judge me. 

I do prefer the Mr. Goodcents over in Tempe off of 48th Street, but this one is just as good.
