Love their food and service! Never had an empty glass, server always made sure we were happy. Recommend  the Shrimp with honey glazed walnuts and the Mongolian beef which is our favorite! This last visit we tried the Sesame Chicken that a friend recommended and that was great! The fact that George actually comes around and thanks you for coming in and has occasionally sat down with us and given a complimentary desert which was a warm crispy roll with bananas and chocolate  with powdered sugar on them tops off our wonderful evening . We will be back!
