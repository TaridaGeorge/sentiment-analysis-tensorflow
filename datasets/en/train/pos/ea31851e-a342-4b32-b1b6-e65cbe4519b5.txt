I'm a big fan of this adorable Scottsdale spot, it's a quaint little place to take out of town guests or just to enjoy a nice weekend brunch. The ambiance is charming, the food is fresh and flavorful, and the portions are sizable so I would suggest splitting a sandwich if you're looking for a light lunch. 

Came in with a large party for a bridal party brunch and the service was flawless. I'd highly recommend the warm goat cheese salad with raspberries...perfection!
