Oh, what a glorious establishment!  I don't think there is any room to say anything new after over 50 reviews.  I think my fellow Phoenicians pretty much have it taken care of.  However, I will second that the wine is great as is the bruschetta.  I'm not sure you can write a review of Postino and not mention the bruschetta.  I'm ready to go back for lunch and try something else off of the menu and also take advantage of the $5 wine.  Yum!
