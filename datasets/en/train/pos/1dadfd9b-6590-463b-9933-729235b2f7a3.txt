Cowboy Ciao is what I consider a good special occasion date restaurant. It's on the pricier side, but worth every penny if the event calls for such a dining experience.

Some of the menu highlights at Cowboy Ciao....The Chopped Salad is one of the best salads that I've ever had, the bruschetta is an amazing appetizer, and the short ribs and pork shank are both very good entrees.

I'd say the best thing about Cowboy Ciao is their extensive wine menu. They have one of the largest wine lists that I've ever seen.

Great food, good service, and awesome wine list, gives Cowboy Ciao five stars.
