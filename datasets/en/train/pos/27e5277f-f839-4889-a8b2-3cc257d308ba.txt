I love that I can smell this place from across the street. Roasting their own beans is impressive; I can taste the quality. I'm a cappuccino drinker and Cartel is where it's at in Tempe. Being an ASU student, I feel spoiled be only a short walk away from amazing coffee. The barista I had today was very friendly and asked how my drink was after I finished it.. I think my demeanor and facial expression said it all--ahh bliss :)
