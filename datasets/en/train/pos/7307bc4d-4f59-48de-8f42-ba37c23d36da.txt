Okay, so I love Starbucks ~ actually their caramel macchiatos:
     * whole milk, single, venti, no foam, extra whipped, extra caramel, 
        upside down, caramel macchiato!

NICKIE (at this specific location) makes THE SMOOTHEST caramel macchiatos . . . ever . . . every single time!    

I have found EVERY employee at this location to be courteous, friendly, outgoing, kind . . . and they even have puppy bones!!!
