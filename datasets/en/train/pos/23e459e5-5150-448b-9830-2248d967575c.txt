Siam is hands down the best Thai food in the Valley. Not only is the food great but it is one of the most inexpensive places to eat. With under 50$ I have fed 3 people with Soup, a main dish, desert and Thai Iced Tea Yummy !!  I moved to Scottsdale and this is the thing I miss the most about the West side, they don't have places like this in my area :( . It is very authentic, I love that they did not change the food to appease the American palate. My very favorite is the Masumum Curry with Beef the beef is so tender it melts in your mouth. With the Coconut Soup as a starter you really can't go wrong. This place is really a must try especially if you love Thai.
