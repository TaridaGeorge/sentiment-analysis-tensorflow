What's not to love about Tempe Public Library?  It's not huge, but they have a book store inside and it's so cheap.  You can grab a hard-cover book that's in PRISTINE shape for, literally, 50 cents.  How fucking awesome is that?  Really, really fucking awesome!

Their selection of movies is always really great.  From this place, I have rented some amazing stuff:  The 7th Seal, The Thin Blue Line, Overlord.  I saw A Taste of Cherry here, which sucked, but I shall not fault the library because the movie SOUNDED really amazing, but it ended up being a long-ass movie about a guy driving around.  Talking.
