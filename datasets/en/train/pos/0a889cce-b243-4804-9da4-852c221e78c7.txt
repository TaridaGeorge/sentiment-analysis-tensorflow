We have been going to this Denny's for 3-4 years now.  My spouse and I have breakfast with our very close friend on Sunday's often.  Our daughter and I go there sometimes on Friday's before school as well as special treat.  Very friendly staff, I cannot remember ever having bad service.  A lot of the servers have been there for the whole time we have been going there.  A lot of them know us.  Very nice people.  It is still Denny's so of course it's not 5 star dining but the service is great!
