I am Italian and I NEVER go to Italian restaurants because they're never better then what I make at home. However, Uncle Sal's is PHENOMENAL. The gentleman on the phone was so wonderful when I called and helped me create the pizza I wanted. The pizza itself was TO DIE FOR! The crust was so fresh, the cheese was perfection and all the toppings were awesome. 
I honestly could go on forever about this place. I even called to thank them personally for such a lovely experience. Everything about this experience was what great customer service and great food should be.
