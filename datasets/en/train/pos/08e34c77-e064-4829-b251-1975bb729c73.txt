When I moved to the Valley of the Sun 15 years ago I went to the Concierge at the Phoenician -then the best hotel in town- and asked him, "who has the best Prime Rib in town?"  His answer, "Don and Charlies."  Next question: "who has the best BBQ Ribs in town?"  His answer, "Don and Charlies."  That was 15 years ago and since then, it has been my benchmark for every steakhouse I go to.  Don Carson knows his business well, no question and when you go there, he is usually wandering around the restaurant visiting with guests and keeping an eye on the place. I've not had anything bad there, ever, and I think I've pretty much tried everything on their menu. If you want good steak, prime rib or ribs.  Go here.  You won't be disappointed.
