This is a very fine bar for those who don't like bars.  The exterior with it's one bright "Open" sign and minimal lighting, portrays a look like the Amityville House Jr., but inside is a very clean, nicely decorated house with places to sit.  Also, if you want to smoke, there is a back patio.   You can get wine, beer and---that's about it but that is okay as this is not really a "get yourself smashed" bar but a "drink casually with friends" bar.
