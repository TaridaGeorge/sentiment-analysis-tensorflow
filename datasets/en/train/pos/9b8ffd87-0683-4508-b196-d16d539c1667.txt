When they see my car...oh jeez...here she is again...how much vodka do her friends drink in a week???? This is the only place I can find Jewel of Russia Ultra...it is about $80 a bottle..seriously ..the best $80 you could ever..ever spend! The bottles are all hand painted in porcelain(?)..It makes a stunning gift! But they also sell the regular Jewel of Russia ..which I buy for every day..it's about $40 a bottle..AJ's carries this as well...the only problem is Tarbell's is the only place I know of where you can get a drink with it.  Belevdere is my 3rd option...Oh can you tell I only drink Vodka..darling..
