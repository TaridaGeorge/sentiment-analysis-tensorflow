TCA is a beautiful space. I feel like I am in San Francisco or something. 

There is really no bad seat in the house and everyone there is very nice. I think that makes a difference when you are attending an event and everyone is all smiles. 

The outside area is right up against the water with a very cool fire place. If it wasn't so damn hot in August it would be a perfect place to hang out. 

I just love it here!
