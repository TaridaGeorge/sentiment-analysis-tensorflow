Perfection!

I love New York style pizza, and I love woodfire pizza.  This is their gorgeous love child.

Ambiance is much more casual than I'd expected.  Red and white checkered table cloths, menu is the paper placemat, etc.  It was packed by 6pm, and I can see why!

Great wine selection with fair prices.  Pizza choices are ample without being overwhelming.

Why can't a place like this exist in Chicago??
