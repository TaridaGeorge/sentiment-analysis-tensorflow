I was craving a gyro and went to yelp to help me give me some ideas. Due to all the great comments about the food, I had made my decision and decided to try it out for myself. Well.... very happy I did. Food was great! Lots of meat and the salad was delicious! Although the place is not very pretty to look at, the food is well worth it. What's even better, it's super close to my house. I will definitely be going back!
