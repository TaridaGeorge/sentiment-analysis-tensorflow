For variety in Phoenix, I give this a 5 star rating. It is quite good. The sweet potato fries are a must. The aioli they serve with it is great. The salads are not that great and their burgers are more impressive in their description than their actual taste. The milkshakes are rather icy, not creamy. However, it is still pretty good and its open late.
