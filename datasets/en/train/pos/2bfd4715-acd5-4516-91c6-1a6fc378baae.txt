When I first moved up from Tucson I had a heck of a time finding a good barber. In fact I would hold off getting a cut until I could make it back to Tucson on the weekends & that got old fast. I walked in to Carlyn's on Mill Ave & found my home. No high price salon here, this one seat shop is functional & fashionable all in one. Carlyn is the owner & sole Barber. She takes great care in your cut. I now have six years going to her & I would not trust my Grizzle Face to another. This was my best kept secret, but I'll do you a solid. Closed Sundays & Mondays.
