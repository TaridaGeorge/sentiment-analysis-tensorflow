I feel like less of a person for being a resident of the South Mountain community and having eaten at the Secret Garden for the first time last night.    

My friends took me here for a  birthday dinner......they had made reservations and had a table set up for our group that seated us comfortably.  

The service was IMPECCABLE and the food.....oh the food.....was so ridiculously good that I have no words.   

I'm sad that there were only two other tables in there the entire time that we were there, for  a total of four more people.    This place is easily the best restaurant on the south side of Phoenix...potentially to include downtown.   Frankly, this made for an even bettter experience for my group - but I don't want this place to close.

Highly recommended.  A+.   

Go.
