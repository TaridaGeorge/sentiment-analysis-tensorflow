Great shop. I've bought SEVERAL guns from these guys hand they have always been great to deal with.  As has been mentioned, they have a great selection on new AND used firearms.

Most recently I traded in a gun on a different gun.  The value they gave me on the trade-in was more than fair, and in end the end I was very happy with the deal.

They often list specials on thier FB page, and list a lot of thier inventory on Gun Broker.  Thier prices on LE trade-ins cannot be beat.

I've used them for transfers thru gun genie and they were very happy to provide that service as well.

The shop isn't much to look at but give them a chance they will treat you right.
