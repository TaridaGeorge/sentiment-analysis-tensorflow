All I can say is whatever your oriental needs are...they have it!

Some of the freshest seafood, poultry, pork, beef, etc.

They have everything from dried foods, frozen, fresh produce, sauces, spices, noodles, different rices, herbs, and everything in between. Asian wine, beer, sake, some great little pastries, asian snacks, candy...the list goes on and on and on just like that song that never ends.. haha

They also have jewelry, decor, cooking utencils, teas, and incense!

Love this place!
