Great place for a getaway! Beautiful hotel with two lagoon-style pools, cabanas, lounge chairs, fire pit, full service spa, excellent Italian restaurant. Rooms have the Kimpton touch, free internet, comfy beds, and great service. Wine hour from 5-6 is not to be missed. Free shuttle service in a cool red Escalade that will take you around town!! First rate, totally want to stay here for another week...
