I've gone to Nancy Erdmann, FNP for approximately ten years now. I adore her. She cares about holistically treating me and is proactive in recommending preventive care. She is always dressed very stylishly, as well!
I have seen Mary, FNP and Dr. Lucas. They also are both excellent! I am more than happy to see them if I need to get in on a day Nancy isn't in the office.  I don't plan on changing PCPs as long as this office is open. I've lived all over the Valley and always made the drive because their care is worth it.
