I'm a fan and always will be, the food is always good here and the selection is unbelievable.  I know it is a franchise but a kick ass one if I may say.  I love all the martinis....and I do mean all.  I love the strawberry lemonade, I love the cheesecake (of course), I love the service, the atmosphere is definitely high end but you can still go casual.  I have had several meals hear and could not possibly remember them all but I have never not liked my dish....except that I can never finish because their portions are HUGE.
