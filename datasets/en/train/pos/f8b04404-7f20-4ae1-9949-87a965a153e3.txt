I recently moved here to Phoenix and was looking for a great space to continue my practice.  A yoga instructor myself, my expectations may be somewhat high.  So far, I've been to several studios in the valley and this one wins!  This one is the "real deal".  Some things you can't really put into words - if you want a solid yoga experience taught by qualified teachers in a safe environment, then you've just found it.
