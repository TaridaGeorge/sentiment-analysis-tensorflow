Well, after a mere month, I'm updating my review of Petit Fromage to reflect that they are the Five-Star shop I knew they could be.  I just stopped in for lunch and hade one of Lara's "Petite Snacks" for lunch, and am radiating happiness for having done so.  I can only refer to Petit Fromage in superlatives based on my experiences there over the past month.  Customer service is tip-top, the selection is great, and the shop really fosters a sense of community.  Life is good with a cheese shop such as this in the neighborhood.
