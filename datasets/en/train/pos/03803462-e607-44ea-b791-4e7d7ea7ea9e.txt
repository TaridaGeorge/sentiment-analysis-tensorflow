FOOD

Stopped at Lobby's for lunch with a friend a couple weeks ago and had a double burger plain (no veggies) with their sauce.  This place makes good burgers at very reasonable prices and their somewhat spicy sauce was good and gave me a change from my usual drown it in mustard strategy.  The fries were decent, though not as good as Four Peaks fries. 

SERVICE

The Service was prompt and quite friendly.

ATMOSPHERE

The place is bright, open, and clean.  Very different from a place like the Chuckbox.  It was empty at lunchtime on Sunday when I was there, but I imagine would be quite busy during the week given its proximity to McClintock highschool.
