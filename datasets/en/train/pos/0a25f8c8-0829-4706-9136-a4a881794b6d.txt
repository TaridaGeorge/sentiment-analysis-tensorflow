Well Zin is too crowded, so why not another FoxRC restaurant and it was a nice surprise; good going Trish!  Spinach Artichoke Dip, Chicken Club Kobe Burgers make comfort food a necessity for flu victims like us ;). Great service, location and funkadelic music...unique all the way, even with the double clear coffee cups.  Hint:  ask for extra bacon strips so you will be happily greeted by big nosed doggies :)
