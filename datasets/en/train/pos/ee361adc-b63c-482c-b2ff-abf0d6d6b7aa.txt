The doctors here are awesome!

I found out I have a stress fracture in my second metatarsal in my left foot.  Being a runner, I not only need my feet but need a doc that understands what I am going through.  Dr. Wyant made me feel at ease and comfortable talking about any issue that I needed to about my concerns with returning to running afterwards.

I had my first cast put on by Stan, and wow...this walking cast was almost like not having a cast in the first place!  After three weeks, they took the cast off to x-ray and still fractured...so Stan put on the second cast, too.  Now...I didn't know this the first time, but Stan does ultrasounds at EVFA...so he casted me as a favor!

Thanks, Dr. Wyant and Stan for making an unpleasant injury as pleasant as you both could!
