This is by far my favorite place in the phoenix metro to kill time, work on school work, hang out, etc.  Great atmosphere, the owner is the main barista and he's really cool always super nice. Can't say enough about this place. The one and only drawback is no outlets on the patio but i will still drive out of my way to go to solo anyday
