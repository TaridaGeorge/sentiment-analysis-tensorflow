Cafe Conmigo is located in the lobby of the Galleria Corporate Centre in Scottsdale and uber-convenient for a quick bite or coffee before/after work or just to get away from the computer for a few minutes. I have only recently started going to Cafe Conmigo but loved each experience. The staff is always friendly, even at 7:30 in the morning! You can certainly expect to see me there from now on. Meet your new 'regular', Cafe Conmigo!
