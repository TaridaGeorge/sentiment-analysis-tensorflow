This place has so many hidden treasures! Give yourself at least half an hour your first time, so you can smell every dish of amazing herbs, spices and blends. My favorite items include the chipotle powder, country french vinaigrette, Extra Fancy Vietnamese Cinamon, and Trinidad Lemon & Garlic Marinade. Be sure to grab their magazine when you leave - it has recipes in it using their spices.
