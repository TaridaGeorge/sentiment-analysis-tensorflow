I have been going to Gyros Express for almost 9 years now. My husband introduced me to it when we first started dating. He's been a loyal customer since he was in 7th grade. They have the best Gyros in the valley and their taziki sauce is so good. I order a side of taziki even if I'm getting their fabulous Mousaka dinner or a burger and slather it on everything. They have the 2nd best burgers in the valley. (Big Al's Greasy Eats is #1)  And I highly recommend the Saginaki. The atmosphere is certaintly not fancy, but the food is top notch!
