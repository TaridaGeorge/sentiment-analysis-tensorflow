I had heard that they sold British bacon, so I decided to stop by.  At first I thought they were closed because I didn't see any cars in the parking lot.  Then I saw the entrance was over to the side and there were 2 cars.  

The store was nice and empty of customers.  The produce and food was displayed very nicely.  The store was clean and welcoming.  

And yes, they have English bacon!  Yum yum!  And it's much cheaper than going to the British shop over on Hayden and McDowell!

Self checkout was a breeze.  I would definitely come here again.
