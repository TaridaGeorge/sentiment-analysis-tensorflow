According to me (and really, who else matters) Zoyo is top dog in the froyo world. I like how their yogurt has all the classics but also kicks it up a notch with seasonal flavors. Toppings are plentiful and finely chopped so I can fit all 8 different candy bar flavors in my cup. If you wear your jammies on Wednesday nights, you'll get 50% off.
