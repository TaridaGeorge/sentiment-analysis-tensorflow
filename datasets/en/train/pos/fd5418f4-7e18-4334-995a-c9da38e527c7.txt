I thought this place would be Great when I pulled up and there were a ton of people outside on Sunday morning 11ish! Upon going inside I saw that 95% of the patrons were Chinese. To me, that was an even better sign. Then the food started coming and coming and coming..... 9 dishes later, the two of us were fat and HAPPY! The food was great and all the servers that came by our table had warm, personable attitudes. Oh yeah, we will be going back!
