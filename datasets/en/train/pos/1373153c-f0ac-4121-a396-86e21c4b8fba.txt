Seriously one of the best botanical gardens I've yet visited.

When I was there, they had an incredible exhibit of Dale Chihuly's glass artwork, which went well with the unusual plants in the garden.

There are many different sub-gardens to see, each with its own standout features.  My favorite garden was the Succulent Gallery - talk about mind-boggling plants.  Wow.  Some of the flora there looked like something out of a Dr. Seuss story.

I imagine this garden would be excellent in the spring, when all the wildflowers and cacti are blooming...check it out!
