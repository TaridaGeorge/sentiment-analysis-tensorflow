Our daughter made a reservation at The Capital Grille N Scottsdale to celebrate our 25th Anniversary and it also happened to be Restaurant Week. When we arrived and were seated we were pleasantly surprised with a decorated table with confetti hearts and rose petals and a good wishes card.
The server Gina was so friendly and gave us great service, we decided to order from the set menu for the restaurant week and the food was excellent, the french onion soup was hot and delicious, the filet mignon was cooked as I ordered and very tendered as the cream of spinach and mashed potatos had good flavor. The drinks were also well made. All in all they gave us a great anniversary experience and we will return for another one.
