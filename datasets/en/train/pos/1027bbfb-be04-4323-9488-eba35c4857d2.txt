I finally made it down to the Phx Public Market yesterday and I loved it! The vendors told me that Wed is pretty mellow compared to Saturday. It sounds like it will compare to the amazing farmers' markets I've been to in NYC and San Fran. 

There was a great variety of items, fresh fruits, veggies, baked goods, dairy, etc. The vendors were all so nice - I chatted with most of them about their products. 

I'm also super-excited to try some of the food truck meals - they were really difficult to resist (I had dinner plans). 

I can't wait to go back on a Saturday!! I just wish I lived closer.
