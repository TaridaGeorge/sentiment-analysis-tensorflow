I can't say enough great things about Scottsdale Child Care.  Isn't it the management/ownership and staff that is critical to deciding where to leave your children.  The owners and employees are extremely good people.  Wonderful values.  Trustworthy and good-hearted.  Their genuine care for children is obvious.  They are fair, don't charge when you don't bring your child in, even though most places do.  Excellent excellent excellent.  Ricole at the Greenway location is the best!!
