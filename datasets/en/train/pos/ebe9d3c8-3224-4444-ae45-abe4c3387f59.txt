Dr. Strand is amazing! Menopausal symptoms for a few years that I tried to handle on my own. It wasn't working so I finally went to Dr. Strand ... 60 days later ... symptoms gone! I can't say enough about how this changed my lifestyle, work, marriage and more - I am clearer thinking and not "flashing". I would recommend Dr. Strand,  without hesitation, to anyone.
