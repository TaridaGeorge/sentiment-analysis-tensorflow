Just visited them for the first time today and all I can say is WOW!!  The people are gracious and the food had that kick that I love.

I ordered the loaded chili and garlic fries.  I could smell the garlic wafting up from the bag ~ my whole office now smells like garlic but it was wonderful!  The portions was enough for two so I know what I'll be having for dinner tonight.

Parking is somewhat of a challenge but it's well worth it.  I plan on returning on a regular basis.
