Being new to the neighborhood, I was seeking out unique places to get a good cup of coffee.  I like to give the locals some business once in a while.  I find their coffee is often better too because it has to be.  This place is great!  They have a drive through (majorly important) and their coffee doesn't have that burnt taste that you get at Starbucks.  The service was really efficient.  I want to go back to hang out for a while some lazy Saturday or Sunday morning.  It seems like a great place for doing that.
