I was really surprised at this little local place.  I don't drink coffee so when friends mentioned it as a lunch place I kind of didn't want to go, but I'm sure glad I did.

The food was very fresh and very good, sandwiches mostly that I noticed.  No fountain drinks, only cans of soda and bottles of other stuff.
Their smoothies rocked too!
