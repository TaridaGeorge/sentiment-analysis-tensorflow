This place is great, fun classes including the Dirty Ride, if you are like me and enjoy bike riding while listening to  some naughty music, this class is for you. The bikes they have are really cool too, you can actually lean on them so it seems more like real bike riding than indoor cycling. They also have hip hop, zumba, yoga, whatever you like they probably have a class you would enjoy.
