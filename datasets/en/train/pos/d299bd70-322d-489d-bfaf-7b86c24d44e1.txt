Whenever I have a craving for something sweet we always come to Mary Coyle's... they are close and I love their ice cream.  I always get either the Carmel Cashew or the Turtle and the Hare and I am never disappointed.  You can tell that everyone that works here is in high school but they are attentive and never leave you waiting around.  I have never had their food, but that is not why I am here anyway.  Also they have a drive through if you are in a hurry.
