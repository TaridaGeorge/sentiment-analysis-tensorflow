Well, i just have nothing bad to say about this place at all... The food was great (I'm picky about my jambalaya - and it was very good!) The pecan pie and calamari are also awesome! My boyfriend's from New orleans and is very familiar with Creole and Cajun. He was impressed! The restaurant is in a very hidden corner of Baseline and the 101 so it's not easy to see, but if you want to treat yourself with some good New Orleans fare, FIND IT! And have the Gumbo!
