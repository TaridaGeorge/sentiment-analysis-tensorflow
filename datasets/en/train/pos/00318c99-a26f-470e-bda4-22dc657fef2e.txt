OK, so I was really hungry when I got here, but I had one scoop of the special/pricier ice creams--a coffee flavor loaded with nuts and toffee chips and not sure what else--that was topped with some caramel sauce.  What can I say but THAT blew any diet I was on that day.
Delicious!  So damn good I wanted to lick the paper wax off the cheap cup they serve it in, but figured I'd shock the other "ladies" I was with.
I am definitely coming here again!!!
And, despite being starved throughout a movie at the half-block away AMC theatre, that one scoop with caramel sauce on top filled me up almost to the point I felt if I had gotten two scoops I might have thrown up!  
Yup, this stuff is THAT rich and THAT good!!!
