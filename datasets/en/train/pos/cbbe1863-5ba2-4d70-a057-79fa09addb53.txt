This is my absolute favorite Italian restaurant in Phoenix.  We go here for our birthdays, anniversaries, etc... any special occasion is a reason to go to Marcellino (or just no occasion other than date night)!  What do we love?  The fresh pasta presentation at the beginning of the meal is so fun.  The food is always exceptionally tasty.  The ambiance is lovely.  The owner and his wife walk around the restaurant to ensure that everyone is enjoying their meal - and everyone always looks very happy.

The have live music on most nights as well which makes the entire space feel very intimate.  They also have this great private booth you can reserve for special occasions.  

I can't say enough good things about Marcellino.  It's our "GO TO" place in Phoenix.
