I love the staff here. They are so helpful and nice, but they stay out of your way while you shop. I just bough my stepson his scriptures, since it's going to be a while before he can be baptized, and he was grinning ear to ear. I love just walking around in here, looking at the beautiful artwork & feeling at peace.
