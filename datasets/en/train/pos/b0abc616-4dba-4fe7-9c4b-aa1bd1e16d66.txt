I so cannot believe I am going to write about $1 store... but I just HAD to.
This place is brand new.
Sparkling new.
Party Favors Galore!
Everything was neat & tidy.
Pool Noodles $1 - usually $5.
Nice Bath, Spa & Shower Goodies.
Alll shelves stocked up the Ying Yang.
Fabby end-of-year Teacher & Grad gifts.
Great Storage Bins of all shapes & sizes.

So, as you can see, a dollar store impressed me.  I'm going back tomorrow for a shipment of solar patio lights there getting in.  Yes. Solar Lights.  For $1.  Cool?  or what?
