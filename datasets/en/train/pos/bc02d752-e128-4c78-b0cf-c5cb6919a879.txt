Im an ASU student and I have only heard great things about this place. I had a float with pineapple ice cream and orange fanta. So yummy. They also have cookie and ice cream sandwaitches and smoothies. The owner was very kind and outgoing. He was thankful for our business. It made me feel like I was in a 1950s mom and pop ice cream shop. Casual, affordable, fun place to grab some dessert after dinner while strolling along mill ave. great location. U can walk to it from asu after class.
