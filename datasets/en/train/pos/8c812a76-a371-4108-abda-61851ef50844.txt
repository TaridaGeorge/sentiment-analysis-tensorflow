Fantastic selection of name brands. You have to give yourself at least an hour in here and be willing to do some patient searching, but wow, I really should just stop shopping elsewhere. Banana Republic, White House Black Market, Ann Taylor, Kate Spade... I got a pair of mint condition Joe's Jeans here for $35. Every time it's a thrill to see what you can find.
