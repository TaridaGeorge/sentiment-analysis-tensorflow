Perfect place for lunch.  In a cool location too.  I had the pesto turkey lavosh wrap.  Came with a small salad.  This was an enormous amount of food.  I had some to take back with me after lunch.  The place is clean, service was good and quick, and the food is perfect.  Had plenty of, almost all, healthy options.  I've been to other locations, and like this one the best.  Will be coming back for more.
