My wife and I are die hard mexican food fans and have been anxiously awaiting the opening of Sol Mexican Cocina.  We love the Quarter and are happy to see new food concepts of this caliber opening.  

The service was outstanding.  We were greeted warmly and taken to our table.  Home made chips and a trio of salsas were promptly brought to our table as well as water.  This team didn't miss a beat.

Jackie and I are vegetarians and we often find our options limited when eating at most mexican restaurants.  This was not the case @ Sol!  They have a great vegetarian and even vegan menu options.  Try the sweet potato tacos or the empanadas!

Have fun guys!
