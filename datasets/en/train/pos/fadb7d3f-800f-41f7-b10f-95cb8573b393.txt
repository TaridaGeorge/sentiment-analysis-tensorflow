What's not to love about this charming house turned eatery?

The patio is awesome and usually full but even if that's the case and you're stuck sitting inside, it's inviting and cozy especially at night with the lights turned down and the candles lit. 

Mac & Cheese...my arch nemesis and one food that's been my fav from when I was 5. TMI nails it. So yummy and with the cracker/bread on top of it, adds a nice texture and taste. The BLT with avocado is delicious..so simple but the ingredients are fresh and you can't go wrong with chips and a pickle slice.

TMI's beer list is solid and I've yet to try the wine but when it's basically down the street, I don't have to think of too many excuses to get back for the service and the atmosphere. 

By far one of my favorite places!
