Yesterday's visit restored my faith in Vets!  We had an excellent visit with Natalia and Dr. Freeman.  They treated us AND our pup with respect.  Dr. Freeman sat on the floor and answered all our questions and added answers to questions we hadn't even come up with yet.  It was a great checkup and we plan to keep this newly established relationship for years to come.
