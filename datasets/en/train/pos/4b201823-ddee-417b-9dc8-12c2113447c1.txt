Divine. Absolutely divine. I love great little places that serve fantastic food. Yasu is amazing and for the quality, you'd honestly think they'd charge you more. Everything was delicious. Service was fantastic and friendly. 

My husband has been to the past eateries inhabiting this spot and has said none has felt as open and large as Yasu does.

This is definitely going to be our go to sushi spot from now on.
