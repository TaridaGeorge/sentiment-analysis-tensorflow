What a hidden gem!  I swung by here to pick up some baked goods for an event we were having - I was only the pick up girl and had no previous contact with the place so I had no idea what to expect.  First, the smell was amazing!  They had all sorts of goodies, from breads/uffins to cakes, cookies and yummy little munchy things that the kids were dying for.
