I have always had an issue about my teeth. Terrified of the drill, and just the thought of going makes me sweat.
Then I met Dr. Miller. Actually I was introduced to him by a staff member, who had been to him.
He promised I would be okay!
Well, it still took about 6 months, but eventually the day came - you know, the toothache, and I made an appointment,

The staff were great - and I say that with total honesty. From the moment I walked in, I felt at ease. I have been back for additional work, including a very complex bridge, and cleanings.

My dental work has been great, and I am thrilled with the results.
