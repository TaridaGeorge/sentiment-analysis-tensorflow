I love this place! Sit outside on a gorgeous day, picnic style with your friends. Great for families, kids, big
Parties, or even a lunch date. My friends devoured their burgers, the salads were really fresh and delicious, and the chicken salad sandwich was super yummy. 
Also head to the coffee shop part where you can get the yummiest baked goods and coffee. (the cupcakes are soo good)
