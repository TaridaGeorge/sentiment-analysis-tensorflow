Well the best way to know what a place is like is when something goes wrong. I took my car in, and something happend with the radiator cap. It lost all of the coolant and this burnt my water pump and other parts. 

I called them and they immediately called my car repair place. By the end of the day, the care was fixed and they took care of the bill.

Thanks, JIffy Lube!
