This place was a blast!  I came here with 8 girls on a Saturday for some bottomless mimosas and Bloody Mary's and we were not disappointed!  We did have to wait about an hour since we were a large group, but we started on our drinks at the bar and the staff checked up on us several times and apologized for the wait.  Very friendly!
The place was so fun, we didn't mind the wait.  There was a DJ and it was packed with a fun group of people!
