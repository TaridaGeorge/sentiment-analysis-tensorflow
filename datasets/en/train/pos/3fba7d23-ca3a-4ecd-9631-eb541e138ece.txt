Folks, NY pizza is supposed to be a little greasy. If you don't like it go to Dominoe's or whatever.

I was a Joe's regular when I worked in the area. After I found another job (far, far away) I didn't go back for ages. When I did, I was surprised that the owner remembered me! (and kind of flattered).

Anyway Joe's pizza is NY pizza. Thing crust, shiny, a little drippy. I had it yet again tonight after Papa John's informed me they no longer deliver to my zip code (85250). Then I remembered Joe's delivered and the day (but sadly, not ALDS Game 5 at this point) was saved.

Just what I wanted--pizza, Joe's fantastic garlic knots, and the best house chopped salad anywhere. Delivered, no charge.
