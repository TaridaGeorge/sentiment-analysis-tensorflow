I used these guys to put in some French doors to replace some aging sliding-glass doors at our home.  They did a great job, and you can tell the doors are of good quality material.

-- Updated: They were really cool about coming back out to help with a crazy scorpion problem we were having.  They helped seal the doors extra-tight, which is great.  At least I know the little beasts won't be getting in through the new doors.  GREAT service after the sale.
