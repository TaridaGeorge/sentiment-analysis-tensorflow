Oh dear.  This place will be the death of my waist (but not my wallet).  Handmade pasta with semolina and another flour I can't identify.  Perfect bite, tooth.  I could seriously develop an oral fixation to the tooth of the pasta.  I've had 5 different pastas -- all outstanding -- my favorite is the beef and rocket. The sides can outshine the pasta -- heirloom tomatoes, braised greens, mozzarella.  And a great wine list that shows some terroir  not 14% alcohol fruit bombs.
