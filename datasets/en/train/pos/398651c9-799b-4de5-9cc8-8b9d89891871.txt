Cool place.  I used to come here when I lived in Tempe.  It's small and kind of like Zia, but I think it's higher priced.  You can definitely find great records here that you won't elsewhere and they also carry some books. 

If you're a music lover, you probably already know about Eastside Records, but just in case you don't, you definitely need to check it out!
