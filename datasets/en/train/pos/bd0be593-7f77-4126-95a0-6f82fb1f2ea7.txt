I love this place! Get the jade red chicken quesadilla and you will not regret it. I go to school in California now and all my friends here know about it. When they come and visit me in Arizona, Chino's is always our first stop. I could not recommend this place enough! Not only is the food delicious (I usually get a jade red chicken quesadilla, emerald chicken, jerk fried rice, and refried beans) but you get a cookie with it! It's the best. Go in with an empty stomach and get ready to be blown away!
