If you're using Yelp to find a restaurant you obviously haven't eaten here - and if you haven't eaten here at least once, you must!

It's not even a burger place, but The Maytag Burger will crush any bacon/blue cheese burger you have ever had. 

The Israeli couscous is unusual and excellent. The food is incredibly flavorful but tastes fresh. I HIGHLY recommend to anybody who wants to go somewhere "new" with great food and some unique options without going off the deep end into "crazy-unique".

Prices are ~$10 - $20 per entree.
