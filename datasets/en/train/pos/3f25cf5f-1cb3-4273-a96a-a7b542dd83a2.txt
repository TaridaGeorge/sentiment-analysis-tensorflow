I called Empire plumbing at 230 am on a Wednesday. I expected to here a groggy 70 year old man on the other end, but was surprised that the operator was very friendly and not the least bit annoyed by my call. He arrived 20 minutes later .  The fix didn't require any new parts and I was only charged the service fee of about $70. This was the best experience in the situation I could imagine. If you need emergency (or any) work on your AC, call these guys right away!
