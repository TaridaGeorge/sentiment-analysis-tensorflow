I love this place! They are always busy, which is ok because I think it's well worth the wait. The Coffee Shop has a good atmosphere, and the outdoor seating is nice. They are known for their cupcakes (even featured on Cupcake Wars) but I have not tried them yet. As for the breakfast, I love the San Diegan- yum! The coffee is good too!
