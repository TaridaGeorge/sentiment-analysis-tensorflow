I bought some of their goodies at the Phoenix Public Market.  I got a cinnamon roll, red velvet cupcake, and chocolate chip cookie.  Everything was absolutely delicious.  No one would be able to tell they are made without eggs or milk.  

The packaging was super cute too.  The cinnamon roll came in a mini pink baker's box.  The cupcake had it's own special box too, with a cute smiling cupcake stamped on the front.

The pricing was very fair for fresh baked goods too.  Check them out!
