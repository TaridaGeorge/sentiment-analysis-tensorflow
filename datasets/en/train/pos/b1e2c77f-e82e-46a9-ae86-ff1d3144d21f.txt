They make you feel better.  I went to Dr Casper for a couple of years for both acupuncture and chiropractic. Going there for acupuncture was a godsend.  I had tendinitis so bad that I was limping and one treatment healed me.  She also sent me to a physical therapist to complement the treatment she was giving.  I cannot say enough good things about Dr Casper.  I am especially missing her since I moved to Baltimore and have yet to find a chiropractor or an acupuncturist that even comes close to her healing abilities.
