Although I am not a vegan/vegetarian, I really enjoyed Udupi cafe, having the sampler plate and appetizers including iddly.  It was definitely unlike any food I've ever had, with a stress on mixing varieties of different flavors and textures.  Hoping to make it to Southern India sometime in the next couple years and Udupi has given me another reason to look forward to it.
