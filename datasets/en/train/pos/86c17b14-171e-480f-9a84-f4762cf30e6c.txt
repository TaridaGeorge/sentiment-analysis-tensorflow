I had a great birthday dinner at Tarbell's yesterday evening. It was a quaint restaurant with SUPERB service. The hostesses were very friendly and seated us promptly when we walked in (although we did make reservations ahead of time). The server was very genuine and attentive. She knew the menu and offered to split my guests meal in half because he could not choose on just one entree. Talk about service!

I ordered the special halibut (Mr. Catch of the Day) and it was exactly how it was described. 

Although I would not recommend taking many children to Tarbell's, we did take our 10 mo old son and the wait staff was very gracious to him. They even thanked us for feeling comfortable enough for bringing the entire family to dine with them.

GREAT EXPERIENCE. I will return!
