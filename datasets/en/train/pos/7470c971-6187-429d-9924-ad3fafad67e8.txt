If its italian night it's Oreganos hands down. I've been to this location 3 or 4 times now and have always left uncomfortably full but very satisfied. Last night we went and started with the Toasted Ravioli's. It's a must get app. The jalapeno cheese inside is perfect.

Then we had the big rig with meatballs and the chicken artichoke lasagne. The big rig still stands as my favorite pasta dish (I like it best with chicken for the health factor, although the meatballs are great). The chicken lasagne is absolutely phenomenal - so much flavor, cheese and chicken. If it wasn't a heart attack I could have it once a week. 

We splurged and finished with the pizzokie...big yummy soft choc chip/white chocolate macadamia cookie covered in ice cream. One of my favorite desserts ever. 

I wish Oreganos existed in San Francisco!
