I find the Parking Spot to be one of the easiest, fastest, most convenient ways to take care of your ride to the airport and get a ride home when you get back into town. There's free USA Todays! And FREE BOTTLES OF WATER! Also, there's a 20% off coupon usually on their website and in the Skymall catalog on the plane, so be sure to grab one or the other.
