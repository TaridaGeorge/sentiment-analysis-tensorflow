I have to give this tanning salon a perfect rating!! I recently moved to AZ and Cody was most helpful with what membership would be best for me without trying to upsell me something I didn't need.  She is so professional and friendly and she goes out of her way to make sure her customers are happy!  Cody even gave me some ideas on where to get my hair and nails done.  The refresher baskets and cold cloths are great!! The salon is always clean, prices are great, and the staff are really nice.  I would highly recommend this tanning salon!!
