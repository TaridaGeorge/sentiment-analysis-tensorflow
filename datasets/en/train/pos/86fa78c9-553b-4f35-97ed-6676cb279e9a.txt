I've recently moved to the Gilbert area from Seattle. I'm pretty picky who takes care of my two mini Dachys. Furry Friends is really close to where we live, so I was really crossing my fingers it turned out good. 
I called and they were able to get me in right away. I couldn't be happier. The long haired one (Ella) turned out wonderful. Teddy is short haired so he just needed a nail trim. Both puppies look great and where really happy when I picked them up. The little bows in Ella's hair were darling. 
I'll DEFINITELY be back. ALSO, I agree with the reviewer before me, the salon smelled wonderful and looked super clean. THANKS
