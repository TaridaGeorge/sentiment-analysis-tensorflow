So, I haven't been to Cary's, but I felt compelled to share a positive experience after I called to inquire about an oil change.  

Whoever answered was very honest in saying that Cary's doesn't offer the cheapest oil change, (because they don't get as good of deal on oil as the big guys) but that I should try Walmart if I'm looking for just the basic/cheap oil change.  He went on to say that he even tells his own customers that and to come into him once a year for an oil change and he'll make sure everything is being taken care of that should be taken care of.  Wow, I am shocked... I will definitely go back to Cary's when I need more than just a quick oil change!
