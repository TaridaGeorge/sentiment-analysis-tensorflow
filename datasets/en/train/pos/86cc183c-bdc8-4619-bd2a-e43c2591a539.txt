Excellent brews to choose from, excellent customer service and excellent vibe.

My latte was not bitter in the least nor was the flavoring overpowering.

I look forward to this little "lab" growing in popularity. 

Maybe next time I'll get cozy on the couch on the other side of the espresso bar and have some quiet time.

I'm looking forward to (hopefully) extended hours. Or I won't be here often since schooling takes up my time during most of their open hours currently.

Hopefully this place will stick around. Local coffee houses struggle in Phoenix.
