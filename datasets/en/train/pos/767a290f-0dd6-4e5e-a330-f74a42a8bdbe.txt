This place has absolutely wonderful HUGE bowls of Pho accompanied by good condiments, basil, bean sprouts and sliced jalapenos. They never charge me for the many extra limes I request.
The SMALL rare beef Pho is a huge meal in itself.
Easily the best Pho anywhere, and a great value at just about six bucks for a small.
The Summer rolls and fresh-made lime-aid are also especially good.

This was my go-to spot for an affordable meal in this neighborhood before I moved.

It is a family place, and small, and the low prices don't afford them a separate serving staff, so wait times for food can vary.
