A massive power outage forced us into a hotel for the night to escape 110 degree heat.  This hotel was close and within our budget.  We try to go with any property under the Hilton umbrella and are usually not disappointed.  This was the best Hampton Inn we've stayed in.  New, clean, and extremely quiet.  Our neighbors took the room next to us.  We couldn't hear a peep.  No slamming hall doors, no sounds of neighbors running water, nothing.  Great air conditioner, ice cold.  Lovely dining room for morning breakfast.  Great shower and nice bath supplies.   The staff were all friendly and joked with us.  If I had to find something wrong, I'd say the room was on the small side, but everything else outweighed that.  Close to shopping, lots of restaurants.  You won't be disappointed.
