The guys at this location are awesome!  They are very friendly and helpful.  The prices are great!  Our serpentine belt had cracks and it was $129 to replace.  I checked around on prices, and this was the cheapest.  They even allowed us to drop the car off and come back for it.  They give us a $5 discount every time we go in.  I would recommend this location.  If they think you can get it done cheaper somewhere else, they will tell you and let you know where to go.
