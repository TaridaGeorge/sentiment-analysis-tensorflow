The Prime lived up to its name.  The pevious reviewers have got it right about the great service, cleanliness and fantastic food.  I'm more just weighing in so that my rating is factored into the average.

On my first visit (of what will likely be many to come) a group of us ordered:

Kung Pao Beef and Chicken
Mongollion Beef
Spicy Chicken
Yui Shan Chicken
Crab Puffs
Egg Rolls

All of them were spot on, the best I've had in the valley and I've been frequenting valley Chinese restaurants for 30 years.  If there's better Chinese food in the greater Phoenix area, please let me know!  Stop reading and get to The Prime posthaste!
