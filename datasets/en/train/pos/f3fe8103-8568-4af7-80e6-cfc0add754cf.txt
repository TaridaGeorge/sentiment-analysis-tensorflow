Yes, I will pile on.  Hipster inspired decor and attitude and delicious and unique breakfast.  We shared the "our way oatmeal) which is made with quinoa/fresh fruit and we opted for the almond milk.  My GF got the breakfast club and I tried the AZ burrito (which I pronounced the AS-burrito, or the A-Z burrito).  Both were fresh and had such interesting ingredient combinations that made things so tasty.  I'm not sure why anyone would go to some big chain place when the food is fairly priced and so delicious here.  Wished I had this place locally.
