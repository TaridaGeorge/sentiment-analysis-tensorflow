As a Minnesota native I've had the pleasure of seeing my Vikings reach four Super Bowls. Well, I didn't see them in the first one, cuz I was barely an embryo at the time. But I was glued to the screen for three of those championship games. 
We lost the first one. 
And the second.
No shit. We lost the third.
Fourth times a charm though, right? In my best Whitney, "Oh hell to the NO!"
Zero for four. Just like Mclean Stevenson sitcom career. 

So Cardinals. YEA! Kickass and Woo Freakin' Hoo Baby! I'm stoked for the big game. How ironic it could be that the 2nd most losingest franchise in all of sports history (second only to the Cubs) may give me the joy of my first Super Bowl win. 

Now. Time to make the chili and chill the beer.
