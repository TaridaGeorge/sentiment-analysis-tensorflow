To me, a neighborhood is complete only after they have: a great coffee shop, a great neighborhood bar, and 3 or 4 small/cheap/good food places. Cartel, Casey Moores and Ottos all occupy the same block and hit all three catagories.

Cartel is hands down the best coffee I've ever had in Arizona.  Great atmosphere too. The prices are absurdly cheap to the point that I worry about them making a profit. I took my coffee snob friend there who was very cynical about it before going but now declares it the best he's had. Make sure you support this place.
