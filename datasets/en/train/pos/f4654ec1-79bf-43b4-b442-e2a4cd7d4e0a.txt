I have been wanting to try this place for a while..always looking for great, non-chain, Italian food close to home. My daughter took me here for a birthday lunch and I was in heaven. The cheese calzone was huge, the sauce was bowl licking delicious! I will definately recommend this place to all my friends, Italian or not.
