I love this place! I live in Surprise, but will stop here on my way home from work and pick up dinner. My favorite is the lemon chicken, all white meat, very tasty sauce. They also have delicious fried rice and lo mein.

For $7 to $8, depending what you order, you can get soup, egg roll, crab puff, your entree, fried rice, and lo mein! Can't beat that! This is definitely one of my favorites and will continue to come. The service is also super fast and the staff is friendly.
