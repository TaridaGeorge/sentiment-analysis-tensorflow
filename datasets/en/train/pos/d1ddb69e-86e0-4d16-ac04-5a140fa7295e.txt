Magically hidden in an obscure but convenient location, this TJ's is awesome!!

We were staying at the Hilton across the street and came here to get some drinks and munchies.

Wine?  check
Fresh fruit?  check
Cheese snacks?  check
Assortment of nuts & trail mix?  check
Chips?  check
Lastly, Wine opener?  check

Our bill was less than $50 and this included 2 bottles of wine and 1 FULL bag of munchies that lasted for days.  What a great deal & I think it's awesome that it's located right in the midst of fine dining central :)  I frequent our neighborhood TJ in WeHo all the time and I love how all the stores are the same, whatever city you're in!!
