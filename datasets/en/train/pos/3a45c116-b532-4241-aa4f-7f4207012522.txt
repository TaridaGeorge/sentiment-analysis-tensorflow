One of the best liquor stores in Tempe...I've been going here since '02 and the selection has only improved.  If you're thinking of a type of hard to find beer or liquor, chances are T's has it.

The store is well organized and has a great selection as well as some of those random items you need to make your party complete.  The staff there is extremely helpful and friendly.

A staple of Tempe and ASU beer runs not to mention great specials on beer!
