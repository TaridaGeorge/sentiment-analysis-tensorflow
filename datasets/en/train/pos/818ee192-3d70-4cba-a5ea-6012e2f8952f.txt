Nice. New. Clean. Comfy. Friendly.

Most importantly, it has all of my fave tv stations: E!, Bravo, HGTV, MTV, and, of course my most favorite, Disney!

I've stayed at all of the other Hilton and Marriott hotel  brands in this area and none of them carry ALL of these channels. One of them doesn't even have the Disney channel! THE Disney channel...Um, how do you NOT have the Disney channel?! Do they not realize that that's how us mature, grown ups like to fall asleep???
