First, I have to preface this review by saying I am a dessert fiend. I melt over a nice slice of chocolate cake or tub of creamy ice cream. But if I only had one pick, Betty's paletas would be my choice every time.

This foodie highly recommends the mexican hot chocolate or strawberries and cream paletas, depending on the season. Flavors rotate depending what's fresh (no frozen bags of fruit here) so I plan to check in often for amazing new flavors.

Seriously, go get one. Wherever you are in the valley, it's worth the drive!

P.S. As another reviewer noted, it's cash only so be sure to make a pit stop at an ATM. Depending on the flavor, the paletas are either $2.49 or $2.79 each.
