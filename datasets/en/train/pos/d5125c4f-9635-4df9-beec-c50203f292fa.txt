I'll just add my 2 cents on how fun, happening, and great this place is. The coffee totally awesome. The bakery items impossible to choose. I had a very very good tuna sandwich then noticed the pizza's on other tables and had to try it. Had the margehrita and it was spectacular. Gooey cheese, chewey crust, superior ingredients. The staff here from the pizza guy to the counter people to the clean up crew......very friendly, real, and beyond efficient. 

The atmosphere here is just real comfortable and fun. A wide variety of seating styles......from indoor table , to community table, bar,outdoors garden, oudoors sidewalk, indoors amongst the grocery shoppers......

A very cool place.....can be difficult to park there sometimes but just presevere.
