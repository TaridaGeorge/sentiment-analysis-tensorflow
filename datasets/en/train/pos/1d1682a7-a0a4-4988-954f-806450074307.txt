Les poissons les poissons how I love les poissons - love to chop and to serve little fish -- yes my friends this place deserve the love I will finally give it.  Always a great atmosphere and the service is tops and on the ball.  Is this the place still to impress your date, but of course darling :) Happy Hour is a must whether after the long work day or for reversed for some drinks with friends.  My fav on the HH menu --- gotta get the butterfish tataki -- yes chopped little poissons in my belly - yum!
