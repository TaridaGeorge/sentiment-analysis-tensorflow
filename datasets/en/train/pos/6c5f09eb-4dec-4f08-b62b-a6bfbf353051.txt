I have been here many times. Love the pizza, love the pasta, love the atmosphere, love it! The owner is very friendly and greats everyone who comes in. All the pasta is rolled by hand, this is something you do not always find at Italian restaurants. This is a difference in taste and texture between handmade pasta and prepackaged. Tiramisu is to-die-for. The only downside is that you might have to wait for awhile because there is limited seating.
