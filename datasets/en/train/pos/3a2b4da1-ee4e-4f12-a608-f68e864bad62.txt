This is the place to go if you can't stand to wait to get a table at Pizzeria Bianco.  This is the place to go if you looooove olives the size of you head.  The pizza is great (I prefer the fungi without the sauce), as is their version of caprese (which includes pesto and several sizes of tomato).  The cheese plate with the honey is also so so great!  Wine selection if also very good.
