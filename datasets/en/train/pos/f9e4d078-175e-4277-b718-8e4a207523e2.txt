Love this restaurant! It's our first time in but would definitely come again...our waitress was wonderful. She helped us to choose the bacon wrapped shrimp as our appetizer, the shrimp are huge and absolutely delicious. We also had the crispy eggplant bites very good too. All 4 of us enjoyed our entrees...portions were perfect which left us room for dessert! We shared the bread pudding, the chocolate torte and the buttermilk pie all three were delicious. A perfect night out in a perfect city!
