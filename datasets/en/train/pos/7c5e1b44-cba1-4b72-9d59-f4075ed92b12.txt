I love Changing Hands! It's more than a bookstore, they also have great gifts and unique trinkets...don't be suprised if you walk out of the store with 5 more things than you intended to buy. The staff is wonderful...I've called 2 different times to look for a book I couldn't find, includingone that was out of print and both times the associate I spoke with took the time not only to look in the computer but also check the shelves for me. This is a great place to hang out and just browse as well. Plus it smells like books new and old, which if I could bottle and wear daily I would. :)
