This is where I go for take out pizza.  I generally get the large pizza and wing special listed in the Value=Pak mailers I get at home.  The pizza is the best part.  The pizza is NY thin crust style, but the crust is crispy and the pizza dough has a unique yeast taste that is the difference maker between Red Devil and other pizza joints in the area.  It is these small differences that make good food great food.  The wings are meaty and tasty but are not as superior to the pizza.  

As for inside the restaurant, cant say.  As I said before, I get the pizza and wings as takeout.
