This place when using their coupon is an amazing value.  I have been there twice and the food was plentiful and oh so fresh. Beware food can be real greasy at times but who is thinking about nutrition at a buffet ?  

Anyway, the food is never old nor stale but always fresh because they keep just enough food out between rotations.  

Lunch is $7.99 with self serve beverage but with coupon it's only $5.99 !  Dinner is $9.99 but with coupon it's only $7.99.  Great Wall Buffet is an excellent value !
