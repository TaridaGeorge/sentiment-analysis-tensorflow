ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE
*STAFF - incredibly friendly and really try to get to know you. They knew my name after my second visit and I don't think I ever introduced myself. 
*PRICE - $25.99 for a spa pedicure and they usually have coupons through money mailer, for $18-19! (includes a foot/lower leg massage, hot stone massage and callus removal)
*CHAIRS - comfy massage chairs to sit in that really work out the kinks in your back

I've been here at least 5x since I've moved here and have never once been disappointed!
