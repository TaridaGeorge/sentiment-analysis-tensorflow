My sister dragged me here with the kids but to mu surprise everything was awesome!!!!
The valducci pasta with chicken was amazing.. it had olives artichoke hearts with penne pasta and a creamy tomato sauce!
Mmmmm my mouth is waterin wishing I kept some fr lunch today.
The service was very good.. we had 4 kis with us so that's no easy task, server was all over the bread and drink refills... 
Thank you I will be cming back!
