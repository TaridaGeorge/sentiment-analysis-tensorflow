I've been going to Just Relax for about two years now, and I've never once had a bad experience. Having worked most of my life as a laborer and been to numerous massage joints, this by far is as good as it gets. You can't beat the price, the staff is always friendly even if there may be a slight language barrier once in a while, it's a clean and well kept establishment and what's even better is that over two years, I still see the same faces time and again which lets me know I'll always get the same quality service. I would and do recommend this place to anyone.
