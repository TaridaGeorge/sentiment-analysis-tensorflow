This is now called Fry's Mercado.  It's as good if not better than the Ranch Markets.  Prices are so low they seem "almost free".   Everything looks really fresh because I'm guessing they move so much stuff so quick. They have the same specialty stores within a store as Ranch Market, you know a restaurant, bakery, juice/ice cream bar and tons of other "stations" for lack of a better word.    Muy bien.
