Tossed just opened recently in the shopping area I frequent. This place is fantastic. Wide variety of salad mix'ins, creative menu and huge portions. Their vegetables are as fresh and delightful as the staff that served me. I was very pleased with my chicken wrap and am excited to try something else at this restaurant. I could easily see this place becoming my default go-to restaurant when I'm hungry and can't think of what to have for dinner. I highly recommend it!
