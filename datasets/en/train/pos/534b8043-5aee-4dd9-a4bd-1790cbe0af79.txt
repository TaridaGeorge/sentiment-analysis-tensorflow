Bottom line: any theatre that brings Rocky Horror back to Mill Ave gets 5 stars just for that. (See, I'm not hard to please.)
And they showed Showgirls here the other night. I MISSED IT (!) but again, any theatre that shows Showgirls on Mill Ave gets 5 stars. 
They also do live music performances and about a million other cool things here, but for me, it's all about Rocky Horror. 

I think (i.e. hope) that MADCAP signals a change back to the "old" Mill Ave. The things that are going on here are the best reuse of this old building. Thank you to all the people who made this happen.
