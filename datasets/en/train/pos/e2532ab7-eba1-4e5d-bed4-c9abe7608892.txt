Ever been in a spice store? It's like walking into your favorite kitchen and smelling all your favorite foods being cooked at once. We had been ordering from a catalog for some time and didn't know that they actually had stores. Then one day we were visiting the Phoenix area and discovered this store. 

First time we came in we hadn't a clue what we needed. We soon learned to make our list and each time we hit the Phoenix area, we know what to pick up. 

It's one of the best spice markets we've seen. Be sure to allow enough time to browse, pick up some of their free recipes and their magazines are loaded with ideas.
