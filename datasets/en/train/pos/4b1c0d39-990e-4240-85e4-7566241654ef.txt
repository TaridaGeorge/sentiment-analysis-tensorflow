I love the atmosphere on weekends with the DJ. Now when I say DJ I'm talking about good beats playing in the background when your dinning. Not a club atmosphere with dancing going on everywhere. Amazing specialty drinks and the food is very good as well. Nate was our server he did an amazing job. Decor fits what they are trying to accomplish swanky with a bit of lounge atmosphere.  I gave this a five because it had all the elements that I like in a restaurant.
