I was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful the villas are at this Hilton facility! The rooms are nice sizes, the kitchen was full service, with everything I could possibly need or want, including washer and dryer. The resort itself is just absolutely beautiful and so nicely maintained. The service at check-in as well as in the restaurant was outstanding. I didn't mind that I needed to drive from my villa to the hotel restaurant, main pool, and fitness center (could have walked, but nah!). I would absolutely recommend these Hilton villas if you are going to Phoenix/Scottsdale.
