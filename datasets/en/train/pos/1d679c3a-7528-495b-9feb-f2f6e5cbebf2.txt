Found this place at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs Resort (I live in town). These ladies do it all, they have a full salon and do a great job, offer nail services and waxing services (Bonnie was very friendly and professional). 

They also offer every kind of massage there is - I'll be back for sure! 

I was a walk-in and they took care of me with little delay but I think I will make an appointment next time as I can see this place being busy.
