Gallagher's is one of my favorite bars in the area.  I love places I can go get a few drinks, talk to (and hear!) my friends, and maybe play some pool or darts.  Gallagher's is nice and low-key, has friendly staff, and really good food.  Their chicken wings are great, and this is one of the few restaurants I've been to that offers pulled chicken, not just pulled pork!  Prices are totally reasonable, too.
