Jamie Kouri is an amazing makeup artist. She has great range and can be as subtle or as elaborate as you want. She is a true talent and is so easy to work with. As a photographer, the clients come to me ready and relaxed. That is so important and makes my job easy. I've worked with her on a number of boudoir and engagement photo sessions. The clients feel so good about themselves and it shows in my photographs. I can't wait to work with her again.
