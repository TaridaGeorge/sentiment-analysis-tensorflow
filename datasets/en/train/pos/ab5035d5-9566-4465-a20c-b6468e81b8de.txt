5 stars alone for refusing to serve ranch! Thanks, Grimaldi's, for preventing customers from ruining their fine pizza. Ranch on Papa John's is ok. Ranch on thin, crisp coal fired crust is not.

Grimaldi's really is our favorite pizza in town. It's not as good as Pizzeria Bianco, but Grimaldi's is just a mile and one phone call from being enjoyed in the comfort of my own home. Besides the awesome crust, I love the whole milk mozzarella. The sauce is ok. Toppings are good too. We always ask for a margherita even though it's not on the menu-- it's a quick way to ask for a tomato, basil and garlic pizza.

Although we mostly do take-out, service has been consistently good for the little that we interact with them. If you're on their mailing list, you can get a free large pizza on your birthday.
