Pumphouse II has long been a favorite of mine. My favorite things about this place are the staff like "Ranger Dale", the hot strippers, JAE the hot bartender, DJ Energy, and of course Diva extraordinare drag queen Savannah!! I've never experienced a wait on busy nights to order drinks. 

Ok, yes, its a dive bar, BUT ITS A DAMN GOOD DIVE BAR! 

Its got a mix of all age ranges... depending on the night... weeknights are a little slower. Thurs-Saturdays are always when I go there! And its always busy on those nights.

THERE ARE ALWAYS DRINK SPECIALS! And Free Wifi!
