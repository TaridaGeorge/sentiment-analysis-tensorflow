Three words... bone-in-filet or is that really two? I'll leave it to the more talented wordsmiths to do the math. Last Friday I had one of the better filets of my life. Cooked to medium-rare perfection you can't really get a better steak. Also watch out.. their pretzel bread is insanely addictive, just say no (actually say yes, eat a couple, then have them take the rest away). I'm a steak purist and it's worth noting they do add some butter to the steaks after they're cooked, if you're like me just ask to opt out. 

Service was good, but know the ambiance is a little old school. The musical act in lounge reminded me of that two person band in the movie Swingers... cheesy, but you don't really hear it in the main dining room.
