We've taken our kids to the museum twice now - it's become one of our absolute favorite family destinations for when we're in the Phoenix area. There is so much to do and see for everyone, from babies to big kids. During the holidays, as can be expected, it's super busy and it's a challenge to keep track of everyone as they're dashing from one exciting room to the next, but it's worth it to see your children have that much fun in a learning environment. We've visited a number of different children's museums and this one is the best we've found so far.

I highly recommend the Children's Museum of Phoenix to anyone with kids!
