Such a fun place to go for brunch after a night of drinking in Scottsdale.  Obviously the Bottomless Mimosas and Bloody Mary's are the best deal in town and the food is fun and hearty enough to soak up all that alcohol.  

Our server Mandy was fun, spunky and literally never let our drinks get to half empty.  

The place itself is very hip, cool and modern western.  

Music is loud and fun.  

Overall a great place to go for the young and fun.  

and more than deserving of the current 3 stars.
