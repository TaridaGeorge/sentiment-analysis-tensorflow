My wife and I both love good Cajun food and Baby Kay's has always delivered. On our most recent visit I had the Crayfish Etouffee and my wife had the ribs, the ribs were very good, they have a excellent sauce but you can get good ribs at a lot of restaurants, Crayfish Etouffee on the other hand is almost impossible to find in Phoenix, AZ and it was as good as I've had in NOLA.  Their gumbo is excellent there are a  thousand small differences in gumbo recipes even in New Orleans LA and  Baby Kay's is exceptionally tasty. I gave it 5 stars just on food quality alone and you can get Turbo Dog on tap! Like they say in the Big Easy, "Let the good times roll!"
