We parked across the arena in a public parking lot where the attendant attracted us by waving a flourescent flag signaling us to see the $8 public parking sign.  He/she directs you where to park since it is completely dark, but rather safe. You pay him up front and he will have change readily available.  We attended the Phoenix Suns vs Detroit Pistons game on a Friday and the crowd was very lively and enthusiastic about their Suns. (I was incognito, rooting for the Pistons).  Food selection is great, lots of snacks and alcohol.  I purchased a hat and t-shirt from the merchandise store and after the game we snapped a picture near the supersized PHX SUNS basketball outside.
