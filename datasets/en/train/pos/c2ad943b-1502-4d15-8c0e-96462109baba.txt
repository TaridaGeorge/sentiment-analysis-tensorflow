I'm a fan of Discount Tire but especially the store at Cooper & Warner.  The staff treats customer right.  They know their tires, are helpful with recommendations, but never pushy for a sale.  Not being a "car person", anything related to vehicle maintenance can be intimidating but the staff here is so helpful and honest.  It is hard to find a trustworthy store these days but the staff here is great.
