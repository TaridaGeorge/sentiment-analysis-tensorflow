I've got to tell everyone about the fantastic sandwich I got over at Wildflower....I might have to make it a regular stop now.  It was the turkey-pastrami with coleslaw and cheese.  Man was this sandwich great, very sweet combination with the turkey and grilled cheese style sandwich.  I like this place but I had never really found an addictive meal here till this past weekend with my family.  I dont like Paradise Bakery but this place is great, the atmosphere is really nice and the service was great, the guy behind the counter recommended the sandwich and I was grateful for that.  This location is a crazy parking lot but worth the visit.
