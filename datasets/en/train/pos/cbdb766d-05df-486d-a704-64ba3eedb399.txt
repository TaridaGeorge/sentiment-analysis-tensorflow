If I lived closer I would probably eat and drink here weekly.  The outside patio is the best part about this place!  I love how a lot of patrons ride their bikes to OHSO and how they have a bike hanging from the outside bar.  If you like beer and I mean good beer you will enjoy this place!  They have an amazing amount of beers on tap and support all of the Arizona micro brews!  The food is alright...my favorite is the pastrami sandwich!  Doesn't matter your age you will enjoy this place and the owners seem like real good guys and have put a lot effort making this place great!
