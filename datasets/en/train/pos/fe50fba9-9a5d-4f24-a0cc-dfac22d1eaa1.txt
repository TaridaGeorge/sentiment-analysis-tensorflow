Please don't tell anyone that this is the best place to watch Ohio State Football on the weekends. The service is great and the food is even better. Bring a few friends and share a few dishes. You will love to eat a bunch of everything there.

I don't drink Bloody Mary's but you can build your own. Very cool feature.
