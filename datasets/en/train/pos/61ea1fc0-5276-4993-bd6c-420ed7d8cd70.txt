Best tacos EVER!  Pernil tacos was AH-MAZING!  My hubby had the short rib barbacoa taco and a fish taco.  He enjoyed both. Chips and salsa were great!  Nice thick chips and tasty salsa.
Our server, Matt was top notch.  He knew the menu, and he made some great suggestions.
This may be my new favorite restaurant!
