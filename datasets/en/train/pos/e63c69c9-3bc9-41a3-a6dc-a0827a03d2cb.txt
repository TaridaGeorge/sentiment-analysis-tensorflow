You break it, they can fix it!  The techs and staff were very open and friendly with answering any question you have.  They have a good selection of gear and an awesome selection of bikes.  I'm not the most versed in bike repairs but I felt comfortable with the pricing, explanations of what and how it broke, and turn around time was quick so I wouldn't be left yearning to get back on the trails.  Quick and easy!  I'll use Rage for anything from my road bike tune ups to mtn bike repairs!
