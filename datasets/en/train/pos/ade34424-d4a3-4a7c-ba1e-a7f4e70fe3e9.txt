Absolutely wonderful!  I actually signed up for yelp to write a nice review for this place.  I am not a big ice cream person, have been to italy and loved thier gelato, but never been a big "oh lets go get gelato" person here.  The point is that the gelato there is amazing, with amazing gourmet flavors that rotate frequently and I think it is family owned.  The employees are all so sweet and make tons of amazing little concoction samples for you before you have a chance to order. Also, I am a student and they give a nice discount.  Try it!
