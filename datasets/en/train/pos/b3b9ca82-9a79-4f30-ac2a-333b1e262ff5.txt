The best thing about this facility is that all the pools are connected.  That's a huge plus for me.  I can get to my kids without ever having to leave and re-enter separate pools.

They have two waterslides, a lazy river, a whirpool, and a playground structure in a zero depth area that shoots out water from every which way. 

They even have these underwater benches that you can sit and rest on while watching your kids... That's excellent for a dad that has to keep an eye out for two daughters.


What's not to like about this place?  I can't think of a single thing.
