I give Pei Wei thumbs up because the dishes are good  for a chain. Because of my social circle, I've eaten here a lot in the past year. I feel that the dishes here are healthy and well presented. Pretty much everything can be made with  just tofu and vegetables. However be sure to ask since some dishes are not complete vegetarian, they are cooked in oysters sauce. I love the fact that they have Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and Thai food here, but where is Filipino? It would be great if they add Vegetarian Adobo or Pancit Noodles. Those can be made vegetarian or even vegan.
I think the staff here is very nice, the food is reasonably priced  and the establishment is clean.   
You know another good thing about this particular location? You can pick up the free wi-fi from Starbucks next door.
