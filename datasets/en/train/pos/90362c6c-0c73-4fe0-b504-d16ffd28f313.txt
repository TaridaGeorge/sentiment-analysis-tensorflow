I have never had an unpleasant experience here. Ive sat in multiple areas of the restaurant.... the upstairs being my favorite. I love the dim lighting and contrast in soft/rough architecture. Incredible seasonal food. WONDERFUL service. I once stayed pass closing time without realizing it and I was never rushed or given attitude nor was it brought to my attention by the staff. Thank you St Francis. You were above my expectations.
