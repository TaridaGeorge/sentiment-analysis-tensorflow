My favorite yogurt joint in all of Phoenix!  I like it better than the other competitors because:

- Its CHEAP
- Super friendly staff
- Froyo flavors change regularly - its fun to try new ones!
- Half off on Wednesdays if you wear your jammies! Double awesome! 
- Interesting toppings - lemon syrup, maple syrup, mochi, etc. 
- Clean, open store
