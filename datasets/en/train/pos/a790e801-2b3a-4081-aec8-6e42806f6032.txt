I've now eaten at The Vig twice - once for Sunday lunch, and most recently, for dinner during a weeknight. I thoroughly enjoyed both my meals. 

The food is good and priced right, and the waitstaff is very friendly. While the place is definitely noisy at night, this didn't bother me. Perhaps this was because I was sipping The Vig's great Bloody Mary's throughout the meal, but I was fine with the noise. 

I've not yet eaten out on the patio, but plan to do so. And I hear the place has a pet cat. Definitely want to return for the cat - and the sweet potato fries. :)
