I loved everything about this place. They have great food, coffee, desserts and ambiance. They add pesto to their minestrone! Pesto makes everything better. Servers were very attentive. This is a great place for me to hang out while I do paperwork and make phone calls in between visits at work. I have also spent a very  long lunch here with girlfriends. We didn't feel rushed to leave by staff. Our lunch extended into early Friday evening. It did seem to get really busy closer to the dinner crowd. Patrons seemed to range from people on dates to people with small children. It's a great place for everyone.
