This is the second time I've been by to fix a bent wheel. The first time they were able to straighten it out, the second time they tried, but needed to get a new one for me. Even though my needs were not big, I felt like I was being treated as if I was spending $2000. When I went to pick up my new wheel, they had had an extra wheel my size lying around that was worth double what I ordered, and gave me the better one instead for the cheaper wheel price. I had previously gotten a quote from Performance Bikes (big chain) and Rage was cheaper, which surprised me. Anyway, I recommend going to Rage, it's better all around.
