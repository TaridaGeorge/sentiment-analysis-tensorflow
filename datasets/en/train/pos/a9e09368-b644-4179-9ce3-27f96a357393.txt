Went here for breakfast.
Dishes:
-Crab/egg benedict-excellent with excellent hollandaise sauce
-Southwest Omelette-yum
Both dishes had breakfast potatoes were PHENOMENAL! Excellent flavor...one of best breakfast potatoes! Yum 
Kids eat free for breakfast! Another plus! 
Lots of workers, including other servers, managers, etc had excellent customer service & always came by to check on us! Glad we choose this place :) 
Plus, it was conveniently located since we are staying @ the Firesky Resort
