Five star ratings are so obnoxious and hard to trust.

So you ask yourself, is there anything better than Cornish Pasty Co. for what they do? No.

Five stars here no doubt about it. Service is great (you seat yourself and they will handle it from there). Nice place outside, great bar, great tables inside. I actually recommend the bar with a friend. It's a great place to relax.

The food is incredible. Their choice of Pastys is expansive. I've had the pastrami and hamburger. Both were very filling. The apple dessert was delicious. Just a great experience.

Note: They refunded my check one evening because I was double charged. Offered me a round of drinks. Honestly, they earned their five stars with me.
