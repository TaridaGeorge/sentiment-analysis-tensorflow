When others say that this place has the best carne asada in town, they are not exaggerating. It is perfectly charred with a great flavor and the meat is neither too chewy nor too dry. The salsa, lime and radish that are served with every burrito complements the carne asada wonderfully. It really is a great burrito.

This review would have been four stars until they opened up their new location due to the difficult parking situation and long lunch lines. After opening up on 7th and Campbell, both locations always have people in them but they are never too crowded. 

Definitely a great place to grab a Pacifico, a burrito and chill on the patio under the misters.
