I am an out of towner, but when I visit my mom, we always come here for lunch.  The lunch specials are a great value.  I love the basil chicken, it has bamboo shoots.  I order it hot at an 8 out of 10 on the heat scale.  My mom loves the beef and green beans.  My husband Joe also likes the basil chicken, but he doesn't order it as hot as I do.  The food is fresh and the service is great.  

My mom just told me they renovated the outside.  She said it looks great, I can't wait to see it.
