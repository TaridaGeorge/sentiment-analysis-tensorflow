La Torretta is our family favorite for Italian food. Darius, the owner, does a terrific job of remembering everyone's favorites or customizing to your desires that day. Our kids love the gnocchi bolognese and we love all of the fish entrees. The smoked chicken pasta is fabulous and I have even taken it to parties to rave reviews. Everything is fresh and fabulous. If you like OssoBucco, this is the best in town! Laurie and Rodney and the Boys
