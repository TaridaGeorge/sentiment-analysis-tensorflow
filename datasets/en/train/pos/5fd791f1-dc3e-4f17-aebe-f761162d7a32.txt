this is one of the best dive bars in phoenix. we go there all the time, and they have hot nuts, and cheap cigarettes, and crazy weirdos like a deaf guy with a giant beard that tried to feel my lady up and ex-hippies and old people.

they have a pinball machine, and a pool table, and jukebox and a claw machine and a table pac-man and that shooting deer rifle game. unfortunately the darts are a little too awkwardly placed to play. 

the bartenders are amazing and have been there since probably before you were born. the drinks are pretty strong and reasonably priced.

there is also a sister bar located in sunnyslope which is even sketchier and just as awesome.
