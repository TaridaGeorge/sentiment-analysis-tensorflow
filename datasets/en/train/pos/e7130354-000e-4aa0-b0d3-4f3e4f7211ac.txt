This place rocked!  We ate here a couple of weeks ago.  So they only have pasties (pass-tees), kinda like a big empanadas, but they are the best pasty I've ever had!!  We sat at the bar, right infront of the kitchen, and it's the best seat in the house...what a show!  It got crowded on a Friday night but with being infront of the kitchen, we didn't care.  It was also nice that they dimmed the lights so it was had that English tavern feel.  Candle lit tables, very nice atmosphere.  We had the Veggie Oggie and Veggie Shepards Pie...both so delish.  I like the Oggie better :)   We're definitely going back  and trying out every other pasties they have.  Highly recommend it!!
