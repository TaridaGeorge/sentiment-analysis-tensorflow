It's been several months since my last visit and I still recall the flavors of the individual ingredients on my pizza.  Amazing!  (ummmm, especially after polishing off a bottle of wine or two while waiting).

There's a reason I won't go here more than once a year or so.  I refuse to wait several hours to be seated at any restaurant. It makes no sense for the customer that Bianco won't take reservations.  Our only recourse.... follow the advice of others here and go find a better way to spend your waiting time than spending money on wine and appetizers.

But seriously, the pizza is amazing and memorable.
