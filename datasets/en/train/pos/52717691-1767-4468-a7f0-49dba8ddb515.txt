There is no other place that sells more Asian grocery than Lee Lee. It is the best place that you can find Asian foods in Arizona. 99 Ranch at the Chinese culture center are no way to compete with this one. 

You can pay US$90 to get US$100 paper money. So you save $10. There are many fresh live fish, sea foods that the staff can kill and clean and even fry them for you at no extra charges. The owner moved the store twice and is going to open another store in East Gilbert soon. 

You can see many Asian from many countries shopping here. Thursday morning is the best time to shop there, because they usually put new fresh items on Wed night.
