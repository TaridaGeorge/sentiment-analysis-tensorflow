Sprouts is where I go for all my veggies! They have great prices and once a week they have a day where you can get both the previous add and the new add prices. They always have a great selection of fresh produce at great prices. They also have good meats that don't have all the chemicals added...farm raised, no hormones, etc. The store is always clean and the people working are always friendly.
