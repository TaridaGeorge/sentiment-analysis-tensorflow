I'm going to flat out say this before I start writing the review, my aunt makes the best pupusas.  Now with that being said this is a nice little hole in the wall.  The place is nice and clean.  The food is cheap and delicious.  The people are really friendly and the old man behind the register always seems to great me with a smile ( I think he is the owner).  Mind you pupusas are more filling then they look so don't over order.  I like the traditional queso con loroco.  The plantains are also delicious.
