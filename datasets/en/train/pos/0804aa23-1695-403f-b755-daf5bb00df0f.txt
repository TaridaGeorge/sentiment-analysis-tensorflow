I rated it as good as it gets but I hate the long waits. I endure them because I love the food that much. I think part of the Oregano's philosophy is keep it small, keep demand, make some hype. I think this philosophy sucks. Just get bigger restaurants so more people can eat good food in a timely fashion. PLEASE!

Pizza, amazing. Great sandwiches. Great pasta. Great salads. Great specialty drinks. Great service. Great dessert. Great. This place can win over anyone, once you get in.
