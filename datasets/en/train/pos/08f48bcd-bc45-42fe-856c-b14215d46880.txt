Let's be honest, Phoenix has developed a reputation as a city without any culture. It's institutions like the Phoenix Art Museum that are proving how untrue that statement is! 

Phoenix Art Museum is one of my favorite places in town, with the standard awe-inspiring pieces as well as traveling exhibits that keep me coming back. It's a great mix of new artists and classics like Picasso and Monet...and includes some great exhibits like Peter Wegner's Guillotine of Sunlight or my personal favorite Yayoi Kusama's fireflies exhibit. Step into this darkened room and experience millions of "fireflies" in a moment you'll never forget. 

With great promotions like Target's free Wednesday nights and great programs for the under 21 crowd, the Phoenix Art Museum stands as an example of all that the Phoenix cultural scene has to offer.
