Last week, I was one of the lucky few got invited to Yelp's Spa Night.  Thanks to Lindsey for inviting me!   Unfortunately, the a/c wasn't working but everyone was in their happy mood.  I had a great time chatting with other Yelpers.  

Brandon, GM of Mood Swings and his team really treated us very very well!   Snacks, chair massage, hand massage, manicure, make-up lesson, and the goodie bag with Aveda products.  Oh yea, there was bubbly too!  

Thank you so much for a wonderful night of relaxation!
