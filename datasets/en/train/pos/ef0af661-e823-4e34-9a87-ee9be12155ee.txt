Great atmosphere!  It's next to the movie theater.  I love the lounge area, the live band, and other events that goes on in this place.  I love how it's always pack with people of all ages every night.  

Great staff!  Keenan, you're awesome!  Thanks for my cappuccino and croissant.  The cappuccino was perfect!
