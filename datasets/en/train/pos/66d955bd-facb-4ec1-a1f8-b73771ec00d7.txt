We've been coming here for five years. This place never disappoints.  In the past year (?) they've refreshed their menu and it is even better than the old one. Their burgers are simply the best in the Valley and the Fez Burger is a wonderful combo of sweet-and-salty-in-your mouth. Their Hummus is incredible; seriously garlicky and served with fresh veggies. I'm in love with their Pistachio Cesar Salad. Their drink specials are amazing and that Apricot  Margarita is to die for. Recently we were in Boulder CO and tried to find a good burger and couldn't. So on the way home from the airport we grabbed a burger here.  Yay! We got our burger fix. And you've got to love the vibrant atmosphere.
