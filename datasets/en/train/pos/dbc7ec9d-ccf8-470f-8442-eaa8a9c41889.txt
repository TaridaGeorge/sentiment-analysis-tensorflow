There's enough reviews of the Roosvelt to make it simple enough for me to say this is hands down my favorite place to get a beer in Phoenix. It really feels like I'm at home anytime I walk into this place. Best tap selection downtown and the coldest glass of beer you're likely to find. 

Hurry up and open the back patio! Winter is coming.
