LOVED this place... Like the sushi type menus - which allow each person to customize their own burger to their liking. LOVED the Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries... LOVED how the owner Lee liked my kids and welcomed them to his restaurant... Loved how they catered to all 9 of us (with 4 kids) without any hesitation. Will definitely be back.
