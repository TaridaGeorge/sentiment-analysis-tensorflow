My chow requires monthly grooming during the summer so I take him here.  The staff is super friendly to both my dog (Ewok is his name) and to myself.  He's a friendly dog but not exactly voluntary when it comes to groomers.  But since I've been taking him here he's been well behaved and happy to go which is important in my opinion.  The price is very reasonable and I can always get an appointment when i need it.

As far as the rest of the store is concerned, I wouldn't know.  I buy dog food from Costco.  But it looks like there are a lot of selections for every type of pet you could need.  They do run classes here for pet training on weekends, but other than that, I have no other info for you.  Good place for grooming though.
