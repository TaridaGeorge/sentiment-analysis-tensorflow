The BEST subs I've ever had, hands down. The bread is always perfect, the ingredients are fresh and the staff always welcomes you when you walk in. While the wait is a little on the longer side(I'd say on par with Cheeba Hut) the time waiting is well spent. The menu is extensive, and I would recommend getting your sub "fully involved" which means that it has all the fixins.
