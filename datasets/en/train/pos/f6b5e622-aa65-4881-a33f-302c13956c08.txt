In love with Jo....but he's part Bot....man vs machine....can I have both?

:/

The new space is mighty fine.

Delicious coffee! Delightful! Divine!

My favorite part is the new patio a go go! and the spare room for "chillin" with your iced-mocha with soy no whip extra shot double pumped caffeine feind shaken not stirred yes please and thank you!

So tute!


Also..the best part, it knows what it is:  unpretentious furnishings and VIBE. I like this place. I love my Bots.
