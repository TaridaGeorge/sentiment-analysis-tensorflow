some of the best latte and the best ice coffee i've had in the country!  really not much different in price than cbtl or starbucks, yet can't even compare the quality.  

if you want to be able to park right outside the cafe, try going to their citynorth location.  parking can be a pain at scottsdale quarters unless you don't mind parking in their garage and then spend 10min walking over.
