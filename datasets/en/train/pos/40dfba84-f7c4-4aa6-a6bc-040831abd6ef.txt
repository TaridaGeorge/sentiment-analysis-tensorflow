I have tried a lot of burger joints in the area, and this one is by far the best. $5 and change gets you a huge burger, fresh-cut fries and a can of soda. 

Operated by the owners, they definitely deserve the support of the community. Coming back tomorrow... And the next day... And probably after that. Also do yourself a favor and get the BBQ Mushroom & Swiss. Perfect ratio of sauce to burger to shrooms.
