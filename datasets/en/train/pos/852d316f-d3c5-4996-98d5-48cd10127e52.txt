I love supporting locally owned businesses and this is the best local dog food store in Tempe. They stock some great natural feeds which are far better for dogs then most of the junk available commercially. I feed my dog half raw food and half kibble which I get at Tempe Feed and Tack. The staff are friendly and helpful! Thumbs up in my book!
