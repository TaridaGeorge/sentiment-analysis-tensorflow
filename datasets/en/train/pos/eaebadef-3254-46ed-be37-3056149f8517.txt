I have to say I'm a bit surprised by the other reviews. A friend an I went for lunch. We were seated right away and had excellent customer service the entire time. The black bean soup was amazing as well as my mushroom Swiss burger. Well done yet juicy and flavorful.  My friend had the chicken tacos an side salad and she was as equally impressed. Will definitely go here a again.
