Best Pad Thai I've had in Phoenix! And I've tried several since moving here last year. 

Cute, smaller Thai place, but the decor is tastefully done. Friendly service and they do a great job of keeping diners in a tight lunch hour on schedule. 

The homemade salad dressing is amazing and I love the fact that the little salad is included with any meal. If you live or work near Park Central, I would highly recommend Thai Basil!
