Took my girlfriend here for Valentines day and was very glad I made the choice.  Loved the modern decor and the friendly wait staff.  We sat at the bar area and was able to watch Chef Josh and his crew deliver an unforgetable dinner for my girlfriend and myself.  Favorites included the Fanny Bay Oysters, Foie gras & the duck confit wrapped in a crepe.  Dont be fooled by the negative reviews written by amateur diners this restaurant is top notch.
