It is my favorite Japanese ramen restaurant. It is small but clean. Lunch ramen combo is really good. You get a bowl or ramen and several pieces of California rolls. Their ramen is really delicious. 
My wife always order a chicken katsu and she loves it. The only complain for me is the ramen is bit small for me. I wish they have a bigger size. But still very yummy and I love it. Strongly recommend!
