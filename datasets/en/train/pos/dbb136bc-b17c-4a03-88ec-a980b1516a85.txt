I love this place. It's filled with old stuff that people in my hometown of NYC would sell back to you for 100x the price. It's an absolute treasure hunt, and I can spend hours there just looking at the random things they have -- if only their a/c worked better, because it's really hot and airless in the back rooms during the summer. But I always try to find an excuse to come here, since I know there will be something I didn't see before each time.

The staff is super friendly; they always help you carry what you buy out to your car and thank you for stopping by. It's pretty dusty in there, but dust won't kill you!
