What a great hidden gem.  Tucked away in a corner of an otherwise uninspiring strip mall in Tempe, Classic Italian Pizza is my new fave pizza place.  Right away, you walk into another world as you step inside.  Cozy and warm, you would have no idea that you were in a strip mall at all.  But the real reason to drive out to Classic Italian Pizza is the pizza itself.  Try it, you can thank me later.
