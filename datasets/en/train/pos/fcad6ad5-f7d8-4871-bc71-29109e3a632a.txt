The soup, salad, panini, and especially the bruschetta were all fabulous! Delicious and beautifully presented. We also really enjoyed the live music and the peach tea. I wish I lived closer - this would easily become a favorite lunch spot for me (although maybe only for special occasions as it's a bit pricey)!

HIGHLY recommend. :)
