I am impressed.  Dollar Tree next to Target is fantastic!  I went Grand Opening weekend, without knowing it was the Grand Opening.  It was like walking into a newly remodeled house, it smelled new and a lot like plastic and stuff for a $1.  I think this is the nicest Dollar Store I have been in, the party supply disposable section is really nice. It had everything you could ever as for and of course all priced at only $1.
