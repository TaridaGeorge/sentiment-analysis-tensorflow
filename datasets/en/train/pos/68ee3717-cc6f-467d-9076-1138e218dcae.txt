I've been to Postino a countless number of times, and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.  The servers are always friendly and helpful, and the food (especially the small sandwiches and bruschetta) is delightful.

If you're thinking about going during happy hour or for dinner, I recommend calling ahead to make a reservation, or expect to wait.  It can get pretty packed.
