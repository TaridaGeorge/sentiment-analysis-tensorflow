Chad and his crew are excellent!! Always prompt, great rates, and gets the job done!  I have been using TIO for several years now and they have completed work for me personally at my office by adding more drops and even network wiring as well as many of our property management clients.  I plan to continue to use Turn It On for all of our electrical needs, in our property management department, and will continue to refer Chad to resale clients .
