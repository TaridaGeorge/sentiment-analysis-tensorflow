Love, love, love this place.  The menu is fantastic.  They actually have steel cut oatmeal!  Wildflower Bread Company is following the same line as Panera Bread, Paradise Bakery and Atlanta Bread Company, but better, exponentially better.  They have the best soups!  I love the Portabello Mushroom and Tomato Basil Soup.  The salads are fresh, crisp and have an abundance of veggies.  One big plus is the salads are not overpowered with dressing.

I will be back!
