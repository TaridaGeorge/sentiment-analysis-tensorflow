I love living near this place.  I'm a big fan of tapas and have tasted nearly everything on the menu, as well as brunch (which is AMAZING).  A couple of items not to miss are the octopus, the fried anchovies, and the brussles sprouts.  David is also great with his wine selection.  Be sure to ask him for help if you don't know your Spanish varietals.  Don't miss this place if you are in the mood for great food and wonderful decor.  The place is hoppin as well later at night.
