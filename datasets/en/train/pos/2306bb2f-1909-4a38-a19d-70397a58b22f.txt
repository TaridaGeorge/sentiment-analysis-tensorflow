I would not survive without Channel 8. i really don't watch much TV, but when I do, I want it to count.

Let me see: Keeping Up Appearances, Coupling, RedDwarf, Antiques Roadshow, NewsHour, Nova, This Old House, Dr. Wayne Dyer, Frontline, Horizon, Scientific American Frontiers, The War, As Time Goes By, Red Green. Plus, tons of responsible programming for kids in the am and afternoon.

(I don't think RedDwarf and Coupling air on PBS anymore - but thanks to PBS for introducing me)
