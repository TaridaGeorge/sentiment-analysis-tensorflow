Breakfast and coffee attached to a bookstore. Wildflower, will you marry me? This place is consistently the best breakfast around. Try the two-egg with rosemary-crusted hash browns and fresh-baked toast, but add a short-stack of traditional pancakes. They're the best in town! Lunch is great too with tons of fresh sandwiches, salads and soups to choose from. The green corn chowder and french onion soups are a must. This place is small. If you're headed out on a weekend morning and afraid of crowds try the Chandler Mall location, equally as crowded but much larger. Bon appetit!
