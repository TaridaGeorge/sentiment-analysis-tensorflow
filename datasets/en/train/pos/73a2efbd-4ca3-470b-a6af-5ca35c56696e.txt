We went here yesterday for their special brunch.  It was fantastic.  We were offered all you can drink bellinis and blood orange mimosas.  There was a sushi bar with fresh sushi, butterfish with asparagus, tofu with tomatoes, and so much more.  They also brought to each table mushroom rice pots, sesame sweet potatoes, and we were allowed to order as much as we wanted on the a la carte menu.  We ordered a couple orders of the sirloin, and an order of the tofu with chili sauce.  Everything was excellent, including the service.  I look forward to their next event.
