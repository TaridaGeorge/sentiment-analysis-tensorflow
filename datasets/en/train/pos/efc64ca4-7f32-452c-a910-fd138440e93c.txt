I've had lunch here several times and this place has never disappointed me. Do expect a crowd during lunch hours and get there early if you want to eat the daily special. ALWAYS buy a Macaroon to top off your meal, trust me you will enjoy it! The staff is very friendly and they use mostly all local products. This place is truly a jewel in Tempe!
