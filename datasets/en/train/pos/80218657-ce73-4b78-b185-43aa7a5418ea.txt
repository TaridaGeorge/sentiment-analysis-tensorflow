Totally adorable, vegan-loving coffee shop! My girlfriend brought me here for the first time last week, and I loved it a lot! The atmosphere alone is great. Lots of chairs and tables, has wifi, and is definitely in favor of anyone with a laptop needing somewhere to work. I had the iced coffee, was strong like I like it, and also had the cinnamon sugar donut. A little pricey for a college student on a budget, but you get what you pay for! I'll definitely be back!
