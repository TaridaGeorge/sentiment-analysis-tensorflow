We absolutely love this place. The food is very authentic and amazing. They will adjust the heat to what ever you want, Mild, Medium, Hot, Very Hot, Very Very Hot to your mouth will catch on fire Hot. It's never busy, which isn't good for them but great for us. I really do hope business picks up. The tradition of Indian cuisine is not lost with these guys. Even the next day I'll get a craving for more!!!!
