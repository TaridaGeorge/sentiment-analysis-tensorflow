This gym is great...  I joined because it opened only about 3 minutes away from my house.  I keep going back because every person who works there is so nice and greets you with a smile and a friendly hello.  It is not intimidating at all, which is a big step up from the LA Fitness that I used to go to.  The staff gets to know you by name and most of the other members are quite friendly as well.   The gym is open enough that you can do free weights on your own without bumping into anyone and there are always plenty of cardio machines available.   I've been going there for over a year and plan to continue doing so!
