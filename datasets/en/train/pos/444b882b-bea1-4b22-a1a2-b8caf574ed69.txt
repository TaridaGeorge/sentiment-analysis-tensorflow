I have been eating at Crackers for years and I can honestly say I have NEVER had a bad meal.  Their food is so friggin good that i'm craving it right now as I type.  From breakfast (sirloin or california eggs benedict are my two faves) to lunch (any salad or soup is great and of course the best sandwich ever - Roast Beef Avocado Melt) to dessert (world famous Bread Pudding and the ever so chocolaty Kahlua Brownie) you cant go wrong!! 

great atmosphere.  Always packed.  great service.
