If you like chevre, you have to try the chevre from Crow's Dairy. I'm ridiculously hooked on it. So is my almost 8-year-old daughter, to the point where I sometimes hide the chevre in the fridge for fear she'll eat too much of it before I get to it. I've had both the plain and peppercorn, which are fantastic on wheat crackers. I've also tried the quark, which I like to smooth over a toasted bagel, and the feta, which is great.  But the chevre is my first and best love from Crow's Dairy, and whenever I need chevre, I try to make a trip to the farmer's market rather than buy it from a store, as the store-bought stuff is never as fresh and tasty.
