The "hipster" tag on Yelp was made for exactly this type of restaurant. This place was full of them; you'll see a lot of tattooed employees here and general indie-ness abounds at the Cornish Pasty Co. Luckily this also means good music. I heard El Ten Eleven, Minus the Bear, Crystal Castles, and Caribou while eating there. But onto the food!...

CPC has a great variety of pasties. I tried "The Porky", which was delicious. Inside it was pork, potatoes, apples, sage, and a few other ingredients. My table also ordered a side of jalapeno fries, which were very good and just the right level of spiciness.  You really can't go wrong with this restaurant. What's not to love about a place that has Strongbow on tap? I would definitely recommend eating here.
