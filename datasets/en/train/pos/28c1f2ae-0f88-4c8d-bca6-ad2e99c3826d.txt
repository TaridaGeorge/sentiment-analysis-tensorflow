I have business associates from Germany that visit annually.  I brought them to City Hall a few years back and now I think they make the trip just for the steak and seafood tower at City Hall.  We dined here again this past Friday and it was another spectacular meal.  The bone-in filet (Oscar style) cannot be beat.  Save a tiny bit of room for the butter cake...quite a nice way to wrap up such a great dinner.  See you again soon CH.
