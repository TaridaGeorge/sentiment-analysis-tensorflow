Easy 5 star fun at the Phoenix Zoo. I've never seen critters so closeup before. At the Monkey Village, they don't even have cages. The giraffes came right up to us. I spent half my beer money on fishheads and shrimp feeding the stingrays. It was a blast!

We had great time!
yow, bill

PS - I've never commented on other people's reviews before. But jeez. When someone goes to the zoo and complains about the cost of a hot dog or a snow cone... well, for spider monkey's sake, get a clue!
