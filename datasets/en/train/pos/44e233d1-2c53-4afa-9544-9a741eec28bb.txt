I can't believe nobody has reviewed this wonderful little restaurant yet!  I've been going here for years, first with my parents, who are both from Indiana, then to treat my mother, my husband and kids, even my brother when he was in town.  Where else you gonna find a "breaded pork tenderloin" sandwich!  And it's really good!  They also have great breakfasts.  I had the "Corn Meal Mush" one day and expected a bowl of hot cereal, but it was actually strips of fried cornmeal batter which were delicious with syrup over them.  They came with a generous amount of bacon, too.  They are only open till 2pm so don't dawdle if you want to eat there.  And be sure to try the pork tenderloin!
