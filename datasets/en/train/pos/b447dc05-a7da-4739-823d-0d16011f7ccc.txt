I've lived near downtown Chandler for over 6 years now.  One of the better kept secrets is how Arizona Avenue between Chandler Blvd and Frye has been revitalized.  There are several restaurants that offer great atmosphere, a comfortable dining experience and a wide variety of wines and cocktails.  98 South is no exception.  If you like a casual happy hour with a great choice of wines and martinis, give them a try.  If you like beer , they have a good selection including Stella Artois (of which I'm a recent convert to!)  Try a couple of their appetizers and share with whoever you go with.  I'm a big fan of the warm almond crusted brie plate and the skirt steak starters.    The staff at the bar are friendly and extremely helpful when you need a recommendation for wine or food.
