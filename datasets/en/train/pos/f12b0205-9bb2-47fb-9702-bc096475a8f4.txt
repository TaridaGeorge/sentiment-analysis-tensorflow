The pride of sunnyslope.  Found this little gem when it was still Tortas La Presa and the place has only gotten better since.  The tostada de ceviche is amazing, especially at $2.99.  Can't go wrong with any one of the tortas, sopes or quesadillas.  For two people the bill will be about $24 and your stomache will be so full you will need to hurry home and take a major siesta before you go into work...or maybe thats just me.
