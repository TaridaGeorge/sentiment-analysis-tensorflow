I had just got back from a trip to NYC where I had the most amazing Chinese food ever, in China Town of course! Well I was craving Chinese food sooo bad so I decided to try this place out. It was amazing. Really authentic and way cheap. In fact, my man and I ordered a bunch of different items so we could try them all. Everything was good and we only spent $30.00 and that included drinks plus tip. The leftovers made for a lovely late night snack.
