I love Fair Trade! they make THE best blueberry mochas in the city. every time I order a blueberry mocha somewhere else, it just plain sucks, but I've never (never!!!!) had a bad one at FT. other wonderful things about FT include its proximity to the light rail, lovely outdoor seating, parking garage (if you drive), and student discount!
