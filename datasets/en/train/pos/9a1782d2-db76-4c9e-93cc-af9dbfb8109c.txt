Hands down the best car wash I've been to in Phoenix.

Not only is it a 100% hand car wash, but the people drying the cars really care. I drive a 2006 Lexus GS300, which has a gas cap area that always holds water, then leaks and leaves an ugly watermark on my black car. I talked to the guy drying my car about it and he took extra time spraying out my gas cap area with the compressed air to ensure it was dry.

You wouldn't guess it from the look of the place, but Stewart Car Wash is an absolutely high-class car wash. AND, it wasn't pricey at all for a car wash.
