I hiked Sunrise for the first time, not having completed a hike in more than two years. While the trail is considered "moderate," one should have plenty of water and appropriate shoes for hiking. The trail is 2 miles to the Sunrise peak summit, an excursion that will take approximately 1 hour and will provide plenty of cardio exercise. The views are incredible and there are a handful of scenic spots along the trail. 

The descent will take about 45 minutes to an hour. Be aware that you may share the trail with bikes, horses and dogs. 

There is limited parking at the trail head and additional parking about 100 yards before the trail head lot in the equestrian parking lot. If you arrive after 9.30 am on a weekend day, parking becomes scarce. 

I will be making this a regular weekend hike. I loved it!
