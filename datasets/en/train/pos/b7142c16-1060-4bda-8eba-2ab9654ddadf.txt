Went here for late birthday dinner with my partner. Our birthdays are one day apart and the evening started with personalized menus with happy birthday wishes on them. A most unusual series of little surprises between courses - like mini mini sloppy joe, mini breakfast muffin, little melon yokes - all very creative and well presented. The tasting menu is a must - the wine pairings were great too. Service was attentive and helpful. Overall, yes it was expensive, but well worth it compared to comparably priced places in the area. This place is in my all-time top 5. Be sure to book well in advance and ask for indoors or outdoors depending on your preference.
