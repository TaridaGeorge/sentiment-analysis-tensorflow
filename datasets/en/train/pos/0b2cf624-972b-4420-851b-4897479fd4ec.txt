If I have a friend visit me from Seattle(where I grew up) THIS is where I take them. Anytime I meet someone new to AZ with the same taste as me in almost anything I bring them here. If it were not for this place and only a small handful of others I would be embarrassed when entertaining anyone from a real city that has any culture or class. Lost Leaf = 5 HUGE STARS
