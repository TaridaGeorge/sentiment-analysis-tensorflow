Salt River Tubing runs its operation like a well-oiled machine, with frequent shuttles at the pick up points with drivers who know what they're doing and are happy to help you out.  SRT works hard to keep the environmental impact of recreational tubing under control, running staff through the river regularly servicing SRT-provided waste receptacles and equipping tubers with plastic bags designated for trash collection.

The availability of restroom facilities, even pit toilet park-standard facilities, regularly along the route does wonders for making this activity civilized.

Fun and well worth the thirteen bucks for a day rental of tube and shuttle service.
