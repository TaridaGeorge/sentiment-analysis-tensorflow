This place in fantastic they pay attention to every detail from ingredient selection, perpetration, food pairings and customer service. I have food allergies and the head chef will take time to discuss any of the dishes with me. Several time they know the ingrdients as well as the name of the farm the ingredients come from.

And Let me say all of this show up in the food. The sandwiches are some of the best I have had anywhere certainly the best in Arizona.
