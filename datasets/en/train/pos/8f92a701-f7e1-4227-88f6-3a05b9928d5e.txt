Been to this and other locations umpteen times...

Pro's
- salad, Oregano's Original hands down is outstanding
- service truly a staple Oregano's simply is OUTSTANDING
- never a bad meal here or at any location 

Con's
- ahhhh wait times sometimes.  Argh!  

And a special call out to this location.  A month or two ago I ordered takeout and it wasn't ready as promised so they "comp-ed" me that order.  

Great job management!
