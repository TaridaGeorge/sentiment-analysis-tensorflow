My husband and I returned to The Herb Box for dinner two days after our first visit.  This time I had the gluten-free Butternut Squash and Corn Enchiladas, which were delicious and satisfying, with a perfect tomatillo sauce.  My husband loved his New York Strip with demi-glace, gorgonzola, green bean & fingerling potato salad w/ red onion, celery & fennel.  For dessert we had a very nice gluten-free lemon meringue pie. Yum!

The cocktail menu is inventive, and we both enjoyed deliciously unique drinks.  The wine menu offers a good variety of foreign wines, but it would be nice to see some nice domestic options, as well.

Once again the service was lovely (thank you, Eric H.!), and the ambience was intimate and relaxing.  We  are looking forward to our return to Scottsdale to sample more of the menu.
