I came here for lunch, and I was incredibly impressed with the service, ambience and tastiness of the food. It's a simple but airy and friendly place, with little touches of China all over. Our server was so sweet and attentive, and didn't even up charge my friend for fried rice. I ordered the Sweet and Sour chicken lunch combination, which was super tasty with just the right amount of flavor. I will definitely be back again, and I think I just found my new favorite Chinese place.
