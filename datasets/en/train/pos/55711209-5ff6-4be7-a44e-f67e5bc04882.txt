We visited Tempe this week dropping our son off at ASU.  A friend recommended we try this place for lunch.  It was not too far from our hotel.  

I loved this place!  It was nice to go to a restaurant away from the busy ASU campus area.  It was the first restaurant meal that we had that tasted like home cooking, and fantastic home cooking at that!  I had the Almond tuna sandwich and split pea soup.  It was delightful and I would go back again in a heartbeat whenever we are in that part of the world.  

Try the blackberry orange lemonade: so refreshing on a hot Arizona day.

Oh the service was very nice.  Everyone we interacted with was extremely courteous and friendly.  We also ended up purchasing a gift card to send to some of our local friends down in AZ.
