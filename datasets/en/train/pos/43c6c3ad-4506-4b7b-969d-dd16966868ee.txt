popped into L'Image studios at Ray and 101 frwy for a hair cut. Canvas Salon is one of the many little privately operated studios.  It looked clean and the other patrons looked like they were happy. I jumped in.
My findings are as follows,
Melissa Canedy is the BEST  colorist there and she also gives  a stellar and way above average haircut.
2 salon visits later my hair is back in incredible shape and the color is better than ever, I am advanced in age and certainly appreciate finding someone who knows what they are doing and cares about the long term condition of my hair.
I think I have found the grail or at least the best Chandler has to offer in this quaint salon. I make this claim because I have been EVERYWHERE!
Best colorist and best local haircut!
