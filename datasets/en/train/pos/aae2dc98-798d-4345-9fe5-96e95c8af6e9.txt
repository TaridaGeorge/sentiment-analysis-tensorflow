I first saw this on the Sunday Morning CBS news show and I put it on my bucket list. Glad I did. I was able to go there over the Thanksgiving vacation. 

What is great about it is:

1. Beautiful building and grounds - It's new!
2. You can take a trip around the world via the music instruments - a very innovative idea.
3. The hands on room is fun, even for me who has no musical training. 
4. I can only imagine if I was a musician how much fun it would be.
5. It's unique and educational
6. Last but not least - you don't feel like a criminal like in some museums where you are scrutinized and watched closely.
