we found that the food here was FANTASTIC and priced well too!   I must admit that i was not excited to go here since i do not do HOT/spicy food - but my husband does and we will now return as often as we can!  The menu has numerous things that are not too spicy for me and still taste GREAT!

There was a shrimp dish that was on their special that i can not remember the name of but it was WONDERFUL with a light batter and i have now had TWICE!!   I also enjoyed their Thai Ice Tea and Coffee and the desserts as well!
