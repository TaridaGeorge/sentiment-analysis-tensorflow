This is our favorite steak house in town period. We always have dinner in the bar and we love the cheezy steak house bar/karaoke live music they are playing. 
Try the Shrimp cocktail and the crab cocktail then Share a salad cause they are huge. 
I always get the bone in fillet which is to die for and they never mess it up. 
Key lime pie to finish of. We always get some side dishes eventhough it is a lot of food but it makes a great breakfast in the am.
