I am really surprised Yogis rated so low. The food is always fresh and the rolls are a great value. The girls that work the register could benefit from service training, but it's fast food. What do you expect? If you want good service, go to RA or Stingray. If I'm in a rush during the workday and don't want to go through a greasy drive thru, I can be found here!
