I LOVE Hula's! 

Hula's has such an amazing happy hour. I love their appetizers, especially the coconut shrimp rolls, potstickers, and calamari. The pulled pork sandwich is delicious as well. I'm the biggest fan of their signature cocktails. I'm not one for fruity drinks, but I really like theirs! Dr. Funk is a must-try, and I love how it's served in a Tiki glass. Blood Orange Martini is by far my favorite though. Such amazing flavors! Never have had a problem with service here. The only complaint I have would be about the size of the appetizers for the price. But that's why I stick to happy hour :)
