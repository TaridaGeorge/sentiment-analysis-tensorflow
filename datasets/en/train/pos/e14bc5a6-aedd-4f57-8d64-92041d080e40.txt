There is no need to make several stops for food, water, or supplement shopping after a workout because you can get it all at this cafe inside right inside of the gym! Justin, the owner is extremely friendly and provides his expert advice to anyone who needs help with choosing the right supplements.  There are so many different options for post or pre workout protein shakes and smoothies, and they are all made with quality ingredients too!  He also makes delicious salads, wraps, and sandwiches to-go that are always fresh, as he makes them daily, right at the cafe. Great place to get all of your needs covered after a workout at LA Fitness!
