During my honeymoon period with this city, which was about two weeks long, I was taken down to the gardens to see the butterfly exhibit. 

It was amazing.  They were releasing butterflies and large moths in a netted tent filled with flowers.  They would perch on various plants and dry their wings by fanning with them.  Hundreds or perhaps thousands of them were in this tent.  This many butterflies is really hard to describe as it is something that really needs to be seen.

Apart from this special occasion, they have cactus and arid plants of every kind.  If you're new to the desert, it is definitely worth the price of admission.

They also have special events that are supposed to be really wonderful.  Check the website and plan way ahead of time as reservations and tickets sell out fast.
