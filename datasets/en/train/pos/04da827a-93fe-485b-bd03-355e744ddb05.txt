Great ice cream.  I got the maple pecan and salted caramel.  

I recommend that you ask for a sample before you actually get a scoop.  I originally wanted to get the Real Mint Chip, but the girl behind the counter asked me if I wanted to taste it first.  I said yes, and thank god she asked me, because it was like the title said, made from Real Mint.
