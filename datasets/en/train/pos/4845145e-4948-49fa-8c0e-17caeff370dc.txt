Yes, I love Gateway community college. I first received college credits from here while I was in high school. The set buildings are indoors so if you are taking general classes the main building is an indoor facility, and that is where the cafeteria and main computer labs are. The health programs building is indoors as well so it is a much welcome relief in the summer here in sweltering Arizona. 

The teachers here are great, I received my Health Unit Coordinating certificate from here. All of the health programs are extensive but you learn a lot and there is a sense of community at this school. They offer a lot of lucrative programs here such as x-ray technician programs, nursing, respiratory ect.
