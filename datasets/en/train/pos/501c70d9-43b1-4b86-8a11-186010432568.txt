Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Beer, beer, beer. Mmm...

Our favorite place to watch sports, but a particularly good location to go on football Sundays. You can have breakfast, lunch, and dinner all in the same seat  and never have to move your head to see all the games. If you beat us there, try for the center high-top upstairs... you can see everything, including people watching the door. 

Now, this is all great but how about your three meals? Well, have yourself the beer-bread wrap for breakfast... Go with the Thai chicken wings for a lunch snack (actual real size wings), and fish-n-chips for dinner. Forget the calories, you look great. As for beer, I like the IPA with everything, but picking beer for your meal(s) is half the fun. 

See you at the center table.
