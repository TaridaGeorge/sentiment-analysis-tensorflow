I am profoundly saddened to hear that Sens will be closing 5/6/2012. Sens is the best place to eat in downtown Phoenix, in my opinion. Johnny Chu will be moving to a new location on Central and Thomas, opening in June '12. It will have some of the same familiar items that the Sens menu had but also some new ones to match his new fresh concept. He will be naming it Shochu House. Get down to Sens before it closes to enjoy some of the greatest food ever!! Thank you Sens for so many great years, amazing food, and kick ass Sake!!! I and Downtown Phoenix will miss you. See you at Shochu in June!!
