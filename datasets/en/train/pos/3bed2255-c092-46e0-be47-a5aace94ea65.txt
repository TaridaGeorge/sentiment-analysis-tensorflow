You can't beat the prices and the great food at Fiorella's! I love diving into a plate of authentic italian food served at this place.  But it's not just the food that keeps us coming back to Fiorella's it's the wine too! Fiorella herself hosts monthly wine tastings!  If you haven't been before put it on your list:) you won't be disappointed!
