best bruschetta ever!!! out of the many times that i've been, the ingredients are always fresh!

TO TRY: the bruschetta (i always get the pesto, roasted garlic, roasted artichoke and lastly the mozzarella, basil, etc), caprese salad is VERY good and i've tried the white chocolate macadamia cookie with ice cream on top! it was great!

NOT SO GOOD: i found the Mediterranean plate slightly disappointing, as I LOVE hummus and the taste of their hummus fell short and was rather salty for me. they're caesar salad was not one of my favorites either.

other than that, the atmosphere is great and i try to take at least a monthly trip to la bocca for my beloved bruschetta!

P.S. my most recent visit to La Bocca and a check-in on Yelp earned me a free cookie with ice cream on top :O)
