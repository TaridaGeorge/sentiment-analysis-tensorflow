I assumed that all these theatres are pretty much standard. 

After sitting in AMC Westgate chairs and getting back and butt aches, I felt a need to finally review theatres.  

At this Harkins chairs are comfy. Things are kept clean. They have that popcorn seasoning.  I haven't had a bag of stale popcorn yet.  Its overall clean and orderly. Employees are friendly and efficient.

I didn't realize how great it was till I attempted other theatres.
