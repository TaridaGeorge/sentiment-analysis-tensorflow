I'm such a friggin' idiot that I just recently discovered this joint. 

Hands down, my new favorite place to eat.  On our first visit, I tried the original 'auggie', which is essentially steak and potatoes.  It was fresh, hot, seasoned perfectly and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  A decent cut of meat and it went along perfectly with the red wine sauce pairing.  The wife had the chicken pot pie and loved it.  The proverbial cherry on the top was the dessert PB&J sangwhich.  Best.thing.ever.

Oh and they have a great beer menu.  This place rocks!
