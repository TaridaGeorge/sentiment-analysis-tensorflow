This is one of my favorite sandwich shops. The bread is always fresh, the meats and cheeses delicious. When you walk in, the staff greets you and is very attentive to your order. If you get a stamp card after 10 sandwiches you get a freebie.. Also it doesn't hurt that it's right across street from ASU and offers great sights.
