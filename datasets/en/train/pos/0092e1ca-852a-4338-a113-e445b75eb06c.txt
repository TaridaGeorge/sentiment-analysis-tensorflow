Sportsman's is the bomb. I was searching high and low for the limited edition Absolut New Orleans bottle. I had looked in several groceries in North Scottsdale and finally stopped into Sportsman's to see if they had it. They didn't, but a very nice gentleman offered to call his distributor. He soon called me back (that same day) and said that the distributor could get some for me if I wanted it. Hallelujah! I ordered two bottles, and the same gentleman called me a few days later to let me know it had arrived. He was so friendly, helpful and polite. The store has a good selection of wines as well - it's small but well stocked. Even better is that if they don't have what you need, chances are they will happily get it for you. I will definitely return to Sportsman's!
