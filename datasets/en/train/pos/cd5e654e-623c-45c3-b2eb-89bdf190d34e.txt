When I went to this store I did not expect the level of knowledge that the sales associate Dylan provided.  Even though he was young it was obvious by his physique he knew what he was talking about.  I did not feel like I was being over sold on any items which is refreshing for a nutritional supplement store. I have my degree in Nutrition and agreed with all of his recommendations. The service was excellent as well as the product knowledge and the store has a wide variety of inventory.
