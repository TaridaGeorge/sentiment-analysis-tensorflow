Wonderful service and delicious food!! Our waiter was very knowledgeable about each item we asked about, and our water glasses were always filled without asking. We ordered the lobster bisque, beet & goat cheese salad, rack of lamb, lobster w/basil pasta, pumpkin creme brulee, and chocolate hazelnut cake. Everything we ate was delicious and fresh and very carefully prepared. Loved the complimentary flourless chocolate cake at the end. Yum! This place is somewhat pricey ($32+ for entrees), but it's a great place for a special night out! Make sure to ask for the original room - very cozy!
