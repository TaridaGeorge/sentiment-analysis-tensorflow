The pizza is excellent. I had a thin crust pie with amazing sausage, sun dried tomatoes and cheese! This is a wonderful place to get great food and a cold beer.  They had Left Hand Milk Stout and 90 Shilling on tap which is always a plus.  Prices are very reasonable, and there are literally dozens of TVs to watch any game that is on...  The staff was very attentive and friendly.  Can't wait until it warms up a bit so I can sit out on their nice patio.
