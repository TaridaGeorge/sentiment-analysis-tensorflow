YUMMMMMMMMMM.  I frequent Calabria for my Italian Sandwich fix about once a month.  I get the Sicilian, which is a variety of Italian cold cuts in the the tastiest loaf of bread in town (sorry willow).  Maybe it's b/c it reminds me of the Italian Grocer (on a much smaller scale) that my Nonna used to take me to, but nonetheless-- this sandwich is DIVINE.  DeFalco's is good and has more of a larger Grocer selection but the bread at Calabria is much better tasting and the sandwich itself is more authentic tasting.  Prices run pretty high for a sandwich but it is huge and I suggest you just get oil and vinegar on it.  Worth every red cent. You gotta try it!
