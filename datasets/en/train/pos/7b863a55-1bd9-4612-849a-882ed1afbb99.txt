Yes, it is that good. Some people just don't get it. In my opinion anyone who says they've "had better" someplace in Phoenix is one of the people who don't get it. The more people that don't like it, the better, as far as I'm concerned. Why? Well...

The wait is never less than 45 minutes. The best plan is to get some friends and make a reservation, which they will take for parties of 6 or more (max 10 or 12). If you must go in a smaller group, go on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, and go early. Don't even try on a Friday or Saturday unless you're willing to get in line at 4pm (yes, that's an hour before they open).
