Seriously - as good as it gets - the food, atmo, and service couldn't have been better. Food: We started out the lamb sliders - 4 to an order - and were literally licking the plate clean!  The Fez burger was as promised - a foodgasm. Get the SPICY fries.  
Drinks: Featured that day was a pom and vodka delight for $3 - um, hello!
Atmo: We ate at the bar and it was trendy but relaxed at the same time. 
Service: I want to be friends with our bar tender, she was so happy and polite. With her upbeat attitude you could tell she wanted to be there. 

I WANT TO GO BACK!
