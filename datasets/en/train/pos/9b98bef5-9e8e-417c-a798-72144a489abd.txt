I took my daughter here for her 16th birthday so that she could get her ear cartilage pierced.  Why on Earth she would want to do this is beyond me.  But I figure there are worse things she could be piercing, so I obliged.  

The place is clean and the staff is great!  I like that they thoroughly explained everything to us, and I especially liked that the guy who pierced her ear made her feel comfortable, so much so that she didn't even cry during the piercing (although she did cry afterwards because she was happy).  

If I ever wanted to get anything on my body pierced (LOL, NOT!), I would definitely go back to HTC!
