I really like this place! I have had my eyebrows and upper lip waxed a few times in there. I recently let my eyebrows get a little wild and went in to get them shaped. The lady did a great job. Really changed my appearance in such a great way. I had a pedicure there before too and I loved it. I used to go to the nail salon on the NE corner of 59th and Olive and after several bad experiences I decided to find another salon. The people here are so nice and it's one of those salons where I actually feel comfortable walking in and being in there.
