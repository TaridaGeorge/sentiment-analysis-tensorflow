Great coffee with unlimited refills. I like the place a lot. The wifi is strong and i've never had a problem parking there. It's a good place to get work done and it's not a pick up joint or a high school hang like a lot of coffee shops are turning into. 

The food is also very good and seems to be served all day and night. I like it a lot and give it 5 stars. 

My only problem with it is the nearest bathroom is about a block away.
