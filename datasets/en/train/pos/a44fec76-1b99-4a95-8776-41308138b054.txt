I don't come to Dillard's expecting a Nordstron-like shopping experience. If I need to be pampered, I go to Nordy's. Dillards is where I come when I already know generally what I want, and I know no one is less expensive. IMO, Dillard's strength is their competitive pricing and their unbelievable sales. For years, I assumed this was only temporary, the Arkansas-based retailer will randomly go upscale. They've never done this and as a result, I still love shopping at a Dillard's.

This isn't to say the service is bad, it's just that store employees do not out-number customers and sometimes this can "feel" like it's the case in a Nordy's---especially in Men's suits.
