Like the other reviewers said - it is owned by Chuck, a man, which seems a little odd, but he was super friendly and very knowledgeable. He answered all my questions and definitely knows his stuff. He mentioned he has owned the store for 14 years and it came about after he was treated poorly, as a male, in a competitor's store. He also said he is now the last local pump rental/supply store left. Appears his motto is to help anyone that needs it and not to push his beliefs on breastfeeding or parenting. 

Even if this store is a little out of the way, it is worth it. I say make the effort to support our local businesses!  His prices are the same or better than the big names like Babies R Us. I will continue to shop here!
