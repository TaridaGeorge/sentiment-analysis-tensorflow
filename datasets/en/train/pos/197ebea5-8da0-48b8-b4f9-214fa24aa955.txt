Wow, I loved this place. Even though it was packed when we walked in, we were immediately greeted and then helped. The man who helped us didn't rush us and was very happy to answer all our questions. They were very thoughtful in explaining the different tire options and helping us determine what would work best for our needs (money and how we use the car). Then, when I picked up the car (45 minutes later!) he had put a free (used) spare in to replace my old one!
