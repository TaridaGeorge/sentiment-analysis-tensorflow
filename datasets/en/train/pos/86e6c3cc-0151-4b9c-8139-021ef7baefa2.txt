Finally rode down to Rita's one hot summer evening and I'm sure glad I did! I am in love with their gelati. Remember Mr. Misty floats from dairy queen? It's like that! Not only is the frozen custard delicious, but swedish fish flavored italian ice to go with it?! SOLD! I can't get enough of this place.
