The service was great and the atmosphere was fun.  We took an interviewee for my husband's company out and had a lovely time.  My husband thought it was a little pricey, but I think three people who were drinking, ordered an appetizer and had three entrees for just a little over $200 was pretty reasonable.  Especially given the unique entres and the amazing service.

I had the white truffle and black pepper scallops and they were amazing.  The pesto rice stuff they were on was sooooooo good.  Had to try the chocolate soufle after reading all the reviews on here and it was yummy, but by that time I was EXTREMELY full!  We'd do it again anytime.
