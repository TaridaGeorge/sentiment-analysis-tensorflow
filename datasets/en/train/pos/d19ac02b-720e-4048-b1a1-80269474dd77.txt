This place is always a must stop whenever I'm in Phoenix. I love panang curry, and theirs is my gold reference standard. Just thinking about it has me salivating and wishing I had smuggled a couple of bottles of it back home. I couldn't even begin to count the number of Thai places that I've eaten at, and only a handful come remotely close to doing it this well. Their garlic shrimp is outstanding as well. I need to stop thinking about this right now...
