I work right around the corner and have driven by Royal Taj a zillion time, but never went in for lunch the other day and WOW it was good.  For a lunch buffet...excellent and I am not a buffet person!!!  

And!  The staff is simply wonderful...If you guys read this, thank you again for your incredible food and kindness.
