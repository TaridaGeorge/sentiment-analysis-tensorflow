This place is a treat.  For me, personally, it has all the right ingredients:
- A cool owner who is really passionate about his place and who really wants to make something fun.
- Unique food that doesn't always work... but usually works beautifully.
- Cool quirks... like the red cream soda in the soda machine! (Ask the owner about it... he's got a story about how he first accidentally started using it, and it became the most popular soda).

Tasty food, fun, and something new.  I'm hoping that if they move soon, they won't move too far away!
