great vibe, great service, great food.

Appetizers; beet salad (didn't try it as I hate beets but everyone raved) butter lettuce salad (amazing) mac and cheese (pretty damn good) Brussels sprouts with bacon (yea, whatever, they still tasted like brussels sprouts to me - no thanks - but again everyone raved).  

Entrees; osso bucco (fab) green chili and pork stew (SO GOOD) short ribs (AHHmazing) and the burger (very delish, very)

Deserts; coconut cake and the creamsicle creme brûlée - both very very good. The creme brûlée was definitely reminiscent of an orange creamsicle and the presentation of the cake was cool.  

check this place out - you won't be sorry.
