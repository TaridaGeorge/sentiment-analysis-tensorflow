Excellent food and service. We never order wine or alcohol at high-end restaurants, as we are not drinkers. Fleming's is one of the only places that does not treat us poorly after discovering that our bill will only include food (hey, we're great tippers!).

The food is incredible, and the staff is very respectful, polite, and friendly. We just love coming back to Fleming's over and over again!
