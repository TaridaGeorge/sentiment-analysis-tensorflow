I recently went to Rice Paper with a friend. I'd never been there before, but thought about going in quite a few times.
We were greeted warmly by the staff and sat at the bar where we ordered wine and a few appetizer's...garlic noodles and spicy asian rolls. The noodles would have made my italian grandmother stand up and take notice. Good sized bowl of noodles mixed thoroughly with a sweet/hot garlic sauce. It's a good thing I'm single! The spicy asian rolls were full of asian sausage, imitation crab meat, siracha and jalapeno peppers wrapped in heaven! My only complaint was that there were only two!!
Now that I know what kind of fare Rice Paper has to offer, I'll be back to try their Pho...I'm sure I won't be disappointed!
