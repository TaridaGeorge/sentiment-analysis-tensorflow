A few days ago I was in the vicinity of Liberty Market and decided it to give it a shot. I ordered the Tower Burger with St. Pete's Blue Cheese and Bacon. The burger was juicy and tasty. The added blue cheese and bacon made it even more scrumptious. The burger was accompanied by fresh Kettle Chips and three distinctly different dipping sauces. 

What sets Liberty Market apart from other places with a great burger is the great service. All the employees were friendly and engaging. Definitely looking forward to enjoying more tasty meals there.

Oh and I don't forget to try the Ice Cream Sandwich. It consists of phenomenal vanilla ice cream sandwiched between Liberty's Chocolate Chip cookies then rolled in almonds, toffee and chocolate chips. It is out of this world.
