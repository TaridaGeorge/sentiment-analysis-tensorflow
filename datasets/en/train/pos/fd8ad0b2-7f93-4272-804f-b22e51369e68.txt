Me and my son love this park! We drive past 3 parks to get there, lol. We don't even have to ride the train every time, he loves just seeing it and waving to the passengers as they go by. Oh and the birthday parties here are great too. They have an air-conditioned rail car for the parties. So if your child's birthday is in July, like my son's is, you cans till do a party here!
