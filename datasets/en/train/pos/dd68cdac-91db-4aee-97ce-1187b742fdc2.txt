This is my FAVORITE sushi place in town...I LOVE the decore and the food is so so so good.  

I will recommend:  The shrimp Shumai, Scallop Dynamite, Rock Shrimp as food-for Sushi:  It's ALL good.  I believe my favorite though is the Morning Dew (a soy paper one) and the Cabo Blanco.

I really don't feel as though i have anything more to say except GO HERE!

Simple and to the Point.  Enjoy.
