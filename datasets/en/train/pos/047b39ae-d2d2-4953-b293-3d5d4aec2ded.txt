Olive heaven.  Great selection of olives, olive oils, and related products.  Take the tour if you go, it's definitely interesting and worthwhile.  High quality food sold on site.  I live nearby so I can stock up easily when needed.  My dirty vodka martinis have improved tremendously thanks to products from the Olive Mill.  Namely a mix I get there and the cream cheese stuffed olives.  Yummy.  I have also tried the jalapeno olives and they are very good.  Nice to add to Mexican food items.   

If you have any interest in olives it is worth your time to get here.  A nice place to spend a few hours and pick up some great products.
