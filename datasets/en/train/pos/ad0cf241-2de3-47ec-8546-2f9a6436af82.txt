Boulders is a great place to have excellent beers on tap. There are always new beers to try. There is also really good quality food! My boyfriend and I go at least once a week. The staff is very friendly and always attentive. Also, the parking is WAY better than Four Peaks. I would definitely recommend Boulders to anyone. Five stars, no doubt.
