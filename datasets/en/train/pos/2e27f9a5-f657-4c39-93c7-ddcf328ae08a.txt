yup, as good as it gets..great spot, great menu(something for everyone, great service.  I don't know what kind of mental problems Kelley P suffers from but I suspect she works at Houston's and realizes she'll be out of a job soon!  If anything this place Blows Houston's away. Sit out on the patio under the huge ass fan(yes that's its name) Have a drink, the staff is young and friendly.  Food is fresh, large portions at a very good price...what's not to like. $1 espresso and $2 cappuccinos I just couldn't make it to try the deserts sorry..
