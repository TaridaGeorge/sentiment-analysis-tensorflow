I GO HERE AT LEAST TWICE A WEEK! I absolutely love the people that work here--they are all so sweet and accommodating! They also know exactly what my friend and I order every visit (endless crunchy rolls)...I guess you could call us 'regulars'!  I like to keep it simple with the rolls, but last time I was there I tried the new mexico roll (AMAZING), jalapeno poppers (SO TASTY), and tatum roll (DELICIOUS)! I will most likely stop there after work because talking about it just isn't the same as actually tasting it!!
