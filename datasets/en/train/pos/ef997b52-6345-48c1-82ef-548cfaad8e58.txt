This is our favorite family place to go for dinner.  We love the food and the staff is so nice and friendly, we feel like we are at home.

We have yet to have a bad meal hear and we have tried many dishes.  The portions are huge and everything is cooked to order quickly and it is so yummy.  

Don't be alarmed if the restaurant looks empty, they do a ton of take out.  If you are in South Chandler and like Chinese food, you must dine here.
