We took our second trip to this establishment today and it was just as good as our first experience if not better.  Our first time at BLD we endulged in Monte Cristo's. Oh my goodness...so big and so, so tasty.  On our tip today I had planned to have the same thing but changed my mind at the last minute and ordered the Open faced meatloaf sandwich.  Thought I had died and gone to heaven.  This place is now on our 'MUST RETURN' (again & again) list.  Nice atmosphere and great wait staff.
