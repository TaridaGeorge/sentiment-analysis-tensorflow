I live in San Francisco. In this city, we see pretty much the full spectrum from Michelin starred to dive bars with deep character. Switch would be a great addition to any neighborhood here...I wish it were a bit closer. 

The food is very well prepared and presented, and the brunch menu is fantastic. I've had several different entr√©es here, and found the quality to be very consistent.

I love the hip vibe of the place; a refreshing change from pretty much anywhere else in the Phx area that I'm aware of. Acid jazz, impeccably clean and tastefully modern. Parking is easy, the patio is great when the weather permits and $1 mimosas? Sign me up!

Come here to get energized before your day or sip on mimosas and start off fully relaxed. You will not be disappointed.
