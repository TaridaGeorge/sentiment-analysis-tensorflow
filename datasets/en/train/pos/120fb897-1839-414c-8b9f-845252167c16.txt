this is a dope spot. it made me think downtown Phoenix doesn't suck so much. i've only been there once. they have a wide selection of beers, local brews and others. i drank a tasty ale out of Prescott...

i went for the Tuesday comedy night, which had a great lineup of comics. the space is roomy, both the theater and the lounge seating...

when i went, the artist-i forget his name, sorry-was painting some additions onto the mural that drapes the inside...it was pretty "hip" without any pretentiousness...there is nice, local art on the walls, and the service was top notch. midway through the night they knew my name and drink...

i will be going back both for the comedy night and the movies...check it out!
