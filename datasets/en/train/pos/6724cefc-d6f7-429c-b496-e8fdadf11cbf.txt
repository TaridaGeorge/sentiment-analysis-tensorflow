Any time I am in the mood for a delicious salad or a hot cup of soup (which is often), Paradise Bakery is the absolute first place I think about.  

The food is amazing (Caesar Salad - yum.  Chicken Noodle Soup - yum. Turkey Sandwich - double yum).  I also love (and hate) that you get a FREE cookie with your order.  Yes, that's right - Free.

The place is always clean and welcoming, and for someone that HATES to wait in line, I never mind here because they are quick, friendly, and efficient, and I can nibble on samples while I wait.

Basically, this place is my soup/salad/sandwich superstar!
