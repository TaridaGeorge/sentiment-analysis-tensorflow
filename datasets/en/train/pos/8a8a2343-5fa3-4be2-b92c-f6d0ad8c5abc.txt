Alchemy is a great place to take people you want to impress. Great views, great food and lots of good service. It is especally lovely when there is a full moon rising over the mountains.  Its a little expensive but you can catch happy hour wine and hordourves in the bar and balcony area. I like that they are so happy to see you, very gracious appreciative of their customers.
