I am not a wing person and I am OBSESSED with the wings as Teakwoods!!!  The Jess Jess wings are unbelievable and I could eat 100!  They truly have the BEST wings I have ever had and my boyfriend agrees and he definetly has had a lot of wings in his lifetime.  The manager/maybe owner? is amazing.  He is so friendly everytime we go in there and takes the time to chat with us.  One time our wings were taking a really long time and he ended up giving us a really good deal which wasn't necessary but definetly appreciated.  Also they have tots for a side which is something I have an awkward obsession for too.
