Thom has handled my business and personal taxes for 4 years.  I was a self preparer before.  I discovered I was doing a few things incorrectly, not keeping the right records on a few things, and lastly, throughout the year as I have questions come up, Thom knows the answer and I did not!  They work with small business, audit work, payroll (they offer the payroll service) and business owner return work.  I believe they handle accounting work as well but I have not used.  Overall, nothing to worry about if you work with them.  Trustworthy, safe, experienced.
