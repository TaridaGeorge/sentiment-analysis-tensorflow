Just took my cat here for his summer lion cut and I'm VERY impressed with the result. They really took their time with him.  He looks great and smells even better!!  It's far and away the best cut he's ever gotten - worth every penny!  I'm so happy to have found such a fantastic groomer and such a great local business to boot.  They'll definitely be seeing me again.
