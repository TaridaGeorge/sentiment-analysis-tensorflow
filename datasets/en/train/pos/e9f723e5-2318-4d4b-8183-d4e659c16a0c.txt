I absoulutely love this place!  I go there so often they know me by name and remember my order.  I always get the Honey Chicken Pita Lunch Combo.  It inclues rice and salad and a drink.  The "honey" is for honey mustard.  I know it's weird but the combo of honey mustard and tzatziki sauce tastes awesome with the chicken pita.  Not only is the food good, but it's fast!  I prefer going here to some of the more "authentic" Greek restuarants in town. I have nothing to say that's negative about this place.
