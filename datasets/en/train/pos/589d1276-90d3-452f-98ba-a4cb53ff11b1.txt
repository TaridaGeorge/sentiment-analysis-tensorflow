Nice surprise... we had breakfast here for mothers day. What a mellow atmosphere & the food was really great! I had the veggie eggs on  ciabatta. I love crunch so the texture of that bread in contrast with those yummy eggs were divine. And my eggs had eggplant! YUM!! My sis had the frenchtoast & my aunt had the Eggs Benedict. Nice size servings & the price can't be beat! We will all be here again.
