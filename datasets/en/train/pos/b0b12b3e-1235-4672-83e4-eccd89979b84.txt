Mill is a unique area and a great part of Tempe.  It has its own character, love it or hate it.  Some business plans thrive here, and some that seem like sure things fizzle and disappear.  Lots of good bars and shops.
Go here during the day to grab lunch or do your banking, or go for the nightlife, with Thursday through Saturday nights being the best.
