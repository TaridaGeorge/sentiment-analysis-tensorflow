Delicious homemade style Mexican food.  The menu is not extensive, but the food is delicious.  It looks like they are a fairly new business, but like the menu says, "the Best Carne Asada This Side of the Border!"  I think they are right. I had the Quesadilla with Carne Asada.  Everything looked fresh and the guacamole was very fresh and had a different but wonderful twist to it.
