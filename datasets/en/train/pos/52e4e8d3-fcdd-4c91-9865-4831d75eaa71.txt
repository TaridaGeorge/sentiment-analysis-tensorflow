Is it all in my mind that this Bath and Body Works is better than the one at Fashion Square?  Who knows, but I could spend a ton of money here if I'd let myself. 

They used to be just lotions, but now, you can fill up your entire bathroom cabinet with items from BBW.  They sell aromatherapy products, cleansers, toners, wrinkle cream, cosmetics and much more. 

My favorite lotions are the warm sugar vanilla, the classic cucumber melon and the strawberry something or other.  But you really can't go wrong with any of their lotions or body butters, and the great thing about them is that the scent is really long lasting.
