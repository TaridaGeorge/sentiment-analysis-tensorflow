The food is delicious!! If you want a great NY style pizza, great subs and wings this is your place. I eat here every time I'm in AZ.
The restaurant is under new ownership and you can sure tell. Its clean, there are TVs and great staff.  The owner "AL" is very friendly and is regularly at the restaurant.
