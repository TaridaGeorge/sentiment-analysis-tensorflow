I LOVED this place! I have been a vegetarian for over 7 years and this was my first time going to an all-vegetarian/vegan restaurant.  It's so amazing being able to order anything off of the menu.  The menu is full of different types of meat substitutes which is great, not just vegetables on a plate.  Everything was delicious, I can't wait to go back and try everything off of the menu.
