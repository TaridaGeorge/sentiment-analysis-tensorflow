This is my second time and my husband's first.  We went for lunch on a Sunday - not crowded at all. They offer the $5.00 glass of wine until 6:00.  This time around we had the cheese platter and prosciotto (sp) wrapped bread sticks (very clever!)

The difference between this place and Postino's is that they have more wine to offer and more of a menu. Don't get me wrong I really like Postinos too -  I simply would not compare the too.
