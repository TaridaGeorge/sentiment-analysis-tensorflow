Our waiter was fabbbbulous and made us feel very welcome and joked around a lot. I was on a quest to taste the chicken nachos of every restaurant I visited and these were quite unique.....about 8 individual chips individually adorned with toppings....like little mini pizzas...weird, but tasty. Good vibe in the bar where we had dinner too. I think for a chilis, it was a good experience, hence the 5 stars. But I always feel kinda dirty after I eat at chilis...
