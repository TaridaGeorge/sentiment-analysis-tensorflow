Yes five stars...well done Cibo...Weather you sit at small bar, inside, or great out front patio with it's well placed heat lamps I rank it above LGO in Arcadia which says something. Nestled Into a old style house in downtown Phoenix on a neighborhood street. Had one of the salads, pizza, and their berry/chocolate crepe for desert...all of it was porn food heaven...and a definite Top Ten place in Phoenix to take a date you really like. You may want to park a few blocks away to walk off the calories or hit up the dance floor at Chars has the Blues nearby.
