I have been going to Last Chance since I was a teenager.  It is a pretty awesome store.  You just have to be patience when you are there.  The people can be really crazy, if you go when they open.  They shirts prices are $2.95-$9.95 and Jeans prices are $9.95-$100.00. I always buy my jeans at Last Chance. :)  If you are ever in Phoenix you should head over to Last Chance.
