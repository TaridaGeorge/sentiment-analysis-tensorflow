I think the food here is pretty good.  I don't drink so I can't say anything for the beer. It can be pricey, so I use restaurant.com coupons, saves A LOT!
The service has been wonderful every time I go.  I have been about 8 times. I always end up tipping 30% or more because the service is that good.  Give it a shot.
