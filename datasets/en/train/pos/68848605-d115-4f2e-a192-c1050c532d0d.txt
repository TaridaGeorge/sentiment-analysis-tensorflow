Love this place, only lived in the Phoenix area for a year and have already been here at least ten times. First, if you are picking up family. They have two cell parking lots! You can park there and wait for your guest to call you when they fly in. Then just do a drive by to pick them up! Very easy!! With the way security is now, there is no reason to park in the parking lot and come inside to wait for who ever you are picking up. TSA check point is not that bad at all when you are flying out. I love this place!
