WOW! What a find! We just went vegan a month ago and this place was a phenomenal find - it gave my husband the will to survive :) vegan 'junkfood' - everything you can imagine in vegan format. There's no deprivation in sight here!

We had the Mongolian bowl, vegan chilli cheese fries, Texas poboy, BBQ chicken sandwich and mint Choc chip tsoynami for dessert. Amazing food, tasted like the 'real' thing, only this IS the real thing - real food. Wow!
