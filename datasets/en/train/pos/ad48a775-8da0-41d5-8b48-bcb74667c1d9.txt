Long live the free sample.

Never had any problems with parking, or waiting in line to pay even at the gas pumps...maybe I'm just lucky.  And where else can your tummy growl and get immediate satisfaction in the form of chocolate milk, tamales, pizza, and ravioli in teensy little cups that make you feel a little naughty when you take one?  As if you somehow need to sneak off into some dark corner of the store with your five items snickering to yourself as you gobble them up...

No need for lunch when you're shopping here!
