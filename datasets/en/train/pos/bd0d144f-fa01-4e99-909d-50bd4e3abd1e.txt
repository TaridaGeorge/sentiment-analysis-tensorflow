Stunning!!!  

7 course meal!  
Italian Truffles!  
Sunchokes!

Fresh dessert cook in a small organic pumpkin.  Loved it!!!!   

Didn't do any research and brought my 2 years old which was a bad idea, but the staff was cordial and accommodating.

Thank you.  I will be back, but I will leave my child at home this time.
