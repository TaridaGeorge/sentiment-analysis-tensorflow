If the opening of a new vegetarian restaurant is cause for me to celebrate, just imagine how happy I was after I tasted the food!

Jeremy and I checked Loving Hut on Friday for dinner.  It's a really cute place, spotlessly clean and the staff is very sweet and helpful with suggestions.

I had the steak sandwich (one of their chef's choice dishes) and it was great!  The steak itself was delicious, served on crusty french bread with crisp marinated veggies.  I had a beautiful orange-cranberry juice drink called the Orange Joy as well.  Mmmmm!

I can't wait to go back again this week and try something new.  Everything looks great and I'm so pleased to have a veggie place on the north side of town.
