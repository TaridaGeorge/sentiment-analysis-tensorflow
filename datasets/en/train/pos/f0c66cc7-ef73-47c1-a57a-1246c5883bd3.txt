I love Laura....  She introduced me to Cry Baby Eye Lashes and I love it.  I suggest to everyone who wears mascara to try this out.  Perfect for vacations or just any old day.  I get up in the morning and my eyelashes are all done.  out of the shower and my eyelashes are all done. swimming ect....  the best thing ever.
