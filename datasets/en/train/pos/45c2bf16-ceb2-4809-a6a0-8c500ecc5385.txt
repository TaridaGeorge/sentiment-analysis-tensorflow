Shimogamo has some of the best sushi I have ever eaten. My parents took me here for dinner and it was love at first bite. The prices are great and their happy hour prices are event better! The owners and staff are friendly and very accommodating. This is a great place to enjoy a nice relaxing night or to have a celebration. I give this place 5 Sushi out of 5!
