With the crazy electrical storms the past few days my AC unit exploded, yes really.  I wasn't sure what to do so from a recommendation from my sister I filled out the web form for Accurate Air on their website ( it was late when the explosion happened ). Their office staff called me promptly when they opened  in the morning and were very nice and sent George out right away.  George came and surveyed the damage and gave me a few options on repairing or replacing the exploded compressor.  I opted for a new AC unit.  They got one from the warehouse and had it installed the new morning in the morning all in about 24 hours.  I had really good luck with them.
