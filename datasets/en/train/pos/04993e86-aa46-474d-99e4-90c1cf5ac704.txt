I grew up in NY and moved here 17 years ago.  Carmine's is the BEST NY pizza place in the valley.  A lot of restaurants claim to make NY pizza, but they don't have anyone making the pizza that is actually from New York.  The owner/chef is from good old NY and he knows his stuff.  When I call to place an order, I can order "a pie" and they know what I'm talking about.  The pizza is amazing, with crust to die for, and the cannolis are oustanding!  Whenever I go back home to visit, my first stop is the hometown pizzeria because I miss it so much.  Now, I can skip the pizzeria in NY, because I have Carmine's in AZ.
