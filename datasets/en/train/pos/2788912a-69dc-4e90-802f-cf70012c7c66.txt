Dr. V and his staff are simply wonderful. 

I've been going for more than 5 years. I have real dread before any dental  procedure. I walk into the office anxious, and the staff have always done an amazing job of not letting me wait and fret. Dr. V spends time to explain things to me before we do anything. I feel their treatment has been incredibly respectful towards my fear of dentists
