Yummmmmm, I love this place, I will have to say though if you are looking for a typical Americanized Chinese restaurant this is not the place for you. While they do have an "American menu" they also have a huge traditional Chinese menu (you might need to ask for it) We are regulars here and while one of my favorite dishes here is their spicy mongolian beef, my fiance John and I also love the fish with black bean sauce, salted fish fried rice, tangerine beef, wonton soup, chicken corn chowder and their peking duck as well. They also have a lunch buffet during the week for $5.75 however we have never tried that as we know what we like to order when we stop in. Overall I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place when we craving good Chinese food!
