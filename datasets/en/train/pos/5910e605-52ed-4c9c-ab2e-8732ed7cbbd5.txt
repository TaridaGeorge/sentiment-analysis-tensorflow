I recently stayed here on a military trip to Luke afb.  The room was huge and very comfortable, the staff was superb and the facilities are top notch.  I will definitely come here again.  The only complaint is that the bartender was from New York and a Yankee fan.   Being from boston originally, the wigwam should make her change to a Red Sox fan.
