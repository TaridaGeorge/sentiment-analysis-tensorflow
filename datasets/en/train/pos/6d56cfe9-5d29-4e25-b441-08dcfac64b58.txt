Thanks to my trusty Yelp app on my new Android phone I found this gem after eating lunch today.  I'm not sure how I've never been to a place like this before, but it was pretty amazing.  I made a half red velvet, half chocolate creation and managed to resist the urge to drown it in toppings.  With a ton of unique flavors I'll be trying new things time and time again when I come back soon.
