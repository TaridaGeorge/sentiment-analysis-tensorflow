Great place to hang out and watch sports! Did I mention that the food is fantastic? Pizza and Calzones like my best friend Vito makes back in NY. I see some of the other comments about the lousy food or service and don't get it.  

I have been many times since moving here last summer and have not encountered an issue with staff or food. Just watched UFC 155 this past weekend and our server was great & hot as hell (Allisha) even though it was busy as hell. 32 oz. drafts for $5? all night long...are you kidding me?? I will be back this weekend for the playoffs for sure.
