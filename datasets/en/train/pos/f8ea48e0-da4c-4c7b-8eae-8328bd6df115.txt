I pass by this place daily as it is around the corner from my office. I was stuck alone one day, and was looking for a place that delivered, and remembered this place. So glad I did! I had the meatball pizza. Not sure why, but I did, and I loved it! The ingredients were fresh, and it tasted like pizza is supposed to taste? Yum! Don't let the location scare you (in a small strip center, between a Circle K & apartment complex), I think the delivery guy was the owner...Italian man,,,and very nice! I'll be back! :)
