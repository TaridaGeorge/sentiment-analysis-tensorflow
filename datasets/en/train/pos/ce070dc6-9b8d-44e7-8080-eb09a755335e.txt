I would just like to start off by saying that I love egg salad sandwiches. I have probably tried an egg salad sandwich anywhere that serves egg salad. Sacks is BY FAR, the BEST egg salad sandwich (entitled "The Dali") I have ever had in my life. I live in North Phoenix and I will literally drive many miles just to eat at Sacks. On top of the wonderful menu, whenever you order a sandwich from them, the meal comes with a little chocolate chip cookie, which is amazing all in itself. If you like their cookies, you can purchase the cookie dough. They also make other delicious dessert bars and salads that are for sale as well. I have been eating here for at least 14 years, and I hope they NEVER go away!
