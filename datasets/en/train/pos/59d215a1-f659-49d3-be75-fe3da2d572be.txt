After reading some of the reviews here and on Flyertalk, I was fearful that the Biltmore had really gone downhill. We stayed last weekend, and I have to report that it is still as wonderful as always. Very pleasant service, friendly staff. I asked to be in the Villa area and was asked which section! Love the Frank Lloyd Wright architecture. We'll b back.
