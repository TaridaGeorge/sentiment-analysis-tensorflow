We have been to the art museum many times over the years, it always gets better.

The current cowboy exhibit is as usual good, even though it is not my cup of tea. One good thing, I saw an artist name that I recognize as being on one of our pieces at home. The difference between ours and the pieces in the museum is ours has no cowboys in it, just animals. But we will have to investigate. 

The exhibit we went to see for the most part was, Extending the Runway Tatiana Sorokko Style. It did not disappoint at all.

Of course we also enjoyed the rest of the exhibits and Phoenix should be very happy with this venue.
