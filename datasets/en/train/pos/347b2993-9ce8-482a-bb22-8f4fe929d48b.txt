Ate there today for the second time - a surprise lunch with hubby.  This is the kind of place I wish Tempe had more of - simple, quality good food, friendly owner and staff, great music, fresh squeezed OJ - the only way I like it, and those brown buttered scones were crazy good - only a taste had I.  The latte was excellent too. Highly recommend for a casual time with self or friends.
