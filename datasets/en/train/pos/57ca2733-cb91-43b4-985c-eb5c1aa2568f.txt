This is an Old School Chinese restaurant for sure. It has remained the same for over 20 years! The Moo Shu Pork is Awesome. I like it without the plum sauce. I always crack up when I hear about the "Flaming Platter" but it very good. This is not the best Chinese Restaurant out there I am sure, but it is very dam good. The service is always very good, and the price is very affordable.
