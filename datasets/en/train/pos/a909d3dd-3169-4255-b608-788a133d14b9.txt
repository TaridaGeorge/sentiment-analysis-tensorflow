I am a HUGE fan of the recent T4 restaurant overhaul, and LGO is one of my favorite additions.  I grabbed dinner here before a flight last week and decided on the chickpea lettuce wraps.  My meal cost around $8 and came with two healthy and fresh wraps filled with a chickpea salad, sundried tomatoes, cucumbers and avocado slices.  Other menu options include creative salads (like the shredded kale and quinoa), fresh fruit and healthy sandwiches.  

Service was both expeditious and friendly, which was a nice change from the typical surly attitude you get at airport establishments.

In my mind, this is "as good as it gets" at the airport - 5 stars!
