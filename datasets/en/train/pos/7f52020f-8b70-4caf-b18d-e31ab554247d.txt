Top notch diner fare, best of it's kind.  Burgers were fast, juicy and tasty!  I had a double burger, double cheese, with bacon and fries.  By the time I got my drink filled, the order was up.  Great service considering it was the lunch rush.  Tough to beat that!  Fries were crispy and delicious.  Restaurant was sparkling clean.  Service was immediate and friendly.  I will be back (not too often, I'm on a diet! :-)
