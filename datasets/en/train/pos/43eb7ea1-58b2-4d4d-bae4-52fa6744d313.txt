Conveniently located on Higley and Ray in Gilbert, The Coffee Shop has the best omelettes ever. I ususally get something like the Ham and Cheddar omelette.  The potatoes that come on the side are awesom and add some fresh oj and you are set.  It will cost you about $9 but it is worth it.  I go there once a week on Fridays to work and enjoy breakfast.  I will be Friday if you want to swing by and say hi Facebook friends!!
