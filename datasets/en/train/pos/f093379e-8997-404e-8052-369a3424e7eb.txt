So I came in for a quick beer before heading home. After my beer I decided I wanted a grey goose dirty martini with bleu cheese stuffed olives. I should know better right?  

I asked the bartender if there was any chance they had bleu cheese stuffed olives because I really wanted a martini with them.  She said no. The frown on my face must have put her into service mode because she said, "we have blue cheese crumbles.". I tiled my head to the side and raised my eyebrows and then...she said "I guess I could stuff some for you.". I smiled and off she went to the kitchen after grabbing 3 large olives from the bar. 

Service is everything. Especially when places are willing to go above and beyond for an "off the menu" item. 

Bravo Azööls, Bravo.
