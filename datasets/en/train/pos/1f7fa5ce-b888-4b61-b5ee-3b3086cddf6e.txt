Bookmans is a great place to go, even if you just want to grab some coffee. My favorite part of the store is wandering through the tall shelves full of books; the smell reminds me of being in the library in my hometown. There is an entire section dedicated to electronics, so if you're looking for a few Nintendo 64 games or even a Wii be sure to check Bookmans before heading to Walmart. There are chairs and couches placed all over the store so I like to grab a few interesting looking books, find a secluded spot and read there. Bookmans also has an extensive video and music section, as well as WiFi so you can bring your lappy or iPad and browse the web while you have some coffee or tea.
