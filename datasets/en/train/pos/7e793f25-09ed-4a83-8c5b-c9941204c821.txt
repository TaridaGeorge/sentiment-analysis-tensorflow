We came here last night for my girlfriends Birthday.Lots of parking as well, we got one front and center.  It was really good.
First time at this location.        We were greeted right away and given a very nice booth for 3. For a starter we got the fried Calamri,excellent!  WIne was good as well as the martini's//. 
Dinner was fabulous,we all 3 got a different steak and all 3 were cooked perfect and tasted great!  The bread could be better but, they do use real butter.
Our waiter was Matt and he explanied all things on the menu,another plus. We had a great evening. Can't wait to go back.
