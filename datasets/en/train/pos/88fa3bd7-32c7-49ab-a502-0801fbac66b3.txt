This is located inside the Scottsdale Fashion Square Mall. I came at  8pm and there were still a fair amount of cupcake flavors left.

I ordered 3 (chocolate, peppermint and a strawberry) different flavors. But they have other flavors like Orange and Key Lime... etc. I wish they had the S'mores cupcakes but they were out. 

The cupcakes are fairly big. I personally thought the frosting-cake proportions were a little off; however I am biased. I'm not a huge frosting person. 

Frosting was smooth and buttery and the cake was fairly moist. 

The prices for one cupcake is less than $4.
