I was in town visiting from California, where we have yogurt shops everywhere and I thought Mojo was great!  They have a large selection of yogurt.  The only thing I'd change there is the flashing display above the machines.  It switches between an ad for yogurt or something like that and the flavor of the machine below.  I'd like to just see the flavor instead.  The fruit toppings were good too, very fresh!  I loved that they had multiple flavors of mochi (the best topping with fruit).  

The service was great and the place was very clean.  The next time I'm in Scottsdale, I'll be coming back.  

I would highly recommend it to you.  Enjoy!
