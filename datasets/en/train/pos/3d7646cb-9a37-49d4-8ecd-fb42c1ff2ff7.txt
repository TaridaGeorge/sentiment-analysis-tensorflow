So I'm the future duchess of Chandler Costco but because we were out in Scottsdale area this location deserved a visit. :) Compared to other locations this Costco definitely takes it up a notch. For one, their booze selection is much bigger here than in Chandler. There were more sofas to sit on and a more varied selection of seafood as well. And I think it's very convenient there's  a car wash on site! Go Scottsdale Costco!
