Sauce is my kind of place.  Great, inexpensive food, casual yet trendy atmosphere, perfect location.  

Located right by Urban Outfitters and Olive and Ivy at the Scottsdale Waterfront, I like Sauce as a pre or post shopping bonanza meal.  I always have the same thing: the mozzarella and tomato salad (which you should know is mostly greens with chucks of each, drizzled in balsamic), and the artichoke and portabella pizza.  This is a huge meal so I always have leftovers which make for the perfect 2am after-bar treat.  

If youre feeling particularly saucey, you can have yourself a glass of wine as well.
