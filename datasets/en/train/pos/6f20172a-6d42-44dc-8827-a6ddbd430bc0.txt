We came back last Friday night, on a very busy night to see if there is any improvement. WOW! We were blown away. Our waitress was amazing, very attentive and sweet, the food was amazing, we felt totally taken care of and there was nothing, I mean NOTHING to complain about! Thank you Delux for proving that your reputation has a basis. We will be back and we will recommend you to others.
