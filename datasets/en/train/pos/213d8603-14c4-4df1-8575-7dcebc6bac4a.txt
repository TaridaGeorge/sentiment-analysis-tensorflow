This place actually makes grocery shopping a pleasure.  The store is very clean, inviting, and well arranged.  A wide selection, maybe too much, of foods.  Crowd control is decent, compared to the Fry's down the road.  It is a little bit more $$$ than Fry's, but I think it is well worth it.  My produce and meat is always top notch.
