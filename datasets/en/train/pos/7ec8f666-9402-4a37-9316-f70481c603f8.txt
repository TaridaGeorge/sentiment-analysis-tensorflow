There is no other choice when it.comes to Chinese food. I and my family have been coming here for 17 years and there food is the same as it was from day one. The restaurant is family owned and they truely love owning this restaurant. I have tried almost everything on this menu and can never say the dish was delish! Every person I have brought here over the years have made this a.regular spot of choice. I have even moved very far from from the restaurant and still will call in the order and carry it out on my way home. Best egg drop I have ever had. If you love authentic Chinese food then this is the place to come hands down. Don't let the exterior fool you its a hidden gem!!!!
