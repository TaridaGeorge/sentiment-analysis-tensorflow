As airports go and I've seen a lot of them, this is one of the best if you are forced to hang around for few hours. First, I wasn't gouged when buying Arizona logo stuff for the friends and family, second, I had some decent chicken teriyaki at a place called Yoshis in the C terminal and finally, there were these tall tables with padded stools with outlets where I was able to use my laptop while waiting for my flight. I only wish SFO or Oakland where I fly out of were this well thought out.
