I checked this place out originally based on the reviews that I had seen here on Yelp and I must agree that the food here is pretty good.      I'm very picky when it comes to BBQ and its been difficult at times to find reliable, good-tasting BBQ in Phoenix but Pork on a Fork definitely delivers in that regard.

    The pulled pork sandwich I had was terrific, soft, very flavorful, enjoyed it tremendously and the cole slaw and beans were both on-point.     All in all I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back here many more times in the future.
