I had a blast there last Saturday night. I had a big party there and had bottle service. The staff did whatever I needed to make me happy and were very friendly. After the bottles were gone I went to the bar and Dave was not only fast at making my drinks but he really gave me great customer service and was nice to me even when I ordered complicated drinks lol. I will be back again and again. Lots of good looking women as well. :)
