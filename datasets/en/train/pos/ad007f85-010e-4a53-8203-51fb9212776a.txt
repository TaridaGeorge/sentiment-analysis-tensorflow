You go into Four Peaks, and everybody there is your friend. On a busy Friday night, this is the weekend warm-up to beat them all. It's loud, it's packed, it's fun. 

I'll usually mix up brews, but I always come back to my old friend... Kilt Lifter (appropriately named, I would say!).  Goes great with just about anything, but i enjoy the Spinach Artichoke Dip, Shrimp & Goat Cheese Bruschetta, and their Calamari is the best I've tried anywhere. Definitely worth stopping in.
