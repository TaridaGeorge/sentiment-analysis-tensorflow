Well done! Such a fun weekend. So much to see and do, such great weather, so many great performances, well organized, lots of great volunteers, and a fun celebration of the diverse and dynamic gay community in Phoenix. (I even got to be in the parade!) 

Phoenix Pride kicks off the summer months of pride festivals for me, and this was a great way to start. 

2010 Phoenix Pride was a total success. Can't wait for next year!
