Rosies makes me want to live downtown.  What a great place! It's cosy, comfortable and a great time.  

The food is pretty authentic, and they have a nice, robust menu.  The beer selections are good, and the service has always been fast and friendly.  

It might get a bit noisy at peak times, but it just seems to fit the atmosphere.  I would be a regular here if I was not always in the East Valley.
