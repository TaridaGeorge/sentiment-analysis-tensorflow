Fantastic service.  Very knowledgeable and approachable.  Newbie friendly! Will make sure you get the BEST helmet for you not the most expensive.  Have other gear as well as helmets (jackets, gloves).  Can special order with one/two day delivery.  Great atmosphere in the store because its family owned.  Highly recommended.
