It's a must. Food was delicious, fresh and prices were very reasonable!! Highly recommend going here!!! We had the baked cheese, the salad with Bacon and apples, and both were beyond amazing. For entrees, I had the mahi mahi over couscous and my boyfriend had the pot roast over sweet corn polenta. He said it was the best pot roast he has had. Veggies were fresh and again delicious.
