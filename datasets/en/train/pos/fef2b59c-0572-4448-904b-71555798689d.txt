Both times I've been here have been long waits, but the combination of a unique atmosphere and good food have always been worth it. Definitely worth your time-I've had both the Fontiga Burger and BBQ Chicken Pizza.

FYI, the BBQ here comes from Joe's Real BBQ-still good, but you may want to order something unique to the grill.
