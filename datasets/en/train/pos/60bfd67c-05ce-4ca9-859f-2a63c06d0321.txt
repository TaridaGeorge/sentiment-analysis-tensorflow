I want to live here and just eat nothing but Fresh & Easy things. This is possibly the best place ever for single people, however always WATCH your expiration dates! Really great vegetable packages to steam in the microwave - suprised at how reasonable they were, and they taste better in Trader Joe's...probably due to the fact that they include butter in the package. 

This parking lot is a huge pain in the ass, really close spaces and a pain to get in and out of, but it's worth it. Don't go right at noon or 5pm, Camelback is a pain.
