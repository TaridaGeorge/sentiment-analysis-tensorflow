Amazing, tasty, healthy, filling food. My husband and I came here routinely for weekend brunch. His favorite was the California club, mine was the early bird protein burger (black bean and quinoa). Parking can be a pain, seating can be limited, and their tiny restroom is accessible outside on the backside of their kitchen... Kinda like a gas station. All that being said, totally worth it.
