I had brunch at St Francis today . From the moment i stepped in , the who restaurant smelled like good food. I had the gravy biscuit topped with a fried egg. The gravy was not the typical heavy gravy, it was made with the perfect b√©chamel savory sauce with homemade sausage . This seriously the  best biscuits and gravy  I have ever had. I also had a yummy fresh Bloody Mary. If I had my i-pad with me I would have hung out until dinner.  I highly recommend it , I will for sure be back to try lunch and dinner, several times.
