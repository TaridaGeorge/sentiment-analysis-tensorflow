I had my son's wedding dinner (small party) at Fresh Wasabi. We were greeted outside the restaurant by the owner. Our server was very sweet and attentive. The food was excellent as well. It's a very quaint family like atmosphere. My youngest son insists we go there and only there for sushi. He & I had dinner a there a couple weeks ago, nothing has changed. The excellent food and service were not a fluke. I am so excited I found this place in November. I plan on becoming one of their many regulars although I've only been there twice. I will have my son's 14th birthday dinner at Fresh Wasabi per his request. I highly recommend this place. I am a huge sushi fan, food and service like Fresh Wasabi provides is hard to find.
