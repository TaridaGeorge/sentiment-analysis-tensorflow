The staff at this Trader Joe's is fantastic! I stop often for quick trips and I always get great tips while I am in there. As a single girl that cooks meals for one, I can take all the tips I can get! Also, a thing I just learned was that if you are moving, they will set boxes aside for you. Just call the day before and they get 8 am shipments and will have a cart with your name on it when you arrive and load up your car. Nothing to do with groceries, but a great concept to reuse and is hassle free!
