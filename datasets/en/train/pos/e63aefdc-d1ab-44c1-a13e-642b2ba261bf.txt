Wife and I had the large burgers. Many options as to toppings, whole grain bun is also an option. Store is spotless and staff is young and cheerful. I had sw style w/guacamole and jalapeno, spouse chose classic american cheeseburger. We ordered sweet potato fries to split. They are awesome and the single portion was large enough for 2 1/2 people. We were advised (in advance) that burgers would be pink inside, which we prefer. If you want yours well done, ask. You order at counter, and the food is brought to your booth. This was our second visit, and we would return. Store is nnear movies in food are of Tempe marketplace, so expect to spend some time looking for a spot.
