this is the tiniest little store but i love it! the owner is the nicest lady ever!! i love to support these little stores. she's a mom herself, and you can just tell she enjoys maintaining and is very proud of this store. they have great prices on resale items and carry a few new items here and there. i found a mobile i've been eyeing for a while. it was less than half the price of a new one and in wonderful condition!!! i was so thrilled. this will be a common stop for me!
