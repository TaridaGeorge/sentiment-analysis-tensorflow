You get what you pay for, and at Simply Bread, it's worth the price. I recommend the challah and the fabulous macaroons. I bought a macaroon on a whim one morning after hiking at South Mountain and almost turned the car around to buy 100 more when I bit into it on the way home.

My only saving grace (for my wallet and my waist) is that I'm always at work during their business hours.
