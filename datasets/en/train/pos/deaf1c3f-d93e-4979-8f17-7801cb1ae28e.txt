The best time to go to Sapporo is in the summer, when they have their all day every day happy hour! Delicious food - try the skewers - and drinks ( I drink wine but try the bellinis!), all in a fun upbeat atmosphere. Love the shuttle...they will pick you up and drop you off within a given radius at no charge. What a service!
