People who think this isn't authentic has never been to Mexico City. I had the #15. The combination of beef, onion, bacon & green peppers is delicious & worth the price of the dish by itself. My mother ordered the chicken soup, & they certainly didn't skimp on the chicken. It was tasty. The restaurant was busy, but server Luis was constantly attentive, great service & great suggestions of what to order. We'll definitely be back.
