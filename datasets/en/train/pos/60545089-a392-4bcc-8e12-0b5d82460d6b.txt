Melanie Newton was amazing! She went above and beyond in every possible way and was so friendly and accommodating which, as a bride, was so relieving. She provided great insight, recommended vendors and made sure my day went as smoothly as possible. I truly adored her and can't say enough great things about her, her staff and the Arizona Grand Resort as a wedding location - plus our honeymoon suite was hands-down the best accommodations my husband and I have had to date.
