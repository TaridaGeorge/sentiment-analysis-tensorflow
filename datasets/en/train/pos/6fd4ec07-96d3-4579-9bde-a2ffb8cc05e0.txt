FINALLY, some good Chinese delivery food in AZ! My husband and I tried the general tso's chicken combo plates and they were fabulous. Large chunks of all white meat chicken, lightly fried, and with a perfect sauce that has a kick. We got veggies added in with no extra cost. The plates came with an egg roll, crab puff and fried rice. The rice and egg roll were good....not great...but did the job. I am super picky about crab rangoons and this one was awesome. Great cream cheese flavor with actual crab! No onions and a great cream cheese/dough balance. Slightly sweet. We are thrilled to have such a yummy Chinese restaurant right down the street...and they actually deliver. Would highly recommend.
