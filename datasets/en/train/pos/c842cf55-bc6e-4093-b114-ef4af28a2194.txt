I am so happy we chose this place for January Yelp Office Hours today... we had a great turnout, but better than that, I found my new favorite Old Town area coffee shop!

I started out with a hot peppermint tea, and a few hours later, I chose a breakfast sandwich for lunch - let me tell you... it was d'lish!  Kyle and Chad - great name for your place, and thanks for the hospitality also.  

I can't wait for my next visit as I hear the dirty chai (chai tea latte with espresso shots) and the breakfast buzz shake are winning combinations as well.  I love that there are so many healthy options on the menu to choose from.  Not to mention outdoor seating, good vibe/music inside, and a drive-thru - how cool is that?!
