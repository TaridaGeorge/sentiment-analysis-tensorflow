I love this place! I decided to write this review after my last visit there because I have never had such great service in my life! My friend and I go here all the time but this was the best experience ever. Ever notice how your whole experience at a place can change just with some great service? Our waiter came to check on us multiple times while we took forever to order because we are the most indecisive people ever. He answered all of my questions and helped me to narrow down what I wanted. He brought the food fast, gave us refills before we were even half way done with our drinks and offered to bring us to go drinks. He was very courteous and attentive. The hummus is awesome and the black bean burger special is to die for!
