I drive all the way here just to grocery shop and its nowhere near my house. i actually live right by "hot safeway" and choose to drive all the way here. the food is cheap and the staff is very very friendly. i always enjoy my shopping experiences. 

if trader joe's was a person i love it so much id probably marry it.
