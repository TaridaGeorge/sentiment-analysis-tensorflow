Having unfortunately moved away from the Valley a few years ago, my first and only experience at SR was last week.  OMFG I am in love!  My girlfriend took me here literally first thing after picking me up from Sky Harbor.  Hell, they weren't even open yet, but the lovely lady (my friend said one of the owners?) let us in and served us right away anyways.  

I had (don't laugh) the basil lime sorbet, pineapple sorbet, watermelon sorbet, and the mango margarita (I think that's the name).  SOOOOOO good, with the added benefit I can pretend it was a healthy "lunch" since they are fruit sorbets, not ice cream.

Side Note: (For anyone who's been to, and raved about Jeni's in Columbus, OH, you have NOT yet tasted amazing sorbet)
