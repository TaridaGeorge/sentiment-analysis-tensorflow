Going to Camelview is definitely a positive way to spend an evening.  Its retro (because it's old) neon lights and blue building exterior make me want to put on a casual dress, grab a clutch, and have a date at the movies.  I would like it if they sometimes had later showings, but other than that it's a great place to go see a film that maybe isn't out (yet or ever) in other theaters around the valley.

On the walls are painted murals of award winning or iconic movies (like a big shot of the classic scene from The Graduate with Dustin Hoffman).

The actual theaters aren't stadium style, but it's never been a problem for me or anyone else I've gone with to see the screen, even when it's crowded.
