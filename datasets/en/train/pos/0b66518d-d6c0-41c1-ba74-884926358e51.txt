My dear love and I came here for dinner the other day-me for the maybe 1000th time and her for the first time. 

We had an excellent meal-perhaps one of the best one could hope for in Phoenix. 

Durants is old school-pleather booths, red flocked wall paper, formal waiters and waitresses. Very romantic and comfortable.

Tip-you enter through the kitchen, NOT through the front door. Once inside, the staff seats you, brings you cocktails, and all is well.

We sat in the bar (Tip-table 51 or 52 are the best). We had steak, Caesar Salad, stuffed baked potato and a tomato salad. An old school meal, over the top good, served perfectly not hurried and not too slow. Dining perfection.

All in all a top dining experience. My dear love enjoyed it and as a consequence we will be back.
