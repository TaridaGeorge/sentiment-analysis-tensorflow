This place is definitely on my top 5 list for having a delicious meal out. After eating here a few times I didn't think it could get any better but each time we discover better foods on the menu. Anything that they cook on the rotisserie out back tastes awesome and the drink list is nothing to laugh at with only the best bartenders with top shelf liquors! Bandera also can cater your events or call for take out but make sure that you call ahead since everything is prepared fresh and you don't want them to run out ; ) Two of my favorite foods here are the mac and cheese and the chicken and ribs dish which gives you a taste of both worlds! Bandera is a must try for everyone that appreciates food!
