I have read some of the reviews and being a bar owner I can tell you this place rocks for beer selection. The pizza is very good but is pricey. $7.00 beers are not expensive if you know what a barrel of micro costs. I go there once a week and have not been disappointed and I highly recommend Rouge Chocolate Stout while waiting on your pizza. I normally drink 2 twenty ouncers and the pie is ready. Yea pricey but you get what you pay for.
