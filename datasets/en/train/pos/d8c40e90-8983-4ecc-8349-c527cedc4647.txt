We saw the Legend of Zelda- Symphony of the Goddesses here. The Orpheum was the perfect venue for this concert, since the charming atmosphere reminded me of some of the scenery from the Legend of Zelda games.  Seats are comfortable, and the rows are elevated enough that you can still get a good view of the stage from farther away.
