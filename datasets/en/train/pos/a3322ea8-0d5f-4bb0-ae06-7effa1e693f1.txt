I've been taking my clothes to this family-owned shop for better part of 15 years. They're very conscientious about taking good care of your clothes and they have always been responsive to my requests. For example, I don't like when my stuff smells like the dry cleaning chemicals, so they make sure things get aired out before zipping them into my handy dandy green re-usable garment bags (which they also provide at no cost).

I also appreciate that they work very hard to keep up with technology and stay ahead of environmental issues. 

Their on-site alterations service is pretty good, as well. And, they get bonus points for remembering their customers' names.

They aren't cheap but you get what you pay for - and with Bell that includes quality and good customer service.
