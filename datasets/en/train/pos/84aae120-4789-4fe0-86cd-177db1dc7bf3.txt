We arrived on a Friday night 10 minutes after the doors opened, the place was already PACKED! We waited for a minute before we were sat. The waitress took our drink orders and we were ready to order by the time she came back. 

Our sushi took maybe 10 minutes before it was in front of us, and it was some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix. I've been all over the valley and sushi is hit or miss. Definitely a hit here. 

The staff was great, service was excellent, and the food was spectacular. We will most definitely be coming back again. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.
