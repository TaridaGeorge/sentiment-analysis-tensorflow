Came here with a restaurant.com coupon, so worth it!We started off with delicious barbecue sliders, I had the Cajun combination of chicken jambalaya, chicken and sausage gumbo and an AMAZING crawfish andouille. My boyfriend tried the catfish po-boy and we finished it off with a bourbon sundae. The food was delicious, the service was great and they had decent live music. I will be going back soon!
