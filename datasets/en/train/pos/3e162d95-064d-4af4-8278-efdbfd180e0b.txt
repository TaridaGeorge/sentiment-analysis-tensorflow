We ate a late lunch here on Tuesday. Arrived around 2:30pm and were seated immediately. My wife had the salmon lunch special with mashed potatoes and a small green salad. It was all delicious. I had the BLT Salad and it was also very good. Service was good as well. For dessert my wife had the standard cheesecake and I had the carrot cake. They were both incredible. This is a wonderful place to eat with good food, a good atmosphere, good service and great desserts.
