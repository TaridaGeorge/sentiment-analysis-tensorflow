First of all I am not a huge Sushi fan or even close to a connoisseur - however, on occasion the mood does strike. 

I really enjoyed this place, the atmosphere is nice yet casual, and the staff are really friendly. The Sushi is fresh, served in larger-than-standard portions and AMAZINGLY inexpensive.

We had 4 orders of Sushi and split a 24oz beer (forgot the name, but that was some damn good beer) all for about $20.

Definitely a spot I will frequent.
