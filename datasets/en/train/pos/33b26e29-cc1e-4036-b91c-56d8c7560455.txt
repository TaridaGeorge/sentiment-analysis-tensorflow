Love this store!  A great place to buy local for one thing, and be ecstatic with all the choices of tea and gifts for anyone!   I have bought tea for myself, but went in for some to send to a soldier in Afghanistan, and as soon as the owner knew what I was doing, she asked for his address and said she would adopt him and his company and send out a box of tea and goodies!  What a wonderful surprise!!  I can't recommend any one tea in particular because the six I have so far tried have been awesome!
