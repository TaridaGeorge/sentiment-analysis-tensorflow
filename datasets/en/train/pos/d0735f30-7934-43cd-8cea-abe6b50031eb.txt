A family run business that even brings its dogs to work sometimes.

They even take off a week or two in the summer for vacation and close the doors, showing money isn't everything to them and if they can't be there to run it themselves, they'd rather close the shop temporarily. 

I got an incredible price on a timing belt and water pump some years back. PA is also open on Saturdays and can do alignments (which many mechanics sub out).

Bizarre location and parking is a bit cumbersome. You could probably make the long walk to Wal-Mart or hop a bus through Guadalupe to 
Mills Mall if your vehicle's going to be a while. 

Walking distance from Phase 54 too. I guess that does you no good though unless this place is open late at night.
