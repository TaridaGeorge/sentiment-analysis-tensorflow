They have some really great flat bread sandwiches! They should advertise it. I had the ham and cheese flat bread sandwich yummy! 

My friend had the egg white and turkey sausage flat bread and said it was delish. Who knew they had these healthy options at DD. I sure didn't I used to go for the munchkins. Now I am going for the flat bread sammies! Their iced tea is pretty good too! I know many people rave about the coffee. I personally have never had it. Just not a big coffee drinker. 

Any who check out the DD this one rocks!
