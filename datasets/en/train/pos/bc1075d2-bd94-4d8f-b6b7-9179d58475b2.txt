Fo-yeah!! This place rocks!
The first time we went there was based on Yelp reviews and we weren't disappointed. The egg rolls eaten wrapped in mint and cilantro and dipped in fish sauce simply blew us away. I'm yet to taste that kind of perfection anywhere else.

The second time we went, the service kind of put us off. The waiter brought us the wrong order and when we sent it back he made faces and ignored us the remainder of the meal, which we thought was very unprofessional. 

My husband gives the 'Fo' 5 stars (a soup with noodles, meat and sprouts ) which is really high considering that he has eaten really great authentic Vietnamese food in Japan and HK.
We love this place and will keep going back.
