I was on Yelp looking for some good places to eat , someplace with good reviews.    And I ran across this place.  Now, it was quite a ways to drive, but I figured, what the heck.  It was, without a doubt, the best Chinese Buffet I have ever been to.  The food is fresh and cooked just right.  The sushi bar is really good and fresh.  The fresh fruit is pentiful and fresh.  Even the baked steamed fish is good.  I am a big crab puff person, and the amount of filling in these was amazing.  I will go back to this place over and over again.  Anyone reading this, it's worth the drive!
