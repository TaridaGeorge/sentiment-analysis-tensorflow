Was visiting AZ  this weekend for a business trip and staying in Chandler. Wanted to visit a brewery pub. So i searched on yelp and found San Tan Brewery. All i can say is im glad i found this place. There beer was really tasty and i enjoyed all of them. There food was was awesome. I would have to say i think the bacon cheese burger was one of the best burgers i have ever had. This place really has there service down. I sat near the kitchen. Cooks really got there orders out quick. Also servers were on top of all the orders thanks to the guy expediting all the orders. Overall a great dining experience with my girlfriend. Will definetly visit again when in the area. 

Thanks San Tan Brewery.
