Pricey without a doubt and admittedly the sort of place that not everyone will "get," Scottsdale Pen Company is a gem for those who fancy esoteric writing instruments - whether for functionality, or as an artistic statement.  A beautiful collection that is extensive yet well culled and workers who are passionate and knowledgable these folks not only helped me find a mechanism I'd been looking for in an old pen but also had ink available at a great price for another pen that I generally have to special order in any color but black.  Great stuff and a nice location for browsing after coffee at Cartel I'll certainly be back.
