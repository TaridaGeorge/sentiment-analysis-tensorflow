We don't like to repeat restaurants on vacation, but we visited this restaurant on our spring training vacation this year and last year. Their small burgers are great size so u can have 2 and experience more flavors! Sweet tots and smothered tots are great, and we haven't found a bad sandwich. Wild boar, wagu, chicken, quinoa and the pb&j are all our favorites! I cannot believe how delicious the pb&j is!! Highly recommend trying different burger types in one visit here!
All sides are a la cart and sandwiches are smaller, but if you're looking for something unique and different, this is a sure stop!  Prices may be considered high, but when you try the food, it's understandable.  
Happy Hour is early if you want the cheaper prices.
