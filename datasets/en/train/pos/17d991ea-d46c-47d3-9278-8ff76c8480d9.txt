I have to say Harkins theaters are good about supporting independent film and they saved this theater from being demolished or becoming another trashy dance club on Mill, and got a Tempe Beautification Award (whatever that is) in 2001, probably when Harkins bought it.

to their respect, they didn't try to make it something it's not, they kept the old school marquee out front and show mostly indy films and hold film fests there like Spike and Mike's and the Edge held a free music movie thing there the same weekend as a arts festival, pretty cool. oh, and Arizona filmmakers held their opening of Never Been Thawed here.

if you want to see that indy film that has made it into the mainstream theaters, come here instead and support those that do their part to support independent and local theater.
