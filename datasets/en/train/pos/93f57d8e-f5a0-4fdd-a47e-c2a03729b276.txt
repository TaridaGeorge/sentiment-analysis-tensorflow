Art and Crafts plus fabrics!

This is the only Jo-Ann's in the area and it is huge! I can't really sew, but unlike Michael's Jo-Ann's has a ton of fabrics and sewing supplies. Beyond the giant fabric center they have everything and more you are looking for in a arts and crafts store. They also have a ton of things for decorating your pad. I usually find myself surrounded my old ladies and moms and screaming kids, but that is the price I pay. 

Way bigger and better than Michael's!
