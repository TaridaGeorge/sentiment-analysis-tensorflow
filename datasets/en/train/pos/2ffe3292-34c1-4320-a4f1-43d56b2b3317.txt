Absolutely amazing!

I finally made it to Postino after hearing great things from many people.  We came on a Tue night to meet up with another couple we hadn't seen in awhile.  Mon and Tue they have the special where you get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20.  This is a great deal.  The place was crowded so if you go make sure you go early and get your name in.  The nice thing is that you can start drinking your bottle while you wait.  We were waiting for around 45 min before we got a table but we were having fun nonetheless.  The bruschetta was amazing and there were many different types to choose from.  We also tried the grilled cheese which was delightful.  We will definitely be back again and I am excited to try more things on the menu.
