Paid $150 for a Friday night beginning of April (government rate), the resort also charged an extra $20 for a resort fee. I imagine the normal nightly rate is very expensive based on how beautiful the resort is. It is huge with a gigantic, beautifully laid out family pool with a hot tub in the middle and a smaller adult only pool. Our room had a small balcony which looked out over the beautiful hotel entrance. Only complaint is how expensive the drinks are, $10-11 each.
