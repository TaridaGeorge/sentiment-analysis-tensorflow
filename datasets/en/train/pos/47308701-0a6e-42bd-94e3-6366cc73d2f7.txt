This place has an awesome wine and flatbread deal on tuesdays. I was visiting from San Diego and this place was definitely one of the highlights from my trip. I highly recommend that going here on a Tuesday but plan ahead and be prepared to wait. We walked across the street to a bar and had a drink while we waited. Cheers I recommend all of the flatbreads. Period.
