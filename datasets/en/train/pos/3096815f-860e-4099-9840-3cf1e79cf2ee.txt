Great vegan and vegetarian food!!!  The tea selection is also of course awesome.  The black bean hummus wrap was excellent and the salads are very tasty. Everything is organic and fresh. After the meal I had a very satisfying feeling knowing I ate healthy and it tasted great! We will definitely come back for more.
