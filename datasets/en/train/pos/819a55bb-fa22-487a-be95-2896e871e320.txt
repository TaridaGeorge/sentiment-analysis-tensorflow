Love this event! I mean, who doesn't love a cupcake- and who doesn't love a bunch of them? I ate more than I probably should have, but I'm pretty sure charity cupcakes don't have calories ;)

I love that 100% of the proceeds (not the profit- every penny!) goes to the charity. This year was a veterans charity as it was held on veterans day, which I think was fantastic and very appropriate. 

The photobooth was hopping as always, and Brand-X made some awesome designs this year. I left with a "Keep Calm and Have a Cupcake" shirt. 

Of course any large event isn't without it's hiccups, but remember folks- it's all for a good cause and everyone is working hard with the best of intentions. I had a blast and I'm already looking forward to next year!
