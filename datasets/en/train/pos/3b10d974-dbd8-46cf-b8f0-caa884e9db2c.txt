Nobody is perfect, but this is about as close as it gets. I LOVE the menu here. It is so simple, yet new and exciting. The picked peppers are delicious, as is their gourmet version of a Big Mac. Also try their asparagus and the cheap house salad. I really enjoyed my bacon infused bloody mary too. Garage parking can be an issue at peak times in this area - though a valet is always available.
