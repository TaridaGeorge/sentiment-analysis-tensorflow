My fiancé and I went into minibar ber shop today and he got an amazing cut from Jackie. My fiancé has had the same haircut for years and he was looking for something new. Jackie took the time to talk with him about what he wanted and then provided advice about what to do going forward. The place is very modern looking and had lots of fun trinkets you could buy for gifts. He will definitely be going back.
