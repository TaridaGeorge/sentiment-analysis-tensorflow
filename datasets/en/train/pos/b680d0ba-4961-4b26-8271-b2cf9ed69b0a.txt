awesome place to have so close. but can't take the pooch, so that's a bummer. great to be able to park there late and do night hikes to the top. weird cat like animal up there and sometimes quite a few scorpions. saw a rattlesnake once as well. great escape except on weekends when it's busier than bianco's pizzaria on half-price pizza day.
