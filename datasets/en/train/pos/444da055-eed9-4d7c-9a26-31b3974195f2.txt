I love Cornish Pasty because it reminds me of my Aussie friends...not English, I know, but bear with me.  One of the best things to get when you are hungover is an Australian meat pie or sausage roll...same concept.  My favorite has the be the Oggie because it's exactly like other ones I've had.  Love it and a must do!  Plus they serve bottles of Chimay...LOVE Chimay.  AND they have Pavlova, another Aussie favorite.  Hmmm, the Aussies are just British criminals, aren't they....it's close enough.
