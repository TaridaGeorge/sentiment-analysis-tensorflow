If you look at Med Fresh Grill from the outside, you might ask yourself: What is this place?  And right you should: there's outdoor seating, there's "grill" in the name, and behind the fast food style counter, there's bottles of liquor, it's all very confusing.  Med Fresh Grill is a low profile restaurant with high-end turkish food.  Their falafels are moist, and scrumptious.  Their portions are generous, you will NOT leave hungry.

Do not pass this place up.  It is a hidden gem of Tempe.
