I had a great experience.  I went in with my son and the gentleman tried on several pairs of cleats on him to find the right size and comfort.  I purchased cleats, socks, shin guards and a soccer ball.  Everything was reasonably priced and my son was happy.  This was my second experience in this store and I would definitely go back again!
