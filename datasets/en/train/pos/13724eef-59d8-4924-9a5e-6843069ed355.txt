During 90% of my visits, I've been in and out under 20 minutes!

I know what you're thinking - you think of the MVD/DMV and you think long lines, long waits, and unfriendly staff. But not here! The receptionists are very nice and truly helpful. They've answered a plethora of my questions and this is my favorite DMV/MVD I go to! I've gotten my Az ID, driver's license, and car registration here and usually in and out very fast! Maybe I'm just lucky, or maybe it's because I go during school hours. Whatever the case, you'll be pleasantly surprised as I was this this MVD!
