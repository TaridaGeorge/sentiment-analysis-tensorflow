Oh Cheese N' Stuff how I love thee! 

I didn't know of The Cheese until I started dating my now husband. He has been going here since he was a little boy. His whole family is obsessed with this place, to the point that not only does the owner know them by heart and knows what they order, but so does the owners kids! That's customer service! 

I usually get the tuna, its AMAZING but this past Saturday I went for the #5 which is the turkey sammich on a sub roll with Russian dressing! So yum! 


Also, I am wayyyyyy picky about my macaroni salad, and cNs's mac salad is the bomb nonnie! I promise! 

I topped off my lunch with a cream soda! 

Yes its old and cramped, but the sandwiches make up for all of that.
