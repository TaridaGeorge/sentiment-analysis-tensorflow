Some of the freshest Sushi I have had. Masa, the owner gets deliveries daily and you can taste it. I am more of a sashimi lover, but my wife is a fan of the rolls and his combinations are great. 

Not a place you would expect when going into a strip mall, but we are finding more and more restaurants that have great food in these strip mall locations. He is currently renovating and adding in teppanyaki which will add to the experience. Cannot beat the cost and love the fact its in the neighborhood. No more trips to Scottsdale for great sushi.
