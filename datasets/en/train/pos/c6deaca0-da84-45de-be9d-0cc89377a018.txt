omg what more can i say about this place i ate here on a recent vacation and thought the food was amazing i love the way the restaurant was set up it made eating there enjoyable the portions are huge and yeah its expensive if you eat with more than two people but i think its worth it  defiantly a place i would eat at again  :)
