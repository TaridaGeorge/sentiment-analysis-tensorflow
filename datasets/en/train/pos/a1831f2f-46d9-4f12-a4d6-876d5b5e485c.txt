Holy crap this is some good BBQ.  

My wife and I love BBQ and are always looking to try new places.  When we saw this place was just down the street from us we decided to give it a try.  My wife and I both got the smokin' meal, which comes with brisket, pulled pork, sausage and two sides.  The meats were each equally fantastic and the BBQ sauce was really, really good.  I also really enjoyed the baked beans and cornbread I got with my meal.  

The price was pretty reasonable and we got our food super quick.  The place is located in kind of a weird place but it's worth looking for if you have to.  Seriously, some of the best BBQ in town.
