Oh My Goodness!!
Husband is Mexican - we're from Chicago - have NEVER had such fabulous food outside of Mexico City! Were there on vaca and went one night - loved the tacos (the Tinga chicken was SOOOO tasty!) and the salsas are so fun and interesting and tasty!

Had to go back one more time before we left and ordered the DEEP FRIED QUESADILLAS!!! O.M.G. pas deaux - it was AH MAY ZING!!! One of the best fried foods I have ever tasted - and the cheese, and the chicken tinga..... mmmmmmm - 

Booking another flight to Phoenix as I write this....
