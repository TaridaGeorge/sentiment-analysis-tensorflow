I've always been a big fan of Postino but don't make it down there very often. A couple of weeks ago I met some friends to hike Camelback. After a struggling hike, we went to Postino to enjoy some food and drinks. What a perfect day! 

We sat outside on the patio and were cooled by misters. Our attentive servers brought us water right away. I started with fresh squeezed lemonade then had a mimosa. My friend and a bellini and the guys had some IPA (I think it was $5 a pitcher??) 

I can't go to Postino without having some of their infamous bruschetta... we ordered the artichoke, tomato jam, prosciutto/fig, and date/pistachio. Every bite was delicious! Can't wait to go back!
