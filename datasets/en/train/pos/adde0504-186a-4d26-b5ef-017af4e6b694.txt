This is a pretty busy TJ's but it's worth it. After going to a few grocery stores right by my house (and being super disappointed by their produce section) I drove an extra 5 minutes to TJ's & was transported to my happy place. Beautiful produce that's cheaper than the next guy, an awesome selection of meat & fish as well as flowers, wine & chocolates. 

I got enough food for the week for about half as much as at the 'big box' stores. Bam!
