What can I say? I love Sunflower. They always have fresh veggies and fruits, a nice organic section, many gluten and dairy free products and they have a deli that sells Boar's Head cold cuts. Their prices on food and supplements is always a dollar or three cheaper than Whole Foods. The wine section is good, but I hardly shop it as I find good wines for better prices at Trader Joes, Cost Co, or Total Wine. 

I have to say though, that some products I do find cheaper elsewhere, such as orange juice and almond milk. I really only come to Sunflower for their produce and some of the gluten free products. But all in all, it's a great natural foods store.
