Because they deserve it!  Two of us had late breakfast.  Everything on my plate was perfect:  carne adovado was smoked perfectly with a terrific spicy sauce; my expectations for pinto beans are not great, but these were awesome; fried potatoes were somehow well above the norm; perfectly prepared eggs on top with an excellent flour tortilla on the side.  Hell, I even cut up and ate the tortilla on the bottom of the plate as it had soaked up all that great adovado sauce.

It costs more than normal but I received fair value for the buck. 

My first visit and I will return for every visit to Phoenix.

Wow!
