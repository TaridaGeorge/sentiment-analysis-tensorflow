I love calzone's but it is very hard to find a place that makes them well. Redendo's is the first place I've found that really nails them. We've been here about 5 times since finding it a couple months ago and have never been disappointed.

1. The calzones are a great deal ($8 for a few standard ones $9 for build your own with 4 toppings included)
2. They are HUGE!!! I eat a lot and usually cannot finish more than half a calzone
3. Great combination of cheese and toppings inside, not too much of either.
4. Cooked to perfection (crispy on the outside but no doughy spots in the middle)
5. Fast and Friendly service if you dine in or carry out.

If you are looking for a Calzone in Scottsdale this is your place.
