I've never been to this location - previously had only been to the one in Chandler - but I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in the west Valley. The food was amazing - I had a bacon calzone that was STUFFED with cheese and then cannolis for desert - and the service was excellent. They say give about 30 minutes for a calzone because they bake it fresh and to-order but I got mine in about 15. The waitress put in the wrong sauce - they ordered a white pizza, got a normal one - so the waitress gave them the messed up pizza and cannolis for free but got the ordered pizza to come out promptly in no time at all. NYPD has the best pizza I could hope for from a chain!
