I really love this place. It never fails to be high quality and delicious. My only complaint would be the amount/type of seating, but that is just a mere location issue. And as far as cheese wiz vs. provolone or whatever people use on their cheese steaks, I think it's however you prefer it, and I know people from Philly that take it both ways.
