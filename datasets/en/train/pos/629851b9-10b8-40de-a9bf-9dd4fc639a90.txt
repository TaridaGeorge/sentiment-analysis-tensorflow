first - eat something here. it's worth waiting to find a place to sit. i sat on the fireplace ledge once. i get the boursin salad or the chips and dip. both are incredible. like out of this world incredible. my friend loves the grilled cheese and tomato soup.

their wine is always impeccable as well. 

i love the roosevelt. be patient, eat food, drink wine, and be merry.
