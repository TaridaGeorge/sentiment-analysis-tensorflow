This place must have been called Cigarillos at one point...but the owner calls it Cigar Inn.

A husband and wife (Salma) run the store, and wonderfully at that.  Salma was just fabulous with her accent and upbeat attitude.

Once she found out I was an artist, she showed me the multitudes of beautiful cigar boxes (some of them are extremely rare...and just gorgeous!) and let me tour the huge humidor.  I'm no afficionado in the least, but it was pretty impressive.

There was a nice little smoking lounge that looked so comfy I was almost regretful that I didn't smoke.  

Salma also tempted me pretty successfully into purchasing some beautiful and delightfully smelling diffusers.  She and her husband are just great, and I can't wait to visit again!
