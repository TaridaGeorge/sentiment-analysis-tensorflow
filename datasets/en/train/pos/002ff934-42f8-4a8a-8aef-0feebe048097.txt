A trip to Geisha A Go-Go = a cab-cab ride home.  I just love this place, and it's quickly becoming a favorite spot for heading out with the Little Lady, meeting friends for HH, late evening, late night, anytime!

HH specials are fantastic, and the food is very good (this isn't a premium sushi joint...but very respectable sushi for a bar).  Geisha is just a really cool spot, that does a lot of different things well...and it all works out somehow.  It's a bar, a restaurant, a club, and a karaoke spot.  Constant good vibe and great service.

I've only had the bad judgement to bring my tone-deaf-no-talent self into a karaoke room once, and I promise you there is not enough sake in this place for that to happen again!
