I had a pretend vacation nite here last weekend and loved it! Our room was newly renovated and overlooked the pool. The bed is super comfy, flat screen tv and the bathroom huge with a great shower.

The pool scene was great for people watching. We hung at the adult only section which was a huge plus. Pool was pretty busy and reminded me of spring break. Lots of locals for sure. I wanted a no-kid day and got it! Drinks were strong and service was available at the pool until about 6pm. 

Every staff member was helpful and friendly. The grounds well kept and easy to navigate around. I will be back for another stay before summer ends!
