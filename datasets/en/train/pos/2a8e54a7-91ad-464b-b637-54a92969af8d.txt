I just had my first experience with Alexanders Aesthetics. I live in So Cal but I found them online. I needed some esthy products and I found their prices to be some of the best. It's always a little nerve wracking ordering online from a new business since you never know how that is going to turn out (i.e. over charging, not receiving products, late delivery, lost delivery, fraudulent business, etc). Well the ordering process was quick and simple and I received my order in 3 business days which I was not expecting. I was pleasantly surprised! And I was so happy that everything was properly packaged and shipped (my products weren't dinged up and spilling out). I will definitely be doing business with them in the future!
