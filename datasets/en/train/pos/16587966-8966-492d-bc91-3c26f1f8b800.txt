I've only been here once-but have been meaning to go back. It is very nice and clean inside and the family that owns it are nice enough. They are as authentic as you can get. I don't like a lot of Chinese restaurants in Arizona but this one's a keeper. The food is delicious, especially the way they make my favorite green beans. I am very picky about this and this place makes it just right.
