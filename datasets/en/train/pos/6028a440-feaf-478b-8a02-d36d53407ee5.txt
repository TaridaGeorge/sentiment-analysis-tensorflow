I absolutely adore this place.  Great location, right down the street from a friends house so we never have to deal with parking issues.  Everyone who works there is really sweet and one of the older bartenders is great to talk with.  I used to stop by so often the bartender would take a few glasses of wine off the bill.  Whenever people come in from out of town I have to take them here.  They have the best bruschetta!  I have tried to recreate some of them at home and while they have been good, they are no match for Postino.  It is a great place for a relaxing lunch, romantic dinner, or night out with the girls!
