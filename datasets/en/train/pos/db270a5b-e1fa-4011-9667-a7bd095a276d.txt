Great gym!  Lifetime has everything and then some!  

Our family loves to come to the gym to work out, swim, yoga classes, for the spa, play & parents nite out.  The staff is out of this world, they feel like family.  

At times it feels resort-like, and the best thing is ....Lifetime Fitness is good for you!

The facility is clean and well taken care of, always someone there to help you, classes galore and all the amenities to make it worth every penny!
