I had the combo sandwich and the pesto pasta salad, both were awesome. I can't wait to go back and sample all the other options and there were tons! Huge selection of pasta salad, sandwiches, pizza, hot pasta, and desserts. The food was worth the wait at lunch hour, but take their advise and call ahead if your in a hurry .
