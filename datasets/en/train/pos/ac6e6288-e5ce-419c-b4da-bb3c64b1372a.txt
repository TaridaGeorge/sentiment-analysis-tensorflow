Initially, I was hesitant to eat gelato here.  I have not had a good experience  with gelato since I left Italy.  I am not usually motivated enough to get gelato as I am quite full after dinner.  Arlecchino Gelateria makes me motivated!  Simply put, the best Gelato in Arizona. 

The other night I went in for Gelato.  After I ordered, I realized that I had left my wallet at home.  Before I could offer to go grab it, the owner told me to pay him next time.  I am sure it was because he recognized me as I frequent his shop; however, this act motivated me to write a review.  It was a small act of generosity that had an overwhelming effect.  

I am officially sold!  Not only is the Gelato Amazing, the service is outstanding!
