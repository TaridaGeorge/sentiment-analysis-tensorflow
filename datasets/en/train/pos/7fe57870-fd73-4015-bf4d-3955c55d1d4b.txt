Visited Phoenix, AZ on a business trip w/ my boss.  We just had to have the GYU DON(beef bowl).  We went on May 30th for lunch but, was closed to construction.  Had to eat the GYU DON before our return on May 31st.  After a fun day of golf, before our trip back to Phoenix airport, we stopped by and has the GYU DON and COLD UDON combination set.  AWESOME!  This satisfied our palate.  Now we were able to return back to LAX.
