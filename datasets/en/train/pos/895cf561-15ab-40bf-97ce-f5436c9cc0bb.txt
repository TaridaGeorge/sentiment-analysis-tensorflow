The price was not bad. Clean, nice rooms, 2 free water bottles, wifi, decent gym, outdoor pool. It has a nice lounge area to just surf and hang out. Also has a small pool table and 2 computers to print out your boarding passes. There is a small area with microwave and quick bites. We had munchies at 2am, so it was nice to be able to go downstairs and buy a turkey sandwich and cereal. Stayed here twice, and haven't been disappointed yet. Good job! :)
