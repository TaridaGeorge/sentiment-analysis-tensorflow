This place was great.

I went on a sunday for brunch. I thought it was going to be small judging from the outside but it turned out to have a surprisingly big. Really good atmosphere especially upstairs. They had piano music playing and I actually wasn't sure if someone was playing live. I don't think there was.

Food was delicious. I got the biscuits with gravy. Potatoes were definitely unique and great. Drinks were also very refreshing. Will be back many times in the future
