By far, this is my favorite Mojo location! The Tempe Marketplace is a beautiful setting for my favorite dessert - it's beside the water spouts and a group of couches and it's nice to take a break and relax there.

The only down-side to this location is that it always smells almost "too clean" - kind of like a hospital. It can be unappealing when you first walk in, and it's very very noticeable. Of course I'd rather it be clean than unsanitary, but it's a little weird.

Oh, and Lion King is playing. Weird? :)
