Those of you asking for them to "come back" mosey on up to Anthem - they have a location up here.  The reason is the owners wanted to spend more time with their family so they decided to keep the anthem location open.  Harry, the owner, passed away just a short while back, but the staff at the Anthem location is still all the same and his wife is running the show now.
