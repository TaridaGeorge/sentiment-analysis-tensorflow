My FAVORITE Pho restaurant! Rare beef Pho is amazing and their broth has just a little something different from most of the Pho places I have tried. Way to go Pho Ao Sen! This place is a no brainer and a great place to take a date. Prices are reasonable, staff is friendly and the ambience is way better than your average strip mall Pho joint.
