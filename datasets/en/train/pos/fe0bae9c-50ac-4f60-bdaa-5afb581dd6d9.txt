If I could give Tommy V's 10 stars I would. The 1st day in Old Town we ate crapp for lunch and dinner, and paid through the nose. Then we bumped into Tommy's, and have been having lunch and dinner there every day since. The food is perfect, the staff unreasonably attentive, the prices are right (especially all day happy hour).
Peaceful ambience (no loud musak), great patio for lunch, loads of iced water.
Hazelnut and foraged mushroom risotto you couldn't beat in Tuscany at 10x the price
The Ceasar's are better than any in Rome.
The guys who give this negative reviews need their heads and rear ends examined.
