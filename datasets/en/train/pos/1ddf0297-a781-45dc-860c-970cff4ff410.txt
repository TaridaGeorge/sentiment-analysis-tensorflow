I've been to heaven, and it's the Kierland Westin.  It's absolutely beautiful.  The swimming pools and lazy river are so much fun, and i had drinks in the bar with a neurologist from New Jersey.  The staff are friendly and courteous, though I'm not sure hy they won't allow you to bring your own bags into your room.  The floor plan is a bit labyrinthine, so this turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  Expensive, but oh-so worth it.
