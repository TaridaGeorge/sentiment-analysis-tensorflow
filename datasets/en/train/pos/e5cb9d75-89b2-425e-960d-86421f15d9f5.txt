This is a Starbucks location close to home that has a Drive-Thru. It can be a bit awkward if you come from the side of McKellips since it curves to the left if you're ordering coffee via Drive-Thru. 

Parking lot here is a bit small but usually never have any problems. I haven't had any major issues with my drink orders here; however sometimes it can take a bit longer during the AM hours than the evenings. 

Free WIFI and there's also patio seating.
