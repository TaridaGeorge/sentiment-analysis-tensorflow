What a cool place. You can either sit and be served in the dining area, or order sandwiches and salads to go, or eat those outside on the front patio. Did a lunch group here for a buddy's birthday, and we enjoyed ourselves.  I ordered the mediterranean salad w/ chicken, and it was great! Delicious, very healthy (not the typical overloaded salad you buy at chain restaurants), good size, and I wasn't under the spell of a carb coma the rest of the afternoon!
