We were craving Chinese take-out and randomly found Qwik Chinese because it was close. We were very pleased with the discovery! The food was incredible and tasted much better than the name would imply :) This food is leaps and bounds beyond your typical take out. We got a few small entrees as well as fried rice, it was a ton of delicious food for the price.
