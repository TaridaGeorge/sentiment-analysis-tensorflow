BEEF & BLEU! The 2nd most expensive sandwhich item they sale but the 1st place winner of sandwiches! 

Aside from the 2 ladies being the sweetest owners I have talked to...

Aside from the collection of cheeses that bring me back every time...

Aside from the friendly staff...

Aside from the meaty goodness of the sandwiches...

Aside from alllllllllll of that...this place is my new favorite place to eat lunch...(LGO is still veryyyy close to the top.)

NOTE: I just got hungry...i am going back.
