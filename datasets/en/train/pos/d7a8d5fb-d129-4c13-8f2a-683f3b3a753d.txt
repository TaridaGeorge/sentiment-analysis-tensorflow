Fantastic place - great food for the type it serves, and an excellent wine selection.      Great place for a romantic evening - have done it numerous times.    Wine is a bit overpriced, but we're willing to pay it for the atmosphere.    Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a cool, trendy place with good eye candy and good eats.
