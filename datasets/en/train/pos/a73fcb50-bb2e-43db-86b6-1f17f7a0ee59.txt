Can't say enough about how great our experience was at this place.

We had a group of 10 for a family dinner, and sat in their dining area in the back of the restaurant.  They made sure we had everything we needed.

The food was incredible.  Some of the best BBQ we've had in Phoenix.  We tried everything:  ribs, pulled pork, brisket, and smoked sausage.  All were excellent.  Fries and slaw were awesome.

We'll be coming back!
