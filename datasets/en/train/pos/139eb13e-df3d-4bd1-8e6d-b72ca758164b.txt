It's crazy that I've lived in Phoenix my entire life and I've never visited the Desert Botanical Garden - seemed so BORING to me!  Well, I guess I've grown up and what I thought would be boring is PEACEFUL and BEAUTIFUL.   

I didn't get a chance to explore everywhere as I had my two young daughters with me and we headed almost straight to the Butterfly Pavilion.  If you have young children this is a NO MISS.  It's a wonderful place to spend an hour or so.  Not knowing anything about butterflies myself, I was grateful there were plenty of knowledgeable staff/volunteers to answer questions.  In fact, everyone I ran seemed really happy to be there.
