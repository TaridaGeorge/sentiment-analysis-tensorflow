Both times I have gone with friends we split pizzas. The margarita is wonderful and I like the unique flavor of the lime & avocado pizza. Genius! I am craving the giant salted chocolate chip cookie. Uh-maze-ing! I just love it! The sandwiches look gorgeous. I am going to try a sandwich on my next LGO adventure. This place is always packed with customers. You cannot go wrong with great pizza, sandwiches, gelato, & a wicked good  bakery. I HIGHLY recommend!
