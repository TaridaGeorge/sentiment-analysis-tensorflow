I have yet to be dissapointed with the service here. When I call or come in I am greeted by name, which just makes everything better from the begining.

The lunch specials are a little more that some places, but not by much and they are well worth it. I don't know if there are any resturant unique items that they have, but they serve the usual Chinese food, just at a better quality. If you are looking for a good lunch, try the Mongolian Beef or Sweet and Sour Chicken.

A must have is their Crab Puffs, these have more flavor here than I can recall having anywhere else. Try them and love them!
