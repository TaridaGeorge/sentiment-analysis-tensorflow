Why 5 stars? Because we have never come to JUST stay in the rooms, or for a conference... 5 stars for the 5 times our family has enjoyed the Oasis Waterpark!! It is a blast! And has been so super relaxing when just my spouse and I.  You can flip up a flag on your beach chair and someone will be by to take your order.  I think that getting 2 days of fun for 1 night stay at the resort is superb! (Day of check-in & day of check-out).  For memories, if you like to swim, it's a great place to go!
