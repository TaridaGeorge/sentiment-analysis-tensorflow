We have been going to Frasher's for 6 years. We have always received amazing food & service. We drive from central Phoenix to Scottsdale, for a meal that is always worth the trip. Some of our favorites are St Louis Style Ribs, Teriyaki Salmon, Steak, garlic mashed potatoes.  George is the owner/mgr. and always checks on us. We are business owners also and really appreciate being treated the way we treat our Guests.
