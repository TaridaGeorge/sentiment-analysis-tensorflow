This place is awesome! My husband and I passed by it a lot. We happened to be in that area and we decided to check it out. Boy oh boy they had a huge selection of movies! We usually spend at least an hour in there picking out movies. Someone mentioned that you can spend that long in there and that is no joke! I like that they are a family owned business, plus 5 movies for 5 bucks for 5 days. If you drive by it go in and check it out, it is worth the money and time!
