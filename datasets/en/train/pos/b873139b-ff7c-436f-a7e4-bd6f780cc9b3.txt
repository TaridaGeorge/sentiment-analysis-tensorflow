I've been enjoying John's incredible massages at SPACE studio for over a year, but the last one was extra special.  I got my first Thai massage and it was amazing!  This massage is received on a futon instead of a traditional massage table.  John uses his knees, feet, elbows and hands to work out all those knots.  Thai massage is given while you are fully clothed, so it makes a great gift for a novice. 

John always takes the time to ask questions and he actually listens to the answers!  He has a great way knowing right where the problem spots are hidden and exactly the right amount of pressure to help dissolve the kinks.  SPACE studio exudes a calming, healing energy from the first step in the door.  It's a perfect getaway to transform stress into bliss.
