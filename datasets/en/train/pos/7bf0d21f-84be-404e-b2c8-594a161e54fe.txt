I love this place and wouldn't go anywhere else.  I always feel fabulous when I leave this salon.  The haristylists are very helpful and very attentive and you always get what you want.  The prices are super reasonable.  I always make my appointments with Yulie but the other ladies do a wonderful job as well.
