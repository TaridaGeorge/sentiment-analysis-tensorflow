This is definitely my favorite cafe in Tempe and it's a short enough walk to hit it during a class break at ASU. The atmosphere is very comfortable and conducive to laptops and group projects. The staff is eager to please and the regulars seem low key and friendly.

Coffee drinks are well-made and they have some nice food options. You can get a great cooked breakfast if you make it there before 2pm.
