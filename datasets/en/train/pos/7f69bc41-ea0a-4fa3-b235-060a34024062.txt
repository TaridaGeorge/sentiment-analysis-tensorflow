I use to be a regular at SFS when I lived closer.  But since I am moved to East LA, I have not been to SFS in a LONG time (4 years).  My 16 niece was in town from Ohio and our mission was to hit all the stores that they do not have in Ohio so she would have clothes that no one else at her school or town.  It was fun!  We walked the entire mall in 3 hours and got a ton of stuff.  Loved the new additions and nice to see the old staples get  bigger spots.
