Ice cream is one of very few foods I will admit to being a snob about (as in, "I am an ice cream snob").  Tortillas too, but that's for another review.  Anyway, Sweet Republic has the best ice cream, gelato, fro-whatever, etc. I've ever had.  Hands down.  What really makes the place special, though, is their help.  Whether it be one of the owners or staff, they're always very knowledgeable about their product, will engage you to talk about their product and help find the best flavor for you, and are fast so the line doesn't get too backed up as we've all seen in many an ice cream parlor.  Whoever does the hiring deserves a special award.  Sweet Republic's people are the best.
