I am surprised at some of the low reviews for this place. Since moving to Gilbert, I rave about Bagel Nosh :) It is probably the best place for bagels and the service is fantastic! Recently, I took my boyfriend there and he quickly understood why this is my new addiction. The staff is friendly and the Honey Walnut on French Toast- to DIE for!! Love this place!
