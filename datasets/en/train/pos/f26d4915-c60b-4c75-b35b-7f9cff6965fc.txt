I have been very pleased with their work and I am a hard to please person.  I took in a pair of Jimmy's to be repaired and the man advised me to not only repair the heel cover but also to line the bottom with rubber.  I couldn't be more pleased.  When I asked him to stretch several pairs of shoes for me as well, he said there is a $7 charge per pair and I would be better served to buy the shoe stretcher for $25.  I asked if I should get a pair and he said 1 was just fine for now.  I was surprised he would eliminate an opportunity to garner more revenue.  I must say that I have been using the shoe stretcher so much that I ready to make it a pair now.
