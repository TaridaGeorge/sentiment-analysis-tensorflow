There's never a wait here and the lady who works here is sweet as can be. Her daughter is gracious and helpful as well. They're both thorough but fast. Good selection of OPI colors - overheard the daughter say she goes on pinterest to keep up on nail trends, which is great to hear. Waxing is fast and good too. I always get my eyebrows done here.
