This is SERIOUS, NO JOKE, authetic BBQ. Stacy's mom hails from Mississippi and Stacy came from Chicago. There's enough history there to justify a 5 star rating. The best BBQ I've ever had outside of Chicago. 

IT'S NOT FAST FOOD - and LIKE ALL GOOD THINGS IT TAKES TIME. Come in, be prepared to have your order started after you pay for it. RELAX... you're about to enjoy the best BBQ in Phoenix.

Other BBQ joints can't even compare - and Stacy's does killer grilled talapia too!
