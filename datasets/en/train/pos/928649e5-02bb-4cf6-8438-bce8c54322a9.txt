First visit this past Saturday.  7 pm, no tables available til 8:15 so... we were offered a place at the community table or at the bar - we chose the bar as there were 3 seats together.  It was a perfect choice.  Very personal service, some good conversation and excellent food and wine.  3 of us had 3 different entrees and each one was perfect.  Shrimp with andoille(sp) sausage, Pork Chop and Shepherds Pie.  Fox Valley Pino Gris wine!.  My spelling may not be up to par but believe me - your visit will be.  We met the Chef's wife and she was as charming as the restaurant.  Very nice place, sensibly priced and worth a visit - or visits.
