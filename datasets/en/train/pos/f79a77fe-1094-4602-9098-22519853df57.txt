I have no earthly clue why I haven't written this review before now... although it probably has something to do with my hands being busy shoveling catfish into my mouth. 

I can't say enough about how much I LOVE this place! I'm not much of a fish person, but I would smack my mama for some Flavors of Louisiana fried catfish. (Just kidding, Mom!) I'm also a huge fan of their shrimp po' boys, fried shrimp, peach cobbler and bread pudding - pretty much everything I've tried. A friend of mine swears there's nothing better than their dunkin' catfish (served on Saturday), but I haven't tried it yet. If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and I've been ordering the catfish, shrimp and fries for the last year at least. 

Tip: don't you dare skip the dinner roll. It's delicious and worth every carb!
