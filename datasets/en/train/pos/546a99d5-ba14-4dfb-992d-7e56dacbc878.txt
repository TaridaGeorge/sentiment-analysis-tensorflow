Hanrattys is my go to dive bar. You cannot beat 2.50 bud and bud light drafts. Plus it is also an Ohio bar which I can enjoy. Not much of a crowd but it is a fun place to relax. 

They have real darts and pool tables. So there is plenty to do. 

The only downside, is the food. I have only tried one thing and that is the mozzarela sticks so do not try them.
