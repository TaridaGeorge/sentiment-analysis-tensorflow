This is THE place to go if you're a celiac! Everything on the menu is labeled - and a big portion of the menu is actually gluten free! The servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and the food - well, the food is amazing. However, it's VERY pricey - especially with all of those amazing cocktails (muddled strawberrys, c'mon!). I have only dined here for dinner, but I loved every bite of it. I would choose to go here for ANY special occasion. They even brought out a free birthday GF dessert! They're great, go here as soon as you can!
