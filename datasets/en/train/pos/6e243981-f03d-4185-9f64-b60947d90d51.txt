This place is a great place to stop by after work and have a few drinks!! The interior is setup like a country western bar....and it looks even better at night when the lights are dim, you've had a few drinks and the entertainment shifts to the mechanical bull....suddenly its a scene out of Caoyote Ugly!!
The people behind the bar are there to also have some FUN!!
