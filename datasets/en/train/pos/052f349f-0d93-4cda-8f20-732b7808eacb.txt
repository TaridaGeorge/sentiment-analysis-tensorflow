Wayne and his son are honest guys.  Hard to find that in auto mechanics and probably the reason you're on Yelp looking for one.

He's mobile so he'll come out to you and from what I noticed, it seems like he knows as much if not more than a mechanic at a shop.

If you have a problem with your car and you're looking for a cost-effective way to get it solved, go with these guys all day.
