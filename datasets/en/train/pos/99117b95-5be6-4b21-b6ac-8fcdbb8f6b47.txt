I love this place! The service is good and the food is great! The pancakes are amazing! I love the blueberry pancakes and pecan pancakes so much! I also love the southwest omelet which comes with hash browns and two pancakes which I usually add blueberry or pecan to, depending on what flavor pancakes I want that day. This place is great for Breakfast but don't be surprised if you have to wait to find a seat because this place can get very busy, and that doesn't surprise me since the food is absolutely amazing!
