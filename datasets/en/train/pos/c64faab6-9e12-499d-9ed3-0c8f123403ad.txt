I am only reviewing the Restaurant and Bar area.  This place is perfect, they get everything right, the visit to Royal Palms for dinner was the highlight of my trip.

Reservations are met to perfection, the atmosphere is super classy without being over the top.  Service is top notch.  Food is great quality and fairly priced.

As I usually do, I will keep it short - GO HERE for drinks and a dinner date.
