Although this place is a bit out of my way, and I have only been here once,  I plan on making the trek to All About Comics at least once a week! The selection is unbeatable, and there are rare or collectible issues as far as the eye can see!!!!

The best part is that for each comic/graphic that is purchased over $10 you get a stamp on a frequent buyer card. Ultimately receiving a freebie.....awesome!
