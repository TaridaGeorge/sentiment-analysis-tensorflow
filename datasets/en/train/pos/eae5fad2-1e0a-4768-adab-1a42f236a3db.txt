This place is a wonder.  All kinds of sausages, and meats.  I'm a real push over for smoked meat.  I especially like their lachs schinken which is smoked ham cut very thin.  Making soup?  Try it with a smoked pork haxen.  Another favorite is their fleisch salat.  But beware, the fleisch salat is put into a container without weighing so the price of each container may not be what you think it will be.....close but not exact.
Great place and like all German butcher shops, it's closed on Monday.
