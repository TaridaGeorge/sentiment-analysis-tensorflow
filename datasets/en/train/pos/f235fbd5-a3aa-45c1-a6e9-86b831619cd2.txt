IKEA is pretty cool.  It's like an adventure in over-stimulation!  So much too look at.  I usually end up leaving with completely random crap... like a spatula, stick of bamboo, hangars and Swedish cookies... all for $4.95.  

It is a bit frustrating to find something big that I really do need (a new bookshelf) and I can't even come close to fitting it in my car.  I guess that's when it's time to borrow the parent's SUV and make a return trip.  :/
