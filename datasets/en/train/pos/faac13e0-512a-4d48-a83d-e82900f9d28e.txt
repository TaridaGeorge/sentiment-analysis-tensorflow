Best NY style pizza you can get in the area.  Whether it's late night, or delivery, you're going to get delicious pizza, crispy but not floppy crust, and a mouthful of gooey cheese that sits well, is flavorful and doesn't drip.  People write a lot about how it's too greasy, etc etc, if that turns you off, then just go to Crust or something!  I think people who enjoy Joe's know what they're getting and are big fans of it.  

Get some!!
