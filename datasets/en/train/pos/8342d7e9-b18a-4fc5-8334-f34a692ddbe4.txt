SO much fun! "Burlesque" is more than just scantily-clad women, and Mz Lucy Morals delivers. Comedy, magic, torch songs ... and scantily-clad women! Not just really skinny ones, either, though they're all HOT. Some are thin, some tall, some curvy, some so short you want to put them in your pocket and take them home. And TALENTED. These girls DANCE, people! So much entertainment in one night, you might not be able to stand it. But you will, and you'll come back for more. ;)
