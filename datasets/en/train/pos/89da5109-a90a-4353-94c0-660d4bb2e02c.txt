There happy hour is pretty decent- half off a number of items.  Very crowded when I came- Friday at about 6.  They said 20 minute wait, but it was much less than that.  We were able to get seated on the patio which is where I wanted to be anyways.  Food was great- tasty, fresh, good sauces, etc.  Service was very fast and efficient.   Don't really have any complaints, except maybe build a bigger patio here.
