Working just down the street, any excuse that i have to take clients out, or friends that come on in for lunch - lets head on down to local breeze.  I will admit i have a problem - i find something and can't stray from it - here is the Green Chile Burger.  I don't know who originally came up with the idea to put chile on a burger - but i love that person.  

Food is an upscale lunch, service is casual, waitresses are fun, owner working just like everyone else.  

5 stars for everything - the porch - ambiance - food - service.
