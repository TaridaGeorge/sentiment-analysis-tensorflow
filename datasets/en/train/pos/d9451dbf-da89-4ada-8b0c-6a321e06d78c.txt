Hands down, my favorite restaurant of all time.  My grandparents have been going to Avanti since the 70's!  It does have a mobster vibe and I think I have actually seen mob activity there before, but that is what makes it unique. The service is impeccable and I have never had a bad meal. They have the best gnocchi I have ever put into my mouth, it is served in a pasta trio with other pastas of the day.  Another tasty dish is the osso bucco.  You really should try this place at least once.  It would be great for a nice date.  I don't think that they strictly enforce a dress code, but you'll want to dress up a little- not a baseball hat and jeans type of place. Also, you'll want to make a reservation.
