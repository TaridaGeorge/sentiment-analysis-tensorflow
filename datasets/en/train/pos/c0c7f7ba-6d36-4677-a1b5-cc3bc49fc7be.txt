I found the Chaparral Suites to be an exceptional value at $85 a night in early December.  With hotel tax of $12.68 per night, the total is only $97.68 per night.  The rooms were clean and huge.  I got a two room suite with a king bed in one room and a sofa bed in the front.  There was also a bar and large table with three chairs in the front room.  You also get a freshly made breakfast in the morning included in the hotel rate.  The staff was friendly and very accommodating. 

The hotel is only a few blocks from Scottsdale Fashion Square. So you can shop til you drop.
