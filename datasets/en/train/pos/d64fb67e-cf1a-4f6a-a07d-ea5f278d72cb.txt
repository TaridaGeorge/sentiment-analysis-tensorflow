Crackers is our favorite local spot for breakfast.  There is usually a wait on the weekends but well worth it and they tend to over quote the wait time and seat you sooner. To start, they have delicious coffee which is always a nice way to start the morning. My favorite dish is the California benedict with avocado, spinach and bacon. The ingredients are fresh and theprtion sizes are hearty. I've also tried other dishes such as the cinnamon roll French toast and crepes which were also yummy. I haven't tried their lunch yet but am excited to!
