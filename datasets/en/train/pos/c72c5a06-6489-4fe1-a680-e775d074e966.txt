Great comfort food and fast!  The service was one of the best experiences I've had.  The food was delicious!  My favorite items were the tacos (pork and carne asada), frozen grapes and OHHH the garlic fries with ranch!  The alcoholic beverages were great and had plenty of liquor!

I was staying at the hotel to get away for a few days and the poolside serices at ROQ made my stay so much more enjoyable!  David Rudolph was there every afternoon to make sure I had everything I needed or wanted.  One afternoon at the pool, I was over taken by a large group, so David placed me in a more private area so I could relax and enjoy myself.  Now that is above and beyond!!  

Thank you to David Rudolph and the staff at ROQ!
