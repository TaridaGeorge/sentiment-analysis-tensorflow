Our Whirlpool washer started leaking water so I called My Appliance Guy and Mario the owner promised to be out the next morning and called to let us know he was coming and he was on time!  He quickly found the problem and showed me the issue and explained everything very clearly.  He gave me a reasonable quote and promised to be back later in the day with a part.  

Mario returned after calling again to let me know he was on the way and replaced the bad pump. He showed me the old pump and explained why he thought it failed. Also, his actual price was about $25 lower than his quote. A nice surprise.

Mario was very kind, prompt and professional.  I will happily use his service again or pass his number onto friends.
