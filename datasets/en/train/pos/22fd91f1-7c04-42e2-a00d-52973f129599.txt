I can't add anything to the other reviews, but I had to throw in my 5 stars. 

Took a temporarily-liberated suburban father of two and a visiting bachelor friend from San Francisco out here this past weekend. They were both extremely skeptical (and scared) as we drove up and parked. They both loved it. The crowd was fantastic. The drinks are nothing special but they do have a decent selection of bottled beers. The music was PERFECT for our midly inebriated state: a live DJ was spinning ridiculous 80s songs from our high school days. A bunch of cute girls were dancing up a storm on one side. Just past them, by the pool table, we spotted an extremely old, wrinkled Mexican dude with a cowboy hat. 

This place rocks.
