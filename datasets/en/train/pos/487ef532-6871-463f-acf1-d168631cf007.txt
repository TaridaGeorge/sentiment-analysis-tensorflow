I used to go here up until I was seven years old. Then my family moved to Boston.

First, the wave pool is completely amazing to a little kid growing up in Arizona, a kid who may have never seen waves before! And the waterslide was scary as hell, but awesome when I got up the nerve to go down it.

And then there are the ducks around the manmade Arizona pond. I loved all those ducks and one time this duck let me put him on his lap and I pet him and he just stayed there! I looked for that awesome duck each time I went back to the park afterwards, but never found him again.
