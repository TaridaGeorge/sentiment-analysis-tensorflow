I'm a new rider and went in to the shop looking for a little guidance with buying a bike the basic: what I need, pricing, ect. I ultimately bought a used bike from a friend and brought it in to have SP give it a look over to see how I can better my riding experience. I left very comfortable with my experience buying the accessories(lock, lights) both were great suggestions on the part of the employee. I went back in today looking for a new saddle and was surprised at the large selection. I was further surprised because they offered to let me try out some seats before I bought one and when I say try out I mean I walked out with one to try for a few days!
Awesome customer service 
Awesome selection
I'm a slippery pig customer for life!
