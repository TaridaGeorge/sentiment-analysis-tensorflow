I adore this nursery & drive all the way from south phoenix to buy my veggies & plants here. The employees are incredibly knowledgeable. I think they have a great collection of organic seeds, starts & amendments. They also do special orders. The 2 peace trees I purchased last year are growing like crazy. Their trees, shrubs & smaller plants are all very well cared for. It is totally worth the drive. Skip the Home Depot and go to a place where they  really know their plants!!!!
