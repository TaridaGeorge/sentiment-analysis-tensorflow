Eden's Grill is a gem in Phoenix.  A diamond in the rough if you will.  It's truly a shame there aren't more deliciously amazing family-owned restaurants like this in Phoenix.  

From the moment you walk in you're welcomed by a member of the family, usually the father who is working the dining room.  This hospitality lasts until you leave.

Their rice is truly a standout with almonds and raisins mixed in.  Hummus is amazing.  Chicken kabobs are always tender and juicy.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu here!

If you're nice to them, they might even give you a complimentary baklava for dessert!
