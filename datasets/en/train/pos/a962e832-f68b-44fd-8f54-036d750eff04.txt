I would eat dinner here every night if I could. On each of my last two trips to Phoenix I enjoyed a 475 calorie dinner that was tasty and filling. Some folks seem to think that a meal must be covered in "Country Gravy" in order to be filling and worth the price. I disagree. Just the right amount of high quality good tasting food - works for me!
