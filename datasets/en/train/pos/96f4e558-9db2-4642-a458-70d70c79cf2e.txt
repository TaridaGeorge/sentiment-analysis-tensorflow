They have good food. Been eating here since I moved down 10 years ago. I like their toasted subs and the pizza is excellant! My husband likes the wings and bread knots. Happy Hour is also a bonus.

 They are Phoenix Suns sponsors and host the Gorillla during the season. My kids loved eating thier gluten free pizza and meeting the famous Suns Gorilla! Very relaxed family friendly atmosphere. Always welocoming you with a smile when you enter.
