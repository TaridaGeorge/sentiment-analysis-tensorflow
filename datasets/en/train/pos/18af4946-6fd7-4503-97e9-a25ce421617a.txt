I LOVE THIS SCHOOL!!!! They have a wonderful management team!  They made sure my child was comfortable, and well taken care of, the teachers are sweet, and kind!  This school understands young children and I have learned so much from them.  My child wants to go to school on the weekends and that says alot.  I am so happy I found this school. The owner even gave me her cell phone and told me I can call her at anytime.  This school loves kids and would never hurt them!  I would cant say anything bad about the school and I am a parent with a child enrolled!

Araceli in the ones room is AWESOME!
Dulce in the two's room is Terrific!
Ms Jenn is the BOMB!!!  Pre-K ROCKS!
Ms Sandy the school age teacher LOVES the kids and the kids love here!
