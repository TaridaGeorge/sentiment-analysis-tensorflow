Here is why I'm giving Jay Pages Jiu-jitsu a 5 out of 5 stars. Jay is an excellent instructor; he articulates each move carefully so anyone at any skill level can pick it up easily. Jay loves answering questions from his students. 

He honestly cares for each person who walks through his door, and when they leave, that person can call Jay a friend.  Jay Pages jiu-jitsu has a friendly family environment in which you are encouraged to learn at your pace, everyone is respectful to each other and are always willing to provide helpful advice.
