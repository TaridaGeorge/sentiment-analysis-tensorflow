The food was amazing!! I can not say more about it! Our waiter was good too, he was helpful in telling us about all the dining options and what was good if we liked certain foods, he kept our beverages coming and was very attentive through the whole meal. It was crowded but now we understand why! Its too bad it such a far drive because we would go more often!!
