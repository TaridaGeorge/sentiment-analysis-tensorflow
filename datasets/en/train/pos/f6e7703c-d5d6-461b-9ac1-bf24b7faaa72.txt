I was remodeling on a tight budget and trying to do as much as I could by myself, including painting. I have cathedral (high vaulted) ceilings, however, and after doing one coat of primer, it became clear that I needed help to finish the ceilings. I called David and he listened to what I needed and worked with my budget. He came out that day to look at my townhouse and gave me a great bid. He made himself available to do the work asap, he showed up on time and did a great job blending the ceilings with the rest of the paint. He even went the extra mile and sprayed a layer of white in my closets for no extra charge. David was a lifesaver: great customer service, great work and very reasonable prices.
