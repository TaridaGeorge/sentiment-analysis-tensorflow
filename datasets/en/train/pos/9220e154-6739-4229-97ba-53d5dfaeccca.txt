Spectrum Dermatology in Scottsdale,AZ is to be commended,not only for its welcoming staff,  but for it's wonderful  bed side- mannered leader, Dr.Kim, who I have had the pleasure of meeting on two occasions. If I was impressed with her during my first visit, I am even more so today. She is gracious and knowledgable along with having a magnetic but tranquil demeanor that puts nervous clients, like myself,at ease. With Dr.Kim,there is no wasted motion or high  pitched up selling  of products,just laser beamed proficiency that addresses your problems quickly and for a reasonable cost. I whole heartedly recommend her and proudly add my name to the growing list  of her many satisfied customers.
