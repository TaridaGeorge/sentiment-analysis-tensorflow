One month in retrospect, 3,000 miles away, thinking about Ticoz is making my mouth water. This is the perfect restaurant: savory food, spot-on service, cozy atmosphere.
 
My sister and I shared the tortilla soup, which was amazing, just the right saltiness and a more than generous helping; the blue cheese cobb, which was fresh, pilled high with a long list of ingredients and also impressively sized; and the blue corn tamales, which were distinct and hearty in their deliciousness. I can't remember what my parents ordered, but they were equally impressed.
 
Our waitress was the sweetest and very helpful in advising our orders.

One of the best meals I've ever had.
