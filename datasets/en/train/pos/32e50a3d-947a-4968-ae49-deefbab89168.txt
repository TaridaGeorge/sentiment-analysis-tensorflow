Doobys is my favorite restaurant in Mesa!  It is a bit off the beaten path, and the journey is well worth it! 

Dooby is the owner and you can see he truly enjoys what he does!  The food is excellent and I think I am now addicted to both the Chicken Schwarma and the Schnitzel.  The atmosphere is relaxed and not hurried, so if you are an idiot alcoholic and cannot wait for a beer, that's your issue.  : )  (see some other review where the poor sap was thirsty)

Anyways, the food is worth it, and it is nice to go and have a relaxing meal.  Here is to Dooby!
