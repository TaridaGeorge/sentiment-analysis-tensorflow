There is something about porches and coffee, the places of characters and caffine and C4 is no exception. High on my list of world's best coffee house and I have certainly frequented a few.
The conversations are always flavorful as the coffee and on occasion, just as dark.
An absolute must stop if you are in the hood, say hi to laurie and the crew for me.
I will return,
Thanks.
