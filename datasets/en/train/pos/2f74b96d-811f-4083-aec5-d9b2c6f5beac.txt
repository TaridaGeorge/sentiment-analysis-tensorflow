Definitely one of my favorite places. They have the best Chai I have ever tasted. Their Chai is nice and creamy and delicious hot or iced. Much better than Starbucks! C4 has a cozy environment with places to dine or comfy couches to lounge on. The patio is a favorite for locals to sit and chat. Food- I have only tried their breakfast. It is tasty and served with a smile. Their pastries are top notch and the burrito is to die for! I drive out of my way 20 minutes to get there and it's worth it!!
