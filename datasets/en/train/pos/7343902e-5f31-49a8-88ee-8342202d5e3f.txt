WOW.....sometimes a steak is a steak, but not here!  The description of the short ribs had me at "salsify" and Gruyere fondue.  What an awesome meal.  I was hesitant not to order a simple steak,  but with the help of our awesomely attentive and friendly waiter, chose the short ribs.  Melt. In. Your. Mouth. Good. 

I almost glossed over this as dining in a mall isn't my favorite thing to do, but here...you'd never even know the mall existed.  The decor is delightful...felt like I was in Paris or somewhere equally dining elegant.

It wasn't busy, which allowed us to chat with the server.  He made great recommendations and took time to really help us make good choices.
