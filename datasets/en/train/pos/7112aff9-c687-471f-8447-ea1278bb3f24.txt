I take a great class from Dan or Don Jimeda. I just started so cannot recall as its fast paced and we dont waste time socializing but in one class we cover baseline, volley, serving and backhand...so you get a LOT done for the money here. There is a lot of parking too and the people at the front desk are very nice and helpful.
