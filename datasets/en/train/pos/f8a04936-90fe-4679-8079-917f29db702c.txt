being that i'm fully vietnamese and my mom has made all types vietnamese dishes ever since i was a kid, i have quite the tastebuds for authentic vietnamese food. also, growing up in so cal there are a lot more restaurants to choose from. 

for arizona, this place is probably one of the best authentic vietnamese restaurants in town. i always get their pho ap chao....even the owner knows this when i step foot in the door. :) their pho is really great..the broth is good, the beef is good, the noodles are good. everything is like it should be. their spring rolls are pretty decent. what i really like is it doesn't pretend to be something it's not. it's a hole in the wall place, but most good and REAL vietnamese places are. the food is great and the service is quick.
