I thought maybe it would be weird to write a review about an Autozone, but hey, looks like I'm actually behind the game.  My car battery was dead, I decided on this Autozone, and I'm glad I did. Marc was extremely personable and was more than willing to help. He replaced the battery for me, and remained cheerful despite the heat...what more could I ask for? I even learned WAY more about muscle cars and engines than anyone in my position (that is someone who's main requirement in a car is that it runs) should...but, hey...it's nice to see someone who is truly passionate about their life's  work...:)  Anyway, thanks so much...no  complaints here. Reasonable price and great service...Yay!
