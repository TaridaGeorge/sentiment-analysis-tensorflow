I've been a bunch of times for takeout and took a seriously picky foodie friend this past weekend.  Everything I've had here has been excellent and I mean, excellent.  

In the past I've had the margherita pizza, eggplant parm and fried calamari.  All good.  This weekend we had the comp tapenade, beef carpacchio, lasagna and one of the pizzas (can't remember name -- had olives, art hearts, ham and ?).  All delicious.  The lasagna was so delicate but melded perfectly with the sauce.

My very particular picky friend LOVED the place.  Seriously loved it.
