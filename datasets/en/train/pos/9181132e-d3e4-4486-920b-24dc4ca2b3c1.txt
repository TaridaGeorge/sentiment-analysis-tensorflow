I bought four new tires next door at Discount Tire, but they don't align them afterwards and recommended I go to First Class Auto Service. I also needed new front brakes so I walked to Midas across the street to get a price quote. 

I took that price quote to Ray at FCAS and he told me he could beat the price by almost $30. Sold! I was given a ride home so I wouldn't have to sit and wait a few hours.

All in all, it was a good experience. I will call Ray the next time I need any work done on my car.
