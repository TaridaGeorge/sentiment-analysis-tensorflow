I must hand it to them at Olive and Ivy! First rate atmosphere and food.
The pesto is the most flavorful I have ever had and that includes pesto I have eaten in Italy.
Wine selection is terrific. The breakfast, lunch and dinners are wonderful. The bar feels a bit like a meat market but that is the only down side.
It is beautiful, clean and worth returning to again and again.
