I admit, I am not a sushi expert...I will eat some things but not all...and my husband orders for me! However, my husband and kids LOVE it. I mean - they could eat it every night kind of love it! Sushi eye is just a few minutes from where we live and we go there often. They all know my family and are so nice when we come in. Richard, the main sushi chef even makes a special Connor Roll for my son. I have also had the teriyaki chicken there, which was good, too. Great service, great food, make sure you add this to your list of places to try!
