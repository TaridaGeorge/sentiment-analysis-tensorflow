I can't say much about this place because I do the same damned thing every time.  Pull up to the drive through window, smile at the nice lady, order a teriyaki combo or two and some rolls, and peel out with my food in two minutes or less.

I can't imagine it's the toughest thing in the world to make consistently good teriyaki, but I'll tell you what, those people are friendly every damned time I roll through.  And the food is always still hot and delicious when I plop down on my sofa to dig in.  Oh, and the salad dressing for the combo salad is yum.  God, I think this place might have been around back when I was in high school.  Way to keep it rolling!  Five stars, baby!
