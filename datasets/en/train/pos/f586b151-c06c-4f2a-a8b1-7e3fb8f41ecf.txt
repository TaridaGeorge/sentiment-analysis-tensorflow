Great selection and fair prices. We've been shopping here for the past few months, mainly for plants. Totally satisfied with our purchases so far.

We exchanged something without a receipt today and it was returned to credit card we paid with. I understand that if you pay with cash and give your phone number upon checkout you also don't need a receipt. I appreciate businesses that value their customers and allow hassle-free returns and exchanges.
