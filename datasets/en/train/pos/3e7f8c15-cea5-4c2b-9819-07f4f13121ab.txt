What an amazing night! Exactly what every theater experience should be :)

The seats are comfortable, I had a great view of the stage, the show (Daddy Long Legs) was one of the best musicals I have ever seen. Seriously. It was put on by the Arizona Theater Company & from casting to sets, it was impeccable. You will not see traveling shows here & that, in a way, makes it even more fun. 

If you like supporting local businesses & you love the theater, you can't do better than this place!
