I haven't been in Paris Envy for quite sometime, but I was so glad to see that they are still around when I went in recently.

Great mix of Home Decor, gifts, bath & body products, & perfumerie. In fact, they had several items on SALE and I couldn't resist shopping!

SUPER friendly and the store itself is just gorgeous to look at. 

Upstairs is another NEW shop, called "Olive in Paris", which is a higher-end clothing boutique--this place is eye-candy (even if I can't afford the items), the store decor is AMAZING to look at...check out the fitting rooms!

OPEN: Wed-Sat.
