We went on a Thursday around 10:30 and didn't expect a long wait... surprise, surprise, we waited an hour. Other than the wait (which was expected) the food was delicious. Everyone working at Matt's were friendly (they all say goodbye to you as you leave). I definently recommend getting the bacon as a side if it does not come as part of your meal. If you can't stand the heat, order carryout or show up later (at 11:30 there was maybe a 15 minute wait).
