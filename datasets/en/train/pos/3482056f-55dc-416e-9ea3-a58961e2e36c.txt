one of the best hyatt in phoenix.
the nice thing about this place is that the pool is all in one area, so you don't have to run around to look for someone.
yea, its not as great as other resort (hilton has a nicer pool area)
but if you can get a suite, its not a bad spot for a weekend vacation.
the regency club is nice. have a great selection of snack (breakfast, and deserts)
