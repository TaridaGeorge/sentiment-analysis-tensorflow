Houston's is one of my faves---which I cannot believe I am admitting. Who admits to loving a franchise?? BUT...best burger around! (Since Welcome Diner, RIP) I will gladly pay $13 any day for your cheeseburger. Bonus points for a tasty veggie burger, too, as that is a rare feat for a restaurant to serve. 
And, so nice to experience courteous, polite-to-a-fault wait staff.
