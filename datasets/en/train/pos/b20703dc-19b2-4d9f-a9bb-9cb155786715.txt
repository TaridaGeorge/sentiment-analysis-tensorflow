Me and my husband love this village inn. We go here at least once a week for their honey mustard pita club, there is nothing like it. The service here is awesome. We have never had a problem. We also get a pie to go and some times go just to get a home made pie. The sugar free apple pie and French silk are delicious. I would recommend this village inn location to anyone.
