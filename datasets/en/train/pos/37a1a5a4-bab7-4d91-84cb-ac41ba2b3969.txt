Best burger I have ever had. Hands down.

That is what I was told before I went there and without a doubt it lived up to the hype. I had the Nogales Burger and my brother got the Sweet and Spicey. We intended on sharing so we could sample more than one burger. But we quickly forgot about that agreement as soon as we started eating.

Atmosphere was great. Lighting and menus were cool and the front door is unique and just adds a great feel. 

Absolutely delicious.
