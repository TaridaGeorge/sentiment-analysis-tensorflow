I love Vincent and Leevon! I have been going here for at least 8 years and feel like I am at home every time I return. 
The hot chocolate is magnificent. The spinach quiche is the best I have ever had. Coq Au van is my all time comfort food. It is so savory and tender. Allow yourself time to relax and enjoy your meal if you can. Other wise it is still worth it just to pop in for a bite.
