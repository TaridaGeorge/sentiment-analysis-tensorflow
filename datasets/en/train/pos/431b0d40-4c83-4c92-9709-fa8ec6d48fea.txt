I have been to a few spas and this is definitely at the top of the list. It is very spacious. They have thought of every single item that you may need including a hair curler. There is even this shower that pours 5 gallons of chilled water over you after you have used the steam room or sauna. They have the perfect canopy beds to take a nap. This place is like a dream. The shampoo, conditioner, and lotion smell so good that you want to spend your entire day underneath the shower. They have a pool just for the spa. I was a hotel guest and able to use the facilities. I will be back as a spa guest very soon.
