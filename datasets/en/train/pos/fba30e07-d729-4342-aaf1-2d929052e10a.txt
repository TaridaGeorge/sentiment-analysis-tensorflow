I am, once again, reminded how much I love Stickers.  You order your sandwich, it's toasted, and then you order your toppings.  You MUST, however, order your shake at the very beginning or you will be shamed.  The sandwiches and shakes are divine.  The line moves quickly.  And at lunchtime there is always a juror in the line who hasn't been downtown in 5 years and wants to talk about how pleasantly surprised he/she is at the changes.  You can feel like a tour guide in your own city.
