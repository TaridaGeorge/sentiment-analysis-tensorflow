Me: Open-faced baby spinach and goat cheese omelet with sweet potato fries. Hubby: Joe's Special - scrambled eggs with local beef, spinach, and parmesan with sweet potato fries. Food; Scrumptious, especially those crispy sweet potato fries. Service: Perfect with not too long of a wait. Our server kept the coffee coming and checked back occasionally to see if we needed anything else. Overall dining breakfast dining comments: We are very lucky to have such a reasonably priced, delicious cafe choice that offers unique and tasty breakfasts. We will return to try the crepes.
