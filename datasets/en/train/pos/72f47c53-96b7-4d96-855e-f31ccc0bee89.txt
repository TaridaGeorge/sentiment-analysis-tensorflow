Oh I love this place. When a generic Harkins theater closed on Mill, the space could have been converted into more chain restaurants and/or overpriced urbany lofts. Instead we got an independent multi-plex! Not one that shows new indy movies, but one that hosts weekly or monthly screenings of audience participation classics like Rocky Horror, The Room, and Carrie! Plus they have special events with some of the stars - I met Mink Stole and the stars of "The Room" within a single eight-week period.

This place makes me happy. :)
