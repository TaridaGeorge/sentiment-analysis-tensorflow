I'm salivating just thinking about the lobster mash, oh yea the steak is pretty fabulous too. There is not bad to say about this place, go with a big group and indulge in the seafood tower, its a must. The service is amazing, one time my good friend Adam tried to see if he could get his glass filled with ice since the waiter was on top of his water and never let it reach half full. He didn't succeed but also didn't have enough room for the butter cake for dessert! I've eaten at many great restaurants around the world and this one hold a place close to my stomach.
