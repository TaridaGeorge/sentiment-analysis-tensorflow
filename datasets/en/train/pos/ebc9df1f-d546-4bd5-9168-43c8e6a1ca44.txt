I've been to this AJ's several times, and I have to say it's my favorite one of all. My husband loves this rare Brazilian beer and they consistently carry it. Better yet, I can get the six pack instead of the individual bottles because they always have it. The deli section isn't as big as some of the other stores, but who cares. 95% of the time, I'm coming here for alcohol of some sort and they selection of that is just fine.

It's never snobby, the staff are incredibly helpful and best of all, it's like 10 minutes from my house. Perfect.
