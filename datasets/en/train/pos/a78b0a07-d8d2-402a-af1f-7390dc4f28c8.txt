One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and certainly worthy of the Iron Chef.  The decor is kool, without trying too hard - and the food is absolutely fabulous. 

If you're looking for a full-flavored dish, try the spaghetti and meatballs - they are to die for good.  Made with organic tomatoes and hefty, beefy orbs...delicious.
