Great concept and outstanding food.  Our service was fabulous.  My water glass was always filled and our waitress Katrina was extremely helpful.  Diners should go in with an open mind.  Each course is a surprise so if you don't like surprises you will probably be stressed out during dinner.  My wife is a picky eater and not overly adventurous and she absolutely loved it.    Enjoy!!!
