Perhaps the most authentic Chinese food in the area and I wouldn't have expected it looking from the outside of the restaurant.

Definitely try their shaking cube beef which is super tender and flavorful. We order it every time we go there...you'll thank me later! LOL.

For a splurge, have the chef make you the house special lobster which includes black pepper, butter and large pieces of scallion and leak. Very flavorful compared to the normal ginger/scallion sauce that most places make.

We were so impressed with the food that we took our out of town guests who live in San Francisco over there and they were also pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste of the food.

Prices are reasonable. Service has always been pleasant.

I notice they get a lot of take out orders.

We will be back!
