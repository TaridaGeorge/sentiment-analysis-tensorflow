Who in the world can actually BRAG about having an amazing mechanic? I CAN. 

Bob is the real deal. My family has taken a veritable fleet of cars to him over the past decade--Hondas, Toyotas, Mazdas, and a mid-90s POS Nissan. He has helped us with everything from the mundane (window switches, antennas) to the crucial (brakes, transmissions, A/C). His work ethic is unparalleled and he has gone above and beyond for us more times than we could count.

Tip: Don't complain if you find a lone cat sleeping in your back seat when you go to pick your car. It's part of the experience!  

They don't make 'em like this anymore, folks.
