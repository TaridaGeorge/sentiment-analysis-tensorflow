There are many cool things about Kazimierz, from the wine to the food, but then there is also the location.  It's hard to find.  It's tucked away, perhaps on purpose, so you'll want to follow the directions carefully or you'll surely get lost.

Second, the door is wooden and the interior makes you feel like you've stepped into a wine cellar or some sort of cave.  You'll dine and drink by candlelight and the soft sofas and chairs are inviting.

Lastly, this is the perfect spot to come on a date, but it's also great for catching up with pals or for grabbing some wine (they have a HUGE list) before heading to a bar in Old Town. The food menu is nice too and their happy hours specials are great. Check it out!
