I have been to this restaurant about 4 times now since I moved here 3 months ago! Great service and delicious food. If you're looking for pasta, I recommend the big rig pasta. If you like spicy, try the el diablo shrimp pasta-it definitely has a kick to it! The thin crust pizzas are great as well. Last time I went there I ordered brushetta authentic for the appetizer...it was a little too salty for me, but other than that, everything was just right!  Will be going back again.
