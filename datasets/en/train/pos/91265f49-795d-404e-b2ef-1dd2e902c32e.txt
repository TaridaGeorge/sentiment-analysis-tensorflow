this has always been my favorite coffee shop in phoenix.  the organic lattes are the fuel that powers me through this crazy world!

i love the ambiance, the people, the food, the art, the music, the couches and of course the coffee. (these guys roast their own beans incase you didn't know)

i have not had the privilege of dining here yet, but i'm sure it is a wonderful experience like everything else.  jeff has done an amazing job breathing life into the new location.

i truly feel the heart of my community every time i am at lux.
