went here for my bf's birthday and man oh man was it tasty!!!!!!! the bread they serve at the beginning of the meal was amazing...we had a nice bottle of wine, shared lobster and the special that evening with the cajun ribeye, shrimp, potatoes and asparagus.  such a great dinner and it totally takes you back to the mobster days :) 

definitely a nicer dinner out price wise but you can go fairly casual-looked like a lot of people had come over from spring training games!!
