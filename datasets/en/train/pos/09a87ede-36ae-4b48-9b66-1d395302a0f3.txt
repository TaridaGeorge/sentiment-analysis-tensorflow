Maybe I'm just caught up in the moment, but on my neverending quest to find the best sub, I think I finally found it.  I can't believe it took me so long to try this place out, but I'm so glad I did.  I ordered the hot pastrami combo.  At first I thought it was a little pricey ($8.00) but that was before I took my first bite.  It only took one bite and I knew I was onto something special.  It all starts with the bread.  It was fresh, warm and very tasty.  The melted cheese, sauce, lettuce, onion and pastrami were incredible when all rolled into one bite.  Not much else to say except try it for yourself.
