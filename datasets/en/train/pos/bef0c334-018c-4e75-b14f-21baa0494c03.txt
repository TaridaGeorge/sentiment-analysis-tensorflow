You don't even know how many Dairy Queen paychecks I would throw down at Eastside ever other Friday! I swear at least  80% of my income as a young 16 yr. old boy went to this place. They always had what I needed and I also collect vinyl so they have a great collection of vinyl also. The workers are so cool, I use to want to be as cool as they were when I grew up, but obviously wasn't successful. This place still rocks and I am sad that I don't really go anymore cause of my online purchasing habits, but I need to make it back over there.
