If you have never been here, do not assume you will be able to just go in for a quick browse.  Assume a good hour will get you through the major attractions, especially if you have a "Type-A" personality.  It's AWESOME.  They have at least a million things you never knew you needed.  Grab a big cart, and talk to the staff.  They are all smiley, super-friendly!  It seemed like at least half a dozen staff members said something to me in the hour I was there.  I highly recommend this place to everyone!
