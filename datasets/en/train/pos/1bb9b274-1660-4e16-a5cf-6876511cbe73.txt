Waiter was really nice.  Thankyou Tantino for practicing your french with us.  We were pleasantly surprised by a complimentary order of garlic cheese bread.  We both had a Caesar's salad minus the anchovies.  They were fresh and crispy with just the right amount of dressing.  My husband had the canelloni and I ordered the veal parmesan.  Both were delicious.  Portions were more than enough.  After the bread and salad we ended up boxing half if each. The complimentary Amaretto was a nice touch.  We have eaten at many restaurants in Phoenix/Scottsdale but Parmigiana stands out for the extra nice touches.
