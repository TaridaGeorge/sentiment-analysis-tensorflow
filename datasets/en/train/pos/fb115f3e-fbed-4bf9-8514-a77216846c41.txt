Ordered the chicken gyro and my boyfriend ordered an original one. Must say I am not typically a Gyro person but really enjoyed my food. Tasted the original Gyro and it was great.  Everything was fresh and seasoned very we'll. The french fries were fantastic ans the greek salad delicious. Highly recommend this place! P.S. Don't expect top notch service.
