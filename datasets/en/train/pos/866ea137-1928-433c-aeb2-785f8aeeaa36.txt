I'll preface this review, for those of you that take gelato very seriously, by stating that I've never had gelato from Italy, I do not consider myself a gelato expert, nor have I received any certifications, degrees or accolades on the subject of gelato tasting.

Now that that's out of the way... I thought the gelato was excellent. I couldn't choose between vanilla bean and caramello, so I ended up getting two flavors (and believe me, narrowing it down to two took a while as they have a lot of enticing flavors).

Oh yes, and after dealing with the prices at Coldstone for a few years now it was a welcome relief and pleasant surprise that gelato for two only cost about $6.
