When I was a kid my parents use to take us here to kill a few minutes of the day. We were bored to death. But wow has this place changed! My kids love coming here and we spent hours exploring the dinosaurs, gold panning, and playing in the real jail cells (about the only thing I remember as a kid enjoying and they're still here). Highly recommended.
