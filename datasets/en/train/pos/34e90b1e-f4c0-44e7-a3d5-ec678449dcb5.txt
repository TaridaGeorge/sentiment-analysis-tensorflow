It truly is as good as it gets here.

Honestly.

The servers sweep the floor.
The food is perfection
The ambiance is classy without being pretentious
They value and carry forth many native customs, foods, etc

I love Kai.  I think it's well worth the money.
It's more than dinner, it's an experience!
