Amazing!
I ordered the Spinach Tortelloni and the ricotta filling was bursting at the seams, drenched in herb-butter sauce. Oh, it was divine!
We went here on a double-date and sat on the patio. There was no dirt involved, or flies, as some of the reviews suggest. In fact, it was impeccably clean, well-designed and relaxing. We went on a Tuesday night, so it was not very busy.
I am a fan of all Sam Fox's Restaurant Concepts, and this one did not dissapoint! Valet parking was not an issue, if anything it adds to the feeling that you are on a fancy date!
