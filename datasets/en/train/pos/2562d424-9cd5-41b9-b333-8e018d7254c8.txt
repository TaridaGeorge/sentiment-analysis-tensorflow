The original. The best. The undisputed CHAMP of burgers, wings and all things in between in Phoenix. Ron has been serving it up for 30 years.

He's from Buffalo - he knows wings. Everything else - the burgers, the dogs, and even the Indian Fry Bread - are fantastic. Have only $5 for lunch? Ron's got you covered with the Fat Ass Special.

PERFECT to watch football and basketball games in. Great local family crowd. Do NOT settle for imitations - make the trip to the ORIGINAL Long Wong's at 28th St. & Thomas!
