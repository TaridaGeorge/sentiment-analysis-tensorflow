I wish I could put an exclamation point after my five stars. I cannot leave this store without buying at least one pair of shoes. They have something for everyone...every style, size, and price range. You must go check out the clearance rack in the back because you can snag a fabulous deal on typically pricey, designer shoes. They also have a variety of super cute purses, of all colors and sizes. I joined the DSW rewards program and receive coupons and deals frequently throughout the year. Great store!
