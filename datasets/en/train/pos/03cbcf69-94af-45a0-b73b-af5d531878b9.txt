This place is great!  Finally something different to eat on Mill Ave! I was so tired of the shitty wannabe Mexican food on Mill.  I work on Mill avenue so when I heard they where opening a new BBQ place I was already excited.  I would walk by everyday waiting for this place to open it's doors, til finally the day came (last week).  Their award winning smoked meat is the brisket, it was incredibly tender and just melted away with every bite.  Their spicy bbq sauce is made in house, ask for "Matt's spicy sauce":. The Beach Pit takes pride in the food, and serves it with care and great service.  I will be back at least once a week to enjoy some brisket and mac and cheese.  Keep up the good work guys!
