No In-N-Out in Oregon.  Which is probably a good thing, or I'd be weighing in around 3 bills right now.  When I visit the Southwest, a trip to In-N-Out is always a must.  For burgers and fries it's really tough to beat.

Here's another thing I love about it (which I've never seen anywhere else):  when there's a long line at the Drive Thru, they'll send a kid out with an electronic ordering gizmo, who walks out to your car and gets you going on your order.  Genius!  That way your order gets a head start and you (and everyone behind you) aren't waiting for days at the window.
