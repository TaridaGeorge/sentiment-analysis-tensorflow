Cindy and Danny have moved back to Cali to be closer to their family... 
But the new owner(s) are doing a very nice job and a great deal--and you can put gratuity on the debit card!

I've been here many times before and always have a great experience. The  other technicians in Fountain Hills  massage my calves so hard that it hurts! The nail technician gave me a nice foot massage and knew to stop scrubbing my very sensitive and ticklish feet when I squirmed. 

The music that they play is very soothing. I like the hot towel in winter and warm lotion....aaahhh, relaxing.

See you in a few weeks for some festive color, purple today, glittery gold for good luck in the new year!
