service was good.  The server came and did his thing, the drinks were topped off all night, food was super tasty. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and loved it.  My buddy wouldn't even let me try his grilled chicken sandwich, partly because he is a fatass, partly because he said it was so delicious.  Great prices, great atmosphere.
