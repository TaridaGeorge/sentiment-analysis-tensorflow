We love Ted's and the great grilled pork hot dogs plus all there other items but a Ted's hot dog is the best.  Since moving west from upstate NY we are looking for a pork hot dog (not a sonoran but true all pork) like you find at Ted's.  We are in the Tucson area and we really wish a Ted's would open up here.  Does anyone know outside of Ted's where one can find a real pork hot dog in this region? The best we can do now is order from a website called buffalofood.com.  Appreciate any info.Thanks
