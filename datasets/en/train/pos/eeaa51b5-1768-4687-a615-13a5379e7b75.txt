Mesa Amphitheatre is easily my favorite concert venue in the Phoenix area.  You can see and hear from anywhere in the place, and the grassy risers were such a good idea.  The sound was excellent for the two shows I've been to there.  Really just an overall nice, peaceful place to see a show and enjoy the Arizona weather.  Parking isn't too bad and neither are the lines to get in where they check your bags.  To top it all of, getting out of there was a breeze both times I was there.
