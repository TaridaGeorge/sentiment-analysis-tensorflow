I stopped in on my way to work as soon as I read it was open... a delicious chocolate chip cookie with walnuts (I think?) put me in a good enough mood to actually go to work, and my perfect iced latte got me through the night shift. I'm so glad Royal opened up in the Biltmore, that area definitely needs a good coffee spot. And so do I, right on my short commute. :) The space inside is nice, though it's small, I think it is modern and clean and inviting, good for a stop-in and fuel-up, if not a long lingering stay.
