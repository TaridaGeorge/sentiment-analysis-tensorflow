What a twisty great scenic road, with one lane bridges, blind curves, steep drops into the canyon and no guardrails to mar the view. 

Just the kind of road I love to drive on, but this time I was a passenger. I would normally not even get in the car with someone else behind the wheel. K and I both went over a cliff together when we were teenagers and she has the same fear as I do and did not speed. 

This is a great drive and well worth the terror I felt. I would do it again
