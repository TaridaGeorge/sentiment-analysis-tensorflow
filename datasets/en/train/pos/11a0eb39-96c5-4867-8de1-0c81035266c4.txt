Great resort- one of the best in Scottsdale.  If you're looking to be pampered, this is the place.  The rooms and beds are luxurious, and the staff is always there to attend to your every need.  

The pool is awesome too.  It's lots of fun to lay out, tan and drink- very relaxing!  Plus, the servers are easy on the eye if you know what I mean. 

The rooms are pricey, but you're worth it!
