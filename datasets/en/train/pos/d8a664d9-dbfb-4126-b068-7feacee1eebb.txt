got an old school bus but it was well worth the money had to use this as a last minute deal to Las Vegas the phoenix station was not too ghetto but you could tell it was not in the best area but the driver was hilarious some lady overslept and was supposed to go to bull head city wound up waking up in the vegas bus station and tried to flip out on the driver and he let her know haha but listen you gotta do what you gotta do sometime my seat was never snatched when i went to the rest room and my space was respected would suggest you take this as a last resort tho flying is wayyyy quicker ood luck
