i love this place! great service and an affordable lunch special. a good amount of vegan options, but you have to be careful that there is no fish sauce inside of things that may seem vegetarian yet really aren't. i really wish they'd add a little bit more vegan option to the menu, but it won't stop me from showing up. i really like their purple sticky rice, curries and veggie rolls. best thai place downtown.. hands down.
