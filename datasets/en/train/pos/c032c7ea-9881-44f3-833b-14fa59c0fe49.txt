Awesome spot. It has become my regular beer after work place and I love that I can get a great hair cut on the way home. Keep an eye out for their special events when it really turns into a fun place with a DJ and everything. My son comes with me and they take great care of him and always make him feel like a big man....even put his picture on the wall. Friendly staff, great prices and a hip atmosphere that doesn't charge an arm an a leg for the decor or the zip code.
