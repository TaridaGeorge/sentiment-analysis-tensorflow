We went to this hotel recently for breakfast and enjoyed it alot. Its is so vintage you would swear you are back in the 60's...but in a fresh, vibrant, updated way. We sat poolside and I really liked that there was no music playing. At 8am we just wanted to hear "sounds of silence". The food was good, too. Later that night, we returned for dinner and LOVED it! The food was amazing and fresh with vintage oldies but goodies, like the Blue Cheese Wedge with bacon. The service was good but a tad slow, but we didn't care because we loved the place so much. We will DEFINITELY go back.If you love vintage, don't miss it!!!
