REVISED REVIEW:  TRY THE KOREAN PORK SANDWICH....OMG...AMAZING!!

Pulled pork sandwich with a spicy cole slaw...enough said.  It's so freaking amazing and the bread it comes on is local and delicious.  The owner is very friendly and we have always made sure to go back and try other things.  They also have a really good caribbean beef sandwich too.  $7.50 for a sandwich tots and a pc of candy to end.  Its def worth it.
