Crappy location where a lot of restaurants have failed... check it out so it stays open for me! They cook with saffron, aka magic. Seriously, the meat is beyond tasty and extremely tender. This is the best Mediterranean food I've had in the eight years I've spent in Arizona, and the prices are very low, especially when the high-end quality is factored in. $6.99 for the chicken entre? $8.99 for filet? This place cannot be beat!
