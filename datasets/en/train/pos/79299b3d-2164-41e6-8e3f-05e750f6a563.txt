These guys are amazing. Mark Zigler is the tech that I have dealt with twice. Both dents he fixed were perfect. One of the dents was on the body line of my 2 month old 2013 Dodge Challenger right in the driver side quarter panel. It was a dent that was almost impossible to fix with out drilling a hole but mark took his time and worked it to perfection with no hole drilled. AMAZING! I am SOOO happy with there work.

Thanks Mark
