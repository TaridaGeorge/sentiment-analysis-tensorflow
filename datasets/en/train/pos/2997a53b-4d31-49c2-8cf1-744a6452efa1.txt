Just picked up take-out from Zoe's after ordering online. The whole process was super quick and easy. I literally walked in, was handed my order, and walked out. Paid online... It was was great!
Then, the food was DELISH! First time visitor, so I didn't know what to expect.
I'll be honest , I needed hangover food, but wanted to stay relatively healthy. I'm so glad I chose this place. I can see why people love it!
My friend and I shared the chicken rollups with the white beans as a side and the chicken salad sampler plate. Everything was great and I don't feel bad about eating it either. 
I'll be back to try other menu items for sure :)
