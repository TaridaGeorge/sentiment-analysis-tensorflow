I am completely in love with Retro Ranch. I recently re-visited them and was overwelmed at their new LARGER and more AFFORDABLE selection. Sure, I could scrimmage around town and attempt to find great vintage items at local Goodwills, but gosh darn it who has the time?! Or energy?! They have great household items and furnishings and prices that are cheaper than Ikea (and original era items not inspirations). The staff was extremely friendly and the environment was overall comfortable to shop in. I was shocked at how low the prices were, 
and can be sure I will be re-visiting this charming store :)
