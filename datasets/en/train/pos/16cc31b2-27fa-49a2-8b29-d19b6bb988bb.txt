Love this library.  But then I love most libraries.  I mean where else can you walk out with a bunch of books and movies for free with only a promise that you'll bring things back?  I love this one becuase it feels warm and friendly.  Burtan Barr in Phoenix is too open and glass-ey for me. Even though it is so close to work, I choose to drive across town to visit this one.  Keep up the good work Scottsdale!  Love seeing our tax dollars going to a good cause!
