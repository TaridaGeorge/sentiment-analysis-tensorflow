Absolute greatness!!!

Service: friendly

Food: TRY the faux chicken wings (I crave this)
Kung pao noodles
Vegan chilli fries

Ambiance - A+

Tip: don't order the faux chicken wings Togo. Soggy experience plus they add the carrots, cucumber, celery in the box and close it. Equals the case of raw cooked veggies. 

Go next door to nami for dessert!!
