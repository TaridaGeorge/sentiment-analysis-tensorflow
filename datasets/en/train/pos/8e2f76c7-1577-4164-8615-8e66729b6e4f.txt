I bought the LivingSocial deal these folks recently ran, and I am so glad I did!  This was my first time doing Bikram Yoga, and it sure does "humble" you, as Nikki, the manager says.  After about 2 weeks of going on a daily basis (minus a few days), I feel like I am really getting the hang of it.  This studio does a great job to make you feel welcome.  They seem surprisingly busy for summer months, but maybe that's due to the promotions they run on sites like LivingSocial ;)

They have yoga clothes for sale, coconut water, and regular water too.  If you don't have a mat, you can buy or rent one, and they have towels for rent as well.  

Good luck!  This is a great establishment, and I am really happy I found it!
