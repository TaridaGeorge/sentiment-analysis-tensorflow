This place is very unique.  After crossing out frogs legs and veal sweetbreads, I experienced a great meal.  (although others at my table had those).. We went here on Christmas Eve, so it was fairly quiet.  Some of my favorite dishes were the tuna with avocado and some type of gel, short ribs, and butter fish on white asparagus.  Everybody else at the table loved the meal as well.  I like that you can choose how many courses you want.  Most of us had six courses which includes a salad and a dessert.  I will be back for sure, because I know it will be different every time, based on what is seasonal.
