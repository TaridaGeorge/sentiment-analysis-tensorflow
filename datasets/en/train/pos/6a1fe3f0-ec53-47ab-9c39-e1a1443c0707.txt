This is where I go for PHO (a good 45 minutes from my house) even though there is a Vietnamese restaurant up the street from me.  I've recently come to the epiphany that all the good asian eats are in Chandler and Mesa.  I've probably tried out 5 different pho places around the Valley and this one hands down is the best.  Not only is the food legit but this place is very clean too.  Prices are very reasonable and the service is lightening fast.
