So it's Saturday night and you're looking for a great place to have rattlesnake?  Well this is it!  Besides fantastic steaks, etc. they have a really wonderful rattlesnake appetizer.  Tastes kinda like fried calimari.  A little chewy, a little crunchy, and oh so yummy.  They have a strolling guitar player / singer who will cinch the "romantic western Saturday night trying to impress a date" evening.  Sit under the stars and palms and just mellow . . .
