I can't believe it has taken us this long to find this hidden gem of a restaurant! We were made to feel like part of the family by the servers and George and his wonderful family. Every item we tried was prepared perfectly, bursting with flavor and piping hot. The Thai Basil Chicken is a must along with the Kung Pao 3 Seas. I can't enough great things about this place!
