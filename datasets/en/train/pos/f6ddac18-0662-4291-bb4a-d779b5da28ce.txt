As a former ASU Kid, this place was a staple in my diet. The smell is amazing and if you happen to study close by it can easily creep into your classroom. There's always a wait and it's sometimes difficult to get a seat but well worth it. The burgers are a make your own when it comes to condiments, may not seem too spectacular but wait until you bite into one of these mouth-watering gifts from heaven! Anything on the meu is good but two of my favorites are their fried zucchini and fried mushrooms, not the healthiest restaurant out there but well worth it for anyone visiting Tempe and ASU.
