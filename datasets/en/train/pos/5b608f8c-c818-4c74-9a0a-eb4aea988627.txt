Love this place for some great burgers. Beats In and Out, McDonalds and others in my opinion. 
The great selection of sides are nice too. I recommend the cheese curds if you don't mind spending an extra dollar. 
The deluxe is my favorite, but I've had their cranberry salad, concrete mixers, lemon ice and other goodies they have to offer. The lemon ice is especially great during the hot summers. 
They're a little pricier then other fast food joints, but their food quality is far superior.
