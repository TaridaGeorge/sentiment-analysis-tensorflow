Best Cajun food in AZ hands down.  They serve all the usuals, etouffee, gumbo, jambalaya, etc. This is genuine stuff here. The jambalaya is the true rice dish. No tomato or noodles. Gumbo is the best! Cajun shrimp are great and worth getting more garlic bread to sop up the sauce with. Hushpuppies are a good alternative to fries the green olive coleslaw. The Boudin balls are worth trying if you've never had them.
