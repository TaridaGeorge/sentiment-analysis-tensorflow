Hey this place is a classic down town breakfast joint. They sure dont need a A+ review from me, but what the hell. This Place Is Awesome.I love riding my bike to this funky little diner. I always get the breakfast special; this time it was scrambled eggs, ham, fresh jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese, with a side of home frys. Holy Sh** it was good! Everything is super fresh, affordable, and clean. The portions are big, so be mindful of spiting with a friend if so inclined. Also I would recommend getting your delicious food to go and sit in the park just to the south. The wait to sit inside can be very long.
