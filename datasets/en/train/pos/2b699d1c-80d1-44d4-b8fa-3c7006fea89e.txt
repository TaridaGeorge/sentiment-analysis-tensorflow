It was completely slammed while we were there but the service wasn't bad considering.  As is the case with most restaurants converted from old homes, the accoustics were awful and it was very hard to carry on a conversation.  However, the food was excellent!  I ordered a tofu and mushroom banh mi and it was so flavorful and full of different textures that it was just amazing.  Everyone I was with really enjoyed their food.  Can't wait to go back!
