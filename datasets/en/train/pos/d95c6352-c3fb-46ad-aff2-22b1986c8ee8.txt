Just ate here tonight thanks to Yelp - bonus that this place had a Yelp deal.  Amazingly good food, great salsas, everything fresh and tasty!  The owner was there and is the sweetest lady.  Had Carne Asada bowl, Barbacoa bowl, Quesadilla platter (for the kids), two a la carte tacos (Chicken and Carnitas), and the Guacamole Fresco, all excellent.  Highest recommendation!
