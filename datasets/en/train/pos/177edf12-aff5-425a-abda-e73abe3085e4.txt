We've been here several times.  It's the perfect place to go if you are shopping around Fashion Square and looking for great food without overeating.  The small plates and patio make for a relaxing snack.  My favorite is the asparagus, but you can't go wrong with any of the cheeses.  Just be sure to order a plate of crusty bread.
