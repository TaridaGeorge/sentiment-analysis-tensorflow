So we have been ordering Flamingo Palace for the last 15 years believe it or not! One of my first apartments was really close and I worked across the street. Once again I find myself nearby and I've probably had it once a month since I moved in April. I love the crab puffs, potstickers and hot & sour soup among plenty of other things here! Unfortunately my orders have to be without chicken, beef, or pork now but luckily they have lots of seafood and non meat options. This used to be our fancy Chinese food date place if you know what I mean ;) *winkface*

When its rainy like it has been who wouldn't want some yummy soup delivered!?!? You can keep your Chino Bandido I will keep my Flamingo all to myself thx.
