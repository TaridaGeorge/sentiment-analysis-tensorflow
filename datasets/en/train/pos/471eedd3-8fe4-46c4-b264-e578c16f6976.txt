Absolutely delicious :) My boyfriend and I went for my birthday and enjoyed every bite!
We ordered the Cajun combination entree and a seafood po'boy (half catfish, half shrimp).

If I had to choose a favorite, I'd choose the Crawfish étouffée - but I'd have it all again. 

We will definitely be going back. Staff was friendly and place had a nice ambience.
