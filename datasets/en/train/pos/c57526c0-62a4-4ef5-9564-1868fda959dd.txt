I go to this place on the way home from school. Every time, I order the spicy lemon grass chicken with rice. It is really yummy. Lots of flavor and veggies which I love.  However, I dislike like how they give me only one bowl of rice. I love rice! I always order extra and the end up giving me no charge which is great. The waiters and the owner who is the main cook in the back are super nice!
