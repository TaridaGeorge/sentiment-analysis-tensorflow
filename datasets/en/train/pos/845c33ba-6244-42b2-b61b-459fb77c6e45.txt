What a fantastic tuna sandwich (Sicilian Tuna Melt: preserved Sicilian tuna, capers, olives, cheddar, Romesco [sauce], arugula, $10.50) with salad. Very useful for a quick to-go lunch, though a bit higher priced than the average. Great atmosphere; I look forward to eating here and to ordering the pizza.
