Sonora is wonderfully average.

You will never be surprised by anything here, as when they tell you the beer won't be cold because it's casket, it won't be cold. The hot wings are hot, the fresh salads are fresh, and they always cook things to order and are always accurate (mid rare is always mid rare... a rarity!). I love brewhouses so the local brews are delish.

There's nothing surprisingly good at Sonora, but I'll choose it over a culinary adventure almost anyday!
