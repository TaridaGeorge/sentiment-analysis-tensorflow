Veneto Trattoria is out of this world! We went there for a birthday celebration. We had reservations and were seated promptly. The waiter (Matt) was very attentive without being pushy. The food was great, although we all had one of the featured specials that night. In total we spent about 3 hours at the table on a Friday night and never felt rushed. Everyone loved their food.
