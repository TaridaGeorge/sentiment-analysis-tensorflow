Oak's buttermilk pancakes, how do I love thee?Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of Buttery Richness and ideal taste.

I know not how they achieve the salty, creamy, sweet flavor of these humble-looking flapjacks. The perfect crispy brown exterior gives way to reveal the perfect middle that is neither too cakey nor too thin. No need for additional butter and one considers foregoing even the cheap supermarket syrup which rather detracts from the beautiful perfection of the cakes. 

I can't speak for any of the other menu items aside from the fried eggs I order with my pancakes-- perfectly fine, by the way. Just go for the pancakes and forget everything else. Maybe I can smuggle some warm maple syrup in next time I dine there. Hmmm....
