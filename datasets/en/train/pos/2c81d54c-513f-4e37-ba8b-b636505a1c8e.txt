Dig this place. It helps that it is within long-boarding distance of the crib, but even if it wasn't, I'd still make the drive. Granted it is located in a strip-mall, but what isn't down here. Very authentic Chicago-style deli feel to the inside, a handful of booths, tables and a few spots to sit outside on the sidewalk if that's what you prefer. Typically I get the Meatball Parmesan sandwich, the meatballs are fantastic, (that's a good meatball) but I've tried many others including their pizza, all tasty and large portions. They also have the fresh deli counter for meats, cheese, etc as well as many other staples for your home-made Italian dishes, check it out, glad I did.
