One of my favorite late night dinner places.

Generous portion sizes of a variety of steaks! I also love their French onion soup with crisp bread and melted cheese goodness. Their salads are huge and very very reasonably priced. Great place for a date. Also, be sure to pick up one of their dinner mints on the way out. It's the only place that has it! Mint hard shell candy with gooey chocolate in the middle. Love it.
