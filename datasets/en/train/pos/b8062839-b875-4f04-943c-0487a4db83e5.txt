I was going to give this joint 4 stars but my gal loves it!!! So she insisted on the 5 star rating. Good for intimate convos, nice snacks and amazing beer selection. You have to try the Hitachino Japanese beer...fantastic!! 
Ambiance and setting is very unique. The bar is set in a renovated old house with each room set to accommodate small groups in a dark cozy setting. Feels like a sophisticated house party!! Love it.
