I liked this place better than Scottsdale stadium because, well, it felt more like a spring training place than Scottsdale.  Its small and intimate, players feel closer and there's not quite as much of a crush of people because of the smaller size.  Pretty normal food selection, though we had a not so great hot dog here, somehow.  We were always able to park in one of the two lots immediately adjacent to the stadium because we always arrived more than an hour before the game.  Parking was $5.  

There is almost no shade on the lawn areas and people tend to stand around obstructing the concourse in an effort to get shade, which can make moving around hard.  Fortunately, the ushers are pretty good about shooing people out of the way. 

Anyways, I'd come see another game here any time.
