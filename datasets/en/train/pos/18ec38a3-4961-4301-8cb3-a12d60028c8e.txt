I could eat here every day, I think. The curry is my favorite. I like a thicker curry, not soupy. They also get the heat amount just right without sacrificing flavor. Always friendly service. They have so much to choose from, and being a vegetarian my options are sometimes limited in other restaurants. The thai iced tea is perfect.
