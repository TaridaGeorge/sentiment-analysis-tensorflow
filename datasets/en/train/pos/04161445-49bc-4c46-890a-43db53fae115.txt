YUM!!!!!!  This was a birthday dinner with my BFF.  We thought we'd give it a try because of the great ratings here on Yelp.  I was not disappointed!  I got there a little early and the staff was very friendly making sure I was OK until my friend arrived.  We ordered several rolls to try and each one was better than the last.  They were so yummy, I took one home to my hubby who enjoyed it as much as we did.  I will definitely be back next time I get a sushi craving.
