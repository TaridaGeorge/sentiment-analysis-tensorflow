I'm a fan of Total Wine.  In fact, I'm like a kid in a candy shop with all of the craft beers!  And the beer prices are much lower than at the grocery store.  I was craving pastis, the anise-flavored cordial enjoyed by the French in the summer.  Sure enough, Total Wine had it!  Plus, they have a bike rack (extra star & added to the list)!
