Well when you fly from San Luis Obispo, CA to anywhere, your choices are limited. So You end up on US Airways to Phoenix, which is their hub. So I middle up there (as it is neither the end of the beginning of my trips) a lot. The Airport has lots of mini art galleries and great internet, and the book stores do me right, and the food choices are good for an airport. What this means is all my layovers work out just fine and Sky Harbor has taken care of me well! Thanks Sky Harbor.
