I love this park- I recently went and brought my lovely greyhound (Hermione) with me.
We had a GREYT time - lol the park is awesome they have nice shade trees and a place with water for the dogs, plus some well-placed benches. There is an area in the middle which is also fenced in for the smaller dogs. The pet owners I've met there are always polite and friendly. I've heard it is VERY popular EARLY in the morning- so haven't been when it is crowded. It is by far the nicest dog park  I've seen- but then still haven't been to all of 'em yet..
