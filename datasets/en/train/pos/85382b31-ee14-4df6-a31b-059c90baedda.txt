I work 7 days a week, up to 11 hours a day, so my back is often pretty messed up. My boss was referred to American Chiropractic Center by a customer, and suggested I go as well.

I was very pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and price. Only 40 quid to get an X-ray, examination, adjustment and electric stimulation. That's a steal anywhere. I signed up for their adjustment plan that day. With the adjustment, I can get two adjustments a month for just 40 quid. Amazing.

The doctors are very welcoming and professional, and the staff is beyond helpful. I plan on trying their massage services very soon.

I can absolutely recommend this establishment to anyone. I always look forward to my adjustment, and I cannot wait to get back in there.
