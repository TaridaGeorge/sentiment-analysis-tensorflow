This is a very friendly little restaurant with excellent pizza.  We have become regulars on Wednesday nights because Wednesday's are half price wine day! (all bottles of wine are 50% off).  But beside the allure of half price wine the atmosphere is nice and the staff seems like a family that cares about the business.

Pizza is fantastic and they offer lots of different toppings.  My favorite when I am in a meat mood is sausage and fresh garlic.  My wife and I ordered individual sized pizzas for the first time yesterday so we could each get our own toppings.  Combined with their giant salads the lil' pizza as they call it was very filling.  

Spinato's also offers to go and delivery service.
