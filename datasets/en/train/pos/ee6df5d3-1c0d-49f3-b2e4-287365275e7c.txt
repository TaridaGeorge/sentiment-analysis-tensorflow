I brought my bf with me to Jamba Juice and he had never been, the girl behind the counter was very nice, helped my boyfriend find something that he would like. Her name was Ashley i would have thought she a manger, she had GREAT customer service come to find out that she is only 16! I have never meet someone so young that has such great customer service! She knew what she was talking about, and  made our drinks perfect! I hope a manager sees this post and she gets the recognition she deserves :)
