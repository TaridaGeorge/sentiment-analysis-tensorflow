I can't say I've had a bad experience here yet. 

Sprouts always seems to have a good selection of organic produce for the price they are offering.

The bread basket granola is moist and amazing-hard to find in other stores, but Sprouts carries a variety of flavors in their bakery section.  

The dog food is always priced lower than I have seen it in other health food stores like whole foods. 

This is not too big or distracting of a store and it is easy to get in and out of!
