Lunch boofay the other day with my brother and his coworker was one of the best tasting lunches I've had here.

My recommendations: 
ask for Garlic Naan instead of plain, but be ready for fresh garlic breath all afternoon.

Go several times, since the about half of dishes they have out vary from day to day.  I've discovered that sometimes I'm not a fan of the items, but have been glad to try new things, since I've also found some unexpected gems. (don't expect me to remember the indian name, though)

Don't worry about crazy gimmicky coupon sites that just want to spam you all day.  This food is superb at the fair price they charge normally.  The owners are great, and staff is friendly and eager to serve.
