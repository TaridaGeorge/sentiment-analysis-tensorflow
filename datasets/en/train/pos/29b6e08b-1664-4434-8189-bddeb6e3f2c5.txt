Alas our air conditioner did not work this year, and I had to get it repaired.  I called a company the listed first on Google Search (Ace Air) and had a less than pleasant experience.  I then called American Air and appliance.  What a major difference!  Bridgette in the office was exceptionally helpful and they dispatched Micheal to my home within an hour.  After tracking down the leak (that Ace wanted to charge me an additional $250 for) Micheal explained to me the nature of the problem and gave me a total run down on the charges. After a call to the office, he repaired the issue, recharged the system and presented me with the bill.  I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the cost was!  I will never call any other company other than these guys again for my a/c repairs.  Top notch!
