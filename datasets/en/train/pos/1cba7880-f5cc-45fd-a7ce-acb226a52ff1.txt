Have been here many times with family and/or friends since my first review. Consistently terrific Italian food with a varied enough menu to make everyone in my party happy! Lunch is still a fantastic deal. For less than $7 you get a large salad with meats and cheeses, fresh bread, and your choice of pasta options. Service has always been top notch. 
Questo Ã¨ il mio posto preferito per mangiare Italiano! (This is my favorite Italian place to eat!)
