I had high hopes for this one from the start, seeing as how I found it on Yelp, and it had nothing but great reviews... well, my fellow Yelpers didn't let me down! WOW, I will be coming here very often. I got the Chicago Gyro, my other half got the Chicken Gyro, and we split the Cilantro/ Jalapeno hummus. Everything was fresh and REALLY delicious... and CHEAP. They even had passionfruit tea and lemonade for the most amazing Arnold Palmer to ever touch your lips. Nice staff, clean restaurant, lots to choose from... you just can't go wrong!
