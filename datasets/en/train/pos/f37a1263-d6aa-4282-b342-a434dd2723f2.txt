Most everytime I've come here its been for tea, work and the people.  Every place has to have something to keep bringing you back and its definitely humorous to see the scholar to the punk ska come in for their daily caffeine fix.  I like staff that a mix of personalities and I'm totally sold on the tea selection.  Not too heavy with coffee so I can't throw down on how amazing or lack luster it is.  Assuming with the crowds its prob pretty damn good!  At times when it's busy bring the earbuds but when you have a large cafe with lots of people that's only expected!
