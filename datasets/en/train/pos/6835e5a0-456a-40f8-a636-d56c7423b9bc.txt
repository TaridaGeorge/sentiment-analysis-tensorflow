A nice place.  A little hidden, but worth the search.   The service is excellent from the moment you walk in.  Try the watermelon salad to start.  I am not fond of watermelon and I enjoyed it.  The pork and swordfish are amazing.  The custard desert wasn't great, but the chocolate cake was tasty.  Also a nice bar.  The wine list was a little on the light side, but they had a decent selection.
