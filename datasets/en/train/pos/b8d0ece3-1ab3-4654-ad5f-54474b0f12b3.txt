If you own an Indian restaurant you food has to be terrible or your service has to be awful to get a bad review from me.  This place I found while driving to a customers house and needed to eat lunch after my appointment.  They seated me right away and, as usual, I went right for the buffet and served myself a big plate.  I love seeing how each place I visit makes their version of my favorite dishes which is almost everything on the buffet.  This place, however, is the first place I've been to where they have a type of bread I've never had.  It's like a crepe with spicy potato in it.  It was so yummy.  Try it all and don't miss out on all the staples; sag paneer, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry, dal mak, chana masala.  Enjoy!
