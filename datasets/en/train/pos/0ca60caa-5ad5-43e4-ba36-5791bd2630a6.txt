The menu is fantastic. Healthy, organic, simple dishes that are portioned well. There were many items that I wanted to try, so I'll have to go back. I decided on the ahi tuna sliders with kale salad and my friend got the spaghetti squash casserole. We also ordered "the natural" to drink which is one of their fresh "elixirs". This one was made with ginger, agave and soda water. We each had two.
We both enjoyed our meals very much-I have no idea what type of dressing was on that kale salad, but I think I liked that the best.
The staff was very nice and attentive, they also let us sit and chat after we paid the check without giving us dirty looks. The decor is simple and spa-like with an open floor plan. They also validate if your park in the lot out front.
