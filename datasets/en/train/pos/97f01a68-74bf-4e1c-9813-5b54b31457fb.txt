I just have one question.
Dave, Kristin and Jared...

Did you REALLY like my chilled Patron with fresh fruit shot? Really now. Don't hold back. I have the FEZ Foodie cards for the chef. But what about me? It isn't fair. Isn't that a bad song from the late 80's? I digress. Thanks for showing up y'all!  Hope you had fun.
