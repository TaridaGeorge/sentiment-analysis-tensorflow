This is our new favorite place. The food and drinks are great.  On our first visit, they gave us a card for a free appetizer or dessert. So we went back on Sunday, 8/12, and on top of the free appetizer, we were given a manager discount of 20% off! My fiance loved the tortilla soup. I loved the cheeseburger on brioche bun. The salads are innovative. Can't wait to go back!
