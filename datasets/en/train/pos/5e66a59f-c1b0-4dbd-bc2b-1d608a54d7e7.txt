The best Chinese food in town. I lived in China and I can truthfully say this is the real deal. Authentic, fresh, and flavorful, and just as a bonus, INSANELY cheap. I eat there all the time and I am STILL in awe every time I get the bill.

The staff is also so wonderful. Very friendly and accommodating. The ambience is extremely lacking, which adds to the charm, in my opinion. Total hole-in-the-wall, diamond in the rough. Doesn't get much better than Asian Cafe Express.
