This a great bar! It has a good vibe, crowd, and jukebox. I like to come here during my visits to Phoenix on any night of the week. The staff is pretty cool too. My best friend and I have been coming here since they opened. They deserve the awesome business that they always seem to have. 3 cheers for Shady's!
