We first met Chris and Rosalee Eles in their previous location about 10 years ago.  Once you feel comfortable with a jeweler, you can be sure that you are well taken care of.  We have always felt that the quality of work done by Chris is impeccable and if there are any changes to a custom design, Chris handles it with vision and professionalism.  I get compliments on my ring weekly.

Lately, our whole family has become interested in Pandora designs and Charms.  We were thrilled to find out that Crown Fine began carrying the whole line and can order anything that might have already sold.  Rosalee has become extremely knowledgeable about the styles for Pandora and we are grateful to have some who knows what is happening on our behalf.

Woohoo! As good as it gets!
