Great, fresh food with a pretty varied menu sure to please many. Gotta love the retro island decor inside, too. I munched on a rice bowl, filled with crisp veggies, brown rice, and tofu. The teriyaki sauce is very flavorful and just the right amount. The mango iced tea was delicious, too. Friendly staff to boot.
