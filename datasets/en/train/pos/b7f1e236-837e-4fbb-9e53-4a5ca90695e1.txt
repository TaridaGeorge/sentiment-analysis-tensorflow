Wow, this place is phenomenal.  You wouldn't even know you're in a tattoo shop by the looks of the place.  Impressive portfolios, artwork and artists.  The walls are lined with gorgeous framed art, most done by the tattoo artists themselves.  I noticed many of them have also won awards for various competitions.  Bruce created my body art and was really patient with this first timer.  He drew up exactly what I wanted....I was in awe.  We completed the masterpiece in three sessions and honestly it wasn't all that painful.  Bruce is an accomplished professional and very talented.

I will definitely return when I'm ready for my next piece.
