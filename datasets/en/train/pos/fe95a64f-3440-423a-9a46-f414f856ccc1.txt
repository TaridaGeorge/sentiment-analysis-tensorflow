It only took one time for this fun little sandwich crafter to get on my must do when in...list!  The menu offer a nice verity of stuffed sandwiches, beverages, and deserts!  I took the Western for a spin, and was blown away!  You get your choice of thick sliced fresh baked breads, tons of gooey, melty, delicious cheese, grilled green chillies, and a small side salad.  I can say without hesitation that this was the best grilled cheese I have ever consumed!  The peach tea was my beverage of choice, and it was just as good!  My only wish for this place would be that it was located closer to my home!  On second thought...my doctor might disagree.  Great food, real reasonable prices for the high quality, and the typical friendly folks of Wickenburg make this a must stop!
