Over 100 different types of beer from all over the world to choose from, including some brewed by Papago (try their Orange Blossom!); great, friendly staff and patrons; excellent food (It's no Roy's, but the food is pretty damn good for a brewery); comfortable ambiance; amazing prices.  What more can you ask for?  

If you come to Scottsdale, this place is worth a visit, especially if you're a beer aficionado!
