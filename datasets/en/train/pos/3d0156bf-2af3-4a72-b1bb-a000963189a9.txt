This place has the best Thai food in Scottsdale.  It is located downtown and has lots of free parking right out front.  I have been there three times (once for lunch and twice for dinner) and each time I try something different.  So far I have not been disappointed.  It is a small place but is nicely decorated.  It has a full bar and you can sit at the bar if you wish.  Today I had Chang beer (from Thailand) for the first time and it was great.

Very friendly people that speak good English.  Definitely worth the drive from anywhere in the area if you are looking for great Thai food.
