I am not a coffee person at all, but their passion fruit tea with lemonade is so freakin good! Every couple months or so me & my hair stylist come here while my hair color is setting, so yes I have come here more than once with foils all over, I'm cool like that. Besides that yummy drink mentioned above they have awesome treats like these mini birthday cake donuts, marshmallow dream bar, iced lemon pound cake & the cashier lady told us their vanilla bean scones were to die for. If I am in the mood for them, I also do enjoy the caramel & vanilla bean frappucinos.
