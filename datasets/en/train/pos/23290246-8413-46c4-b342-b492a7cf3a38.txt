The Shopping center it's in is great, so many choices. This place is very very good. Simple meals done fresh. The service was fantastic. I don't often eat Thai and the waiter took all the time I needed to answer questions, check on us, and keep our drinks filled. Very good prices. Going back again this weekend!
