Great place to go for lunch or happy hour.  The place is always packed and has a nice atmosphere where you feel like you can kind of tuck away into a booth for private conversation...OR you can sit up closer by the bar where more of the action is.  I had the delicious jalapeno appetizer and the even better mac&cheese meal.  The owner is a great guy too.
