I LOVE this place!  The choice of bagels are amazing, there as so many selections of cream cheese, the place is adorable and the staff does a great job!

This is a "mom and pop" owned cafe and I really like supporting local & family owned businesses.  It's so important to support our neighborhoods and community.  

They do a delicious bagel turkey sandwich with melted cheese and tomatoes! It's faaaaaaabulous!!

LOVE Lox, Stock!  Keep up the great work!
