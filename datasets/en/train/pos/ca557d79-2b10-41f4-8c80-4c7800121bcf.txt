We've been going to Sabuddy (they tell us it's pronounced "suh-BUDdy") for several years, and the place has definitely kept its hometown charm, even as its popularity has increased -- as, necessarily, have its prices, to meet demand. It's still gives you some of the best bang for your buck in town -- some of the best-tasting food, as well as generous quantities of it! The servers are usually pretty friendly, and they will give you recommendations to your taste. We can never eat it all, and always box it up for have delicious leftovers the next day. It beats pizza, burgers, and your usual fare for flavor and healthfulness to be sure!
