Still my favorite restaurant in Phoenix area, hands down, no question.

Charleen Badman is just amazing and can make any vegetable just delicious, and make it look easy!  I love that their menu is changing with what's seasonally available, it's always fun to try the new items.  We enjoy going here SO much and try to go at least once a month if not weekly!!  Love love love FnB!!!
