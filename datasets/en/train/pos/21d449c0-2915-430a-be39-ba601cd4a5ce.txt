Really........FOUR stars on the previous review Kristi....realllllllllyyyy?

The food and drink, as always, is on point. Occasionally, they make small changes to the bruschetta menu which I enjoy because hey, who doesn't like to try something new when you're pretty confident it's going to be AMAZING! Helloooo Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes!!

There is some kind of crazy love vortex (minus the twisted trees) surrounding this Postino location. Seriously, everyone else disappears. Don't plan a date here unless you are prepared to eventually propose or accept said proposal. 

Don't say I didn't warn you.
