I am so impressed! I thought everything out here was just strip malls and chains. It made finding the place a little difficult. I didn't expect one large free standing building surrounded by desert, trees, and picnic tables.

I walked in and was even more impressed. This place had options. The coffee shop is simply under the same roof as an olive mill. In one corner there are outstanding breakfast and sandwich options, gelato and pizza in another, and locally pressed olive oil sold in the center.

The coffee, was great and the ambiance superb.
