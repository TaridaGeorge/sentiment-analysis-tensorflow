Tonight I was hanging out in the Tapas bar for #evfn (east valley friday nights). This is not my first time, and every time I attend I wonder why I can't get there once a month for this great event. It is SO worth it! They have special offers for #evfn guests, and the food is amazing. You can pretty much get whatever you want from the many different "restaurants" inside the store. As well as the alcohol- just go grab a bottle of your favorite brew and they will serve it to you. As for the grocery store itself- well you can't get a better collection of specialty and organic foods. Now they just need to open a store out in the Gilbert area! Whole Foods are you reading? I want to give you more of my money, but you need to be closer!!
