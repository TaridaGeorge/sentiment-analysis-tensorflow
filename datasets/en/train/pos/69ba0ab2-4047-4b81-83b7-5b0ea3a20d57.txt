delicious food for a great price. would rather go and get in n out then other fast food places. its a bit far from us then other fast food places so its usually not an option but we love in n out burger! the food is always fresh and tastes amazing. make sure to ask for spread for the french fried. its delicious!! also the lemonade is amazing! this place is usually packed during lunch since its located near desert ridge mall but its worth the wait when you want a fresh burger and fries.
