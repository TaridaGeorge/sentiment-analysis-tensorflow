What an outstanding opening party today... on St. Patty's day, none the less!
They opened for a select group of visitors from 2-6pm today and it included wine/beer and bruschetta for a cost of $25.  What a way to start off in the neighborhood!

I noted an excellent staff - friendly, prompt, and definitely well prepared for the onset of traffic that has been long awaiting the opening of this place.  Even when there were gobs of people in line for food and drink, they were kind, smiley and very up-beat.

The food was, as always, outstanding.  Great bruschetta variety and an impressive display of wines.

I'm excited this opened up in our neighborhood and I can't wait to come here again!
