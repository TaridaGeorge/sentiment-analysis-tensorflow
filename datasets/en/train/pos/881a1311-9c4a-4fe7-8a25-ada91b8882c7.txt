JAM!  I've been a JAM artist for more than a year and i have watched Shauna turn this delightful little shop into a safe haven for fun activities, girlfriend gatherings, friend making, crafting, food fun, learning how to do just about anything you can imagine all with her delightful smile and spirit.  With summer and heat upon us, we sure hope you can stop and visit and check out our handmade gifts of all styles and price ranges.  Bring your friends and enjoy this sweet little house on 1st Street.
