I loved this place at first sight for its incredible selection of craft beer and booze. But now that I've eaten here, I'm doubly impressed. I made a visit here with co-workers for a late lunch, and since we are all beer afficionados, we spent some quality time browsing the selection proudly displayed in the shop's extensive glass-door coolers.

I had some wonderful pork sliders, whereas my cohorts opted for the hot Italian sandwiches. The folks working here are super friendly and helpful and will even tolerate long rants about beer and whatnot from our little group of random bastards.

This is a great place to shop for that otherwise elusive brand of liquor or wine. Of note, they carry Junipero Gin (distilled by the founder of Anchor Steam Brewing, Fritz Maytag) and Pim's No. 1 (for those who like an occasional refreshing Pim's Cup). Pip, pip! Cheerio!
