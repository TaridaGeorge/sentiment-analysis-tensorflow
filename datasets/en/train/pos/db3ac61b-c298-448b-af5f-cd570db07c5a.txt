Since I moved a few miles away, this has become a neighborhood favorite of mine.  The sandwiches are pretty good, but the bread is really what makes the deal.  Everything's on their in-house Italian bread that's really well made.  Go with the classic- the Italian sandwich, and get a couple smileys (what they call their small size).

Added plus: the staff is very friendly too.  Worth stopping in if you're in the neighborhood for lunch and in the mood for a good Italian sub!
