Sarah's literallly THE best!! I've been her client for years now back when she used to work in Gilbert. I'm so happy that she finally opened up her own shop in chandler. It's a little far from my house by it's totally worth it! She really knows what's she's doing, and never ever disappoints. The salon was completely remodeled from before and it looks AMAZING. They're are still decorating the place it seems but as of right now, it's a clean relaxing and fun salon. Sarah really talks to her clients and her niece is the sweetest thing. Walk ins are welcome too which are a lifesaver!!!  :-)
