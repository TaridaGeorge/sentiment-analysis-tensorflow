WOW.  This places is incredible.  I can honestly say that everything on the menu is wonderful.  It's the perfect date place, since you can order booze to cure the date jitters.  Also, you can satisfy your dieting girlfriend and still order a big plate of "man food".  The best part about their menu is the fact that it is SO TASTY with being HEALTHY.  The extra care in picking ingredients, grilling/cooking with little fats, and unique spice combinations truly makes PJ stand out.  The decor's nod to local artists also helps make the dining room an enjoyable place to be.  For a perfect healthy and satisfying vegetarian lunch I recommend the following:  A small Greek salad with an order of the jalape√±o or roasted red pepper hummus (PS:  they'll let you order the hummus half and half!)
