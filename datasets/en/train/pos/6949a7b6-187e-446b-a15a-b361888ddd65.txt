The pesto pizza is amazing....:)

I've been here twice and have walked out much happier than when I walked in.  Great food and atmosphere. 

Now, I am not one who normally goes for pizza.  Most days of the week I'd much rather have sushi, a gyro, or jimmy john's (I'm all over the place).  After having the pesto pizza, I could have pizza twice a week, maybe more.

Salads are equally fantastic.  The parlor insalata is one of the best salads I've ever had.  I want to try others, but it's just too damn good.

Great restaurant for a date or with a group of friends.  I'm moving closer to The Parlor in a few months.....I may be showing up a few days a week now:)
