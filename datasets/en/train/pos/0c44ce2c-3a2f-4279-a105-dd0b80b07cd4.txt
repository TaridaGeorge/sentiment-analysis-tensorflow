My wife and visited Four peaks for dinner this past Saturday on a date night and it was out of this world.  
The food was amazing the server was attentive without being annoying and the beer was perfect.  I tried the flight and really liked the hop knot and the 8th ST.  (Kiltlifter is already in my beer hall of fame club).
My only complaint, open a resteraunt on the west side and save me from Rock Bottom and Gordon Biersch.
