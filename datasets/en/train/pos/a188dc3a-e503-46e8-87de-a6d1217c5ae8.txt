Wow from me!  We were delighted to enjoy a wonderful time at Marcellas this evening.  Food, attmosphere, and service was fabulous.  We sat in the Bar with a table of 9 and got outstanding service from Brittney our bartender/server.  She was very busy and still made us feel so welcome and good.  Great pizzas for apps. And then wonderful entrees.  I loved the stuffed mushrooms and Marcellas house salad.  Nice job Marcellas!  Thank u for a great Birthday celebration!
