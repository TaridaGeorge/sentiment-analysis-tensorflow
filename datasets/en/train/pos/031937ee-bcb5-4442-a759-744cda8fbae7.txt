Opera is Fun! Yes it is! 
Tosca yesterday was amazing! I was riveted through the whole thing - and at almost 4 hours (including 2 intermissions), that's saying something. I was wowed by the singing, enjoyed the sets, was impressed by the acting, and intrigued by the story. Floria Tosca was superb, Scarpia and Spoletto deliciously evil. Honestly, I did not expect to LIKE opera as much as I have, but I've been enthralled with both AZ Opera performances I've seen this year (The Mikado and Tosca), particularly Tosca. 
After the performance an opera Q&A session was held for anyone wishing to stay. The AZ opera head and tenor James Flora answered questions about everything from the set, the director's mindset, the Spoletto character's triumphant ending, and the future of opera in the United States.
