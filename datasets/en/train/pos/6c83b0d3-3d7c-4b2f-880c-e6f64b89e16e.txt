My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday evening. We had about a 30 min. wait which we spent in the bar w/ a good glass of wine. 
We were seated and promptly greeted by our waitress. She was friendly and quick. 
We split 2 pizzas, had a bottle of wine, and the Nutella Crepes. Everything was delicious!! 
At the end when we received our check, we were pleasantly surprised at how affordable the meal was. 
From start to finish, we loved this restaurant! The ambiance, food, and service were impeccable. We will definitely return!
