I have recently found Italian BLISS and have since given birth to an Italian "food baby" and proudly so. I grew up in "Little Italy" in Toronto (boasting the largest Italian population outside Italy!!)....so let's talk salami: I was like a little kid in a candy store steaming up the charcuterie counter window....prosciutto, parma, sausages, bresaola....and so many delicacies that I can only pronounce after some Italian wine! 
Upon entering, the English language dissappeared and I was soon transported to Italy - the language, the cuisine and LIVE music!! ....Bellissima!!
I successfully made it to dessert and found happiness in sfogliatelle and soon learned the art behind every layer of phyllo. It was worth every little bit.
