Go see Amanda at Pure Elements Salon.  She does a great an amazing job.  She was very nice and helped me with suggestions on what to do with my hair.  She colored it, cut it, and styled my hair and is reasonably priced.  The salon was really clean and I felt so comfortable.  I left with a smile on my face and I will be going back to see her again.  I would highly recommend her!!!!
