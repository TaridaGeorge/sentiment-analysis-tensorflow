It's a great place to go for all your pool needs, any advice is given with concern & a sense of caring for your questions by all & any of the staff. Also, I drove up on a Sunday about 5:30pm, not knowing they closed at 4, Steve & Bonnie were still inside, saw me & as I was about to drive off, they motioned me to come in anyway. Very happy that they are across the street from me! The HASA products they carry are the best I've used so far, I will only use HASA chemicals & will only buy them at Steve's! Thank you Steve & Bonnie!
