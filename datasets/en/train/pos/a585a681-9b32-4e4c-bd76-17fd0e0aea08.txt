I moved out here from Boston last October and I can't say how relieved I was to find that there was still at least one indie record store.  Back home, I spent time every weekend browsing at Newbury Comics, which expanded to a chain in New England but kept the same feel to it.  

It's just nice to see that iTunes, file sharing, Best Buy, etc. haven't completely shut down this type of shopping.  For some, running in to grab a cd and run back out is what they're looking for.  If you're like me, this is a way to unwind in a laid back, albeit cramped, environment with good music and a knowledgeable staff.
