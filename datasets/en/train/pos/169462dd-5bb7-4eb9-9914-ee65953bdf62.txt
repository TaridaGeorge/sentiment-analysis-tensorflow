Coming from out of town, I always see what people on Yelp have said about good restaurants.  This one popped pretty high on the list, so I was excited to try it.  
I was not disappointed.
Portions are generous.
Quality is superb.
Wait staff is focused on making sure you have a good dining experience.
Price is very reasonable for the quality/quantity and atmosphere.
Had the House Salad, Old Monkeyshine Nimbus beer (excellent Tuscon, AZ brew) and the ilTagliere (sampling of meats, cheeses and veggies).  Every bite was fantastic.
Their focus is pizza.  They only serve pasta a few nights, and last night was not one of them, so I'll be back to try the hand-made pasta.  I can't wait.
