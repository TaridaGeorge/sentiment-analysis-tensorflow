Wings are amazing!!!  The pizza is pretty good as well.  They also have a good happy hour and a lot of different beers on tap and in bottles.  Make a delicious/strong rum and coke!  I would definitely recommend this place.  It can be crowded at times in the bar, but I have always been able to find a seat within a matter of a few minutes!  Definitely recommend giving it at try!
