So the resort is great, can't say anything bad about it.   Sure, the Gondola ride is kinda cheesy I admit, but come on, it's pretty unique for the feakin desert.  Live music is usually pretty good grown up flamenco stuff, hey what ever happened to ESTEBAN?   

Wanna go out for a drink, but not to a bar, or a club, or a dive, why not try a resort sometime. What, this is Arizona ya know.
