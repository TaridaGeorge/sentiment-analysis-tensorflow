Another night at the Parlor in the books.

1 primavera mitsi, 1 caponata bruschetta, 2 small pizzas (1 yukon gold & 1 pepperoni), 2 small salads (1 spinach salad & one farm greens); and that concludes another evening in paradise. 

The Parlor is by far my favorite spot in the Phoenix/Arcadia area. If you haven't been there yet than you'd better get sum!
