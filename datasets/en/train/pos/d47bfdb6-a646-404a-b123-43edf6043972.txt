I have been to this Firestone about 4 or 5 times and each time I have had a great experience.  My car has been less than reliable lately so they know me by name at this point.  I have frequented Firestone for tire checks, oil changes, and fuse checks too.  They are always really consistent and trustworthy.  If you need a auto care place to rely on...this one is it.  Especially this location, they are the bomb!
