I always thought that east coast (Long Island, New York)  bagels were the best until Lox Stock & Bagel moved to McCormick Ranch.  Absolutely delicious!!  NY can't hold a candle to their products especially their bagels and bialys!
We have had their bagels,breakfast ,  lunch items, etc.  No other place in the valley can  compare to their always fresh and deeelicious food. 
Excellent service, never a wait.  Best coffee in town!! 
Once you try LS&B, you won't go to another bagel shop.  J.S.
