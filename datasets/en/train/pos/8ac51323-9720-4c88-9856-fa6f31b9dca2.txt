I love IKEA! I don't go as often as i'd like. I havent been to IKEA in years and when i went yesterday it was wunderbar!!l 

I was reminded of why i like IKEA, lots of new stuff over  the years. Definitely will be coming back with more money to shop for my new place!!

p.s. i love the funny looking swedish names for the items
