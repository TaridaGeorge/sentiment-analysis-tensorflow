This place is hidden away in a little strip mall but SO great!. It is super clean inside.They have lovely padded highchairs for the baby.  There is a window to the kitchen where you can watch the very nice man (he always waves and smiles to the kiddos) pulling your noodles to order right when you ask for them. It keeps the kids happy and busy watching him twirl and stretch the dough. The portions are big and inexpensive.
