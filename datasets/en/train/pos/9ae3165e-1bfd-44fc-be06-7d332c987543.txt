Ugh, some of the best pizza in town.  Just moved to the 'Slope in 2011 and this place has added a couple of pounds to me for sure.  Chicago style thin crust, square cut deliciousness.

Ever miss that smell that pizzerias used to have?  The kind that made you so happy and hinted that there would be a Pacman machine in a table top?  That's what this place makes me feel like.

I LOVE the Spicy Italian specialty pizza, and even though it sounds weird, you just have to try the Spaghetti and Meatballs Calzone.  Ask for it with Ricotta, you'll thank me!
