I love local gems like this, the food is made with love and wholesome ingredients, which is rare now a days. If you are a veggie or vegan this is a great alternative to the same ol' places you've eaten at a zillion times. Please check them out and support small, local businesses- these are what makes Phoenix unique and wonderful.
