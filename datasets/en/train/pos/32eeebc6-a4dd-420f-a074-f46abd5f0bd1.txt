Buffet is super cheap.  You have to know what to order to really fall in love with the food.  

We started coming here about 5 years ago, we LOVE this place.  My kids are so excited when I come home with take out and my 4 year old knows no other chinese place except hong kong!  We don't speak the language but they remember their customers and we always get a smile!  

Sometimes when my husband and I go, the waitress says "hey, where are your boys?"

Order the "sesame chicken" and the "mongolian beef" (extra spicy), shrimp fried rice and crab wontons.  Haven't had it better anywhere else!
