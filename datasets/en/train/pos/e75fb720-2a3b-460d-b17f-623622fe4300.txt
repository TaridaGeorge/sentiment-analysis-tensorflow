Old Town has a new kid on the block.  I've been to 5th and Wine twice now and I must confess I love this place.  

Happy hour specials are fantastic -- $5 wines and $1 bruschetta (per piece), among other fantastic appetizer deals.  Speaking as a Postino loyalist, this place will give it a run for its money.  Postino doesn't include food in its happy hour menu, and Postino's happy hour ends much earlier (5:00 I think).

The first thing I noticed is how the owners know what they are doing.  As a new place, it's important to generate positive buzz with quality food/drink, great service, and pleasant atmosphere.  On both visits my servers went above and beyond the call of duty.

Great wine selection, too -- and some wines by the glass are $5 regularly.
