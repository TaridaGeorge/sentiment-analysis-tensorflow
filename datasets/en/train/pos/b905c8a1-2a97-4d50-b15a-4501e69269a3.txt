Came here with the Bachelorette party for some appetizers to tide us over since dinner was not till 7:30. Managed to come right as happy hour was beginning (3pm to 7pm). Had a couple of drinks (mango margarita was amazing), calamari, Vegas roll, and rainbow roll which we split. Everything was terrific. The calamari was sooo tender and I loved the batter on it. SInce we came for happy hour, everything was cheap and it was a great start to our night out.
