Today, my nine month old daughter and I drove to Phoenix for a baby shower. On our way there we got rear ended. While there was no visible damage, my car refused to start again. AAA towed us to Advanced Auto, and it was the best decision of the day. They were kind, courteous and seemed genuinely concerned with my plight. They ran all sorts of tests and couldn't figure out what was wrong with my car (which started once they got it off the tow truck). However, they wouldn't let us leave until they had made sure that we would make it back to Tucson. They were amazing and we made it home without a worry.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.
