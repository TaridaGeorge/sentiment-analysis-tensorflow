I drove through mad crowds on 4th of July to have my burger there. And it WAS worth it. 
Tasty Fez burger with a heap of sweet fries (Thomas, who IS on your fryer??? Give that person a raise. Those are probably best fried fries to my taste!!! Yummm..... ) and glass of cold Stella. All enjoyed in the company of Mr.Smith himself. What else any normal person can ask for!?!

I just wish there was Fez II close to my neighborhood. Ohh well. Give me a reason to visit that part of the town.
