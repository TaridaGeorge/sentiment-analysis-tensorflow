This Starbucks is one of the better locations that I have gone to.  They are always very courteous and they have never messed up on my drinks.  

I understand that some people do not think that their prices are fair... Here's the thing.  You aren't going to Starbucks for a cheap cup of coffee.  You are going to Starbucks because you know the coffee will be of high quality, and you know that you are going to have a great experience.  Starbucks does not mess up, and if they do not fully impress you, then they gladly give you free drinks to rectify the situation.

Always impressed, and always a happy customer.
