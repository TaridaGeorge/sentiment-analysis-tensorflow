Honmachi rocks!

Hubski and I live around the corner from this place, but we didn't know it existed until we were out on a walk one night and happened by. The sushi is reasonably priced, they have a happy hour we have not yet experienced, they have teppan yaki. They have got it all- except a lot of business.
We regularly order the spicy tuna (I am such a spicy tuna snob), tuna, california roll, and salmon. All are delicious. A few nights ago I ventured to order the jalapeno poppers with spicy tuna. Wow. That thing should have a "might blow your head off" warning. They were tasty. You better be able to take the spice, but there were damned tasty.
We'll be back. Hubski is trying to get the to increase business by instituting a poker night. "Poker and Poke"! (Tuna Poke, get it?)
