We called to make Friday night reservations for a party of 16 - they said they didn't take reservations so we decided to go anyway and drink beer until we could get seated.  To our most pleasant surprise, they pulled together some tables upstairs and we were seated right away.  Our waitperson was very patient and helpful as we all tried to decide what to eat and what beer to drink.  Service was excellent!  Food was excellent!  The beer was excellent as well - thanks Four Peaks for a wonderful evening.
