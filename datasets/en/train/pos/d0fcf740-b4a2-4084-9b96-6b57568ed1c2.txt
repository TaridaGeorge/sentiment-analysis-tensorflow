I just started as a patient here and am very happy. The staff is very nice and they have been fantastic to work with. I have had to go three times in the last two weeks and have a few more appointments coming up. I can honestly say I am not dreading the sessions as much as normal. They also have been great to work with for payment, since I am paying out of pocket. The other amazing thing is that they are open a few Saturdays a month. since I work an ungodly amount of hours this has been clutch. They even have tvs to watch movies or listen to music while they do their work. 6 stars all the way!
