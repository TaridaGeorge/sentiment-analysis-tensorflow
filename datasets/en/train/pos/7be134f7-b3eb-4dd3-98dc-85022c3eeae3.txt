So so so good ... Here in Town for Indian spring training so why not eat Indian?  Nice people, attentive service, yummy classic treats .. Arizona!  Don't be a chain sheep and go to Flingers/Zingers/Whipperdejibbits when you can have authentic ethnic cuisine in an up-scale setting ... Get yer butt here and feast!
