Postino = Love. That's all. 

Well, it's far from being "all," considering I could sing it's praises all day, but I'll try to be concise here! 

Service- friendly, laid back and approachable; even when it's busy (which is often- go Postino!) you never get the impression that they're too stressed to answer a question or help you. Always smiling. 

Tremendous value- $5 glasses of wine until 5pm, and one $12.75 board of bruschetta is easily a meal for two - and DELICIOUS. I've yet to order anything else because I simply can't imagine a visit without it!! 

Ambience- reason enough to come back as often as socially acceptable. The industrial rustic interior is full of character and all in all just a wonderful place to be!
