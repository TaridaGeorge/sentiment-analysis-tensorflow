I learned about Durants from Yelp while on a business trip to Phoenix. The rave reviews are true: Yes you walk through the kitchen; and there is velvet on the walls, etc. Great ambiance.

The food was outstanding. I had the rib-eye steak. Service was great too.
Bottom line, my wife joined me later in the week and we went to Durants again!
