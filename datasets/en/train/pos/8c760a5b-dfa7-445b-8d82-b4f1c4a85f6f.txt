Back when the Doughnut Peddler had their ice cream/smoothie/sandwich/doughnut parlor on Val Vista and Southern, these were my favorite doughnuts.  Sadly, I moved, and then moved back near the area and they were gone.  Now they have since replaced Krispy Kreme (yea) but never been the same quality.  

Bo Sa has taken over as number 1.  Hot, Fresh, Delicious.  A wide variety to choose from and very affordable.  Conveniently open 24-7 too.  Since I found them randomly 6 months ago I no longer miss my old stand-by (even better than what I remembered a decade ago).
