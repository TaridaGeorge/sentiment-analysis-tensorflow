Great place!  Needed to meet some people for a one day business meeting.  Hospitality through the roof!  Also booked rooms for a couple nights.  It's an older place but more than served it's purpose, coming from a person that travels and has seen both the best and worst of what hotels offer.

Unanimous decision by the group that this will be our "Phoenix" place to meet in the future!
