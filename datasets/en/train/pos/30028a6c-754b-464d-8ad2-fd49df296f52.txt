In a pinch, I had to find a place for lunch that was downtown, not overly expensive, and served both delicious soup and salad. A coworker suggested the Coronado Cafe, so I looked up the menu and happily discovered that it more than met my criteria. 

For lunch, I had half of the Turkey sandwich and a small Coronado Gorgonzola salad. YUMMMM!!! The Turkey sandwich has a sort of cranberry relish instead of mayo (much healthier and much more delicious), and the Gorgonzola salad had apple slices and candied walnuts. It was the exact meal I was in the mood for. 

The restaurant itself is almost too cute for it's own good. It's small, cozy and the absolute polar opposite of any chain restaurant. The service was great, and my food arrived quickly. I can't wait to eat here again!
