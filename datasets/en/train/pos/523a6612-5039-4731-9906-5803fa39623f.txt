this is probably the coolest diner in downtown phoenix. all organic ingredients, a kickass interior (it's super small, but totally rad), and great people working. say hi to the bearded jewish cook, andy, and he will make your food just the way you want it, and also, with love.

the food is totally cheap and tastes exquisite. you can also eat outside, if you want. 

it's located on a nondescript corner in a residential area, so it's easy to miss, but this place is definitely worth checking out if you're downtown.

also, the hours up there ^^ say it's open until 5, but i am pretty sure they close at 3.
