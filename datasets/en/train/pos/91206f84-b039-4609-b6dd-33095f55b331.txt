First let me say this spa is fabulous.I I have had pedicures,manicures and my hair done and also spay tans;)second the person who wrote the review about her spay tan experience and pedi obviously has to much time on her hands...we yelpers don't need a whole essay.with that being said this spa is a must and I always look forward to returning;)  youll not be disappointed!!
