I'm writing this review because I'm currently living in Flagstaff and am missing my Taco Shop! 

I love this place because it's small, local and delicious. I used to come here 2-3 times a week and order the same thing: XL Bean and Cheese, Terry's way, add cilantro. I dream of this burrito, daily. Also, the cochata (coffee/horchata drink) is very yummy. 

I miss the warm greetings from Randy, one of the managers, and Patricia! 

America's Taco Shop (Melrose; 7th Ave) is always our first stop when coming to Phoenix!
