No really - if this place goes anywhere Phoenix;  AZ for that matter will have lost something monumental.  I am not over exagerrating when I say, at the top of my voice.....THESE ARE THE BEST DAMN DONUTS YOU WILL EVERY EAT.  They are light and big, the long john with the cream down the middle is unlike anything you've tasted.  The cream isn't super disgusting sweet so it goes so well with the chocolate or maple frosting.  It is owned and operated daily by the same people.  You won't see anyone different every time you go there.  I have one drug.  Coffee.  Second drug every 2 months.  Rainbow Donuts on Cave Creek and Greenway, not all the same this is the best in the west.  Bar none.  Try it you'll see why.  

Try not to cry when you go there.
