We were in Scottsdale for a meeting.  Wife notice sign so we stopped in - looks like they recently opened.  She had a big chip on her back iPhone 4 glass and wanted it fixed before it completely shattered.  For a little extra was able to change her Phone into a Red iPhone for about the same price as our deductible WITHOUT having to wait at cell store.  Walked next door for coffee and when we returned she now has a red iPhone.   Owner was knowledgeable and friendly.   He described how he can practically rebuild the entire iPhone - speakers, internals etc.  I am dropping my over priced cell company insurance as his rates are basically what I would pay as a deductible - saves me about $20.00 a month/$200+/yr on our two phones.  He also repairs other electronics but have not tried anything other than iPhone.  Highly recommend.
