The food and service was excellent, well deserved 5 star rating.  While it was a little out of the way, I'm so happy we were turned on to it!  

Elements has one of the most romantic views at sunset!  And a stroll around the grounds is enchanting.  

I highly recommend even a drink at the bar at sunset!   Amazing!!!
