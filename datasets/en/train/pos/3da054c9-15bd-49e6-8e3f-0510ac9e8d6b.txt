Very helpful staff helped me fix my camera settings. I thought my camera lens was broken but an employee named Marcia came to my rescue. I am new to photography and was nervous they would charge me just to look at my lens but she took a moment to ask me how she could help and then proceeded to reset my settings and everything is better.
