Can never go with a Marriott property. The staff here was amazing, the rooms were very clean and upgraded. It is very close to the promenade and a couple other nice shopping/restaurant places right down the road. I had to check out late due to an emergency on Sunday and the girl never even questioned me. Overall, we had a very good stay, and free wifi is always awesome!
