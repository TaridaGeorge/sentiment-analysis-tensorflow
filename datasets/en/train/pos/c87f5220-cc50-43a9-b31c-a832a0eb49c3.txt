I have nothing bad to say about Nordstrom ESPECIALLY the one in Fashion Square Scottsdale. 
They always have the best customer service and friendly staff!
I love the great finds here, even in the Juniors section for us small girls/ladies!
The only thing is that I wish their "high-end" shoe department sold more high-end shoes, common Louboutins!!!
