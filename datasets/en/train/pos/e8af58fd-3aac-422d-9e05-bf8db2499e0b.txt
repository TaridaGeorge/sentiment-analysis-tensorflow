Really good food in a cute setting!  I like how the restaurant is set up in little rooms.  (It is a house after all...)  That makes for a more intimate, quieter meal.  The omakase dinner was not available the night I went, so we ordered off the menu.  The hamachi with grapefruit was awesome as were the soft shell shrimp & green papaya slaw (great for snacking with a glass of cold beer).  But the star of the night was definitely the pork belly buns.  Finally, a creative way to eat pork belly!  The soft, white buns complemented the fat from the pork belly very well.  Parking was actually note that bad since the restaurant offers validation for the parking structure next door.  Pricing is also reasonable for the quality of food.  This is an all-around winner.  I can't wait to go back.
