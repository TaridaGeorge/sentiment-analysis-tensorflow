my fiance and i just returned from the herb box and i had to immediately write my first review.  we aren't from scottsdale and have been trying places every night since we got here two days ago for a work conference and this was by far the best food we have had here in town.  i had the pork stuffed with cornbread and it was excellent.  all that and the price was excellent.  nothing on the menu is over $24 and most items are under $20.  our entire meal, including edamame appetizer was only $50.  great food + great price = great restaurant.  this place is new (april 2008), but everyone should check it out.  it is run by locals, so go out and support your local restaurants.
