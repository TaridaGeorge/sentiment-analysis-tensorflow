We are real estate brokers with Coldwell Banker and we just had a client tell us that when they spoke with their insurance agent, he told him that he is unable to give him a quote for homeowner's insurance.  We told our client about Mike Pinta with American Family Insurance and within minutes Mike had helped our client.  Way to go, Mike.  We will refer you again and again.  You make our job easier!
