best restaurant hands down, my bf & mine FAV
my bf and i have been here prob over 50 times. 
we moved back to Canada now but visit AZ every 3 months and always go at least once to the city hall mastros.
I really like the ocean club one, but my bf insists on this one.

amazing food
great bar
wonderful service
