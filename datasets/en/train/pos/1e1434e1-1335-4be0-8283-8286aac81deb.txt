THIS PLACE IS GREAT!  Especially, in this economy!  They have tons of items and keep me looking wonderful for work and beyond!  The reason I love this place is because I grew up shopping at Nordstrom's, Sak's etc.  Therefore, I'm used to excellent quality clothes, shoes and accessories.  But I'm too frugal to spend the money my parents had to spend.  Therefore, for years I only "invested" in good business clothes and hardly any "play" clothes.  Now I can afford both and help others while I'm doing it!  I've lost weight and I'm like a kid in a candy store whenever I go in there!  MY WHOLE LIFE HAS IMPROVED-I HOPE THEY STAY OPEN IN THIS LOCATION FOREVER!
