First, I did not eat here.  This has nothing to do with the food.

I was in the area and had heard about this place.  Younger crowd (yes, it's close to ASU) but good music, good atmosphere.

Strong pours from the staff.  I mean strong.  I mean five stars strong, on any type of liquor, any bottle.  If you hang out in Scottsdale and need a reprieve from that scene (and that L.A./Vegas price point for drinks), this is a place that should be on your short list.  You will think you died and went to heaven when you get the tab!
