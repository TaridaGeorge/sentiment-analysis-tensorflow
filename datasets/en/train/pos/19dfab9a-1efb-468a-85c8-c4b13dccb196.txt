Unlike my sis, Sarah M., who doesn't like greek food,  I love greek food and this place did not disappoint.  Not only was the food great but it felt like we were invited to a family party rather than eating at a restaurant.  Loved the music and the dancing and how everyone was included.  My 11 year old was invited to dance more than once and she had a great time.  I highly recommend going for a late dinner and staying for the entertainment.  Be willing to join in and you will have a blast!
