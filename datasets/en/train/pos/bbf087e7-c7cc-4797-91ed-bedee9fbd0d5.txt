I would put Wildflower's sandwiches up against just about any other sandwich shop in Tempe. The toppings are delicious and go far beyond your standard ham or turkey, lettuce or tomato. But the bread here is the real star, more expensive than a loaf from the supermarket but infinitely more flavorful. 

Wash it down with their fresh lemonade, and you will find yourself coming back.
