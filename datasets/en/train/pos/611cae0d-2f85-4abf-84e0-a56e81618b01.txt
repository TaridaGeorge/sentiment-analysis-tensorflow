New Coffee Shop opened in Olive Mill-  family owned and operated, locally brewed right there in the store.  I  noticed that they offer a nice selection from light roast to dark roast.  I tried the Superstition blend (medium) and it was excellent!!

They also have a unique and beautiful Italian cappuccino machine, that I was told was 1 of 2 in all of Arizona.

Overall wonderful setting inside the Olive Mill, and friendly family staff- will definitely come and again and recommend to friends.
