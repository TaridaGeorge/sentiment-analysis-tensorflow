Don't mean to bore you folks, but I gotta tell you this.  Yesterday I went to buy some chicken and pork chops that were on-sale and just couldn't resist getting some menudo for an early lunch.  They serve menudo only on the weekends.  I got the "big bowl" for only $6.50!!  And it was a huge, freaking bowl.  And it was the best menudo I have ever had.  I must admit that I love menudo and have had it at about 5 other places here in AZ, but this was the best I have ever had.
