Spinato's Chicago style pizza is even delicious microwaved the next day. I'm from the Chi and I can honestly say, Spinato's hit the nail on the head with this one. Yeah, the sauce is a tad sweet, but who cares. It's not like honey instead of pizza sauce, besides....it works! It's great pizza, period.  I'm not interested in sampling anyone else's in AZ, I have found my pizza place.
