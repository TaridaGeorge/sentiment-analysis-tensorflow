Windy City DJs was wonderful.  Frank and Susan in the office did a wonderful job of sending us all the paperwork and contracts, and setting up a time to meet with us to discuss services prior to deciding on using their company.  Lee, our DJ, was incredibly organized and professional.  He called me the week of our wedding to discuss all playlists, ceremony music and timing, and the nature of what we were looking for at our reception.  The wireless mic we ordered was flawless, and the sound quality and lighting provided were perfect for our venue and guests.  The guests enjoyed the music and Lee kept in constant communication with me as well as our caterer and photographer.  We would whole-heartedly recommend them to anyone looking for a wedding DJ, or a DJ for any other event.
