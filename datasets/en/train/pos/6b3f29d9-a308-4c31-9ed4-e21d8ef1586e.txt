This place is truly unique, and deserves 5 stars.  I too am now obsessed with this place!  The atmosphere is like no other you will find in a Phoenix coffee bar, people will actually interact and talk with each other, read, study, work, talk, watch television. It reminds me of being in someone's cozy living room.  I absolutely recommend this place!!!
