This bar is awesome! If you have gone here more than once, the bartenders remember your name. They're all really friendly, the drinks are inexpensive, and there's a bunch of types of entertainment: from karaoke, darts & pool tables. Sometimes the regulars put on a put luck or a chili cook off. The best part is they have a "designated driver" ready to take you home for free on Friday and Saturdays... although you need to tip the driver (obviously). It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall type of bar. It's a tiny area in a strip mall, so it's easy to miss. Almost all of the patrons are regulars too. The only downfall: limited drunken munchies. There's no food available, that I know of.
