I LOVE this place. It's my birthday dinner with my fiance tonight, and sushi is my favorite. He told me that I can pick whatever place I'd like to go. I choose Sakana. I can't get enough of their stuff and that's not saying their portions are small. They aren't. They give you really nice sized sushi rolls and at an affordable price. My fiance doesn't like sushi, but they offer other types of non-fish foods like chicken and beef so he's happy too. I'm so excited to have dinner tonight! I can't wait!
