I've gone to see games and "Disney on Ice" type of events at this stadium.

I've sat in some "ok" seats, VIP seating, and even got lucky and was treated to seats in one of the luxury boxes a couple of times.  Every seat I've had there was pretty good.

By admission, I am a Golden State Warriors fan, and as such I can't complain.  There are plenty of GSW fans in the audience at US Airways Center.  

The prices of tickets, parking, and food are much less expensive than other out-of-state venues I've been to.  The ease of parking and flow of traffic is light-years better than most major cities.

Also, there's a lot less "crazies" at this arena than other arenas.  I feel totally safe at US Airways Center.
