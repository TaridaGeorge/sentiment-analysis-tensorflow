I work pretty close to this place and when i get a sweet tooth it's a hop skip and a jump away.  I always order a half chocolate chip cookie with chocolate chip ice cream sandwich.  It's so good!  This summer it was so hot it started to melt pretty quickly, so i would eat it in the bowl with a spoon and it is just as tasty.
