Yum! (And good for you too!)  Golden Spoon offers numerous types of fat-free frozen yogurt.  We are talking smooth, creamy, full flavor frozen yogurt here!  If you are a WW point counter know that you can have a not-so-small or regular for only 3 points!  

The cake batter and chocolate peanut buttercup flavors are sinful.  The Chocolate malt is tasty but not so sweet.  Whatever you do avoid the simply tart like the plague. (Unless you like the taste of sour cream cheese or find your self so old that you delight in eating salted grapefruit for breakfast.)
