I have eaten here many times.  Sushi Brokers has one of the Friendliest Staffs & Best Sushi in the business and they are always on top of keeping your drinks filled and your food prompt.

As for the Sushi, it is some of the freshest & best in town, certainly the best I have found on a consistent basis.  I normally go during one of their Happy Hours as the prices are much more affordable then.  They have two Happy Hours, one from 4 - 6:30 pm, then a reverse Happy Hour from 10:30 to Close.

My favorite Sushi rolls here are the Chimichunga, Cowgirl (Abbie Style), Surfer & The Sanchez.

Music is current Hits and helps the place feel fun.  Eye Candy is great.

Stop by & check them out.
