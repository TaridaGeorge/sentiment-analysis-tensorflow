If you truly love fish this is the spot. I went in at Mandys and ordered the cat combo which includes three catfish three shrimp and chips, truly it was the best decision ever. I moved here to Arizona a couple months ago from Louisiana and I had never had tasted fish like this it was amazing. I will be coming back to Mandys again for sure.
