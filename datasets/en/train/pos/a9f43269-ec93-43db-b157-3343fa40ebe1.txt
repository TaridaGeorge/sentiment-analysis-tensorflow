My husband and I are fans of St. Francis.  We start with the Goat Cheese appetizer... with little crostini's... very good!  Then, we settle in to the Pork Chile Verde.  There is nothing that tastes this good... we crave this dish!  If you come during happy hour, you can get the Goat Cheese appetizer for $5, then Pork Chile Verde dish for $8 and share a house white wine carafe for $12...  fantastic bargain and you'll leave happy.  

The staff are friendly and attentive, it's a favorite early dinner spot for us.  Thanks St. Francis!

PS:  If you have the kids with you, they eat free.  Our 9 year old is a huge fan of the kids pork roast.
