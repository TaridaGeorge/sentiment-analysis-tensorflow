This review is strictly about Riverview Nissan's service department.  I brought my vehicle in for a second opinion after another dealer quoted me $1,100 for repairs.  They looked at it and found the other dealer trying to fix something that wasn't broken.  Dustin who is the customer rep is honest and great to deal with.  I left not having to spend $1 for repairs.  I've also had them repair my car a couple times prior and they did a good job and prices were reasonable.  This dealership is 25 minutes past a closer Nissan Dealership to me, but it's worth the drive for an honest service rep.
