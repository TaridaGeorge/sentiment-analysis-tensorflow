Dr Halver here at Animal Care Hospital is most highly recommended.   He is knowledgeable, compassionate, and reliable.   After moving to Phoenix several years ago, I had been to several vets searching for the right fit, and I've stopped looking any further.   The facility at Animal Care Hospital is clean, their staff is friendly and professional, and the overall experience is very positive.  My dog was recently ill and Dr Halver made an excellent referral to a neurologist as well.  Unfortunately, the outcome was not good, but Dr Halver called after my dog's early call to heaven to follow up and express his sympathy.
