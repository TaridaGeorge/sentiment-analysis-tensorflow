Red Devil has been around since before dirt was invented, and there is a reason: it is GOOD.

I love love love their bruchetta.  It is, no hyperbole, the best in town.  I don't know where they get those tomatoes, but I have never tasted a bad one there.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Pizza=to die for.  Amazing.  The hubs and I usually split a white pie, and never regret it.... well, if you don't count the regret I feel that I over ate!

We have tried the entrees, but we always go back to the pizza.  It is really that good.

Go to Red Devil - what have you been waiting for?  Have some bruschetta.  Go home full.
