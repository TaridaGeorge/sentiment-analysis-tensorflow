I enjoyed my experience at this location of famous dave's. The service was excellent, the server went out of his way to make us happy!!! I ordered the BBQ baked potatoe off of the lunch menu, A large baker filled with cheddar cheese, butter, sour cream, and perfectly cooked brisket. It also came with bacon bits which i opted to decline that topping. The price was $6.99. I also added a side salad for $2.99, It was fresh, cold, and crisp. The dressing (blue cheese) was great!!! tasted like they make it in house rather than coming from a jar.

My personal pet peeve is when a restaurant serves un-filtered water, Famous Daves serves filtered water. YAY!!! 

I will be goig back for more delicious mouth water BRISKET!!!!
