I look for two things when judging Chinese food - is it flavorful and is it "clean". The dishes that I had at Golden Wok definitely checked those two boxes for me. The Kung Pao chicken was the perfect balance of flavor and spice for me and I loved the Beef and Broccoli. Both dishes were very "clean" also. Not sure how to explain that exactly, but if you look for clean food,then you know what I'm talking about.

To top it off, the owners make you feel like family and I would equate it to a "Cheers" like Chinese restaurant. Go their a couple of times, introduce yourself, and everybody will in fact know your name.
