I absolutely love Sens! 

This is an intimate little restaurant with a lot going for it. 

They have a large selection of flavored sake's, and a very unique menu.

This is a great place to take a date as its fun to pick out three or four different items to share. 

The winners on the menu are the "Volcano Flamed", "Bacon Wrapped Okra", and the "Soup Gyoza". The "Soup Gyoza" is one of the best things I've ever eaten.

Fun and unique menu, great flavored sake selection, awesome food, and reasonable prices, gives Sens five stars.
