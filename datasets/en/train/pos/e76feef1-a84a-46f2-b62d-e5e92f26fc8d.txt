Fair and honest prices.  Friends and I have been ripped off by other companies for the last several years wondering if there was anyone honest left.  During the summer, you're at the mercy of the air conditioning techs and usually they take advantage of it.

I'm very happy with their service.  Very prompt and professional.   Father and son make a great team.

Great warranty service.  An electronic part he installed died after 3 weeks.  He came out immediately and replaced the item for no charge.
