Penzey's is the end of the road for those searching for high quality spices.  I have never had a bad bottle from here.  They also have great collections for just about any cook with any taste.  Their spice collections make great gifts too.  I received a kit at one of my wedding showers - it was a Mexican collection.  Caliente!  You definitely need to check this one out.
