This is my favorite Fry's around. I love the expanded natural foods section & improved organic produce department. A few weeks ago I purchased some juice boxes that were sticky & asked if they had any others that weren't sticky. The grocery manager took my juice boxes over to the Starbuck's & washed them off before putting them back in my bag. He was super cool about it & let me know it was his pleasure to make sure I was happy.  LOVE him.
