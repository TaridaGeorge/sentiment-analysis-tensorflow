Brian at PropertyAZ has done a great job for us since we signed on with his company.  We were self-managing a rental property near ASU, but after moving to Colorado we realized that we needed someone to handle this house for us. I was reticent to use a property management service, as I've been "underwhelmed" by what I've seen before we worked with Brian. He's exceeded our expectations, and I'd recommend him to anyone who needs a property manager.
