Best vacation I've ever had.  They practically give these rooms away in the summer, and it's a great value.  The service is amazing, the rooms are understated but elegant, and my favorite is the prickly pear iced tea that they have free flowing all over the resort.  Such a relaxing visit- after three days I felt better than I had in years.  Something about the overwhelming desert heat... FORCES you to just relax.  Nice quiet pool, free of horrid disco music.  Great value!!!
