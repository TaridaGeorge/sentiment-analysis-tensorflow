I have never stayed here, but i have dined here for a party and visited Jade Bar for some drinks. My opinions:
1) The views are amazing at sunset! You can see the city at night and it is a beautiful view of Scottsdale
2) The food catered to our party was delicious! Especially the white chocolate truffles at the end of dinner, better than what Godiva makes.
3) If you get a drink at Jade Bar you must try the Strawberry Lavender Royale and the Beet Yuzu Gimlet ( their signature drink.)
