Why does this place NOT have a high rating? What's wrong with everyone? Pearl is my addiction. I've been a devoted customer for over a year. The staff, the vibe, the service, the atmosphere, the martinis, the flavored sake, and umm.. the SUSHI is delicious.

I crave the Fake and Bake roll regularly, and at $6.00 it's ridiculously reasonable. I went last night and can't believe I've never indulged before, but the Garlic Edamame is orgasmic.

Yep, I just related an orgasm to Pearl. It's pretty damn amazing.

I don't understand why anyone would not leave Pearl satisfied. I mean, the staff, especially the management are all super friendly, upbeat, down to earth, and fun. What more can you ask for? I'm excited to visit their new location downtown Phoenix when it opens!!!

Five stars... well deserved.
