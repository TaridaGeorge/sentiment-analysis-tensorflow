Grimaldi's makes me realize it's worth it to pay more for real pizza (instead of the $5 deals). Their pricing is reasonable and you get your money's worth in flavor and ingredients. The Gilbert location is lively and popular. I greatly appreciated the friendly greeting at the front and the gracious hospitality from John (manager?)
