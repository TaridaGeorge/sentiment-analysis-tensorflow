Maybe it was just because I was really hungry, but this pizza really hit the spot and tasted like the best pizza ever.  We ordered a medium pepperoni with extra cheese and it was absolutely delicious in my opinion.  The sauce was very flavorful and not sweet at all, which I like.  It tasted more like garlic/oregano/herbs/etc. Very fresh.  The toppings were sliding off there was so much cheese, which again, I liked.  The crust was also good.  Perfect happy medium between deep dish and thin crust.  Service was top notch.  They checked back with us several times, pizza got to our table soon after ordering, and when we left I think we had about 36 employees tell us to have a nice evening.
