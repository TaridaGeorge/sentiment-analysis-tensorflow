We absolutely love Dr Jarvis and North Kenilworth!  And most importantly, our sweet puppy loves her too!  They've been so great to us, and as new pet owners (as adults) we are so thankful.

We has a crazy scare the first week with a too rough playtime with a littermate and a slice in our pup's ear.  Dr Jarvis had us come in and looked at it and glued it back together and didn't charge us for the visit!  And then she followed up a few days later to see how he was doing!

We went in for our third set of vaccination for the pup and he didn't even notice anything was going on.  He gave kisses to everyone and has a couple overexcited uncontrollable bladder releases.

We are so happy to have North Kenilworth in our neighborhood and only a short drive away!
