I found this on Yelp while staying nearby for a conference. 

It was completely delicious. I got the Cashew Nut ( I think that was what it was called) with just veggies. Everything tasted so fresh. It wasn't too spicy, I said I wanted medium but I'd consider it extremely mild. However it was really flavorful so I can't complain at all. I just think next time I'd ask for it spicier.  

This place is in a pretty nondescript strip mall, but don't let that deter you, they're doing an excellent job.
