I couldn't beloved how good the food was here I would give it 6 stars if I could. I had the mahi mahi taco special and it was amazing. Fresh homemade salsa and chips were great fresh guacamole too.  The other two people I was with had the beef burro special the looked great. My new spot in Phoenix for Mex.
