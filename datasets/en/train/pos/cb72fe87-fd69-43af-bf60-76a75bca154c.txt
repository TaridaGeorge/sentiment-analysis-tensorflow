I'll stay here again, hands down.  

I can't thank Derek and his staff enough for the excellent service we had during our three night stay.  Very welcoming staff. 

The shuttle picked us up at the airport and offered to take us to our off site rental car location.  We were allowed to check in early.  Anything we needed Derek made it happen.  

The rooms were clean, comfortable perfect for us to come back and relax after the long days we had.  

I just wanted to say that it was a very wonderful experience to stay here.  Derek made the trip less stressful making sure we got to where we needed to go.  Keep up the good work, its rare to find that kind of customer service these days.
