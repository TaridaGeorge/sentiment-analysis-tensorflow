I like Stinkweeds. The rare instances I actually buy an album, I go here. The staff is knowledgeable and can recommend a slew of new music if you fess up your preferences (unless your preferences are boy bands or Yanni, then you -might- be out of luck...but one never knows the dark secrets harbored by others). They're not judgmental or snobby. It's hip, it's cozy, and you can get some weird zines and DVDs, too. 

P.S., this review was "inspired" by Dave B.'s.
