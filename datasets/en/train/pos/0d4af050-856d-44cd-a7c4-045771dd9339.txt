Excellent food, drinks, and service. It was definitely a culinary experience for me, and I tried food I have never had before. It was fun to hang out there with friends and they had live music on a floating stage above the bar! The vibe there is different from any other place in Scottsdale- very welcoming and relaxed! We cannot wait to go there again and try some more items on the menu.
