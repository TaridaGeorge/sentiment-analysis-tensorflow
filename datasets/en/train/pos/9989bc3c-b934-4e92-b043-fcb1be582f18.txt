I seriously love this place!  Great art, Great exhibitions, even the weird layout appeals to me.  I would prefer them to have a more interesting gift shop but that isn't enough to put a dent on my review.  Anyway i've gone many times probably close to 100 and i've never gotten tired of it it's just an all around great museum.
