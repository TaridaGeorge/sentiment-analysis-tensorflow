If you like learning about American Indians and/or viewing artifacts and art from Indians, then you will want to visit the Heard Museum.  The thing I love about the Heard Museum is that their exhibits are constantly changing, so you can come again and again without ever getting bored.

Their focus is on traditional and contemporary American Indian art, so you'll see some of the most beautiful jewelry, painting and pottery on display.

I love looking at the Indian artifacts in the museum; I think it's the most interesting part.  You'll see pottery, bracelets, brightly colored jars, arrowheads and much more.  

They also have classes on jewelry making, basket making, beading and painting here as well as various festivals.  Check it out!
