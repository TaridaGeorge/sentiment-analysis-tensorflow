I've been to this place a few times and I wish I lived closer. It's a great place to hang out, the service is excellent and what food I've tried is really good.

The bands I've heard there are good, too. There are a couple of pool tables and the patio area is misted so the summer heat won't be too bad.

We had our #evfn meetup here tonight and they arranged an area just for us. The server Katie managed everyone's separate order (as far as I know) without mistake, which almost never happens. Great job!

I'm sure we'll be back again.
