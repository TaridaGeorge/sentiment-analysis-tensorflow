INCREDIBLE customer service. I have never experienced anything like it. My Brother and I visited this location and we were so pleased. Every single employee had walked up to us that came across our path to ask if we were finding everything okay and if we needed any help. That alone is a 5 star!! This Home Depot is very nice according to my Brother who works in home renovation and home improvement/remodeling. So there you have it. GO HERE! Awesome place. Knowledgeable Staff made it a easier experience and went out of their way to find us things for the home as well as made great suggestions. : )
