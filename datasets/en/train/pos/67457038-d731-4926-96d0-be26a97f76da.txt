Out on another ride. The sun is set, hands are numb and the stomachs growling like a lion defending its territory

Amazing old fashioned cowboy burger joint. Come to square dance, roast marshmallows, and chomp down on some badass burgers. 

Don't forget to bring a dollar bill or a business card to staple to the ceiling. I think its got like over 10,000 thousand dollars stapled to the ceiling. thats def a cool thing to see. I wish all my friends did that at my place every time they stopped by!

The burgers are good but better after a long motorcycle ride for sure. Try it out and see what Arizona used to be like! I sure hope this place stays the same.
