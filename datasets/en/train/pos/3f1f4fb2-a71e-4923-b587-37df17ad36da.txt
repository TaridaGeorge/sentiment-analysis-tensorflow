Coming from Seattle where they have good Asian spots everywhere, finding a good pho restaurant was hard. DaVang had really good pho. I had the tofu pho and the tofu was lightly fried just how I prefer:) the broth was amazing and it was a bigger building than most I've seen in Arizona. It's one of those "hole in the wall" type restaurants, but sometimes I think that's the best places for real authentic oriental food. I now come here at least 3 times a month ;)
