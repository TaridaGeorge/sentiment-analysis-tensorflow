I discovered this little gem of a place with my co-worker on our lunch hour. We were very pleasanly surprised and we have been coming ever since! One of the best burgers I have had in a looong time. Try the brule or the bacon cheese burger..OMG SO TASTY! And the seasoned fries are yummy too. I'm a big fan of local spots and this one is just great. Try it!
