I'm vegan so there wasn't much on the lunch menu that I could eat, It was about 3:30pm, but our server said that there was a grilled vegetable plate on the dinner menu and I could order.  He was very helpful, and the grilled vegetable plate was well seasoned and the grilled red beets with a balsamic vinegar reduction was fantastic.
