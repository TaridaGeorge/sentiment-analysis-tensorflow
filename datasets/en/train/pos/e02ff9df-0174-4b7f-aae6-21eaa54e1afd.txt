This place is fantastic! I big puffy heart the red velvet pancakes and the orange juice was delightful! I've also dined there for lunch in the last week and split the kobe burger and the turkey wrap with my assistant and both dishes were flavorful, well-prepared, and really interesting. The fries are delicious and the service was amazing as well.
