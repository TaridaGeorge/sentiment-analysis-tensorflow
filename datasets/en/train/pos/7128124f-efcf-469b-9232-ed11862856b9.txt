I agree that the one star ratings aren't very fair.. Not everything is open yet. Sadly several store openings got pushed back, but I am so excited for what is in store! I am originally from Phoenix (born and raised) and I never would have thought I would live "downtown Phoenix" or love it here!
They are definitely doing a very good job about turning downtown Phoenix into a great hangout spot! Lots of great places to eat and hang out. Even with limited openings currently at CityScape, I am a big fan!
