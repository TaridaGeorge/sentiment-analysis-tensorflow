O Holy Pork Chili Verde, 
your flavors are so grand.
Your spicy kick 
and sweet cornbread 
make me a huge fan.

Long lay St. Francis,
You're warm and friendly and hip.
Your modern flair
and down-home style
is really hard to compare.

A thrill of hope
for each new visit.
St. Francis you inspire
and your food I really admire.

I fall... on my knees!
With taste buds exalting!
For the French Onion Burger,
the seasonal soup
and a taste of things to come.

O, St. Francis! 
O, Holy Pork Chili Verde!
O, you're so divine!
