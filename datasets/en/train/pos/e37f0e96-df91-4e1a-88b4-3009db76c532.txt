This is my guilty pleasure. My boyfriend and I eat here AT LEAST once a week. All of the servers are laid back, but fast and friendly. The Cornish Pasties are amazing. I've tried many, but my go-to is always The Ruben. If you like ruben sandwiches, the Ruben pasty will blow your mind. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!! Cheers!
