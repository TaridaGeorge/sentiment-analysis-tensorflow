Everything I've had here is wonderful.  The service is wonderful.  The ambiance is comfortable.

They recently added guacamole to the appetizers and I'll tell you what, I think its one of the best ones I've had outside of my own.

I crave the Spit Roasted Turkey Melt.  It really does melt in your mouth.  Wish I had one now.

I've enjoyed the Tomato Gin Soup, Filet Mignon Cobb Salad, Classic French Dip and Rotisserie Chicken Crepes.  All wonderful.

Sides I like: Israeli Couscous, Fresh-Cut Fries and Freshly Mashed Potatoes.
