Great food - great service!  I love how it feels like a small town diner. Clearly a neighborhood joint - people greeted each other warmly. Our server was as sweet as could be.  She had good timing, knowing just when to ask us if we needed anything else and making sure our coffee cups were not empty. Order the Carne Asada Skillet - yum!!!
