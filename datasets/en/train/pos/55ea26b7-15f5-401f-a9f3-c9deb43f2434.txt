Not that Flemings needs my help or anything...BUT

My wife and I went here last friday and had the time of our lives.  I've been there a few times and they addressed us by name and even knew how long it had been since our last dinner.  The wait staff is exceptional and the food was B B B B BOMB!  I have the parmesan encrusted halibut and my wife had the petite filet.  

If you've never been you should definately check this place out.  I highly recommend it.  Ask to be seated in Lindsey's section.  She's GREAT!
