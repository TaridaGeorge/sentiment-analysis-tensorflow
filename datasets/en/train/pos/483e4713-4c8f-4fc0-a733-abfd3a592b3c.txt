I'm definitely a fan of Nordstrom's.... just left their Anniversary sale a happy girl! I scored some great sales, and remembered several people I needed to get gifts for ....and with my Nordstrom's card I got double points. (So that's like a gift to me.... :)

I like that this Nordstrom's has a Spa too. (I have yet to use, but one of my friend's has said the massages here are awesome.) But it's nice I have that option. Maybe I should get one today, cause then I get double points. Hmmm....
