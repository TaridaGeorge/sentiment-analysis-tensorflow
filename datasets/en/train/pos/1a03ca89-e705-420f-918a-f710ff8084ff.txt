Cheryl and Dave are really nice people. I showed up a complete novice and they really helped me along. It would have been very easy for them to get rid of me or not bother as they are experts in their field. Most people going there are very good but they accepted me as a true beginner and made me feel welcome. They change it up once in awhile and they are starting to get other teachers in so there is a nice change of pace, it isn't always the same thing. I highly recommend.
