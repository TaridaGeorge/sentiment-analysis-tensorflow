Just checked out Cork last night for their regular dinner service. Without a doubt, best meal of my life!. My dining partner and I tried the mac and cheese (so rich and tasty), baby arugula salad (best salad I've ever had), wild boar short ribs (very tender), buttermilk fried chicken and banana cream pie. Everything was absolutely fabulous. The banana cream pie was to die for!

Other reviews have mentioned that portions are very small. I have to flat out disagree. Cork isn't Claim Jumper, it's a fine dining experience. Between my starter and main course, I was more than full, happy and satisfied. Not once was I disappointed with the amount of food I received. While the prices are steeper than your average date night destination, the food also far exceeds in quality and taste. Check it out for yourself. You will not be disappointed!
