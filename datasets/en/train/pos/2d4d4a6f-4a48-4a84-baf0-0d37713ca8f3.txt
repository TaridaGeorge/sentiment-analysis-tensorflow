Small and un-assuming.  The pizza is excellent if you like real Italian thin crust done in a real wood burning oven.  Slightly burnt crust, fluffy edge and chewy. Service is prompt and friendly. My wife and I shared one salad, which we thought was little small, however the lettuce was cold and didn't come out of a bag like many restaurants. They make their own sparkling water which came in a very cold bottle - a nice touch.  Wine selection is small, but reasonably priced. The patio is small, so get there early if you want to sit outside.  We will definitely go back!
