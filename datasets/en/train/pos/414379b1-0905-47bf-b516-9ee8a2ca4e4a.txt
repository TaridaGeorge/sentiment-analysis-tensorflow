Dear fucking lord I am not going to eat again until next Thursday.

A friend took me here for lunch today, in exchange for a little 'puter help. The cook is a friend of hers, he just said, don't worry I'll make something you like.

Next thing I knew I had a Scheiners freshly made hot dog, grilled, split open, on a bun... with a fried egg an some of their pepper concoction on top. One of the best things I have ever ever eaten. 

As others mentioned, the fries are sliced to order and fried to a super crisp.

The eggs are organic. The menu is tiny, it's diner food, but the food quality is very, very high. 

Has a few bites of a freshly made pear pie.... oh my.

I will be back, but not that often, otherwise I'll be a lardass. (again)
