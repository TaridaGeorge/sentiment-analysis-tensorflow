I would say this is one of the best Vegetarian/Vegan restaurants I have been to in a while! Their mock meats are seasoned so well and the food is really healthy you feel good leaving there! Appetizer: Chili Fries...Yum! Entree: Kung Pao Chicken...Yummier! Dessert: Tsoynami with bananas, peanut butter, mallow...Yummiest!!!!! So good you must go!
