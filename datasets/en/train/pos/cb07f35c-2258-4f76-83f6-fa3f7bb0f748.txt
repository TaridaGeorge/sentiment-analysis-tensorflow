Every Thursday we get food trucks outside my office building in central Phoenix. Emerson started coming around recently and I'm so glad they did. Incredible fry bread made fresh topped with fresh and flavorful ingredients.

I went for broke the first time I got lunch from them and tried the Jazzy which has grilled steak, beans, and a spring mix with pico de gallo and chipotle sauce on fry bread, a surprising combination that worked really well. The bread itself is the best I've ever had, very light and tasty. I've also had the Yolli, a more traditional beans and cheese dish which was quite good.

Do yourself a favor. If you see them at a food truck gathering or special event, get there early and feed your face.
