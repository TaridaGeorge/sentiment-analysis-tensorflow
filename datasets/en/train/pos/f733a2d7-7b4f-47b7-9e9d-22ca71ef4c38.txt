My wife and I have been living close to this place for a while now.  We've seen it coming home more than a few times.  Tonight we jumped here on Yelp and saw they were rated pretty high and decide this was the place for dinner.  

I got the gyro burger combo with French fries and a sarsaparilla and my wife got the Cali Burger and onion rings.  Everything was fantastic.  They have a huge selection of pops that you won't find anywhere else.  Everything we had was great.  The French Fries and the onion rings were some of the best around.

If you are hankering for a good burger joint, this is definitely a good place to go.
