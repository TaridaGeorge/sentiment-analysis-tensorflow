Sucker Punch Sallys really come through with great food and excellent drinks.  The staff were all very attentive, professional, and just cool. The place has a very welcome rockibillty vibe and excellent food. I HIGHLY recomend the Corned Beef sandwhich, which I am going to go ahead and proclain Corned Beed at Sucker Punch Sally's (SPS) to be the best in Tempe, even better then my beloved Chompies. The bar is stocked with a full line of deliciousness, this combined with the great food has bumped SPS up to be my new favorite bar on mill.
