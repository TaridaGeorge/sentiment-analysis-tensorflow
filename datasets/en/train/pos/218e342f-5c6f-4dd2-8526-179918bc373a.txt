Just great.  So glad my Yelpers led me to this place when I was in town, and I brought 3 locals who loved it too...and hopefully will patronize this place again.  We were served by the owner (manager?) who was great fun and gave us great service.  The bruschetta sampler was outstanding.  Live music was good and it was a really fun atmosphere.
