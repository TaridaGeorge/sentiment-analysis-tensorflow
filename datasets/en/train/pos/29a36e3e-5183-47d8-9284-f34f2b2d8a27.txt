These wings are deelish! They are so meaty and well seasoned. I had honey BBQ got 20 wings for 13 bucks, and the honey biscuits made me melt.  These are made upon order and do take some time, so if you are in a rush call ahead otherwise, plan on waiting at least 25 minutes for your order.  I signed up for their text messages and now am alerted on ther specials: 50 cent wing Tuesdays 4-9.
