I love the food here. I was born and raised in Manila so I have been homesick for Pinoy food. Everything at this place is baked or cooked on premises from scratch. I had the lechon kawali and it was crispy good. I have tried the dinuguan ("pork chocolate stew") with rice and puto -- deelish! My American fiance loves the Pancit Bihon Guisado. We both love the macapuno tart and the special halo-halo. This is a rare sit-down Filipino restaurant with friendly servers. The rest room is clean, complete with amenities like hair spray. We are on our way there today for our nth visit and don't mind having to drive from North Scottsdale. We stop by Fry's Electronics while we're there as it is nearby and we kill 2 birds with one stone. Malinamnam!
