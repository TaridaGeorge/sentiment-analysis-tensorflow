As an avid golfer and habitual tinkerer this place is tops in the valley.  Todd is the man, very knowledgeable and undertands the meaning of good service.  Prices for product (balls, clubs, gloves you name it) and repair work is fair and equitable.   As someone that goes through and tries a lot of clubs and new equipment, AZ Golf Works' consignment program is a nice feature as well.  I can sell my old equipment at their store for a small fee.  I live 30 minutes away and have access to atleast 3 other golf stores within 10 minutes of my house, but always choose to conduct my business with AZ Golf Works.
