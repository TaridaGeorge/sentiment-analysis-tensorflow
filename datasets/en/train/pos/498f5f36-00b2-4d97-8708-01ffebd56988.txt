Does anyone know why their regular subs are $1 more than all the other Jimmy John's? Or is that just when it's delivered, instead of charging a standard delivery fee? I've noticed that with the other types of sandwiches too, and extras...the slim is $4 instead of $3.25, and extra avo is $1.75 instead of $0.75

That's not going to stop me from ordering though :-) Still love their sandwiches...they make the best veggie sub I've had. They load it up with veggies, whereas I have to ask for extra everything at a certain other sub chain and then they still barely put any on. I'd much rather pay a little bit extra for Jimmy John's :-)
