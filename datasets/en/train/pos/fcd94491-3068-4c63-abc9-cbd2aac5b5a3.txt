I love this place!  The food is ALWAYS fabulous and healthy.  The art on the walls is changed out monthly and the staff always friendly.  A great place to chill with a book or the New Times over lunch, they are not open for dinner.  The Prince of Thai's Wrap, is the best and the pasta salad is the best I have ever had.  No mayo !  Also, you can get a "frequesnt visitor" card and after 9 meals get the 10th one free, which trust me, does not take long!  5 stars, always :)
