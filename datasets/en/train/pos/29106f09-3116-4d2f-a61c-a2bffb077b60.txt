As with most places in AZ, the service was excellent. Friendly and hospitable. 

My date and I sat in a cozy corner table. The menu was quite extensive, so we ended up ordering a variety of dishes. The tastiest was the goat cheese and garlic pizza. The risotto was very delicious, as well as the mac-n-cheese. All very delectable.

We ended the carb-tastic meal with the Chocolate Tower that was to die for. And we almost did with the amount of calories that we consumed. 

Overall, very pleasant and delicious dining experience.
