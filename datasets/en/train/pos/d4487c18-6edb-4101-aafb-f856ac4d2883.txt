Urban Beans has very quickly become my fave coffee shop in Phoenix. It's locally owned, unique, good food and coffee, great service, free WiFi, and awesome hours. All of these bode well for a full-time employee + grad student. On weeks when I have an exam, you can find me in here nearly every night.  

They have a Sunday brunch, and always some tasty snacks (quiche, muffins, scones, cookies, etc.) and even breakfast items. Vegan options are available also. 

There's a wine bar also! 

I love the quirky furniture and artwork (which is for sale, by the way). I love giving my patronage to locally-owned businesses, and this is a really good one.
