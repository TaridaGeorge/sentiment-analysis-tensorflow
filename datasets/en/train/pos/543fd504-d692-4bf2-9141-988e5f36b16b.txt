OH WOW! I had lunch there again today (recent discovery). The Turkey Tempe + Avacado is litterally to die for. I love their bagels, music selections, staff, location and bagels (did i say that? YUMM).. I need to try the bagel bags for an office meeting i have a feeling they would be a hit. . I cant say enough nice things, its never packed, plenty of seating and selections. Only downside that I can find is they close at 2, so if your limited to a late lunch you may miss the awesomness :-) eat early...
