We've just (really) returned from Phoenix, and after a five and a half hour drive, I find myself a bit groggy. However, I feel compelled to review For the Love of Old, as it was our first stop on a mid-century buying binge that left me feeling like Hunter S. Thompson at the end.

Owners have excellent taste--price right and really have an eye for aesthetics. Not a big place, so every decision counts. One of the owners said she felt blessed to be able to do this sort of work--and believe me, it shows. Organic talent that brings the best to those who really appreciate it. Outstanding! Going to sleep now!
