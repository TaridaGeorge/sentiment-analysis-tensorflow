If you haven't been here...WHY?!  It is WELL worth the drive.  My little bro, who is/was a picky eater would dine 3 times a day, 7 days a week here if he could (once he starts driving I'm not sure we'll see him around, ha!).

Pecan-smoked onsite, even the restrooms are permeated with the aroma.  Hot links and brisket (sliced) w/ mac and cheese make up my usual.  Root beer is fab, and the choc chip cookies are the best.  And everything is made from scratch.
