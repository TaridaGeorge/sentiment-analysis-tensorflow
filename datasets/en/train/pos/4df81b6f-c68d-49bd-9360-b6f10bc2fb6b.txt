although I don't want to admit I eat a lot of hotdogs... if your craving some junk food or your hung over this is the perfect place to go. Its a different style hotdog, its not like Chicago style with kraut or anything its Mexican with mayo and hot sauce and beans and bacon.. lol... all the sins you should probably not congest yourself with, nevertheless-- an awesome hotdog stand and really nice people.
