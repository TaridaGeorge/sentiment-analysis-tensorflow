Ever since the Pasta Bar closed down i have been on the search for a local Italian joint with a very welcoming menu... and Cuoco Pazzo delivered!

The menu is unpretentious.  The service is very friendly.  The owner comes out to check on his guest and strikes a conversation. 

What keeps me REALLY coming back is that the food has great flavor and doesn't even try.  I've been to restaurants where you taste the food and its like they are trying very hard to make it taste amazing.   At Cuoco Pazzo it comes together very nicely.

Definitely a must go.
