I really enjoy having Sunday Brunches here.  The outdoor seating is nice when the weather is right; they have set up some canopies so everyone sitting outside can really enjoy the warm weather.  The service is great and everyone is friendly.  The food is full of flavor and the portions are perfect; when you sit down you are served croissants and jam before ordering you meal.  When you think it is done your server brings out dessert for your table; it is always great, making the meal and experiance complete and satisfying.
