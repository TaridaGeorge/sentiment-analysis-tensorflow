5 Stars! just because it's the only place I know downtown that caters to us vegetarians in such a creative way. The menu alone will really impress anyone that enters. They have over 60 vegetarian items with fake meat or tofu. It's crazy to imagine what you can try next. 

My favs are the eel, sweet and sour pork and lobster...

You must try it to believe it! I take all my friends vegetarian and meat eaters.
