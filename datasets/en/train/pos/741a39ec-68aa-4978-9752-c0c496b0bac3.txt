Decided to check this place out after finding it accidentally.  A work colleague and I decided to hit up the lunch buffet and came away pleasantly surprised.  Staples like the Butter Chicken and Lamb Vindaloo were excellent and I was surprised to see a HUGE selection along with a fresh looking salad bar.  

Naan bread was frequently brought to our table and we were given the option of garlic or regular.  Both were very good.  I was also very happy with the service as my iced tea was kept full constantly.  The price was also right as I have tried a few different places around town which were subpar in comparison but way more expensive.  

Overall I can recommend coming for lunch as we had an excellent experience and I look forward to coming back for dinner and bringing family/friends.  A great dining experience!
