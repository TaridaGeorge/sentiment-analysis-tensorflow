Hubs and I didn't have a reservation like we needed to get a good table. Our fault.  So we ended up at the bar, and we were lucky to get those seats; this place fills up fast.  
The food is excellent quality authentic. 
The ambiance is dark, with only candles for lighting, leather booths that looked really comfy. So make reservations and enjoy.
