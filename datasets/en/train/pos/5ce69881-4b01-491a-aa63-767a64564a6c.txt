They do what they say they will do.  They are extremely thorough compared to previous companies I have used.  They also help identify other areas outside of pest control that may be improved to protect my family and my property and that's just cool!  I use them and I know others will be as happy as I am.  Legacy Pest Control is based out of Mesa. We live in San Tan Valley and they have no problem coming down to us.
