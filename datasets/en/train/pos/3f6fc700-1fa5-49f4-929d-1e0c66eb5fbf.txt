Ok, you have all heard it before, but I am going to say it anyway.
I love this place.  I always get the mozzarella sandwich and it is one of my favorite sandwiches, ever.  The homemade mozzarella is delicious, especially when they make it extra salty.  The bread is wonderful, always. It is a very large sandwich, you can easily save half for later if you want.  Lux next door has awesome lemonade, very sour.
