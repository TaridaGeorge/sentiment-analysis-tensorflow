Needed to wash my dog today and have been to CNC previously - and have thought they were awesome.  Well today - they managed to top awesome!  My dog had a thorn in her foot that I could not get out.  Their groomer Sandy immediately offered to help - and after about 15 minutes of struggling with a squirming dog - she pulled out a thorn that was about 1/2" long!  I could not have done this without her - and this would have been a HUGE vet bill to taker her to the vet.  Aside from having an awesome facility - they have an awesome staff that is extremely friendly and helpful!
