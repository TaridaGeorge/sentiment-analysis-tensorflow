The owner really knows his stuff. My whole family goes here and his work is superb. But what's even neater is that his prices are very reasonable. He's a personable guy. It's like dealing with someone from the days when people trusted one another. For example, I gathered up some shoe accessories to purchase (polish and shoe pad) and he told me I could just take them and pay later when I picked up the shoes that he was repairing for me. It made me feel great. I'm very happy that we have found Artisans Shoe and Leather Repair!
