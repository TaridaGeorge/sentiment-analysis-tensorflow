LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie theater!  

Giant screen, impressive seating, surround sound that truly puts you in the middle of the action... what more could you ask for?  (Oh yeah, dollar drinks and yummy popcorn!)

I always make a point to see big-ticket movies at the Cine Capri.  This past week I saw Inception there.  What an amazing experience!  I'll definitely be coming back for more.
