first words out of my mouth after entering this location: "it doesn't smell like mildewed clothes in here!!!!" 

three cheers for cleanest goodwill i've ever been to.

this place was amazing! cara and i came here looking for a project. the furniture selection was crummy. we were hoping to find a wood table or night stand or something maybe with drawers. no luck. it was mostly plastic faux wood. 

we did find a ton of other amazing things for a different type of project. a guy behind us in line found citizens jeans w the tags still on them. 

tons of board games w all the pieces. really, really great good will. my fav so far!
