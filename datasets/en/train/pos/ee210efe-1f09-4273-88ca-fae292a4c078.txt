Cannot recommend TJ's enough. Also, if you are looking for a good salsa, Trader Joe's chipotle brand is absolutely the BEST salsa I've ever had. Perfect sugar/acid ratio, actual REAL chipotle peppers (some companies just add smoke flavoring), not too hot, not too mild, just absolutely fantastic. I can't buy any other salsa now. $2.50 a jar too, so cheap!
