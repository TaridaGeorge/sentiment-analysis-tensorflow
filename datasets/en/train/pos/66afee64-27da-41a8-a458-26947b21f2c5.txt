What a brilliant place to have breakfast. The coffee was delicious, and the staff was entertaining and very friendly.

And they have crepes! Spectacular ones!

If you're in or around Old Town you should absolutely stop by. Grab a sandwich or crepe to go, or take a seat in their cute little dining area. Plus, the staff openly speak French and at least one of them may break out into song. Highly recommended.
