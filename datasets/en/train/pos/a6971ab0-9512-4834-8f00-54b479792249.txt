I live within walking distance of this Blimpie's. I love this place. The food is great and the service is too. They have a great selection of breads, meats, condiments, and chips. 

The Blimpie's Best sandwich is my favorite, prepared as toasted bread/melted cheese/heated meat. 

When I first moved to PHX last fall I avoided this place because I thought it was fast food and probably like Subway, but I kept seeing tons of people going in there so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did!
