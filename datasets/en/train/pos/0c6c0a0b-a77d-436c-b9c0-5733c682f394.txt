My favorite pizza place and lucky me, super close to home! I always get it to take out, so I can't comment on decor, but the service is always fast and friendly. When a friend suggested it, I was not enthusiastic because I think of Chicago pizza as that gross deep dish mess. I was pleased to hear their thin crust pizza is super thin. I was suprised that they slice their round pizza into rectangles, but it works well. Now I find myself thinking about how good their pizza would taste... and how nice it would be not to cook. Oh, and when you get peppers and grated cheese they give you the nice fresh stuff in little cups rather than those nasty packets of dried up light brown stuff.
