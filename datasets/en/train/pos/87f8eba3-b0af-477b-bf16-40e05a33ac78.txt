This place puts a smile on my face! It's silly because it looks like a granny decorated it, but the food is probably better than most of my grandma's food-so who's to complain?

I got the turkey sandwich with mashed potatoes. I was so surprised when it came out with real carved turkey!! I felt like it was Thanksgiving! The potatoes were super yummy too! My bf got the pork tenderloin sandwich-it was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. I would definitely come back :)
