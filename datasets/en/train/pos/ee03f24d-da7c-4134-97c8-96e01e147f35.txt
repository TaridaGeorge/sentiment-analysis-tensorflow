Love this place! I wish we can get some Cracker Barrels in Cali! had the Mama's french toast meal.. so Delicious! I thinks my only complaint would be the sausage patties, I get the size for the kids meals but for an adult meal? Anyway, can't go to Az without a stop at good 'ol Cracker Barrel, will definately be back next time I'm in town!
