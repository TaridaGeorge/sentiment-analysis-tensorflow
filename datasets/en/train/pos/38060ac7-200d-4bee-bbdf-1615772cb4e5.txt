Now, I've been a YC's fan for years, but, dangit, this is so much better.  The meat is raw and fresh, just like you get at the grocery store.  Every time i've been, the staff has been very helpful and organized.  The veggie selection is out of this world (they have baby corns!) And the sauces are quite creative. This is the spot: healthy, yummy, and they have one of those punch cards.  Love.
