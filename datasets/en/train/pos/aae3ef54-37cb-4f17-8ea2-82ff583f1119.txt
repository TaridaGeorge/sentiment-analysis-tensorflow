My family and I were just passing through town looking for a decent bite and decided to resort to the Mall we were passing, and boy did we luck out!  The service was prompt, helpful and friendly and the food was delicious and inexpensive.  Even the kids were happy, and we're all pretty spoiled with a great Thai restaurant just down the way (if you're ever in Southern Marin, I recommend Thep Lela!), so we were very grateful to the travel gods that day, I can tell you.
