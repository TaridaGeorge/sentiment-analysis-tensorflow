Love this place. It has a cool coffee shop vibe, plenty of tables, comfy couches and chairs and a bar kind of area.  They've always been super cool and friendly.  Also, they have lots of creamer options including soy, almond, and rice milk!

I've been there 5 times, usually stopping in on a weeknight after work, but once I stopped in mid-day during the week and the owner made it a point to say say Hello and ask how I found out about them.  He was very energetic, positive and seemed like the kind of person who really cares about his business and his customers.
