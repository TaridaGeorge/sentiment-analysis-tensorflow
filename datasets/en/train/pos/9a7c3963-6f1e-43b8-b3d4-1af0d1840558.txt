Apparently it's been thoroughly renovated as a 1956-built hotel where the Hollywood elite hung out.  I can see this.  It's retro Mad Men heaven!  Very tastefully appointed form the lobby, lounge to the rooms.  Great mid century mod design and furnishings.  The rooms are all like suites.  Large, comfortable, well decorated, convenient and with every amenity you could need.  Great space, awesome bathrooms and just a great environment.  I wish my stay hadn't been for business and thus, so short.  I'd definitely come back just to hang out there!

Also, the food at their restaurant ZuZu was great as well!
