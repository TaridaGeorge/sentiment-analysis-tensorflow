I don't think my husband will let me rate it anything less than 5 stars... 

Parking for us was okay since we did not park in the lot, we parked at neighboring house for 5 bucks.  Grabbed some towels from the hotel and staked out our claim on the lawn... People were very friendly.  My hubby met some folks from Dixon, IL the day before and they came by to say Hi... and of course, watching the Cubbies - can't beat that!!!
