Wow. This tiny slice of gelato heaven is next to La Grande Orange. I don't even much of a sweet tooth and I'm thinking about it at 3:00 AM.  The place is run by an Italian couple who obviously know their stuff -- the gelato is magical.  The pistachio is amazing. Peanut butter -- amazing. Anything with chocolate -- amazing. Fresh fruit gelato? Amazing. Lunge for any daily-special flavors. Try it all. Keep going back. Arlecchino is relentless.
