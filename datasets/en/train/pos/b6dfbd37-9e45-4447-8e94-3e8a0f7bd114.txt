I don't know what they do to the bread here but it's so addicting and great. In fact it's the best bread I've ever tasted nobody compares to this place. 

So far my favorite menu item is Gorgonzola Pasilla Chile Penne with the garlic bread. I've probably been here 15-20 times and I've never had any issues with the place and in fact they just seem to be getting better each time I visit.
