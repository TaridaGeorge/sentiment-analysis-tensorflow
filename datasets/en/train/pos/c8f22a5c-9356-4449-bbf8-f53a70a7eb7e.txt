Love this place. We use to go to a nearby ice cream joint, but now this is the place to be. My daughter and I stop by to bring home gelato for my wife all of the time. They have some cool obscure flavors like chocolate chili (love it!) or sesame ginger (you gotta try it, but it's ok to not buy). Enjoyed this all of the time.
