This place is so many things: a lovely wine bar, breakfast joint, beautiful place to relax - and most importantly, an AMAZING place to watch the World Cup. My friends and I stopped by here for the first round of matches. We chose Bomberos because, unlike any other Valley bar/restaurant, they are the only place to be open by 4 a.m. - every day of the World Cup! So we had to support. We're so glad we did. We had an amazing breakfast, with coffee and tea, and had fun cheering along. 

What I ate: the Uruguayo, which is amazing. :)
