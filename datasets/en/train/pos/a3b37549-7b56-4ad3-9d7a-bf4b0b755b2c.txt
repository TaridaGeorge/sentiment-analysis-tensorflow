I love My Florist Cafe. The sandwiches and salads are excellent, the hours are late and it's quirky enough to stay interesting. Casual enough that I don't mind swinging by on the way back from a Coyotes game, but nice enough that I don't feel like I'm slumming it. Phoenix needs more restaurants like this.

And parking is much better now with the North parking lot.
