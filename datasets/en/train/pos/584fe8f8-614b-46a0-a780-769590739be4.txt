Chick-fil-a is awesome. My kids love the food and the playground. They have family nights on tuesday. They have balloons. The restaurant is always clean and everyone is super friendly. They offer to get you refills and help to clean your table. What fast food place does that? I really like the food here too although my choices are limited because of the vegetarian issue but I usually get a large fruit cup and a side salad and I'm good.
