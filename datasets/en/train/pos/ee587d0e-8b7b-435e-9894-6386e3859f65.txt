For anybody that wants the feel of a traditional diner from the 50s, 60s, and 70s Lenny's fits that bill. The food is appropriately tasty and filling. Their burgers are some of the best in town, as long as you're not looking for healthy fitness related food that is :)

And the chocolate peanut butter shake is amazing. My 7 year old son, who is a notoriously picky eater, recently had a burger shake combo and was in a total food coma by the time we got to our car. He now begs to go back (mostly for the shake, but he liked the burger too).

If you're downtown and feel the urge to splurge on something you know can't be good for you then head over to Lenny's!
