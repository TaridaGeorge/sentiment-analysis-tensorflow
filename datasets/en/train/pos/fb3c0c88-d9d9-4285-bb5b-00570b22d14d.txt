Wow, it took over 2 1/2 years to circle back around to this Old Country.  Maybe it's because it's 28 miles from my house!  Anyhow, I finally got back here today, joined by Mike C. to see how they're doing.

Everything was great here today, & I see that it was way back last time, so what was it doing at only 4 Stars all this time?  Oh well, that will get fixed this time!

So what did they have today?  Well, "the usual", if you please.  There were three kinds of soup, lots of salad goodies, really good chicken tenders, pork ribs, & lots of other things plus a big dessert selection.  It was everything you could hope for in this type of place, for the money, so it's 5 Stars for Old Country Buffet, Glendale.  YUM!     :-))

Lunch Buffet:  $7.49/$6.99 Sr.
