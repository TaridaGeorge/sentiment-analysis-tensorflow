This place definitely rocks.  I am a pancake lover, and this place has the absolute best pancakes I have ever had.  Then for lunch, they have soup, good soup.  It's hard to find good soup in AZ when you are a Chicago Girl.
I would recommend this to anyone who is in the old town area or even traveling for a short period of time.  It's part of the Scottsdale Experience
