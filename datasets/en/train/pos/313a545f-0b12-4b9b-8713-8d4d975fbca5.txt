Mmmmm. The beef pho is soooo tasty as is the beef sandwich. Why they dont have the bacon sandwich [Banh-mi] is beyond me. It's a little more than I'd like to pay for Vietnamese, but it's worth it. I have been twice and everything has been great. The egg rolls were a pleasant surprise as well. Definitely a place I'll be back to. Owner is a not a talker or smiler but does have an awesome metal cart on which he toodles your food out to you. Awe-some!
