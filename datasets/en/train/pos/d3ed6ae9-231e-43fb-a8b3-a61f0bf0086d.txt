i am very impressed with this place. The unique decor and inside/ outside set up of tables was a nice change from the ordinary. This place feels like a cottage--- very homey. For lunch on a Saturday, the place was packed-- i think we sat at the last open seat. The deserts are VERY tasty and homemade in house. If the weather is nice, sit outside!
