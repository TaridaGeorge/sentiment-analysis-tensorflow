Best sandwiches I've had in the valley, bar none.  The Super Sicilian is my go-to, and I have to say, their toasted bread with its delicious sprinkling of sesame seeds is worth the trip even if it didn't surround a wonderful sandwich prepared by the owner and his family.   I only wish they had more locations.
