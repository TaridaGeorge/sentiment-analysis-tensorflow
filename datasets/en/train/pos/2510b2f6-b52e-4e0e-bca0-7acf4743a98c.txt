I read this rating but went in and bought hair anyhow. The hair they carry is all different prices. Starting from low priced for lower quality to higher priced for higher quality. The clips ins started at 85.00 and went up from there. Tey are priced according to length and blonde is also a couple of dollars higher. I thought it was a great price. The wigs  are beautiful. I may get some just for the ease. The customer service was AWESOME! The girls that work there were so helpful. I  didnt want to leave. Great atmosphere. Very helpful and educated. Busy store so they must be doing something right. Cute and clean and very inviting. I will be back Ã nd bring my friends. Thank you Sunnys
