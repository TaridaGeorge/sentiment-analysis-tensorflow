When I walked into this place I immediately felt the energy of Love and acceptance.  As i sat through the service I had to hold back tears.  this is a place of love, acceptance, and spirituality.  
it is a place for everyone, no matter your sexual orientation, your religion, your beliefs..  all they teach is Love, its amazing!

i am so glad i found this place!  If you are looking for a place for acceptance no matter what, this is definitely the place for you.
