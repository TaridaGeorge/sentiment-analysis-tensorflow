I can't get enough of this pizza. Tonight I took my friend there for her birthday..started with the house salad which was crisp and refreshing.. the ranch was ranch and didn't taste like seasoned mayo.awesome. I ordered the lil margherita and couldnt wait to taste that sweet goodness they have for a sauce and lo and behold the margherita is a white pizza???? You know what? It didnt matter it was magnificent without the signature sauce. This place is the best pizza place in Phoenix...hands down
