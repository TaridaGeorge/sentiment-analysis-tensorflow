Took guests to the Mission the other night, and that's always risky.....just when you have hyped some place up.....that's when the service or something will be off, BUT NOT THE MISSION.  It was, AGAIN, a wonderful experience in every way.  The tacos, jicama salad, and guacamole were fresh, flavorful, and delicious.  They had a nice selection of Malbec, too.  We celebrated a birthday and they brought out a sweet dessert, chocolate churros......with a sparkler to liven it up.   Nice touch.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
