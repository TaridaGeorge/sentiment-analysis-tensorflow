I have lucky enough to come here 2 x's now. I can only say good about this store. Rusty helped me the first time. He was so kind as to explain everything to me about gold and silver. More than i ever knew before. 
They have beautiful high quality items that are new, and they also have some wonderful Vintage pieces as well. Very unique pieces that you would have a hard time to find anywhere else.
 The thing i really like the most here is you do not feel pushed, you are treated very nicely weather you are there to buy or sell. Lots of parking in the lot as well.
 It is located in a large shopping center so it is easy to find. 
I feel they are very fair and honest and you won't feel cheated.
 So isn't that the best part of all.
