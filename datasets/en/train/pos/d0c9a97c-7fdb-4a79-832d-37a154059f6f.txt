It is rare that I have a dish that is unlike anything I have ever had...that makes me think I only wish I lived locally so I could have it again...but that is how I feel about the sweet potato and chicken risotto!.  It was extraordinary.  Fresh asparagus, pancetta, and pine nuts mixed in make it all just delicious- bite after bite.    And we dropped off our kids across the street at Safari Kid Care and all together it was a great vacation evening!!  Kids had fun, we ate well and had a nice short walk across the street to our car.  YUM.
