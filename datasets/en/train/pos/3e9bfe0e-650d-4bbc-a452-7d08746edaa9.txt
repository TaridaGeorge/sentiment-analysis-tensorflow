Love the pizza, and not just because it was free :D  We had a coupon from a mailer and thought we'd try it, sooo good! Even my son who is almost 3 won't eat pizza from anywhere- but he ate Barro's.  The restaurant was clean and well staffed, very friendly and priced well considering the area, located in (N. Scottsdale). Very happy & will be back again very soon!
