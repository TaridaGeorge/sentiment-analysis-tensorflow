Been going to Noe Import Auto for 10-15+ years.  Honest service fair prices.  Always fix the problem right the first time and I also see some cars coming from other "repair" shops to have them work on their cars too.  The mechanics really know what they are doing.  Everyone I have sent to them has never had anything but great service.
