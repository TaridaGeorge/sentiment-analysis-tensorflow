Amazing new restaurant in the Scottsdale Quarter.  This place has it all, great food, great ambiance, great selection of champagnes and wines. I went there New Years Eve on their second night open and had a fantastic night.  The room was breathtaking and the people there were great, not to mention the service was right on!  Haven't been to any other club in town that has the feeling Narcisse has!  Do not miss out.
