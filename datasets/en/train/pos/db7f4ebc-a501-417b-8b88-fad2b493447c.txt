Hula's is a great addition to our neighborhood, and we've never had a disappointing experience. Great drinks, fresh and tasty apps and main courses, and a very cool staff. We usually go on Monday nights and John takes great care of us at the bar. He makes us feel welcome and appreciated. Thanks, John!
