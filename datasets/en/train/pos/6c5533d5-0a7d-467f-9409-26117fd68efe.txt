Growing up in an Asian house hold, we always had asian food. I'm Cambodian and our foods are very much close to Thai food the only difference is the spices. 

I've tried many different thai food restaurants but no one beats Yupha's. Their pad thai is very delicious and like it hot with extra bean sprouts. You can control how spicy you want the food. 

When you are there you should also try their salad with the peanut dressing. Its hard to describe how good it is you would have to try it yourself. 

The prices are reasonable, if you love thai food you should try out this place.
