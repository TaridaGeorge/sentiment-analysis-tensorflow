I have just recently discovered Luke's and mmmmmmm I am addicted! The best Italian sandwich EVER!!! I ordered the whole because I was starving, but was defeated halfway. I put the half in the fridge for lunch the next day and it still was amazing! Small menu but it is definitely worth it! ps... fries are really good too! om nom nom nom
