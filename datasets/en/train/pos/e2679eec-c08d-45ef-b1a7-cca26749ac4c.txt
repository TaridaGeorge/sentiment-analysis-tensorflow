So my husband and I have been coming here for quite some time.  We lived in Los Angeles and frequented many Dim Sum places there.  We also Visit Vancouver and get some great Chinese food from chinatown.  This restaurant is and has been a great representation of chinese food. Here in AZ there are many fast food places that dumb down there representation of chinese food.  Orange chicken and Sweet and sour chicken aren't the only fantastic dishes the chinese have to offer.  Broaden your culinary horizons and try something more authentic.  Try Dim sum ... It's awesome and fun!!
