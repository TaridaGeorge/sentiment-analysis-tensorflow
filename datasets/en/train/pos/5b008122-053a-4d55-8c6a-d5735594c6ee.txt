There are some decent Mexican joints in Phoenix, but the best and most obvious are the $hitholes down in Central Phoenix where you might get botulism with your burrito.  

We have been here for over 20 years and have traveled to Los Dos Molinos and everywhere everyone tells us to go, but after all of them we come back to Jalapeno Inferno.  Don't let the name fool you.  It has great food, a great vibe the kids love it and it is located on the NE corner of Pinnacle Peak in Scottsdale (Just north of where RawHide used to be).   

Every time an out of town visitor asks for great Mexican food, we also recommend this place.
