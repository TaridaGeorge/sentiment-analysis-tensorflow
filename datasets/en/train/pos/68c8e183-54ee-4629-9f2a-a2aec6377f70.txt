This branch is right down the street from where I work.  It comes in handy when my computer at home is acting up.  I have been coming here about every 2 days or so for the past couple weeks.  They have a good amount of computers.  Some are Express, which means their only for 15 minutes and others allow you to stay on for an hour.  There's hardly ever a wait to use a computer.  If you need to print something, it's 25 cents per page, which isn't that bad.  Faxing is free.  

There's also several areas where you can sit down and get some work done.  

I haven't looked at their book/cd/dvd collections yet, but from what I can tell, there is a wide variety.
