How have I lived a few blocks from this place and just now found out about it?

I'm all about ethnic foods, and Sekong will find itself toward the top of my list.  The most expensive menu item is $10, with most meals about $8.  Most meals come in combo form with rice, soup (Winter Melon at the time we went, delicious), an egg roll and some pickled vegetables.

The decor is awesome - warm and welcoming, with each table featuring a few Cambodian travel books.  Service is awesome and helpful.  The menu has just about anything you could want but it isn't overwhelming (don't worry, nothing is too adventurous).
