I purchased a month's worth of unlimited yoga from a groupon. First of all, let me applaud Urban Yoga for this brilliant marketing idea. As soon as I walked in their for my first day, I was hooked. The setting is beautiful and spacious. They have an extensive store, complete locker room (with fantastic showers!), and firm but patient instructors. I had recently recovered from a foot injury and the instructor personally showed me how to move into poses without stressing my weakened foot muscles. Absolutely worth the monthly pass price. I can't wait to go back again!
