If you ever visit Fountain Hills, you must stop off for breakfast or lunch at this remarkable Bagel shop. My wife and I had lunch there. I ordered a peppered turkey with salami and pepper jack cheese on an everything bagel. The bagel was toasted just right...not burnt. They aren't stingy on the meats either. When you get your sandwich, you wonder how in the heck are you going to take a bite out of it, cause it's huge!! For the sides, instead of ordering chips, you can have potato, pasta or cucumber salad. My all time favorite is the cucumber salad which has cucumbers, scallions and celery. It is a refreshing salad. 

This place is a whole lot better than going to Chompie's.
