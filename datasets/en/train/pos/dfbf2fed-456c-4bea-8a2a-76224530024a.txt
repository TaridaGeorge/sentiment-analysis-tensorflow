I love George & Son's.  I used to live just a couple blocks up the street, so we frequented this place.  My favorites are definitely:

Sesame Chicken ($9.95) - Excellent sauce.
House Fried Rice ($7.95) - With chicken, shrimp, and pork.

I highly recommend both of these.

I've also had the Pad Thai ($9.95), which is pretty good for the price, with more shrimp than I expected.  And, of course, I have had a number of other dishes as well, which are pretty standard (Americanized) Chinese food.
