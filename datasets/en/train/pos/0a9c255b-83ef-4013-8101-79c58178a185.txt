Always great, fast and consistent!  The service is excellent, the staff has worked there for years and is speedy to run around and refill drinks and clear dishes.  It's nice to have the counter service so you don't have to wait to be waited on...because if I am at the mall I am there for serious business:)  If you like a home grown grilled cheese and some tomato soup or a salmon Cesar salad or even a gourmet pizza this is the place.  The brownie and the red velvet cake are hard to resist ...get both!
