Amazing. Just a darn good burger. Got the Arizona, pulled off half the jalapenos, de-lish! Great service, manager was very nice and makes sure Military is discounted all the time. The place is clean and comfortable. The smash fries are so so, not my thing, but I am glad I tried them. Going here will not save your soul, but you'll be glad you tried it.
