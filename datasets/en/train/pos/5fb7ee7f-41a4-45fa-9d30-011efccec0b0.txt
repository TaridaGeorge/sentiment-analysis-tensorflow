5 stars for a deli? When it's this good oh yeah! Great Cuban, great roast beef horseradish but the amazing part was the pancetta wrapped homemade mozzarella and carrot cake. Lemon bar was just a lemon bar but the cake was better than my grandma's and she was a cook for 30 years. Farmers market out front and the service, while hit or miss by whoever was walking by, still slipped my kid a cookie on the way out gratis. We'll be back!
