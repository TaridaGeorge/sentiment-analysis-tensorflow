What else can you ask for? Tasty food, GREAT SERVICE, nice decoration and on a large group they WON'T enforce gratuity!

Of course we were more than delighted to tip well the guy that served us! I ordered the pork sandwich and thou I'm fan of Lee's...this one goes on the top of my list. GREAT! soft still crunchy baguette that matched the ingredients inside. My friends had different things and all tasted good. One of the favorites was the rice crepes and a fish cooked in coconut milk.

Thank you Sekong!!
