The "Supreme Master" is one of my favorite restaurants in town.  The menu is entirely vegetarian with many vegan options.  

My favorite meal:
three-striped vegetable soup, a spring roll with sweet and sour sauce and kung-pow beef with brown rice.   Mmm, mmm good!

My only complaint is the the restaurant is often very quiet and the wait staff is VERY quiet and reserved.  Still, it's a great place to bring a group of friends and have a good time.
