We knew we wanted to do some sight seeing downtown Phoenix and this location would allow us to do just that.  The quality of our stay with Holiday Inn Express has always been excellent, so when we decided to go to a Diamond Back baseball game, we discovered this location within walking distance.

The rooms are spacious, clean and very comfortable.  We had a nice walk to and from the game, and again the next morning to attend Sunday services.  Would recommend this location for anyone needing to do business or pleasure near downtown Phoenix.
