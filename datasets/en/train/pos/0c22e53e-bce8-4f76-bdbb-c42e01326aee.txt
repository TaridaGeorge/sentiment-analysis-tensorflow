After three unsuccessful attempts, I finally made it to La Bocca, and fourth time's a charm! The food was perfectly executed, the service on point and the ambiance relaxing and casual on a weekday afternoon.

The order:

Flight of three ice creams (sorbet - strawberry, lemon, basil, Maya Farm Mint with Chocolate Chips, Salted Caramel with Toasted Almonds) $5

Bruschetta planks: pulled pork, housemade pesto, roasted red pepper
Mozz, basil, roma tomato, qc olive oil & balsamic

Margarita pizza

Warm queen creek olives and artisan toast

Mediterranean plate: basil hummus, babaganoush with warm feta, roasted peppers, queen creek olives, artisan toast and house made flat bread

A 5-star experience all the way.
