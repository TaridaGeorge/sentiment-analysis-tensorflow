Now one of two standalone philosophy stores, Casa Paloma is home to the flagship location. The other is in Dana Park Village Square in Mesa and both stores offer the only places you can go to sample and sniff the entire philosophy collection. You can also get a complimentary mini facial to sample their innovative skincare products. I find the salespeople at both locations very pleasant and excited about what they're selling. The best time to go is holiday season when their seasonal collections are available. Heaven.
