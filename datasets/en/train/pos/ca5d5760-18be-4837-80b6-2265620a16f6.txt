Stopped in here today for lunch with a friend.  Ordered Salads and Sandwiches.  Food was fresh, staff was friendly and made us feel welcome.  This place is very comfortable and inviting.  Didn't sample any of their desserts but if they taste half as good as they looked...........they will be amazing.

Saw a couple splitting what looked like the best apple pie I have ever seen.  Kept hearing them talk about how delicious it was.

Restroom is clean and well kept.

5 Stars - I highly recommend.
