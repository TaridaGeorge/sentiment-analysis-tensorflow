I wouldn't even bother trying to go for dinner.  It is all about lunch here.  I've tried every pizza and love them all.  There is a special place in my heart for the wiseguy and the margherita plus proscuitto.  YUMMY!  Their bread is insane.  I could do with a better drink selection, but that is a minor quibble.
