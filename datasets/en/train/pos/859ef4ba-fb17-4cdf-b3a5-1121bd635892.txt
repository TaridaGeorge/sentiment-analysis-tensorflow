Nestled behind most of the bustle from Scottsdale road, just south of Camelback road, a funky, serene little spa has popped up to serve the skin and eye brows for the otherwise facially deprived.

Full service facials, eyebrows, (as you might guess) massage, and much more, good prices, great service, all in a place that smells really good too.
