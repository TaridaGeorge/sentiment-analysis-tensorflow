I have been going to Bo for years, and he has never lead me astray!  He saved me thousands when my SMG light went off. Rather than a $3500 repair, he took the time to research the issue.  As it turned out, I just needed the fluid topped off.  He is honest to the core, friendly, and efficient.  I wouldn't go anywhere else!
