I'm sitting at Solo right now with a friend, each of us working on our own projects. 

I love this place. Great coffee, all local. 

Also, a great place to work--relaxing, not too busy, and pretty quiet. I'm a coffee-camper, so this is the place for me!

On a side, but no less important note, I think it's really incredible that wife's hair salon and husband's coffee shop are connected. What a great family experience!
