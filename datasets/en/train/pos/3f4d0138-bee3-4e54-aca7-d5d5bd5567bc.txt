I have seen a long line of companies try to fill the juice bar spot in the LA Fitness at McCormick Ranch.  This time it looks like Endurance Cafe is a keeper.  I typically would always walk by the juice bar counter, however now I won't do that again.  Justin, the owner of the company, works the juice bar daily.  Not only is he engaging and a nice guy - he's incredibly knowledgeable about fitness, nutrition and supplements.  He impressed me with his knowledge and has invested his savings in this business to make it work.  It's nice to see an entrepreneur with a goal and the knowledge and commitment to back it up.  This place is fantastic - the products are top notch and flavorful.  Best juice bar and supplement advice possible at this place!
