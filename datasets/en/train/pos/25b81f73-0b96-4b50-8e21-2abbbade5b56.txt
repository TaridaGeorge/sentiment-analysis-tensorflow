I had never heard of Tam's until one of my best friends kept talking about this fabulous little hole in the wall of a place. I'm glad she did. Better yet, I'm happy she decided to pick up some Tam's and head over to my place for dinner.  I gotta admit that Mona is right about Tam's serving up the 'best blackenese chinese soul food' in town. For real****

Best chicken wings. I love their egg foo young w/chicken gravy! Yummers. I will definitely keep this place in mind for the future. I've yet to actually pick up an order from this place but if it tastes just like what I had when Mona brought a bit of Tam's to our house, then it's definitely worth the drive. Five Stars, Baby!
