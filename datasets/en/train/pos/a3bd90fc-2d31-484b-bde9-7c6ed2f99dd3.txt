Tuesdays are 2-for-1 pizza night! Which is amazing. The truffle mushroom pizza is a favorite or some of my friends and I. Along with the bruschetta - (fig/prosciutto is the wonderful). The staff is very accommodating and friendly. Everything about this place is great. The only thing I would say is that some Tuesdays when it's slammed and it's two-for-one pizza night the pizzas are not as good and come out burnt. I would go another night.
