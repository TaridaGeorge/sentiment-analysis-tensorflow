I've been to the Parlor at least five times at this point, and I'm pretty much always up for it when someone suggests it.  Even if I was there less than a week prior.  

I'd wait for a table on a busy night as the bar is loud, but I must say that the bartenders are pretty great eye candy.  

I'm a big fan of the cauliflower appetizer, the Margherita pizza and the beer on draft.  I also am mildly obsessed with their obsession with freshness, the remodeled salon layout and their adorable little garden out front.
