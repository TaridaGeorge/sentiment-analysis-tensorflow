This place exceeded my expectations. My husband and I wanted to go on a romantic dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We heard about Elements that had incredible  views and amazing food with an top master chef. The services was impeccable, and the food is to die for. They even provided us a dessert on the house to celebrate our anniversary. This restaurant is good for first dates, to celebrate a special occasion or if your looking to have a good time. We look forward to coming back!
