Loved the sampler of different pickles.

The decor was fun.  Our waitress was attentive and friendly, explaining to us the menu our first time there.  

We had the reuben sandwich and the sliders.  Both were delicious.

We didn't have any space left for dessert, but we did pick up some pastries for the drive home.
