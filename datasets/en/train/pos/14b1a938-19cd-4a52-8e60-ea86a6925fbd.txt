Dr. Alber and Dr. Freeman are great vets! They spend a lot of time with us when we bring our two dogs in for care and provide excellent care for our animals. The technicians and the office staff are great as well. They know our pets are nervous in the office and are very gentle with them. They know our pets by name and are happy to see us each time we come in. The quality of care our pets receive is reflected in the improvements we have seen in their health and longevity!
