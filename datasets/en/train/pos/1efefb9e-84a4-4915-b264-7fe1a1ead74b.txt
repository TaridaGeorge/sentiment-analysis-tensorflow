Alright! A really good coffee place. So, I went here on my coffee tour of Phoenix (ftw) yesterday with the Bf. He got a hot latte and I got an iced latte. They were both very good. The barista was also very friendly and knowledgeable about coffee. She explained that they have a new espresso machine that uses varying pressures when pulling the espresso shot, which makes for a more smooth coffee. Smooth, it was! Both the iced and hot lattes were not acidic and just had a very pleasant smooth coffee and milk flavor. Also, the foam to latte ratio was very good on the hot version. I will definitely be coming back here.... yum and yum. This may be a new front runner on the coffee tour.
