I spent nearly a year in Phoenix helping my Mom through her last year of life. Essence saved my life while I was in "care taking" mode. The food matched the best I have had across the globe! My favorite? The chicken salad sandwich with basil and lemon. Also the French scrambled eggs done to PERFECTION! And, of course, that chocolate croissant! For those complaining about portion size?
