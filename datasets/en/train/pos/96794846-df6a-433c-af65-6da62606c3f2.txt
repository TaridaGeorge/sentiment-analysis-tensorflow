They have a separate gluten-free menu, so be sure to ask for it.  The food and service were excellent.  I wasn't able to partake in the pre-meal bread offering, but it didn't matter because my meal was big and fabulous!  I had the prime rib and baked potato and was provided with all of the fixings (au jus, horseradish sauce, cheese, real bacon bits, sour cream, etc.).  The food was very tasty and was just as good as any gluten-filled meal.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for gluten-free dining out.
