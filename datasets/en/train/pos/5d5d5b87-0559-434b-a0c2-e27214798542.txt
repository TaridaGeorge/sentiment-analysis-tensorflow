What a breath of fresh air!  In the wake of a hellacious experience with a different appliance repair company, the folks at Wright's Appliance Repair were fantastic!  I made an appointment for my gas dryer to be fixed after another company damaged it further and the tech from Wright's was on-time, very well priced, courteous and fast.  He knew his product and was able to diagnose the issues with great ease.  I would highly recommend and will most definitely use Wright's for all of my future appliance repairs.
