Love this place.  Bring some patience because the wait is sometimes long and there is little seating.  The outside patio is excellent in the fall and early spring!

But I gave it 5 stars for a reason - and that is because the awesomeness of the food absolutely outweighs the wait time.  I acknowledge that this is a personal choice - but if you go and try any of the sandwiches, you'll likely agree.
