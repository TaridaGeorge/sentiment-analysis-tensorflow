I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.

Burgers were very tasty and fresh.  More than a pleasant surprise, to be sure.

Custard?  I had the Turtle Pecan thingy, and it was awesome.  Just wish there was a larger scoop of custard.  The folks were nice, helpful, and friendly.  I'll definitely be going back.
