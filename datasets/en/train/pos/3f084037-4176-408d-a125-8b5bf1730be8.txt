So your at the Scottsdale mall. Your in the good wing... You know, Crate and Barrel, Norstroms, Tiffany, etc and your hungry. Well after spending tons of money why not spend a tad more for a great meal. 

It looks fancy, it's beautiful and really not badly priced. we did appetizers. And the Rubin sliders were to die for.  OY Vey  were they great. The fried pickles may sound weird to you but they are a must. Salads are big. Service wonderful. 

It's a place that made our shopping guilt feel much better. So go a head.... Try it out. Best lunch I've had in a long while!
