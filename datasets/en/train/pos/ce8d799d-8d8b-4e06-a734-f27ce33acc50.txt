Unbelievable, affordable, & some of the best Mexican food I've had in the Phoenix/Scottsdale metro area.  Everything we ordered from the cheese crisp to our entrees (my party ordered tacos & burritos) were absolutely delicious.  The flavor was bursting out of our dishes and the portions were perfect.  The ambiance & DJ spinning music added to the overall experience.  This is my new go-to Mexican restaurant.
