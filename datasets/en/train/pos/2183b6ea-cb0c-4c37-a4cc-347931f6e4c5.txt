Far and away South Chandler's best sushi and tempura, and their miso soup is wonderful too. The staff is very friendly and by your second or third visit, you'll feel like you were missed on the days you didn't come in for lunch. Speaking of which, the lunch special combinations (sushi and tempura, for instance) are not only a great value, but are amazingly fresh and tasty, with the sushi prepared while you wait (never in advance). They have an extensive menu for specialty rolls, too, and if there is a better sushi option in the east valley, we haven't found it. Can't recommend highly enough!
