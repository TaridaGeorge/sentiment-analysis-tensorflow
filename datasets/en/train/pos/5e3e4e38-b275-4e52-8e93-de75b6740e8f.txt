I flew into Phoenix this weekend and had the most delightful experience with US Airways. Both on the way there and on the way back, the staff was professional, accommodating, friendly, helpful, patient and extremely efficient.

I haven't had this great of an experience flying in a VERY long time.

I want to thank the crew of US Airways for a FANTASTIC job. I will most definitely be flying with you again in the VERY near future.
