I haven't had this great of an experience at the dentist in years!  Dr Tran took her time, made my procedures painless and really tried to work with me and my budget.  Not only is she a great dentist, but her office is completely environmentally friendly (down the the tile and paint) and the tv's on the ceilings made the procedures fly by. 

I HIGHLY recommend!
