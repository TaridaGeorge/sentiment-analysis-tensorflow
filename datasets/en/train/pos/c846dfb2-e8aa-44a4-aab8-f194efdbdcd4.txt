This is a great find!!! Food was fresh and delicious. My boyfriend and I were looking for restaurants by our apartment that delivered and stumbled across this gem on Yelp!

The gentleman on the phone  that took my order was very nice and polite. 
It was delivered in lightning speed too. I placed our order at 6:45 and it was here by 7:00

We ordered the following:

Avocado Boat
Sunset Roll
Sushi Deluxe
Chicken Fried Rice
Shrimp w/ Black Pepper Sauce

was all GREAT!!!!!!!
