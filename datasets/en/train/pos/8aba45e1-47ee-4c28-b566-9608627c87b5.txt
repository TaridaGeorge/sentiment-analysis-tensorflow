After a long week or after a big working event, I have been going to this location for some pampering.  Love it, and it's reasonable. I usually go all out and get a manicure and a pedicure "with everything" .  A really nice staff.  My nails and toenails always looked good for weeks when I've gone.  I've never really had to wait that long to get a chair and they have stayed open late for walk-ins.
