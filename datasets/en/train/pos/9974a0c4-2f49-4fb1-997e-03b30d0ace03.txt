Very comfortable place. Tried the mocha velvet...i like it a lot. Although I enjoyed the selection of music I initially thought it was a little loud.  I got "engrossed" in the work I brought with me so got used to the music level rather quickly. The lady next to me was crunching on a toasted ciabatta which smelled heavenly. Ahhh...perfectly toasted bread. Definitely a simple pleasure worth savoring. 

Only wished this place was closer to my neck of the woods. Oh, and no outlets to plug in laptops.
