Think belly-buster and you have Harlow's Cafe. It is in a free standing building with parking in front-not really a "lot". It is dark and dated but the food is delicious, heavy and copious!  I had a huge omlete with salsa, chile and cheese, hash browns, coffee, biscuits.  Ugh, getting hungry thinking about it. 
The waitresses all could be in a '50's pin up calendar, curvey and beautiful. It's quite a sight to see the regulars come in and get called by name. They have regular tables and regular girls. And those girls work the flirt for their tips. But how much does one really have to work a 50 year old bachelor? Don't ask me, that was a previous life....
Love it but can't visit often or my Lucky Jeans won't fit. And I loves me Luckies!
