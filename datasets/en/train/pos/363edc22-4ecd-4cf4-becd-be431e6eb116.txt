I love ClimbMax! I've been a member here, off and on, for over 2 years now. They have, hands down, the best bouldering of any gym in the Phoenix area. It is absolutely huge! I mean come on, you can boulder all the way up through a cave from the first to the second floor. How do you beat that?

Also, recently the ratings for the rope routes have changed to be by community consensus. This appears to be making for fairer, more consistent and stiffer ratings. This place is constantly improving, taking into consideration customer feedback and growing as a gym and as a community.

ClimbMax is absolutely my top choice for indoor climbing in Phoenix.
