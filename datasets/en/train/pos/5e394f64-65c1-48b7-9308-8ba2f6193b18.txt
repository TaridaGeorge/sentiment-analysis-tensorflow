I have used AZ Taste for multiple events, sometimes last minute, and it's always the best.  Heck, they have gone half way across the state for me with little warning!  Their food is awesome and the service is impeccable.  These guys have it down to a science and their pricing is always better than any other catering company I have gotten bids from!  Cant wait for my next party...
