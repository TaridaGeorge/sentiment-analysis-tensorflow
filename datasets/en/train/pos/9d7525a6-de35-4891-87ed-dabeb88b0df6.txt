The Farm has never, ever disappointed. With it being officially Fall in Phoenix, the weather was perfect for a picnic lunch. 

I had the Grilled Chicken Spinach Salad. It had grilled chicken, spiced pecans, dried cranberries, goat cheese, tomatoes and spinach served with creamy Farm house dressing. The goat cheese gave it an extra wonderful kick. 

Fantastic! Fresh and delicious! The best part was a side of their Roasted Sweet Potato Salad. It had pecans, chives and some sort if chili spice. Excellent contrast to the sweetness. Okay, I lie...the best part of the meal was the Apple Turnover I bought and brought home. That WAS the absolute best! Great stuff!
