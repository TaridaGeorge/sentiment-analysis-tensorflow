Stopped by Brix yesterday to check it out after it came recommended from a wine friend who lives up north. She had described it to me as the way to do a wine bar right and she was spot on!!

Bryan was an extremely gracious host and my sis and I love love loved our bottle of D2! (Gotta support my WA wine obsession!) The energy was great and it was quite busy for a Sat afternoon! Also, the wine selection is awesome - I wish it were my own personal with a few more WA wines of course! And, it's at retail pricing with no corkage if you open a bottle, which is fantastic!!

When the GF BF gets back, we will definitely head north with our own snacks to hang out at Brix again! Simply delightful!
