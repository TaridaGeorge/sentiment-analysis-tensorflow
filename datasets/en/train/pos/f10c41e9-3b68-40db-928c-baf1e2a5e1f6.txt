My office is in Old Town Scottsdale so I have a lot of options for lunch. This little place is by far my favorite! My "usual order" is the "Man Salad" which is just amazing- lots of protein and good fats to keep you full all afternoon!

They are always so friendly EVEN when they're busy. The thing I like most, however, is simply how consistent they are. The salad is the same every time, their service is excellent every time, and they are as fast as possible every time. You see them hustling to get orders done as quickly as they can. The place is really just wonderful- keep doing what you're doing guys!
