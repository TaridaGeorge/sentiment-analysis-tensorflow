Casey's is forgiving and she gets 5 stars. I've been going there for ten years and even though I have been kicked out multiple times.. (Using the blarney stone, using the mens restroom, generally causing a rukus).. They always let me back in. (Sometimes with a stern warning to behave..) Their food is decent and inside dining suitable for family.
I truly love this place, she is like my home away from home.
