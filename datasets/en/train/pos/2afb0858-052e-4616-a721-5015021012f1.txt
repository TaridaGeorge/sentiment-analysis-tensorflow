Okay... so the building looks like a dive or strip club from the street.  Get over it if you are looking for excellent breakfast food.  

We just moved to the area from out of state and I immediately began the important task of searching for a great breakfast spot.  I saw the reviews for Harlow's on Yelp and had to try it. 

I've eaten there twice in the last week and the food & service have been excellent. Day 1 I had chorizo & eggs which was amazing.  Today I had eggs benedict and the hollandaise sause with fresh lemon was ridiculously good.

If excellent breakfast food is what you're after, you need to give this place a shot.  And let's be honest, the waitress outfits don't hurt the cause either ;-)
