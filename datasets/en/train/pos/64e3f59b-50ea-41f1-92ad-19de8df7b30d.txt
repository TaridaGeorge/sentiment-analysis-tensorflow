Hey to my Chicago people...for those of you who shop at Aldi's well this place is like that but better. This particular one is only 2 miles from my Apt. here in Phoenix and i have to tell you it has fresh fruits and vegetables and even a discount section that changes daily. They have great packaged to go fresh meals and the Organic White Cheddar Snack are a must buy. The "D-lites" Turkey Sausage and Cheese Croissants are also a must buy, i have them for breakfast every morning at my job. You get 4 huge sandwiches for under 5 bucks, and the best part is that the entire store is self checkout...so hardly ever any lines, and in case you need assistance someone is always there to assist you.
