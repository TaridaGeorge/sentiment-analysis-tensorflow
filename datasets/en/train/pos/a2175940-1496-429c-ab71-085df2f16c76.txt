I met a friend here for lunch, and we ordered the soup and salad, the Bistecca
 salad, and minestrone soup, really good price, and the salad was chilled, it was delicious, the soup was pretty good too, I think I like Olive Garden's Minestrone better, my girlfriend says their Happy Hour is really great also !
