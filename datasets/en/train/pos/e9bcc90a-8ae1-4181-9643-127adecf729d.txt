I love Chill. Frank and his wife make amazing vegan concoctions that bring you back again and again. Plus, it's a great deal! On Friday nights, they are kind enough to give out the minis of the soy froyo for FREE. They also are very philanthropic in the community, helping student groups at ASU fundraise. My only complaint would be that they use styrofoam...Compostable cups would be the perfect accompaniment to a sustainable treat like soy froyo.
