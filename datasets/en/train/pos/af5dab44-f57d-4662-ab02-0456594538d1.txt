HOORAY for an alternative to too-big bowls of ice cream and nasty non-fat frozen yogurt on Mill!  

These frozen treats are delicious- you can tell they're freshly made and there's a great variety to choose from.  Eight year old loves the key lime pie (has a graham cracker crust on one side. yum); 2 1/2 year old loves the strawberry; my current favorite is the pineapple and raspberry, but I'm looking forward to moving onto some creamier, dairy-filled delights when I can start eating dairy again.  On that note, this place is great for people with food allergies- no wheat? no dairy? no problem- everything here is great!
