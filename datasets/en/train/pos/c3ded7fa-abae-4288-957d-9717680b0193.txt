You'd think my memory would have faded on this place by now, but I still remember the awesome-ness of this place some odd weeks later.  I remember all the little luxuries and wonderful service.  The stunning mountain views and landscaping.  The infinity edge pool.  The many, many water bottles they handed us to help us fend off heatstroke.  

Come here!  You won't be disappointed.
