went again last night.
more of the same kind of awesome.

tried the papaya mango spring roll.. so hot. literally. so good.
the lemongrass clams were also amazing.

hittin this place up on wednesdays, is a good move because of the farmers market. they have bacon wrapped tomatoes as one of their specials. i didn't try this, but it was ordered and 'it's like a BLT'.. all super good.
