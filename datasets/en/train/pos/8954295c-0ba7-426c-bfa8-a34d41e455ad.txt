Had an issue with a pizza I had ordered. After it was brought to the attention of the manager, I had a new pizza to try. Thanks you guys, you are the greatest. I've only ordered delivery from this location so I do not know how the local restaurant feels. Great pizza, great workers, fantastic concern for the customer by the whole Streets company. 

Thank you... very much. We love you!
