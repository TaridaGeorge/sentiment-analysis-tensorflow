Great Great Event!!  Who doesn't like friendly people, local businesses that actually care about their customers, and great food.  Oh ya live music and the beer garden... duh!!  Four Peaks took great care of us!!  I saw everything from Premium Sunglasses www.SunglassGarage.com to Zia Records to tons of Food Vendors.  It was packed but in a good way people were out and about having a great time.  I will go again next year 4 sure!!
