I had Hank fix some of my sprinkler issues.  Not only was he thorough in explaining what he was doing and why, he always responds to my calls on further questions and is willing to come back to address any additional issues.  He does all of the work himself which means he ensures the work gets done, unlike some big companies that send people out that are in a hurry to get done and leave things undone.
