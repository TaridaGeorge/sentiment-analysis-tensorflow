Fantastic food. Yes, its crowded on a Friday or Saturday night, but the rest of the time it's not a problem. The sushi and sashimi are great, and there are tables where your other food is cooked right in front of you as well. Becomes an incredibly trendy spot on weekends. Really cool atmosphere, especially if you manage to go when it's not crazy.
