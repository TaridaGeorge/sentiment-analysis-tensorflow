This is a small, but well-stocked Whole Foods! I was able to find my favorite Marich chipotle dark chocolate covered almonds here, as well as my favorite grain-free gluten-free raw granola by 2 Moms in the Raw. BOTH items are EXTREMELY hard to find. I scour each WFs I visit. I live in LA, and this WFs beat all the WFs in the SoCal area because they had these items. The hot bar and salad bar are small, but had a decent selection. I really liked the bulk section at this WFs, since it had so many good chocolate items, as well as organic dried fruits and nuts that I don't normally find. I've been to a million WFs and this one passes with flying colors! The location is very easy to find and get to as well.
