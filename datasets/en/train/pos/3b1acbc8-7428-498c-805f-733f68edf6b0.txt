Best pizza in Chandler if you like thin NY style. For pan/ Chicago hit Oregano's. 
Anyway, the ingredients are primo. I like the pepperoni (small but slightly thick and very flavorful) and sausage. The mozzarella is prime but placed intermittently so order extra chesse if you like your pie completely covered. 
We have eaten here several times. They will give the kids some dough to play with which keeps them occupied. Salads are tasty also.
In summary: Patsy is the bomb !!!!
