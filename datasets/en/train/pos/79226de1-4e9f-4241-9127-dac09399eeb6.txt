Some restaurants are ok but you just don't think about coming back to them. Not Hillstone. I am there at least 2-3 times per month and it is always great. 
The building is new, beautiful architecture, interior has great lighting, both natural during a day and artificial at night. I like cozy relaxing places and I feel always very relaxed after 2-3 hour dinner there. 
Food - always excellent, especially Thai Salad, sushi, artichokes, chicken, soups... everything I tried was good. Service: on a scale from 1-5: I give them 5+. Coffee is local , from LUX. 
The beautiful patio has comfy furniture and a fireplace. 
Sometimes you need to wait 45 minutes for a table,  so it is a good idea to avoid the most busy parts of the day. I took there several of my out of state clients and they all were impressed.
