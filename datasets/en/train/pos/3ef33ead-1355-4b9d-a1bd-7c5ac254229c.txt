Okay, as much as I love Starbucks Coffee. . . This gives them a run for their money for sure!  

The interior decor is nice, very relaxing.  The baristas were friendly and what I enjoyed most is the fact that once your drink or food is ready, they don't just scream your name out at the bar, they actually walk it over to you.. whether you're sitting outside or inside!  Amazing.  I wish there was one closer to home, but It was worth the drive

Truly the way coffee is suppose to taste
