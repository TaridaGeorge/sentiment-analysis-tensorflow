My favorite bar within 3 miles of my house! 
Katie makes some awesome special drinks, my favorites included her Holiday coffee she made last winter and over the summer she was making a strawberry lemonade drink that was SO YUM! 
The two things that originally got me hooked on this lace was the iced coffee drink & they have Strongbow (i only wish it were on tap!). 
I love the jukebox & rest of the staff as well - all very nice and if it's not busy easy to chat up.
