I have a friend who works here, so I get all the gossip on Britney Spears, Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston when they stay here. 

The hotel is on Camelback Mountain, giving it a relaxing feel and the views are amazing.

The room was great, the bed was so comfortable and the room service was fantastic.

I'd recommend this hotel to anyone!
