LOVE this place! One of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at, so far. Best salsa ever! The cheese enchiladas are REALLY good, too. My husband gets the chicken tacos, and those are kind of pricey. $4 per taco. So $12 for 3 tacos... I mean really? No beans and rice or anything. But anyway, the food is really good and the servers are always really nice. Yum!
