We had this place cater my husband's birthday party.  The food was first rate and very well-priced.  Our friends raved about it all night long.

I did my homework and really shopped around for the best food, best service at the best price and Chicago's Gyros were hands-down the best choice for North-Central Phoenix.

Would not hesitate to hire them again to cater anything!
