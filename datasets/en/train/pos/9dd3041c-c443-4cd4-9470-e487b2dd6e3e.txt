Stopped in here for lunch today with Mike C., Robyn N. & Arlin B.  I thought the restaurant was great, with a lot of small dining areas on all different levels giving it character, & a pretty little lake outside which was in plain view of our table.  Also, there's a nice covered patio out there, of which at least part is reportedly smoker friendly.

The service was great, & the food I had was delicious!  This was a "Mex 'n' Match Combo", which gives you lots of choices.  I went with Tortilla Soup, a big (Pablano) Chile Relleno, a shredded beef hard taco, & steamed veggies.  The portions were generous, everything was served at the right temperature, at the right time, & the prices here are very reasonable.  How can Enya keep from singing, & how can I keep from giving this Macayo's 5 STARS?  Woohoo!     :-))
