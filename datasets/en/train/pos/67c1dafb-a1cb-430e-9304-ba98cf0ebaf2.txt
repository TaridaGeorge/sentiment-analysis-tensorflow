I know it's a chain, but it lit up my Yelp choices and I knew that this was the place to catch my Phoenix breakfast. They have a huge menu and it took me a little bit to decide. I really wanted the Eggs Benedict, but detoured slightly and had the Sunrise Benedict instead. They replace the grilled ham with grilled sliced turkey and top it with a few slices of avocado. With a pile of country potatoes on the plate, it was AWESOME. I was stuffed all morning for sightseeing in the Valley of the Sun.

Free wifi worked well.

Tip: Try and sit in the solarium area. It's only a view of the parking lot, but it's much sunnier than sitting deep in the restaurant.
