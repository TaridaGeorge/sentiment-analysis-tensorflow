I'm in love with Postino.  I do love the outdoor seating area, open air restaurant, wait staff, food, drinks - everything. 

 I have been coming here for well over 4 years and recently branched out from my usual picks.  I tried the Mediterranean salad and Veggie panini- both great choices!  

If you are looking for GREAT wine, AMAZING bruschetta, and a relaxing evening out, Postino is the place!  I've never been disappointed.
