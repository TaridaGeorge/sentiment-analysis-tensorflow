This is my 2nd time at North and I must say that the quality of food for the price is great!  My server was Brian tonight as he made my our night that much better.. Brian is very friendly and really seems to enjoy working at this great establishment. 

This is a great place for a date, fun, hip, classy and very enjoyable! 

By the way, the Chef's Board and the Ducati drink are my favorites along with the Bucatini...

5 stars all the way.

Thanks North!!!
