First time i came here i was super impressed.  My friend from work brought me here because she had been raving about their bread bowl soups.  We finally went on a cold day and it was the best idea ever.  I ordered a half chicken salad sandwich that was enormous and cut that in half as well.  I ordered the soup to go with it that was Chili.  Best chili hands down that i have ever eaten.  It also came with some cheddar cheese on top. Best idea ever.  I ate all the soup and was wishing for more space in my stomach to eat more.  I can't wait to bring more people here and eat this again.
