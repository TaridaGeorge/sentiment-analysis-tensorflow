I love, love, love Cibo! I know it has tons of great reviews but I feel it is time to add my own. In my opinion Cibo is better than Pizzeria Bianco and way less wait. 

This is a great place for sharing. My favorite night at Cibo goes like this...
The delicious pesto salad. ( I am not usually a big salad person but this one is quite interesting.)
Then on to the pizza. I generally get the margherita pizza but had the diavola the other day and now I am hooked.
For desert all of the crepes are amazing.
And if you've never had limoncello I highly recommend you try it!
And of course you can always share a bottle of wine for dinner. 

Great food, reasonable prices and beautiful patio!
