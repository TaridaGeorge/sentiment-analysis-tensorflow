Great food! My favorites are sizzling rice soup (great when you're sick), poopoo platter, cashew chicken, house lo mein and house fried rice. The staff is very friendly and if you call to pick it up, it usually  takes 10 minutes. You can also find coupons for free lettuce wraps or crab puffs in the mailer ads.
