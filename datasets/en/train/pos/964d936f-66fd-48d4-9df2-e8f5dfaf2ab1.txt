I visited GB recently and had a good experience. I order the usual burger and drink with a side of potatoes and the burger was very good. The service was excellent and the I decided to sit outside in the patio where the tvs are. 

I like the ambiance of the place as it is a step up from a noisy sports bar. Its a place where you can intelligent conversation and still enjoy the surroundings of westgate without the noise.

Now it will be interesting to see how the ambiance measures up when the retail outlet is built but for now kudos to GB for a good experience.
