Love this place. I love dancing and women. This place has a ton of both. Big dance floor and women everywhere to look at. Country music all night long. They got beer specials till 1030, this place is fun to hang out at. The east valley needed a place like this. They surpassed all my expectations. You can easily drop 120 bucks a night here and thats what i usually blow. Its well worth it though. Anyone can have a blast here, mostly old people till they have their warm shots of milk at like 800 and then it gets filled with the younger crown.
