Awesome place to eat. I went to SmashBurger for the first time about two weeks ago and have been back six times since. Every experience has been amazing. The food was top quality, not like going to any ordinary fast food chain (McDonald's, BK, etc.). I describe it as "those kind of burgers your dad cooks in the backyard". The restaurant overall is a very clean place, and the booths are super comfortable. I ate there today actually, and actually experienced a couple of the employees asking me how the food tasted and if I needed anything at all (it was busy, not like it was slow and they had nothing better to do).
