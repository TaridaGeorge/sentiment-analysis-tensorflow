I first found this place ,when i first moved here and was looking for specific napkin rings.I was impressed by how knowledgeable and courteous the staff were .

Consistent impeccable service at this store .Here you can find beautiful Patrick Meyer napkin rings ,table cloths ,Molton Brown soap, Thymes lavender candles, linseed oil room freshener, pure linen bedding ,plates,goblets ....Everything you need to dress up your table and your bed can be found here . What i like is they can and will do special orders for you .They also have lovely floral centerpieces ,and though this is a high end shop , you can find  gift's here for under 100 dollars as well. .
I love this shop for what it sells ,and especially for the level of customer service as they exceed the standards .This is why they have been in business so long,in my opinion .
