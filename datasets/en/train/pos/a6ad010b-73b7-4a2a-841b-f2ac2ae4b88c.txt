Amazing!

While I do not craze frozen yogurt often, Aloha is where I go when I do.  There are always new flavors to try and you are able to sample them before buying.  The staff is always very friendly and helpful.  The array of toppings is also fantastic and evolving all the time.  The business is clean and inviting and I believe they even offer free wifi.

For those that are pet owners, there is a bench outside and water for the pups if they happen to be accompanying you (Our Dane loves the peanut butter flavor yogurt).  The prices here are also very reasonable.  As it warms up for the summer, I will definitely be going back again and again and recommend that you do the same.
