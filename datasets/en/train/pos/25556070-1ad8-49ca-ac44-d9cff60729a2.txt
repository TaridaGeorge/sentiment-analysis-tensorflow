Time to break out the five star rating!

Eddie's House does not disappoint, and in fact sets the standard in my book.  I truly wish that every dining experience could be as pleasant, comfortable, and tasty as our visit to Eddie's House. 

The bar is spot on, with well mixed drinks.  Appetizers were outstanding!  We tried a BLT type pizza which sounds crazy, but was incredible.

I had to get my favorite meatloaf on the world.  It just is too good for words.  I do not have the words for this place!!

Deserts also rocked.  Yes, we really did it up this visit.  Thanks Eddie Matney for a wonderful time!!!  We will be back!
