I have recently abandoned Five Guys and adopted Smashburger as my 'go-to burger place'. I just love Smashburger! For starters their prices are quite reasonable (especially compared to the likes of Five Guys). I also love how they give customers the opportunity to get free smashfries by completing a survey! 

Smashburger in general just seems to care about their customers and their employees will often introduce themselves by name when bringing you your order. The food is awesome, especially the burger. The fries aren't the greatest I have ever had, but they certainly are unique!

The restaurant interior is also pretty sweet compared to burger places like this. There isn't much about Smashburger that I don't like.
