I would have never known this place existed- but I found out about the greatness that is Fuego Tacos through a HomeRun offer. The chips and salsa were stellar, and I tried the pernil taco and the carne asada. I preferred the carne asada. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other tantalizing tacos! I also had a great drink with Jack Daniels! I will definitely be coming back. 
NOTE: You must remember to have Fuego validate your parking, or you will be charged.
