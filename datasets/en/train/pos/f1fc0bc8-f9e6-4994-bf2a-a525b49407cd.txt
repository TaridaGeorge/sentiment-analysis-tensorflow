People that know Phoenix know this place.  I will drive out of my way to go here when I'm in town.  I will tip extra.  If I see someone in line being difficult I will stare them down, the family that works here could give kindness lessons.

Exactly what one hopes for in a family run deli/sandwich shop.  Half of Phoenix grew up on this place including myself.  

"GOLD, Jerry!...GOLD!"
