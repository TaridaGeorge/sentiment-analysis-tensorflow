I friggin love this place. It has such a family feel, and you always see the same staff (a couple, I think they must be the owners) every weekend. They definitely don't let you take your time as you order before you pay, but you get your food very quickly and they bring it right over to your table. The bagels are delicious and the smoked salmon bagel (The Works) is enough for two-- just get an additional bagel with cream cheese and you're good!
