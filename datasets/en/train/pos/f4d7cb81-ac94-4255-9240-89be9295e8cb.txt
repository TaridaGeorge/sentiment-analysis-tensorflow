I've been going to LollyPOP for a while now and have purchased several items from a few dresses to some super cute tops and also a few handbags/purses.  For quality pieces, I find the prices to be fair.  I'm not quite sure how "cheap" folks expect the prices to be... You get what you pay for, right?  My boyfriend seems to have even MORE success when hunting for a few awesome button down long and short sleeve shirts.  

Was in recently for the one year anniversary party and had a blast... stopped by to support our local businesses on nutcase Friday and got a cute new flower for my hair... again, bf walked out with two more shirts.  Oh yeah... also enjoyed some tasty special hot cocoa. 

Love this store... great addition to the Melrose.  Hopefully this place sticks around for a while.
