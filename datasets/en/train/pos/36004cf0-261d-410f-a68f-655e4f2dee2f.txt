Even though I haven't been a Tempe resident for a long time, I still make the trip here for my dog's food.  Prices are the best for premium dog food, and they stock lots of premium treats as well.  The employees are very nice, and even though I can carry it myself, always carry the dog food bag out to my car for me.  I think its a good thing to support local businesses when you can, and these guys make it easy.  Highly recommend.
