We checked out Lo Lo's Chicken and Waffles on Father's Day (downtown location).  All I can say is YUMMY!!!  And I am so happy we went.  They were pretty busy but the wait was only 20 minutes.  

We loved the atmosphere when we walked in and the staff very personable.   The red Kool-Aid was perfect on this hot summer day!

What we had:
Chicken and Waffles and Chicken and French Fries

We had to have the red velvet cake which all three of us loved!  And it was a nice treat.

Will go back!
