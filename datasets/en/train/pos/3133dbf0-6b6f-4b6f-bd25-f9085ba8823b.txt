Im giving Ottos one more star for their stellar remodel! The place looks great! Gone are the mis matched chairs and patio tables inside, old bakery cases and grandma-esque art on the walls. In their places a half wall "Ottos" sign, a fresh coat of paint, great new matching tables and chairs, some Coke themed signs and other things, and my fave, the new wall art. Black and white pics of the kitchen, its vintage equipment, and the chef himself tossing some dough! Kudos guys!
