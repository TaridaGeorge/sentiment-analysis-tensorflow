One of my favorite neighborhood spots.  Everything is great about this place.  It's location, it's design, it's staff, it's beer, and it's food.  And the fact that the owner is almost always there working behind the bar says a lot about the place considering it's already established and known.  

Their menu serves something for everyone and for whatever your taste bud mood is that moment.

Did I mention they're dog friendly?  That is has a great patio?  And Ska Decadent is on tap?
