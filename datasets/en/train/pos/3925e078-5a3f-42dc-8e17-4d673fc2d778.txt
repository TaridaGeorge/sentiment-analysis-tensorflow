I love this place.  The sandwiches are unique and fresh and always made right in front of you.  The service has always been good and the prices are reasonable (same as any other sandwich shop).  I have tried many of their sandwiches and enjoyed them, my favorite is the cheesesteak, but beware- the peppers are spicy!
