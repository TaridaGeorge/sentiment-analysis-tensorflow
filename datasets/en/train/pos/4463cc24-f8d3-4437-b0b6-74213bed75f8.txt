What a great place, the cocktails are amazing the atmosphere is like no other place ive ever been. There is a little gem at this establishment and her name is Dawn. She is the hotels Tarot card reader and what an amazing and insightful person she is. Her energy is calm and inviting and her presence is larger than her petite frame. She is passionate about her ability and show during her readings. I highly recommend visiting her if you are ever at the San Carlos Ghost Lounge.
