We were visiting Scottsdale and just happen to choose Roka Akor to dine at, and I have to say, we were so glad we did.  We had the premiere Omakase (the most expensive choice for the tasting menu), and everything we had was fabulous.  I had the sake pairing to go with, and it was spot on.  The chef came out to double check for alergies, and our waiter was phenomenal.  The desert tasting course had about 4 different desserts on it, my favorite was the mango shiffon cake with brown rice ice cream.  Yes, brown rice ice cream.  It was the best thing ever!  Would move to Arizona just for this restaurant.  It was pricey, but money well spent.
