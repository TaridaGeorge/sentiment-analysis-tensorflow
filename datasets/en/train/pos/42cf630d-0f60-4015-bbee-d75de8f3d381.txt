I see there hasn't been a review in 2009. So let's get started. I don't know why I don't eat here more often. It's not all that far from my office. The talk about the bread is all true. Phenomenal taste and texture. I had the turkey and swiss. Pretty tame. However the Boars Head turkey thinly sliced is to die for. The only other great sandwich in the dowtown area is at Calabria's on Roosevelt. Both places do remind me of back East in NY.  Any sandwich you get at either place is big enough for two, or for both lunch and dinner.
