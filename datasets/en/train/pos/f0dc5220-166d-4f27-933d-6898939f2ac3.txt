Hey, I have one of those Conair Vanity mirrors that has a light around the mirror, last time the bulb went out I had to order on line, it took at least a week to get a replacement and cost over $5.00 plus postage for one bulb to replace it, this time I found the Light Bulb Store and they had just what I needed, and I was back in business in no time, great service, nice friendly people,  and the bulbs were a couple of dollars for two.   Thanks!!!
