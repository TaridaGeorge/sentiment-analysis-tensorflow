A truly amazing experience!  I have always thought about getting laser hair removal, but I had heard it was so expensive.  Deidra offered such a great price I couldn't turn down the chance to try it.  It was a little painful, and she explained that it would be a bit uncomfortable.  She was very kind and let me take the process as slow as I needed.  I will definately be going back to finish up the treatments, which for my neckline that I had done, she said it would only take 4-5 treatments.  I would recommend to anyone who has ever thought about having it done.  Thanks Deidra.
