Great food.  Great ambiance.  Excellent service.  If you're looking for a vibrant atmosphere, with delicious (and healthy) fare, do yourself a favor and try True Food Kitchen.  The food is good, but the service is impeccable.  EVERY single time my wife and I have dined here, we have been welcomed warmly and have been treated like regulars.  The staff is efficient, and is never in a hurry to just take your order and leave the table. The management is to be commended for hiring/training such a great staff.  The Scottsdale Quarter vibe means there is much to take in and some excellent people watching as a side note.  If you want to feel like your business is appreciated, and you want to support local business - make a point to eat here soon.
