This place is awesome nice layout for dining in, thai art on the wall, looks like ikea lighting but the food is what you want to know about right? Get in here everything I have had in and take out was delicious and they will go thai spicy on you if you can handle it.  I'm talking about lips burning at midnight after you finished eating at 7pm! All the thai staples are great pad thai, the brown sauce noodle.  They have some cool appetizers go see for yourself!
