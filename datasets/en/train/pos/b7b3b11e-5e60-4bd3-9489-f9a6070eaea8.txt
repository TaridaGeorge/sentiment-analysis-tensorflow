Went to the pre-opening celebration. The ambiance was absolutely wonderful, the service staff was top notch and the food was fantastic.
Very difficult to pick a favorite dish as everything they brought out made me want more. The patio was exceptionally comfortable with the high tech
misters. The couches, lounge chairs, and coffee tables made the patio seem more like a lounge than a restaurant.. A terrific place to hang out. 
This is my new favorite restaurant of all time. Best of Arizona!!!
