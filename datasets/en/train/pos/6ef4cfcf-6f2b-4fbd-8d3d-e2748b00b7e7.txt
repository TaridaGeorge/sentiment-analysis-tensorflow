My bimbimbap place to be. Korean food is one on my favorite ethnic foods. It was my pregnancy addiction. Too bad it's too pricey go daily or my dh would have had to take me there every day or move to Korea. The service has always been great. We also tried the barbeque and just the same great experience. I often see Koreans and other Asian people here and my thought is, if the local people get their fix at a restaurant that sweve their home cooking, it must be good and authentic. Yum. Love it.
