The cheese and the pepperoni on my mini pizza glisten, taunting me to dive in. I scarf down my pizza in a matter of minutes and rub my belly, thinking, 'I'll have to do a few more crunches tonight but it was well worth it.'

This is the usual battle I have when I go to Chandler's Floridino's for lunch with the gang where it's always a struggle to avoid the calzone, which is seriously the best calzone I've ever had in my life. 

 Floridino's is one of my favorite lunchtime destinations because the service is good and the pizza is dyn-O-mite. And you can get a  mini pizza and a drink for under $5 during lunch time. Lunch doesn't get any better than this.
