This place is still excellent!  We ate the Tiki Chicken Masala... So good I almost can't get enough! Every time we go it seems really empty. I hope it picks up! They do need to train the water girl about the menu. She never seems to know what anything is! Lol. But that won't stop us from going. Next we are going to try the buffet.
