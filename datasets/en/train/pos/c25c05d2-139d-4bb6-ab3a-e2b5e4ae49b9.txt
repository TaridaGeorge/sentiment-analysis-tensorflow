We just relocated here from Seattle and needed to establish a new pediatric office for our two children. Initially I went to another office that was awful so took a chance on this one and have been vey, very happy. The front staff is very warm and the nurses have been so kind and gentle. We have only seen Dr. Fischler but he displays wonderful  bedside manner and talks to me and my children with respect. I am so pleased to have found this practice.
