This is the place where they make up in service for any shortcomings they might have. Service is always aware of what is going on at the table and is ready to re-supply and fix things. Manager doesn't just sit around and manage. He actually makes the round and checks to see if customers are good.

The food I had here for the yelp event wasn't very good or very well prepared. The pork was dry and very 3 dollar grocery pork chop with cheese on top. At least it was pre-cut :) Would have preferred it rarer but I had no option. The Mushroom side was good.

Good selection of Saki.

Sushi rolls were good. I don't remember what they were but had chopped jalape√±o on them.
