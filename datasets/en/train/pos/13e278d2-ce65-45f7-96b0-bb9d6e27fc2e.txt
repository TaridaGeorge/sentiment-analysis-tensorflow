I needed blinds for the new casa - I called Ambassasor Blinds after reading a Yelp review, Joe Del came out the next day, free of charge to look at my windows. Joe asked alot of questions and really got to know my taste and style and vision for the house - he recommended cordless blinds and i decided to give it a whirl. After the blinds came in, Alfredo came out and installed them - he was very pleasant, needed no babysitting :) and installed all the blinds quickly. My boyfriend and I love the way the blinds look and work but we also love the service we got - Joe even stoped by after the install just to check on us and see how we were doing! As soon as our office is done, we will be calling Joe and Alfredo for more blinds!!
