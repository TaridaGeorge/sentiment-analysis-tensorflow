Sitting on their patio listening to Pete Rock & CL Smooth (and other old school hip hop gems), sipping a local beer, chatting with friends, and eating their comforting green chile mac and cheese is the best way to spend any happy hour. The staff is small and friendly, the atmosphere is comfortable, and the prices are totally reasonable. I love The Main Ingredient.
