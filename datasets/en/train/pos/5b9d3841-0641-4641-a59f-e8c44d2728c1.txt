Damn this place was good!  It was so good that even though I was craving decent Mexican food after living in DC and working in Indiana, I was convinced by the smells emanating from this choice spot.

We had the Mediterranean sampler (top notch baba ganoush! and local olives) and the mushroom, truffle oil, and elephant garlic pizza.  Amazing.  The sangria was good, along with the Margaritas.  The staff was quick, efficient, and friendly.  You even get a bomb-ass iron skillet cookie ice cream if you check in online via the Yelp app.  Ugh!
