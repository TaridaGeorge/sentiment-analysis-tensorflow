WOW! While this park is a good 15 min drive from my house in Downtown PHX, I will gladly make the drive. The park is HUGE. I love the grass, the clean water station. The CLEAN park. All the pet owners actually look after their pets and clean up and or discipline to avoid fights. I love it and wished there was something like this closer to home for us.
