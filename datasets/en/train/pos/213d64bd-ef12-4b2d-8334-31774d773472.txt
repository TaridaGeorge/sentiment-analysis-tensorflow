My hubby and I are self- proclaimed "Foodies." We loved Chef James at Tapino and were thrilled when we found out they were opening this. As many others have stated the atmosphere is charming and cozy. Reservations are recommended, especially on weekends. We have had dinner and brunch now and both were excellent! The Vicchysoisse (hard to find in Phoenix, the hottest city in the country) is superb as is the Steak Frites. Tradtional french, just like Paris. For brunch, it was the salmon pappilotte (delicious) and beignets (for our 11 year old) and a different twist on eggs benedict for hubby. Really wonderful and authentic. We are bringing our college son in this weekend for Croque Monsieur. Chef James and lovely host Wendy have hit the nail on the head this time. Laurie and Rodney
