I love this place. There are plenty of flavors and toppings to choose from when making your yogurt dreams come true. I love the cookies and cream yogurt with some finely chopped oreo cookies, coconut flakes and some white chocolate bits in the small cup when satisfying my sweet tooth. 

This place is cheaper than Yogurtology, 39 cents an ounce. The employees are friendly and helpful. They have ample seating inside and outside.
