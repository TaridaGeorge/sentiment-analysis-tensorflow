I went during lunch for their annual "Free Omelette Day ", and to support St.Vincent De Paul.   I was surprised there wasn't a long line.  You get to choose any omelets on the menu.  Holly, my waitress was super friendly.  I had ordered the Bacado omelet, which filled with bacon, avocado, melted Monterey jack cheese, along with housemade salsa.   I thought the English toast was a little oily.  I don't know if it was butter or something else.   I usually like drinking stronger coffee, but the blend they had was pretty good.  It wasn't strong or too light.   The food came quickly and hot.  Ambiance is not much, but overall a pleasant experience.
