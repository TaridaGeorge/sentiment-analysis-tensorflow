This place is the BOMB when it comes to gyros!  The meat is so tender, juicy and tasty!!  It's a modest (hole in the wall) establishment but hey, those are the best kinds most the time!  I have taken many friends here and have yet to have one not agree that this food ROCKS!!  Not to mention the boys at the register are nice to look at ;p~
