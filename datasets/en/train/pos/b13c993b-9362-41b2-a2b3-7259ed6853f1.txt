Last week, I had my first appointment at Pure Dental. Dr. Kang and the office staff were all really nice and helpful. Dr. Kang even did my cleaning and it was very thorough. I've never had the actual dentist give me my cleaning. I was wowed by their modern equipment to view x-rays and the doctor even took pictures of my teeth to show me. I will be going back to get some filings next week and was told I could watch a movie while I was getting them done.
