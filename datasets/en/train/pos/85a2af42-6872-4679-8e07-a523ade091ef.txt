we received wonderful care from dr. courtney bishop from the day my son was born and all throughout his rehabilitative care after his heart and stomach surgery. she's thorough and attentive and is very straight-forward, which was great when we had so many things we were always worried about. i wish we could have continued our pediatric care with her for our son, but we've recently moved to california and had to say goodbye. we miss her and the staff dearly. the nurse practioners, office staff, and on-call personnel are all wonderful people who take their jobs seriously and consider your child's health to always be top priority.
