Oh my goodness I wish there was one of these in Denver!  I LOVE that this restaurant offers vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options.  My first trip here I got the butternut squash ravioli (which I don't see on the menu anymore, boo!) and it was perfect! It was spicy, sweet, savory, and creamy all at the same time.  I also had a super-tasty mock-tail called Cucumber Refresher (sooooooooo DELICIOUS).  On a couple other visits I got a cashew-curry pasta dish with chicken (normally with tofu, but they put chicken in it for me....I also don't see this on the online menu...sad face) that was creamy and it makes me drool just remembering how tasty it was.  I LOVE that the restaurant also strives to buy local and be eco-friendly (the staff even wears American Apparel uniforms because they are made in the USA).  I miss living near this place!
