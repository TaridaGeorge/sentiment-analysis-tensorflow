This place is totally awesome for happy hour. The have an Imperial IPA on the menu that is like 8% and So Good. It's called "Gordon Knight," drink 2 and have a friend drive you home. Plus the best part. Their early happy hour starts at 3 maybe 2 and the beer is $2.50 a pint. That means you are sitting happy for a fiver. 

Plus they're always spinning good hip-hop.
