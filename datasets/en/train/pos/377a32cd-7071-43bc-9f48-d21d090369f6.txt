The Grand Canal is a great place to exercise, whether you walk with friends, take running seriously, bike or roller blade (yes, I do see people out there on skates). I love the canal because it's great exercise for me and my pup. We enjoy the stretch from Maryland to 32nd. Beautiful homes along the way, the Wrigley mansion and the Biltmore!

Some people have said that the trail can be a little sketchy or unsafe, which I have yet to experience. I stick to daylight hours when plenty of folks are out and about.
