I keep meaning to ask if they do gift registries at this store.  Because my friends say I'm hard to buy for, and I just don't get it.  Go to Made.  Apply blindfold.  Spin.  Stop.  Walk forward.  Buy what you touch.  Unless it's baby clothes.  It's that easy.

I really love this place.  I make people go here.  I got a rockin' ring here.  Some cool books. Of course a few magnets.  Recent purchase was a baby t-shirt (for friend) that said angel on the front and had a pic of wings on the back.  Aw....  And the selection is often changing as artists create new things. 

You should go.  You need to go.  Just go.
