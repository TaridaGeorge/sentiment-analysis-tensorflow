Man, I was looking for some coffee up late and I found what looks like an ideal place to go setup my laptop and keyboard and work some late night. The tables seemed generously sized, which is a must if you really want to read and type. Can't recommend this place enough. PLUS: it's got veggie friendly food! That's hard to find during daylight hours, but after 9 it's all but impossible in this city! Love this place.
