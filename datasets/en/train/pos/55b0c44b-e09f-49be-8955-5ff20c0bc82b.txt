Pretty much the best sandwich I have ever had.  Shaved Ribeye sandwich is unreal.  Their ingredients are top notch.  You will pay more but it's worth it.  Not sure about other review that said there wasn't much meat.  I have ordered the shaved Ribeye sandwich twice now and I am a pretty guy, usually can't even finish it.  I have attached a picture for the first time because I have claimed this to be the best sandwich ever.  Their homemade lemonade in regular or berry is outstanding.  Everything is locally sourced which I appreciate as a local business owner.  The interior is very nice and you can tell the owners put alot of time and care into this concept.  I definitely recommend this place.
