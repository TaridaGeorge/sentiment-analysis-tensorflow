I've been to stingray at the biltmore a number of times since its opened. Great happy hour specials on tuna rolls, gyoza, speciality drinks, sky flavored vodka and house wines. I've always had a great experience at the bar (that's really the only place I sit). John, the bartender, has always been so welcoming and friendly. He recognizes me every time I'm there now! The other bartenders are also personable and talkative. 

Yummy food, great value during happy hour and a nice atmosphere make this place a must on my list.
