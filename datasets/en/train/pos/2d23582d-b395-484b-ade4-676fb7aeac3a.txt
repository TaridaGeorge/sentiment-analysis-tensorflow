Stopped in on the advice of a trusted friend and found that all of the five star reviews are well earned!  We had the beef brisket, smoked sausage link, baked beans, and coleslaw.   The meats were precisely cooked, juicy, delicious and tasty.  Sauce is totally optional here!!

The sides were great!

Service was helpful and friendly!  And parking was plentiful, convenient and easy.

WE WILL BE BACK!   

This place not only exceeds expectations, it raises the bar for BBQ!
