This place is great!  They have the best designs for a reasonable price.  They are relatively fast and priced.  I was told about this place about a year ago by my boss.  I usually get designs on the toes (standard), my eyebrows waxed, a manicure with buff and shine....after gratuity $60.  I do wish they had they have a great tv, but it never plays anything I would expect at a womens salon...although I do see men.  I usually have such a hard time picking the designs.....
PS. It's easier for them if you do cash but if not, at least gratuity in cash.
