Reading some of these reviews do not shock me..'commercialized Mexican food', 'its expensive' or 'not very authentic'... You are at the Biltmore!  You will not get "authentic" Mexican at the Biltmore. It does cost more than Filibertos. If you complain about the pricing, maybe you are eating out of your budget and should go to Taco Bell with the rest of the less fortunates.  Black Chile is Mexican fusion and doesn't claim to be 'authentic'. It's nice having a Mexican style restaurant at the Biltmore! 

The Shrimp Diablo was amazing. It was spicy and full if flavor. The rice is AMAZING! It tastes a lot like corn bread. Give it a try. I loved it.
