EXCELLENT moving service!  KC and D moved our furniture from store to home.  Very nice gentlemen, they were extremely cautious with the move, came early and their charges were extremely reasonable.  We will definitely refer them to our friends and use their services again.  A BIG THANKYOU to KC and D at Novice, LLC
