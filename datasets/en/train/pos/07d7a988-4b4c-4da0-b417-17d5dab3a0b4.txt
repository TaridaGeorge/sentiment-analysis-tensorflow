My Cousin just got married here a few weeks ago and the entire evening was amazing!!  The indoor and outdoor settings were gorgeous, cozy,  and inviting!  This wedding was honestly the most beautiful wedding I have ever been to.  I loved the fountains, the trees, the lights and brick walls inside, and the list goes on and on.  If you love the feel of Disneyland (warm, happy, unique) then you will love this place!  Everything was just so quaint and attention to detail was excellent!!
