I love this place. They have a large assortment of pasties to choose from. A pasty is similar to a calzone, but these are of English influence. My favorite is the Gobbler- it's a Thanksgiving type dinner wrapped up in a pasty with gravy and cranberry sauce on the side. Mmmmm! Some other recommendations are the Shepard's Pie or Chicken Pot Pie. They even have vegetarian pasties. One important fact- you can't modify the ingredients. They come as they are and they are delicious!!
