Recently had wonderful, fresh, and lively food for lunch on a Sat.  My husband had a beef salad (made his eyes roll with delight), and I had excellent Chicken Pho with the typical additions on the side.  Delicious spring rolls.  Friendly, helpful wait staff.  Clean, pleasant decor.  A very economical and rewarding experience.  We'll be back!  Thank you, Viet Kitchen.
