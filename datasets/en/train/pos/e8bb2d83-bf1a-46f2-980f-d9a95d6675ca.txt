These guys did an outstanding job sharpening my knives at an incredibly reasonable price. One of them, my favorite Misono chef's knife, had to have the tip reshaped after an inlaw managed to drop it; the guys at Phoenix Knife house had it fixed & good as new in just a few minutes.  I was so pleased that I bought 2 more knives before I left!
