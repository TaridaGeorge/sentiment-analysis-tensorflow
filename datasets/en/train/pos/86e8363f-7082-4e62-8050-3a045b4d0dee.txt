I just recently visited this place and was impressed with not only their support of all things local but that they can ship gift baskets with AZ wine to other states.  The staff Jason and Ron were very helpful and kind and Ron made me an awesome Date milkshake that got me through the rest of my day.  You gotta get one of these if you go.  They have a good selection of AZ wines and will be expanding soon.
