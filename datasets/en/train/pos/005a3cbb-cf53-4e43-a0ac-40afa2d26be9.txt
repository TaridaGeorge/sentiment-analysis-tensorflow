Hot Things (with Prince's Hot Thing playing in your head):

Christopher Meloni (Hello? Have you seen him in Oz?)
Glee (C'mon you know you love it!)
Betty White's career!

HOT HOT HOT!!! Phoenix is hot. Mercury is hot. Phoenix Mercury is SMOKING HOT! I've had the privilege to meet many of the players and the folks behind the scenes and they are professional, courteous and most of all FUN!!!

The energy and the entertainment at the Mercury games is unlike and energy I've experienced. I've attended hundreds of sporting events throughout my jock heavy life and the Mercury games are infectious. Like laughter. Not poison ivy. 

So here's to the WNBA Champs! A five star organization from back of the house to the court. GO MERCURY!!!
