I love this place. You pick whatever meats, veggies, and noodles you want. Then they grill it up for you. I usually take it to go they charge by the pound. It's enough for 3 meals. If you eat there it is buffet style and you can't take leftovers. Good food!

I went to Lai, Lai after I started my review and they changed EVERYTHING! No more buffet, or Mongolian grill. They only offer eat in or take out Chinese food. They do have great taste, but we are very disappointed to find out about the change.
