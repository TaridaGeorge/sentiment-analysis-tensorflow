I figured I should write this while I'm still full of Pho. My husband and I are able to meet here for lunch, as it's in between our two work locations. Noodles Ranch is simply the best lunch compromise ever. The service is friendly, spot-on and I've never been disappointed with the food. Quite the opposite, I'm ecstatic over it. Even while I'm sitting here full, I'm thinking of the leftover Pho I'm going to have for dinner tonight. Delicious!
