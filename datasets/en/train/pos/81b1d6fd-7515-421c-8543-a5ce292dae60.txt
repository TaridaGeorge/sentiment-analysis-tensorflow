My favorite steak in the Phoenix area, without question.  We've been here 12 times and consistently had a tremendous experience.  The staff understands the menu, and the sommeliers are quite knowledgeable and friendly.  I tend to stick to the petite filet with the wonderful peppercorn sauce, but the dover sole and branzino have been terrific as well.  The roasted asparagus tastes like God grew it in His garden.  I don't know how they make it so good.  I suppose the desserts aren't anything amazing (though I do love the bowl of berries).  Frankly, after the popovers, entrees, and sides, you probably won't have any room for dessert.  Everything is a la carte, and it isn't cheap, but it definitely is worth it.
