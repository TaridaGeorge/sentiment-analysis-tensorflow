This is a great breakfast place... 

A simple easy to follow menu with nothing but fresh made ingredients.  I had the hash and eggs and we shared a half order of the French Toast.  All was really well prepared the caramel sauce is well worth the extra buck for the French Toast.

Staff was great and knew the menu well.  Portion sizes are huge (my wife got the wolfpack and I think it had 1 1/2 pounds of hash browns.  Nice breakfast, nice service, nice environment = a great breakfast
