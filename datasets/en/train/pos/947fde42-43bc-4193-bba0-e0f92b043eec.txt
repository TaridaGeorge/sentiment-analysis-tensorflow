My husband took me to Donovan's for my birthday and we were so impressed with the quality of the food (best steak ever) and the outstanding service.  I would like to see them update the art on the walls (really dated, european stuff) and the overhead lighting fixtures (just plain ugly and cheap-looking).  But, these minute criticisms aside, this has got to be one of the best meals we've ever had.  We will surely become repeat customers.
