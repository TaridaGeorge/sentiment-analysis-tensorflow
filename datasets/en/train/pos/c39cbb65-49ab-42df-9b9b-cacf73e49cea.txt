I was visiting Az and had a the pleasure of getting a massage from Traci. She was awesome made me feel comfortable and worked out some of the knots that have been bothering me. I just wish she was in  the bay area, but next time I'm in Arizona I will be back. The place was very clean and the gal at the front desk was very nice and welcoming.
