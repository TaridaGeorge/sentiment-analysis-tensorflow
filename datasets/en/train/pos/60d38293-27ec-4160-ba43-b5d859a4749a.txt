Good store, having big sales right now, so prices are reasonable and selection is great.  Getting ready for big trip and I picked up a few items.  I like the fact that I can get the comfortable sizes here and not have to worry about looking frumpy.

This store was nice and clean, the service was quick and friendly and I felt welcomed.  As with most Fashion Bug's, this was no exception to that.
