i've used mike's for years. he's a sweet guy and is always honest. i never feel like i'm going to be lied to when i go here, and i appreciate the timely manner in which repairs are done. 

have you ever gone to a mechanic who constantly nags you about your "serpentine belt"? that's a load of crap. it's like visiting a doctor who suggests pointless treatments because "you're going to die someday"...yeah, we all die from something some day, and yeah, the belt is going to break eventually, but usually not any time soon. in other words, mike's doesn't stoop to such low levels. they fix what needs to be fixed when it needs to be fixed.
