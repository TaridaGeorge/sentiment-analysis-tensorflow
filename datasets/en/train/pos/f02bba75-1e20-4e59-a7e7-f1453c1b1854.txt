I am writing this review hoping it won't violate the TOS.  I was present at the appointment for my father.  

He had some concerns about moles and through Yelp I found Dr. Linder.  

She was amazing! Kind and caring and her staff was very pleasant.  We didn't have to wait long for the appointment (3 weeks) and we were in the waiting room for about 10 minutes.  

She seems to be very busy but as a patient it doesn't seem to affect.  
Also, unlike other derms in my experience she did not try to "sell" services or products.  

Great Dr!
