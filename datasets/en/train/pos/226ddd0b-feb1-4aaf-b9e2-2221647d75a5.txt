Not only is Susan a wonderful photographer, she's also a wonderful human being. I volunteer for a dog rescue and Susan has done 2 pro-bono shoots for some of our dogs. The professional photos were used on their Petfinder and Adopt-a-Pet profiles and were INSTRUMENTAL in getting these dogs adopted! 

I highly recommend A Dog's Life Photography and Susan Schmidt. We love her and the dogs love her!
