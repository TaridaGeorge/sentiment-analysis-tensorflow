Great pizza and better salad selection! If you are looking for a great happy hour then this is the place.  Social Saturdays $2.50 Beer Flights Social hour specials from
11 a.m. - 6 p.m.  Great service for large groups.  We went there with 15 people on a Saturday and had great service.  My girlfriends and I have been there for ladies lunch and enjoyed the all you can eat pizza and salad.  These are gourmet salads and personal pizzas not slices.  The BoomBozz #1 salad is phenomenal... candied walnuts, sun dried cranberries and goat cheese yummy! Unlike some all you can eat menus choose one of these salads.

Bought a gift certificate for a friends birthday.  Hope he invites me to enjoy it with him :)
