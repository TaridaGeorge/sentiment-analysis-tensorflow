Ok, so I came here because I needed  a change of pace, and boy, am I glad I did!! Holy cow is this place NICE!  The inside is clean, nicely laid out with plenty of seating. They have a variety of tables, and a few set of couches in here as well.  They even have a really cool back room too.

This place is open early, but closes early too.  6AM to 3PM is what the sign says.  They even have a drive through!  They have really great prices, and are cheaper then Starbucks.  They also have a menu of breakfast items along with some sandwiches.  Menu selection is awesome!

I'm really glad I found this place.  Plus, the staff here is super friendly.  I just had a doughnut and it was tasty as all get out.  yumyumyum!!  Free Wifi as well!  Go get coffee from here now!!
