After shopping around at most of the shops in town .none of who would call back..From Tempe to Peoria....I ended up taking my bike to Coyote Honda in Avondale...even though I had a Kawasaki ...they still worked on it...Fast service ...Competitive pricing.Great communication.... if you need work done this is the place to take it to....
