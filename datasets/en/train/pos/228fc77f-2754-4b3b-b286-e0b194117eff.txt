So very Portlandia in its hipsterness and decor. Premium coffee roasted in-house, in the middle of the desert, no less! Who would have thunk it.

Baristas were profesh and friendly. They even warmed up our pastries upon request. Perfectly foamed milk and fruity noted espresso. I hope this place has a long life in Scottsdale, where great coffee is few and far between.
