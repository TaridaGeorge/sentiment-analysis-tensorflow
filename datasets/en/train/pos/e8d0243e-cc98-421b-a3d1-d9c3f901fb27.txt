The "Duck" is one of my favorite places!
The music is great, EVERYONE who works there is super kind and cares about your experience.
I am vegetarian and enjoy "Where's The Beef"- when I ask for extra avocados, they REALLY give extra; it hits the spot EVERY time.
Wonderful wine selection, easy laid back vibe and even the red house wine is tasty!  
Free Wifi, they make a mean mean latte with soy milk..love this place!
