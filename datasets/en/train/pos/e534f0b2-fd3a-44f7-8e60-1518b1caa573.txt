Boom Boom La Rue's is by far the best! Going in there is like visiting a toy store. The costumes are over the top, the wigs are to die for and the customer service is super fabulous! Joseph and Sherman work so hard and are very talented at what they do. My company "Scandalesque" shops there often. I also send all my Burlesque students to Boom Boom's to get professional critiques and custom made costumes. Adore them so much! Highly recommend visiting them. Tell them Pyrrha sent ya!
