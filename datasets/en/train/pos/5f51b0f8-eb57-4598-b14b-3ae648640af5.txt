I went into Books looking for a specific book by a fairly obscure British author and ended up finding a first edition copy for $13. I love this store. It's one of those places you can get lost in, looking at mysteries for 30 minutes then travel books for the next hour then vintage books for another 20 minutes. Endless selection in almost every genre. If you love books, you'll love Books.
