Since moving to the West Valley, we have been in search for good Thai cuisine! We found it!!! 

We ordered lots of food, as it was a special occasion. We walked out with lots of leftovers, and more than satisfied with our dinner!

We ordered the Orchid Special Combination appetizer with egg rolls, satay, wontons, and fried vegetables. It was heavenly!!!!

Tom Kha Kai Soup - Rich and flavorful broth soup with lots of mushrooms and chicken. Some of the best I have ever had!

Phad Thai - a delicious noodle dish

Pha Nang - flavorful red cury

We will be back for sure!!!! The owner was sweet and checked in on us. The waitress was attentive and refilled our tea glasses countless times. Overall, we were more than satisfied by our experience! I am so happy I finally tried this place!
