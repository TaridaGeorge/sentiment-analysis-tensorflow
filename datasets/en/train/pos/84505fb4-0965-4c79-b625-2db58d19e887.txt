Where do I start. I've been looking at this place for a year now, passing by, never knowing if it's a bar, a club or a restaurant. Finally one day decided to go there for a lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Even though it's just on Camelback, its nice and quiet. The patio is modern and cute, reminds of little lunch bistro's. Only thing I would change is to put seats further apart ... I like my space and this I felt like everyone else is too close to me. The server was nice and helpful, not one of those boring, whiny, what-can-I-get-you every 5 minutes guys. I had French burger which is absolutely the best burger I have tried in a loooooong time. Prices are ok, lunch for 2 ended up costing us same as Macaroni grill lunch. I definitely recommend the place
