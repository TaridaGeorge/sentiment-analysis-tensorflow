Now that I've had the chance to taste frozen yogurt from the majority of the shops that have popped up around Scottsdale, my vote goes to Yogurtology.  The taste, consistency/texture of the yogurt and selection of flavors and toppings is the best.  And as other reviewers have mentioned, the staff is very attentive to keeping everything very clean.  The servers are cheerful and thank me for my business on most every visit.  Yogourtology is the place I take out of town visitors for a cool refreshing treat!
