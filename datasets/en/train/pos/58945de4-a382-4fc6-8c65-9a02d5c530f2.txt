Jodi is amazing. 

My bouquet was everything that I wanted, and more, and my bridesmaids were awesome too. 

In addition to bouquets and boutonnieres, she made seat placements for my mom, grandma, my husbands grandma, grandpa and ta ta as they were ill or had passed away and were, obviously, unable to attend our wedding. It was a very kind suggestion. 

My centerpieces were massive and were heavenly.

I can't express my gratitude enough for the beautiful flowers!!
