We stumbled across this place while looking for some dog friendly breakfast joints in Scottsdale. Boy were we lucky to have found this hidden gem... And I do mean hidden gem as it's pretty difficult to find the first time. 

First off, their coffee bar menu gave us a great couple of options in the Mexican latte and smoca mocha. You can do any of them hot or cold and with the temps scorching in the summer, the iced versions were great. 

The wife had a great mushroom omelet in a wine cream sauce and my green flannel (corned beef hash with chilies topped with sour cream) was fantastic. 

We were fortunate to not run into any service issues as others have which meant that we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience here. 

I think we'll end up frequenting this place on our getaway trips out to Scottsdale.
