Great Food and even Better Service

Staff made sure that all entrees were placed simultaneously in front of everybody.  My wife claims that the service seemed choreographed.  Never had service quite like this.....

Food was also exotic.  A few things touched my palate for the first time while dining here....inspired by some local native american herbs which typically aren't found in the grocery store.    

Great for a romantic night out or splurge of some type.
