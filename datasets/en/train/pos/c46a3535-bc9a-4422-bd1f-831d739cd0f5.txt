My fianc√© and I had great experiences with The Right Touch yesterday. 

I scheduled massages for both of us at the same time for a Sunday afternoon. He opted for the Deep Tissue Massage with Traci and I had the Therapeutic Massage with Kelly. It had been a log overdue treatment for me and Kelly was AMAZING. She was gentle yet firm in areas that needed to be worked through and my body felt like butter after it was over. I was also pleasantly surprised that she asked me if I wanted the oil removed from my body. Yes, please! She spent an extra 5-10 minutes cleaning me off with a hot towel and even that process was gentle and massage-like. We will definitely return again soon!
