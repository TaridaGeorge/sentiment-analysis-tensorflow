Man I am glad that I have a new BBQ spot to eat at!! This place is great..I have been back Several times already.. The Pull Pork Sandwich is absolutely Tasty! Great smoke flavor and always very juicy..I also have tried the Ribs and those were great as well..The Staff does a great job and are always very friendly..I will certainly be back soon..
