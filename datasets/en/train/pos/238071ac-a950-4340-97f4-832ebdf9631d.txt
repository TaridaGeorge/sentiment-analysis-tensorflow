It's places like this that make me thankful for Yelp!  Being from out of town, my friends and I were looking for a quick breakfast stop to grab some baked goods and coffee.  This place popped up on Yelp and just as described it was awesome!  We got several different danishes, a cinnamon roll and sticky bun.  All were delicious and still HOT!  

The coffee was excellent too!  They had a hawaiian hazelnut coffee that day that had a coconut flavor to it and was delicious!

Bottom line: stop by for some delicious baked goods and get here early for hot fresh out of the oven yumminess!
