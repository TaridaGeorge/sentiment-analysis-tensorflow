Great place!  I love that they feature wines from "the little guys."  You won't find most of what they feature at any Total Wine or Bevmo.  Small business supporting small business... totally awesome in my eyes!  The staff is knowledgeable and ooooh Chef Sarah - your food pairings with the wine in the wine 101 course were AMAZING!  Katie, the sommelier, is fun and she knows her stuff, plus it is clear that she loves to share her knowledge of wine with everyone.  I'll be back for sure!
