i guiltily admit i havne't been inside this store in a loooong time, and it keeps shrinking! i'm just glad it's surviving, i hear rumors of its closing all the time.
a tempe staple, prob higher prices than ZIa, which is just down the street, but i think the vibe here is cooler, and not as corporate as Zia's.
