Very very good! Spaghetti and Lasagna for lunch... The lasagna with meat sauce was both bold and flavorful, the portion was well worth the price.  Spaghetti with meatball was equally delicious.  They were out of  Italian sausage or enough for a dish, so I had the meatball instead with a pleasant surprise, the little bit of sausage they did have thrown in for good measure.  The sausage wasn't grainy or fatty and wow the flavor.  We'll be back for sure and did I mention they're doing a Thanksgiving dinner, should be good!!!
