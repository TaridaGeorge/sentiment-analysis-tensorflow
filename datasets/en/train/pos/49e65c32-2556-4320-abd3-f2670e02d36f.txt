Mozzarella sandwich w/tomato and basil is amazing.   Very fresh, very tasty.  The bread on the bottom of the sandwich can get a little soggy but it's all very tasty.

Chickpea potato soup was fantastic.  One of the best soups I've had. Not cream based, very healthy and fresh.

Sopraseta sandwich is also very good.
