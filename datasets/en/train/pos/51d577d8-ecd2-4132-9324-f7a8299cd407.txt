Triple Sports is the real-deal 'mom & pop' small business. Brian and Kara are always so helpful and they do a great job of remembering their customers, and have a genuine interest in all things triathlon. I love going in and just looking around. Its also next to The Coffee Bean, so make an afternoon of it!
