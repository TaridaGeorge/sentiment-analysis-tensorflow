If Teds existed in the burgeoning void of sanity that is know as Los Angeles it would be called Pinks and people would wait in lines around the building for two hours to eat here.  Thank Christ it doesn't because you can stroll right in, order two split grilled dogs, rings and a coke, pay ten bucks and feast till you are in a food coma. Teds is seriously one of the better charbroiled grills i have been to, it can get a little busy but it is worth ANY wait.  They have all the fixins, mustard, onions, peppers, relish, mayo... pretty much anything you could ever want your porky goodness to swim in.
