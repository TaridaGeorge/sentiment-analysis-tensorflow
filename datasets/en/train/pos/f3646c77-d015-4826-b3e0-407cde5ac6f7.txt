This is a family affair & I love that it feels that way in a pizza parlor. The kids are running around during the family breaks to eat & the pizza is traditional NYC. The wings smell is intoxicating. You can't not order the special that includes wings. This is my sons fave pizza place close to the house. I love the family atmosphere & the bang for my hard earned bucks.
