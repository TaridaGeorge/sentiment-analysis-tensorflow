First time there for breakfast and it was very very good.  The service was great and the waitress had my husband and I try their homemade raisin bread which was sooooo good.  There was no wait once the order was placed. Food was hot and fresh. Will being going back again for breakfast and also trying the lunch/dinner menu.
