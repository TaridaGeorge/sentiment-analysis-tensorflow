This place is located on the NE corner of Scottsdale & Shea almost next to the Safeway store (just south).  When I've gone there, the man has ALWAYS been super helpful with my questions on cat & dog food.  I've gotten small sample packs for some of the food so my cat could try them.  He was the first store in Scottsdale area to carry the Orijen & Acana brands.  He also carries Evo, Innova & CA Natural among others.  The prices are competitive.  I'd rather buy from small business than support the larger corporations if at all possible.  It's a very small place, but there is quality merchandise.
