This is just the type of hole in the wall type of place where you can always count on a cold beer in a frosted mug and some really good options when it comes to really unhealthy food that rocks!

I forget what dishes I've had but I know the few times I've been there everything has been damn good.

update .. I just got back and thought it was better than ever.  9pm on a tues it was just myself and two friends and the local drunks.  

You really can't ask more than good company and unreal Chicken Fried Chicken with mash and gravy.
