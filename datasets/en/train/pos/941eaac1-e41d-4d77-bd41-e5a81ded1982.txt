Dr. Hunt and Hunt Family Chiropractic provides excellent service to the patients. Dr. Hunt has a caring demenor and genuinely cares about the health and wellbeing of all his patients. After knowing Dr Hunt for numerous years I was excited to see his practice open up. I have been going for a few months now and seeing him three times a week. There is a definite improvement to be seen. My back hurts less and I feel better.
