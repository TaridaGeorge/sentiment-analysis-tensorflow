I was really impressed with this place. It reminded me a lot of Plaid in Tempe, but without the too-hip-for-you attitude from cashier/servers and dingy, cut-corner atmosphere.

the food was delish- i had vegan crab puffs (WOW, these were good!) and a tofu noodle bowl. the tofu was cooked perfectly, but i agree with Blythe down there that it's not "healthy" vegan- it's a lot of fried, greasy stuff. also, good call on that's a wrap in phoenix - deeelish!
