I have been a Solar Waves client for over two years now. Susan (owner) and staff are the best! Always friendly, helpful and very knowledgeable about tanning. 

The entire salon is immaculate. I am pretty sure this salon receives a "spring cleaning" on a weekly basis if not DAILY. 

The beds are quality, and awesome selection of tanning lotions as well. They offer a discounted punch card to reward for buying product from them. Recently got a $80 lotion for under $60. That is great! 

Even better Friday's are Happy Hour ... half off tanning so you can upgrade to a awesome bed for half the price.
