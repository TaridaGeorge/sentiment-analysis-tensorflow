I like coffee and dunkin is where its at!  It takes a few times to get use to the coffee its different than Starbucks (which is bitter and terrible but i still like it) or coffee bean (WHICH IS GREAT!) but its own flavor is origional and i appriciate it.  Its crazy close to my work which is good they have great breakfast options as well (aside from donuts), the flatbread breakfast sandwich is really good and under 300 calories so you can afford eating delicous dunkin' donuts by saving the calorie intake on that.  Either way the service is quick i love the coffee and im mad caffinated up so maybe thats why they got 5 stars.
