{{First off, I am a California Marriott restaurant manager.  I am overly observant and critical when dining out.}}

My husband and I were fortunate enough to enjoy our fourth wedding anniversary at BLT.   David Kent the restaurant GM was second to none.  He was inviting, intriguing, and extremely genuine.  HE SINGLE HANDEDLY MADE OUR 4TH ANNIVERSARY AMAZING!

Service:  Flawless.  Well spoken young man who was unobtrusive and gracious.
Food:  Incredible.  We had almost every item on the menu (or at least it felt like it).  Quite possibly the best steak we have ever had  (bold statement).  We decided to go back the next night for happy hour, which is a gem in itself!  Thank you for carrying Fernet Branca, too!

Thank you, David and BLT staff
