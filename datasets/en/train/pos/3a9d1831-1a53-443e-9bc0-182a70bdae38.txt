Wow...this place is incredible!  We enjoyed the unwind hour at the lounge and had a great experience.  $6 muddled drinks and select wines...the sparkling rose was great!  The shrimp chicharron was to die for...so flavorful and just so tasty.  Best appetizer I have tried in a very, very long time!  I will definitely be back!
