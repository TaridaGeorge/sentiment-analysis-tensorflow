Holy -god damn it - batman - rock n' roll I love LGO.   Even when this bish is rocking hard on a Saturday morning and I'm yanked cause parking here is an absolute cluster (not their fault they kick ass and everyone wants to mow here) I find it feasible to commandeer a table (Steph does this part) get coffee/hot chocolate and get  my scrumdiddliuptious nummers nom nom'd.   I highly recommend eating a Tammie Coe pastry while waiting for your food.  She makes a crumb bun that will make you weep.  The thing is a religious experience, I swear.  

FYI there is no waiter service till 4:00PM.
