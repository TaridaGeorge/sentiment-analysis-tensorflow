This place is on the way home some days. I change my route daily. The anti OCD. So I like to stop in here with my tiny and we do some reading in the childrens section. Some days I will leave with nothing; some days I leave with far too much. 

But it has an amazing selection of books, movies, etc... And if you are looking for nothing you will find everything. That is my favourite part. There is so much that you didn't know you didn't know. Bookmans will help you and your pocketbook discover so much good literature. It's almost better than the internet.... Almost. Ha.
