I love always being greeted with a "hi" whenever I walk in. The young men and women who work here are incredibly polite. The drink possibilities are vast, although I usually get the green tea. Sometimes I treat myself to a delicious cappuccino. And I must say, it has some of the best doughnuts in town, and they are only 59 cents after 3 pm!
