Wow. We eat out for breakfast every weekend and we have tried at least 50 different breakfast spots with 15 to 20 miles of our house.  The food here is amazing. Absolutely the best quality we've experienced.  Truly delicious. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and their coffee is tops. The presentation of the food on the plates is also well done. True attention to detail. The gals who serve and clean up are cheerful and helpful as well. The decor is a bit sparse but the food and service make up for it. Highly recommended.
