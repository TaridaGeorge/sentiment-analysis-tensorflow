I love and will always love the sweet and sour bowl with mock chicken, the bbq chicken sandwich, and, well, basically everything. Great atmosphere, best employees--basically do yourself a favor and go here, NOW.

If you ever get a chance to eat a Big Wac (like Big Mac), TRY IT. You'll have one of these I can't believe it's vegan moments, while simultaneously sending you into a deep food coma.
