One of my favorite pizza places in Scottsdale. The waiters and waitresses are always fun and provide good service. The pizzas are great. I love the salads too. They have the best dessert a baked chocolate chip cookie with ice cream on top and it is to die for!!!! Plus, the atmosphere is fun. You can sit inside or outside.
