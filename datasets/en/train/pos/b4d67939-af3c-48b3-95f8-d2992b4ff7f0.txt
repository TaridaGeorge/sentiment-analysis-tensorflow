Exactly what you want in a little cocktail lounge.  Cheap drinks, cheap pool table and jukebox, and plenty of interesting people watching.  They have a decent selection of craft beers which is nice.  Not many "dive bars" carry blue moon or Stella so that's a bonus.  The bartenders do a good job of not letting drunken idiots have the run of the place so you always feel safe.  Its perfect for a low key night or starting off your adventures.  Never have had a problem here.   The best neighborhood bar in Scottsdale.
