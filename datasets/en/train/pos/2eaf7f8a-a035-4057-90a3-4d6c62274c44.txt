25 degrees is a great spot for a date, dinner with a friend, or a late night bite. The burgers are tasty and not too greasy (the grilled cheese is pretty decadent as well), the fries and onion rings are awesome, and the drinks are just right. 

Good service, reasonable prices, and delicious food. Love it!
