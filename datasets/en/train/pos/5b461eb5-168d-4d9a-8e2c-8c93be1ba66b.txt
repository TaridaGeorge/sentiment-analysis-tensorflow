Love the happy hour - half off appies and $3 micro brew pints.  Go for the pizza crust with cheese for $3.25 - basically a deconstructed cheese pizza for 1/4 the price.  Meat and cheese board is also great and very filling.  Spring for the wood fired za (Shriners Pavone Pepperoni is a personal favorite), but don't come before 5pm as they will still be stoking the hardwood flames. I have a dream of someday locking down one of the 3 high top tables in the bar area, always taken by regulars that seem to live there. I have tried almost all the menu items and have yet to be disappointed.  Service is always great - Cody is top notch, high energy and knows his brews.  If Shaun White and the dude waiter from Chotchkie's (Office Space) had a baby, it would be him...
