The service is impeccable and the wait staff is nice to look at and very friendly. Food is very good Mexican and the drinks are free poured and better than most places in Peoria area. Chorizo is home made and is the BEST. Burgers are great and the wings are fabulous and HOT !! One time here and you will return again and again !!
