For a hotel nearly 30 years old this place has been kept up well over the years. 

Stayed here a number of nights and swam in the pools, drank, eat and floated myself stupid.   I expected the Hole In The Wall to be more expensive than it was, and the food was great.  Very surprising.  

Service around the pools was great. 

Also ate around the hotel complex each night too and was not disappointed or out of pocket too much considering the convenience. 

The pool complex is the main reason to stay, and the casitas are close enough to walk. 

Huge pool area, waterfall, spa, cool slide and a great lazy river around most of the land.   Just grab a tube and float... 

The only one bad thing was that the water and ice dispensers they place around the pools needed to be filled more often.
