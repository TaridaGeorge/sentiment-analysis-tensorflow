Delicious meats, and more!  The taste is so much bettter than buying from the grocery store.  It's noticiably higher quality.  Price is  higher, but worth it.  I also recommend the little box of Green Chili seasoning.  I've made it several times and LOVE it!  Also, try the dog bones.  Our dog loves it.
