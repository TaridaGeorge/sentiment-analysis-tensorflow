Many, it seems, hate this place because it has a "hipster" vibe. But what  if you just like industrial-looking decor? Do we all have to buy colonial furniture now? And if we all do so to avoid looking like hipsters, aren't we just pursuing a variant of hipness? Chill, sports fans. 

Anyway, I liked this place. Jeff is a friendly guy, takes coffee seriously, and there are soft chairs in which I can get some freaking work done. I use a Dell, and the Mac people did not give me the hairy eyeball - maybe because my Dell is so lame, it's hip?
