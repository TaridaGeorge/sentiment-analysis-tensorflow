We THOROUGHLY enjoyed our stay at this Embassy Suites location.  

Our experience: Hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful with any requests or recommendations. Lobby and pool grounds are beautiful. Impressive, clean & fresh room. Free parking. No resort fee. And the complimentary breakfast was OUTSTANDING. I've stayed at a few Embassy Suites properties, and this one had the best breakfast by far.  Chef Maria really knows how to serve up a great omelette!

I really can't think of any negatives (and I can be pretty picky). I'd come back to Phoenix just to stay at this hotel.
