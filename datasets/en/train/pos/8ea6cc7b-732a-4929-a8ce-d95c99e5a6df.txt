WARNING: BBQ AT IT'S MOST ADDICTIVE!!!

I love Famous Dave's, we try to come here at least weekly for lunch. friendly staff, reasonably quick service, and the meat just melts in your mouth. They have a good selection of their own sauces (5 or 6), from sweet n' sassy to 'devil spit', tasty fries, and awesome cornbread muffins.

Try the rib combo platter with some brisket, or the Texas Manhandler Sandwich (Memphis Style). 

Can get a little crowded at lunch, especially on Fridays.

Join the PIG (Pretty Important Guest) club for special offers & free Lil' Wilbur meals for kids on their birthday.

You won't be disappointed.
