Superb! ....This is a Happy Hour review .

Scotch and Bourbon lovers unite !
We enjoyed an exceptional HH ,the nuts and olives OMG ! so off the hook good,as was the plum tomato flat bread. 
The bartenders are genius and super nice. i had the darkness cocktail (yum) strong and pretty. Erich had brown derby's ,a nice old fashioned bourbon cocktail.Very nice crowd in this trendy, chic house.We really loved it here and were impressed with how friendly and warm the service was ,that dinner is now a "must do".

The pool bar Lustre looks fresh and modern ( a class act) . we are planning to explore this amazing pool deck space when we return for dinner.

A GEM at City Scape! 
The noshes we sampled were so great ,the drinks were strong ..The service was stellar ..

GO!
