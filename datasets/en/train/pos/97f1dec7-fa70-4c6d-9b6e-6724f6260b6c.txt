I just moved to Gilbert and needed to find a new dr. This place was close to my house so I called for an appt.  they got me right in and I was blown away by the whole office.  From dr McRae to his PA to his entire staff....they are all wonderful. The dr is very comprehensive and takes his time with you which I don't think I have ever experienced. I was losing faith in all drs because they rush you and don't try to get to the root of the problem. The office is so nice and clean and everyone is so beyond nice and makes you feel so comfortable.  I honestly can't say enough good things about the entire office. Even if I ever move out of Gilbert I will still come here for all of my needs.
