I finally made it to Beckett's Table tonight and sat at the bar for a couple of drinks and snacks. Really enjoyed the $5 Sangria. 

The attention to detail in this restaurant is amazing. I looked at a lot of the plates coming out of the kitchen and they all looked amazing. The restaurant is very attractive and well executed, especially for a two month old restaurant.  Service was friendly and attentive. The bartenders really knew their wines - I listened in as they made recommendations for others.

We just nibbled on the Oven Roasted Root Vegetables and the Mac and Cheese with Pancetta, both of which were excellent.

I look forward to coming back and trying out the full menu in the near future.
