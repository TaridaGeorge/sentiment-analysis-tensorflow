I go here every time I have worked out enough to deserve a pastry.  haha.

The almond horns and macaroons are just ridiculously delicious.  I wish  they had more of a pastry selection but it's more a bread place and grocery store than a bakery.  

It's the only place I can find German treats though that are freshly made.  The prices are great considering it's the same thing you'll pay at AJs for a muffin.  

Yum.  Also the ladies are so nice and always friendly.
