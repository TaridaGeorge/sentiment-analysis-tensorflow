I love big beautiful Whole Foods markets.  While I've been going to the one on Shea, and it is nice, I don't know if I can go back after going to this one!

The store is huge, and their selection of products is great!  I can't wait to go back and enjoy some of the in store dining, they offer so many options - including seafood, smokehouse meats, tapas, sushi, pizza, sandwiches and more!
