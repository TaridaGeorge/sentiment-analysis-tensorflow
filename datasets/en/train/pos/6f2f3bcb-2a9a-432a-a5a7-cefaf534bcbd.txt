Honestly, I can't remember how I found out about Butter & Me, but I'm glad it happened.

My fiancee (now wife!) and I are addicted to cupcakes and we decided to swap the traditional wedding cake for some delicious cupcakes. Kelly at Butter & Me did not disappoint. She was absolutely fantastic to work with and has *the best* cupcakes in the valley! Believe me, we taste-tested a number of other vendors and everyone else's cupcakes tasted like small, dry, cakes.

The cupcakes from Butter & Me were exactly what we were looking for. They were perfectly moist, beautifully decorated, and there are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from!!!

I cannot recommend Butter & Me highly enough! The Yelp review sums it up: "Woohoo! As good as it gets!"
