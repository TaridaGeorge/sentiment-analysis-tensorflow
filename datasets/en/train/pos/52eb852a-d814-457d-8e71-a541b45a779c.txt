This is the 2nd best sushi in Scottsdale, without being overpriced and over dramatized by $3 million decor, like most of the boring unauthentic restaurants in Snotsdale that snowboreds with money to burn go to get drunk. They have Japanese chefs, and they give you huge and fresh, oversized but correctly sliced fish on nicely groomed rice. You have to get here early, as it opens at 5:30 and fills up by 6. They have well prepared non-sushi dishes, too, and friendly service.
