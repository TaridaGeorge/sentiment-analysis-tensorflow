Oh no....I have a new addiction in Downtown Chandler. 
This store is absolutely beautiful. It is Christian themed, but it will appeal to anyone. I bought an amazing bracelet and some great gifts. The prices are very fair. They have jewelry, clothing for all ages, home decor and so much more. I spent an hour looking at everything. 
They just opened on 12/3/10.
