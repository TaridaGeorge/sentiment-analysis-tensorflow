Amazing frittata and the best breakfast potatoes I've had in a long while!  I could have ordered so many different things off of their menu, but had to narrow it down. There's a great beverage selection (morning coffee style) and I thought it was reasonably priced for the excellent quality ($6-$8 for full breakfast)
