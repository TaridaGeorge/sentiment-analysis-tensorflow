Absolutely 'The' place to to enjoy 'chaats' ... can not get more authenticated than what you get here... not even in India (overall menu options could be more in any chaat place in India though)... grocery part of it is not bad at all... almost everything I have ever seen here in the store is fresh (unlike some other Indian grocery stores around here) and variety  is awesome... there are some things that you can get only at this place and nowhere else esp if thats related to different festivals/celebrations... items other than chaats like Chole Bhature, parathaas etc. are yum too... and you get Thumbs Up here 12 months a year ! ... ahhhhh....

Overall, a very good place for vegetarian Indian food and groceries...
