Terrific pizza for over 20 years from a really nice Chicago family. For those of you from the Windy City, think Home Run Inn (the original S. Side location).  The crust is they key...it's perfect -- thin and almost pastry-like. This crust and other fresh ingredients more than offset the slightly too sweet sauce and use of canned mushrooms.  One of the top 5 pizzas in the valley!
