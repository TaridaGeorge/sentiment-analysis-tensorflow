Let me just say that I'm no stranger to donuts and these donuts at Rainbow Donuts Bakery are fantaaaaaaaastic!  I'm not a sweet tooth guy but I inhaled 3 of these in a day and had to give the rest to my friends otherwise I would have eaten the whole dozen.

Like Daren C said - they serve rice bowl meals too and I had the curry one and my friend had the spicy chicken (i think it was the spicy chicken).  Both were full of flavor and served really hot because the owner cooks everything to order.  No microwave stuff here!  

I would totally recommend going back to this place to grab a value lunch and probably the best damn donuts on the north side of town.  

Yes, they are better than Dunkin Donuts.
