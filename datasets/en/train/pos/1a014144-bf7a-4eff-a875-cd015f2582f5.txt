Best donuts in town is right! Try the donut holes as well, they are  only .99 cents for a dozen and they are ginormous, fluffy and delicious... They also have some coffee drinks that are ok, but they don't compare to a Starbucks.... But that's not what they are here for... Eat the donuts! You will never go anywhere else!
