Frank and Lupe's is an oasis hidden amongst a sea of snooty.

Tucked back in the back is one of the best patio's around.  The drinks are strong, and quite tasty.  The food is delicious!  I had the carnitas stuffed sopapillas last time, and I'm still dreaming of them...

This is a must-stop for me every time I'm in Old Town!
