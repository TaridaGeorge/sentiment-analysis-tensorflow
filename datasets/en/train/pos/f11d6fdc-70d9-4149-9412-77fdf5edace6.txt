I love Thai food. Love it. And this is the best Thai place that I've come across in Phoenix. I've tried a lot of their menu items and have never been disappointed. I also enjoy being able to select how spicy I want my food (1-5 scale). The service can be mediocre and they don't serve alcohol, but with food this good you won't even care.
