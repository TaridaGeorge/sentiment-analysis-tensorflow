Although Jim's isn't flashy on the outside, and scared me for the first few years I was here, I decided to actually go inside one morning I was completely impressed with the food, service, and diner atmosphere. Hands down, my favorite place to go after a long crazy night of partying. Fun to go with a group, or by yourself and sit at the counter reading the paper.
Caution: I've never actually had the coney island here, so I can't vouch for it. However, I do LOVE the hamsteak, it is a great large portion is always cooked to perfection!
