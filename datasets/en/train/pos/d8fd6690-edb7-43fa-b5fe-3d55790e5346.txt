I love this place. I have been going to it since it first open. I had my first oyster there and love them.  Great service and great food! Huge menu that includes a sushi. They serve sough dough bread while you wait for your order. The have huge booths. They have great take home kid cups and a very nice kids menu that even comes with tattoos. The house wine is also pretty good. I highly recommend it.
