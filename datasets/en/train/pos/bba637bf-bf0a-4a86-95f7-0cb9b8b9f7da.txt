I have to tell you all that if you are planning a baby shower for anyone you should for sure check out the cup-cake cakes at Safeway. First of all, they are very affordable and second of all, they are too cute!  You know since you are at Safeway, you are going to get good service, but I have to say the bakery people are the best.  The cakes come in very shower friendly pink boxes and are ready in 24 hours.  I believe you can get cup-cakes cakes for any occasion but I highly recommend the shower ones!!

Check out this baby girl cake I used for a shower I just hosted!!!
