this was my first time really hiking and since i can be overconfident i kinda didnt respect it for its difficulty but it was tough and it kicked my ass but i probably wasnt in as good shape as i thoght i was since a lot of people passed me including old ones lol. it took me over an hour to reach top but when i did get there the view was well worth it....its like an oasis in the middle of a busy city, if u wanna get away from from phx but cant get away from it then just use camelback to go above it. oh yea its best to try going on weekdays and i went in late oct but i dont know if i would dare try it in the summer.
