One of my favorite Thai restaurant in AZ, everything is so original and not americanized. My fav gonna be Pad See Ew, the famous rice noodle cuisine that I always eat from time to time. It was so delicious and you can really smell the fried rice noodles aroma as they cook it out for you in their kitchen. The next best thing is gonna be FBI - Fried Banana Ice Cream served with vanilla ice cream and honey which I love the most. Tad Hoo Tod is my recommended appetizer. A fried silk tofu that was melt in your mouth and you got to order peanut sauce that compliment the taste. So far, I'm a very happy customer everytime I went here and I'm crossing fingers that they will keep the original taste cause it's superb!
