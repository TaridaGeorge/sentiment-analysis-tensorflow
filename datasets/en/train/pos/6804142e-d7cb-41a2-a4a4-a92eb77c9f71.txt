If I could transcribe the sounds of a happy stomach to written word, it would probably be spelled, "Mastro's".  I would classify Mastro's as the ultimate of steakhouses, with cuts so prime and tender that they will still fall off the bone the next day when you take your leftovers out of the fridge.    

From the insanely good assorted bread basket (don't eat too much or you will spoil your dinner) to the shrimp cocktail that are so big you'd swear they were on the Barry Bonds regiment of steroids, to steaks that come out on 400 degree sizzling plates...there is happiness at every turn here.

Live a little, eat at Mastro's!
