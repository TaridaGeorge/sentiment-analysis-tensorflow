Best delivery wings around! Seriously, I've never been able to order wings for delivery and have them not be soft or soggy. That is NOT the case here! I've ordered wings twice, and both times they have been excellent! I recommend hot wings, and order them well done for that extra finishing touch!

I can't wait to actually go there and try them fresh!
