Oh my f*ing phenomenal.

Yesterday I went to fez and sat on the patio.  Thank god it wasn't vegetarian day because I had the spiritual enlightenment on ciabatta that is otherwise listed as the Douxelle burger.  That's right, I got that burger even though I hate mushrooms--on the strength of Brad E's recommendation.

Burger topped with tomato, sauteed mushrooms and onions, and dijon, and sweet potato fries on the side?  You can bet stacks of benjies that I will be there to donkey punch that fucker again, and soon.

I was told the veggie burger is amazing and maybe I'll try it one day but for now you'll have to trust me that there is now a burger out there that rivals the Houston's cheeseburger for most succulent thing in the universe.

the friend I was with got some roughage with dressing on the side.  sheesh.
