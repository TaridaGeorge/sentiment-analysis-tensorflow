My husband is from North Carolina where they sell Cherrywine. We searched all over AZ to purchase some, never found any. Bought a 12 pack online and shipping alone was 20 bucks. Apparently he really wanted this soda. Anyway, we found this shop and they carry Cherrywine!!!! Bought a case this morning. Love this place and we will be back.
