So happy to have not only frozen yogurt in Ahwatukee, but relatively healthy frozen yogurt at that.  The toddler and I come here often and he always lets me pick the flavor (such a gentleman).  I've been to other locations in California and those seem to have eight flavors and ours always has twelve so that's a big plus.  My favorite is pumpkin, they should have it year round, but I've never had a bad flavor.  My dream flavor though would be a tart yogurt, kind of like Pink Berry or MoJo's.  Maybe I'll right them a letter.
