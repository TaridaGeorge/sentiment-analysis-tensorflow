HORRIBLE!!  I had to wait for my Spaghetti and Meatball stuffed Calzone!  They should have known I was coming!!!  

The food was just as good as I remember from 2 years ago...maybe even better!  We had dinner there Saturday night and it's now Sunday and I'm drooling thinking about my leftovers in the fridge...That yummy, yummy, yummy sauce....mmmmmmmmmm.

OK, *burp* (excuse me) I'm back... mmmm that was good! 

:(  Now I have no more left :(

Unfortunately, they don't have one in Chandler...I wonder if I can get Mr. Spinato to open up a 5th one out here! *hint* *hint*
