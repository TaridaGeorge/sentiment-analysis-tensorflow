I lived in Japan as a kid and regularly stuffed my little face with Japanese French style pastries. I always worried I wouldn't be able to find similar bakeries States-side. Well, Arai's cakes taste EXACTLY how I remembered mine from Japan. Lightly sweet and airy. Freakin perfect! And the goodies look super kawai, too. My Arai faves are the strawberry short cake, rolled crepe with fruit, and fluffy ass wheat bread loaf. 

I must stress that the pastries here are lightly sweet! If you like to taste nothing but overwhelming sugar in your mouth, then don't come here.
