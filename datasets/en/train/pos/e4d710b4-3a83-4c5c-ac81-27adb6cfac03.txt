This place is Good.  The food looks and tastes very fresh.  I don't think I've ever been to a Mediterranean restaurant that was extremely clean and modern.  The service was very good and the food was extremely good.  I don't live in Arizona but if I am ever within an hour of one I will make my way to it.  Pita Jungle people, please open one in So Cal.
