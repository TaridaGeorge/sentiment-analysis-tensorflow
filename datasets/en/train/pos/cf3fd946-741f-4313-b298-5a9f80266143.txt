Tasty Italian.  Yes, there's definitely the feel of the chain Italian place that it is, but if you're in the neighborhood and you're in the mood for pasta, this place will satisfy your craving for noodles and sauce.

I had the Pasta Bolognese, and my wife had the Chicken Lemone.  Delicious all around.  Top that off with bread (perfect for dipping in balsamic vinegar or leftover sauce), and you have a satisfying meal.

Service was friendly too and the ambiance was pleasant.  I'm always in the mood for good priced pasta, and Babbo gave me what I was looking for.  If you've seen their billboards and was wondering what they were like, I can vouch for their good taste on multiple levels.
