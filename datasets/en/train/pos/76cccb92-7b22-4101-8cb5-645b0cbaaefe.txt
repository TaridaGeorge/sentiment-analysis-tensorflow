LOVED this place! Went here for dinner on a recent Friday evening. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Great wine selection and menu choices. The ambiance was very relaxing and comfortable. 

The food was awesome. We shared the Cheese fondue and a deli meats platter. The cheese fondue was DELICIOUS!  Better than melting pot by a long shot.  For dinner I had one of the crepes, the presentation was beautiful and the flavors were amazing. My husband had the filet that that cooked right at the table - it was fun and delicious. 

My only wish is that this little hot-spot was closer to where I live!  We will be back for more.
