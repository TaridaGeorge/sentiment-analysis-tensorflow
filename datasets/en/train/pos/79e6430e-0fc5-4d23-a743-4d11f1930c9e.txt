When I was planning my wedding last year, I was also with child (like Sophie below) so I decided that I needed to find a great tailor that would take care of my dress quickly, because I wasn't sure how much my growing midsection would change within a few weeks time.

I bought my dress 2 sizes too big, because I wasn't sure how much fabric would be needed, and took it to Valentina 2 weeks before the big day.  Not only did she take it in perfectly, but she did it in only a few days and only charged me $30!!  Score one for the prego bride.

I would highly recommend her, she was great, fast and professional.
