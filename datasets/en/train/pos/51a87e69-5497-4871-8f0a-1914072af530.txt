rise up is amazing for several reasons:

1. rise up is a non profit organization that does humanitarian work helping children get educated around the world. clearly awesome.

2. clothing line is good for everyone. i was able to buy a birthday present for my best friend, my brother, my mother, and my father all at one store.

3. decor of the shop. from the art, to the gurney, to the church pew. everything means something. the 'kill  your tv' installation is epic. 

4. the record player. all the music in the store is on vinyl, so you can come in and choose a record to listen to while you shop. i chose radiohead. clearly a good call.
