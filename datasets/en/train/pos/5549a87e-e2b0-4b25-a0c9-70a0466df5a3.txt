Del Lago Veterinary Hospital provides excellent care for their patients, plus the doctors and staff go above and beyond for their loyal clients.  My family have been going to them for a long time.  So when we found a litter of wild baby roof rats, we brought them to Del Lago, and they humanely euthanized them for us.
