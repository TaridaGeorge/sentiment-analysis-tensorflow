So delicious! The amazing spices are going to haunt my dreams!

Unlimited chai, mango lassi, matter paneer and garlic naan... I almost died. Stole some of my boyfriend's raita that came with his lamb biryani (which was enough to feed two hungry people very happily) since my matter paneer was so deliciously spicy!

We were one of two guests on a Thursday night and waited for nothing, service was amazing, our server had great suggestions for both of us.
