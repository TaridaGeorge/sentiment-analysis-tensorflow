My favorite bar in Tempe.  Chill patio scene.  Grab a pint and a table outdoors.  Due to its proximity to ASU it tends to attract a college crowd but there is a good mix of ages most of the time.  You can wear your grungies and not feel out of place, which is always a plus.  If you like uppity Scottsdale bars you might consider this a "dive" even though it's not.
