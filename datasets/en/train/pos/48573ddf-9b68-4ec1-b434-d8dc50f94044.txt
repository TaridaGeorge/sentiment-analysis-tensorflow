My father introduced me to this place about 6 months ago and I've been back about 10 times. They have my favorite beer on the planet they brew themselves known as Kilt Lifter. It's a dark beer...mmm.....my favorite and it's the best there is, period. The best part is (and I do this every time) you can buy cases of their most popular beers for $1 a beer. No I didn't studder. $24 bucks gets you 24 beers. The best beers money can buy. Beyond that...ALL their beers are good. Most are phenominal. The scenario (college area) is fabulous...and the food is amazing! 

Everyone I have introduced to it has absolutely loved it! 

Also note...there are 2 locations I have only visited the Tempe location. The other is in Scottsdale.
