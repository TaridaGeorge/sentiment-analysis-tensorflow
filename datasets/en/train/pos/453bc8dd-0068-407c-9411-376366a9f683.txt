Add this spot to your bucket list. I'm a totally spoiled food snob and LOVE Tarbell's. The food is AMAZING as is the service with lovely ambiance. They really know how to balance flavors, cook everything to perfection, and use the freshest ingredients. Don't even get me started on the mac and cheese.
