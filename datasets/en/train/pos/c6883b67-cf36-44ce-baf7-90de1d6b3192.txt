Apparently this place underwent a renovation and let me tell you, it's a fantastic renovation, whatever they did! The pro-shop is large and extensive, you can find all of your golfing needs there (clubs, bags, shoes, clothes....).  Note this is NOT a course, it's only a driving range and pro-shop.  The driving range is awesome.  It's a double decker range, which I have never been to, plus it's automated balls & tees! You pay inside the golf course for a certain number of balls and it will keep track for you, plus the computer tells you exactly how far each of the flags are from you, which is pretty nice for a beginner .... and MISTERS in the summer!! For all you Phoenicians, you understand how important this is!!!!! :)  They also do lessons but I have not signed up for them --- yet.  I plan to though!
