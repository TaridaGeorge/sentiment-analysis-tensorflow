Love this place. Good food, good drinks. Try pear and gorgonzola flat bread, butternut squash corn enchiladas, Thai BBQ baby back ribs, smoked gouda mac and cheese, apple slaw with jicama and watercress, cheese plate...dessert... Try the Sun Salutation cocktail (citrus, ginger, curry, lemon, cayenne sugar rim --divine). --Service is attentive. Pricey, but worth it.
