Nick's is the mom and pop of AZ Italian restraunt must! The food is always consitently great! I highly recommend the Chicken Piccata. :) It is a very casual place as far as decore but the food is what does it for me.  I would have to agree with Ronald's review below. (The two chair in the middle... worth waiting for a better table)
