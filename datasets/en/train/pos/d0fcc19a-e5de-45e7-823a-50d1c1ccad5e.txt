I stopped at this waffle house it was really good, affordable prices and the waffle was soooo good. I was surprised even the people were ok dint expect this since I was in Arizona, maybe everyone is just happy since the food is so good. Its a small place seems everyone is eating next to each other but you forget it once you get your order. Wish we had them in the LA area as we lack breakfast places that are actualy good.
