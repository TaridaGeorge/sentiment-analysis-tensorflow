Ok its about time to review this place.  Ive been here several times, breakfast lunch and dinner.   Every meal was delicious and super flavorful.  You will not find another place with FRESHER organic ingredients.  Cmon they have cage-free chicken salads and street tacos! The combinations they come up with here are amazing, very unique. The chef is a genius.  Also see Gary at the bar for happy hour, he knows his food and is very helpful! Great staff. 

My favs:  
red pepper hummus, Tzatziki, (homemade yum). 
Anything on the brunch menu, pancakes, BLT, Chile burrito.
