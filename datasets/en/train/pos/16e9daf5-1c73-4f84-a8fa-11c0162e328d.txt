My girlfriend and I found ACE upon arriving in Mesa for a temporary work assignment of about 6 months.  We love this place.  If you're looking for fancy, this ain't it!  But if you're looking for a clean, decent, VERY inexpensive Chinese restaurant with good food and friendly service, this is the place!  It's in a strip mall right next to a Subway deli if that gives you an idea of the ambiance.  It's usually full of Asian people which is always a good sign to me.  There are zillions of items on the menu, and while we've only tried a few of them, we have yet to try something that we didn't think was delicious.  The Beef Chow Fun with gravy is my favorite, but we also like the Chicken with Fresh and Black Mushrooms.  Sit down, or take out, you can't lose in this place.
