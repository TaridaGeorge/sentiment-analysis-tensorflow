This place is really amazing.  I've been to a lot of vegetarian restaurants over the years and this is one of the best by far.  I just wish they were closer to Tempe where I live!  It's totally worth the drive though. We had the cucumber rolls (incredible!) and I had Pad Thai and my husband had the Kung Pao. Both were awesome.  Everything we got had amazing flavor and freshness. We had been going to Green and I have to say, this is better and worth the extra money. I didn't mind their prices because the food was really outstanding.
