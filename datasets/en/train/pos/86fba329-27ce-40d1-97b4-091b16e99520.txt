My husband to be and I had a great date night here. We made a reservation using open table and were seated promptly when we came in. Our waiter Gary was fabulous and provided great recommendations on the menu. He was fun and knew the menu well. We had great drinks and great food. We tried the crab cakes and Mac n cheese both to start with. My hubby to be got the filet and I got the meatloaf and everything was super yummy. Definitely will go back and bring friends!
