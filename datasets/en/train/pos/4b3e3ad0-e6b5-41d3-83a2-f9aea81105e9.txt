First time I have been there in years. My breakfast was pretty good and reasonably priced. Coffee was great with Sugar in the Raw (a great condiment). The pecan cinnamon roll was very yummy. We were there at 11:45am and were seated right away, drinks delivered, order taken, and food delivered within minutes. Overall...Thumbs Up!
