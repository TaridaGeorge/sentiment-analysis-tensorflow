This place is awesome.  The service is great and the food is the best I've had for the price.  Ive tried a few different things on the menu and haven't been disappointed.  My favorite is the grilled mozzarella and fontina sandwich.  Their roast beef is an excellent choice too (hot or cold).  I have tried several of their homemade ice creams and all of them are sooooooo good. If you're in the area and looking for somewhere to eat, this is it.
