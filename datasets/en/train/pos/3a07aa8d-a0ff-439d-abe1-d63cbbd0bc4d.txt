This pizza has been around for years. The family started the original place under the name Aurelio's in the early 1980's. It was in Tempe as well but different location was off McDowell. The pizza over the years has been consistently good. The owners are awesome and friendly.  I am recommending for those going for the first time to try the Spinato's spinach pizza or the all meat pizza. I would start with an antipasto salad and then dive into the pizza! Delicioso! Currently have to BYOB/BYOW but process of getting a liquor license as of 10/2010.
