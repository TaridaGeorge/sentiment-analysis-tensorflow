My awesome wife took me here for my deep affection for cheeseburgers. I was not disappointed. I also have a love for iced tea which was very good. My wife had a Moscow moose cocktail which was refreshing and enjoyed. The wings were an added bonus as the chicken was of great quality and the fact they are grilled is nice. The sauce was spicy enough with a heavypepper taste. We liked that the server waited to bring our burgers until we were done with our wings so we were not rushed. As a huge burger fan I was STOKED on these. The meat was cooked perfectly to a med rare and high grade. The buns were perfect and the topping were different but welcome. The herb fries were fries but crisp. This was a delicious dinner and have no complaints and worth every penny. Will go back soon.
