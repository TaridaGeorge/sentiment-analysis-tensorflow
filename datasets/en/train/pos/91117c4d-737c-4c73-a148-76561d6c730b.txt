I have a Shetland Sheepdog and have had some trouble  finding a  good groomer who knows how to groom the breed. Then I found Best Friends Dog Grooming. I booked an appointment and was impressed right away with the care the groomer  took to understand what I wanted to achieve with my dogs appearance. They had him done early and when I picked him up I was blown  away. He looked great, they exceeded all of my expectations by doing  a fantastic job; giving me exactly what I  was looking for. I would highly recommend Best Friends  to any dog lover.  Great job!
