I stop by Phoenicia once a week for the hummus deluxe with gyro - it's a perfect lunch, supertasty hummus and the gyro meat make my mouth very happy.  The folks that work there are always pretty nice, and I've never been made to wait an unreasonable amount of time for my food.  Very happy to have them in my neighborhood.
