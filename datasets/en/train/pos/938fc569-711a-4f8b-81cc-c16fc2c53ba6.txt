i don't know why most people give this such bad reviews, maybe it is just not new enough.  The food is always great.  I grew up in New York eating chinese food.  The food here is authentic, not spicy in general - mostly cantonese style but very good.  They will make your fried rice with bean sprouts and not carrots and peas if you ask.  The Dim Sum is better than Phoenix Palace (we had a blind taste test at home after doing takeout from both).  Service is always great.  Mongolian beef is great, salt and pepper shrimp or pork choops are very good. try the duck Mu shu. my wife loves the orange beef.
