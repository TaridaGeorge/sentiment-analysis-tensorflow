This aiport is great. 

Secuirty is always a breeze dispite being in the top 10 busiest in the US.  Terminal 4 is great with multiple food options before and after secuirty. Terminal 2 and 3 are much smaller but still great and have food and lounges.  Terminal 2 has a military room and United Red Carpet Club.  Terminal 4 has 3 US Airways clubs there.  Best of all, FREE WI-FI.  They also have good shuttle service between terminals and the light rail to connect to PHX, Tempe and Mesa.
