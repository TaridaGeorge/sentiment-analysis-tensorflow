LOVE this place! 

I went here to meet friends and grab a coffee last weekend and it was perfect! Great service, delicious Latte, clean and cute design with seating inside, and just the perfect mix of people to make it feel like a great place to converse or enjoy a coffee and relax on your own. 

BONUS: There's a really cute hair salon connected through a side door - I'm coming back for a coffee and a hair cut next time!
