Went to this place last night for a BEARDO and Dirt Nasty show. Wayyy fun! (Even though Andre Legacy didn't show). 

Wow, I cannot believe what a good time I had. Really intimate venue when they performed on the first level. Moderately priced drinks and my favorite was the outdoor patio. 

Clean women's restrooms, and that is certainly a godsend, even on a Wednesday night. 

We got our pics taken with the artists since the outdoor patio is near their chill room, where the artists were hanging. I also thought it was cool that they split the venue so the 18+ kids could get in too... they like music, man!

Overall, really liked the style, the less is more inside style with guitars on the wall and calm colors. 

As a San Diegan now living in Scottsdale, this place gets my pick:)
