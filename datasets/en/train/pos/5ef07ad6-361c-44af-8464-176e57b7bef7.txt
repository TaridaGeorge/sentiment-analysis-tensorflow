Aside from breaking a lug stud making me late to get out of town on a road trip (pulling a camper, not willing to risk with a broken stud) these guys were great. Matched Tire Rack (less shipping costs), got my truck in and out quickly, and everyone was really nice. They did not, however, road force balance my tires so I had shaking in my steering at over 60. They quickly fixed the issue, but had my office not been close by I would not have been happy to spend time there twice for what should have been done the first time. I would have thought that with a 32" tire a road force balance would be a given. Overall, these guys get 5 stars from me. We all make mistakes, and they made up for them beautifully.
