Have not stopped thinking of my cheeseburger since I left a few nights ago.  Being a huge Pittsburgh fan I had to order the Pittsburger with sweet tots.  Cole Slaw and fries on the burger might not sound good but it is amazing.  The tots were amazing also, great beer selection on top and in the bottle.  All 4 of us loved our dinner and have talked about how fast we can go back.  We ordered the Tot-Chos, messy but tasted great, the full order was the perfect size for the 4 of us to share.  The rest of my party got the Mac-m-cheesburger, juicy lucy and Hangover burger.  Great service, kid friendly and tons of tvs to watch sports.  Can't wait to go back!
