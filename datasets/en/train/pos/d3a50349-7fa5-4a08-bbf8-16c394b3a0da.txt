If I could give Spinato's 10 stars I would! That's how much we like this place. Their food is always delicious, the service is great and I'm oh so happy that they opened one closer to my house. 

They have daily specials, a great kids menu and awesome desserts. Their pizza is amazing (you can order 1/2 and 1/2 for their toppings), their pasta is super yummy, but our fav is by far the calzones! Those are to die for! We came here a lot when I was pregnant and after our baby was born, we went back with him...they gave him his first Spinato's shirt!

If you go to the Tempe location, you won't be able to get pasta, just an FYI.
