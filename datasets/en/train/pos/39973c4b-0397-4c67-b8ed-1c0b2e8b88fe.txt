Hands down the most amazing vet one could ask for. Every time I bring my bunny in they always ask to come pet her, and finish her appointment on time or ahead of schedule. 

When I brought River in to have her fixed, they called the next day to follow-up and check on her, and then returned my calls promptly or put me through to a vet immediately to answer some medication questions that I had. 

I am so impressed with their care, as well as their follow-up. I would highly recommend them.
