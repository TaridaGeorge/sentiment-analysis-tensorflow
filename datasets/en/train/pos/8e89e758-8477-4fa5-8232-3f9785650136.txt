I've been here more than 4 times, and have always been very pleased with the experience. The food is very well prepared, "outstandingly" flavorful, service is attentive every time, and the ambiance is Great! Definitely one of my most favorite place to dine.

I remember 3 dishes we ordered and absolutely loved: spaghetti vongole, fettuccine bolognese,  and salmone con caponata. Others were great too, but I really can't remember.

And there are complimentary gondola ride and valet parking. As it's getting cooler, I'm thinking about going back there soon to enjoy their outdoor patio.

Their price isn't outrageous either. Main course range from $18 (pasta) to $26 (meat), rib eye is $32 though.

If it makes any difference, they are Diner's Choice Winner for Italian & Romantic. Yea, you can tell I love this place!
