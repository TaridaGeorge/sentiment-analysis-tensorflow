In a nutshell, CARMAX did everything they said they would. When I told them, I needed the vehicle sooner, than a week. they said, it would arrive in two days and it did?!! Wow... a car dealership that does what it says it will? .... Then when test driven the transmission was skipping, they said they would have BMW check it out and get back to me in two days and again, CARMAX did get back to me in two days and replaced the sensor. l was comparing two vehicles (one new) MINI Scottsdale and a used one from Carmax. I ended up buying from Carmax cause they did everything they said, they would and super nice on top of it. No "car salesman" type here. Highly reccommend!
