The service here is very good.  I've been coming for years, even back to the days when it was less trendy/more traditional French countryside upstairs of the Biltmore.  The waitstaff, despite the hip decor and occassionally foreign menu item, are very pleasant, not condescending, and quite helpful.  What's great is that whether I go for a formal dinner for a special occasion, or with a friend to "cheap" it out for burgers and duck fries, the service is the same.  

There are some great menu items and you could spend many visits exploring them.  Goat cheese flatbread, gruyere pomme puree, lobster bisque, the burger, the salmon... all rather good.

Definitely a favorite in my rotation.  And nice decor to heighten the mood further.
