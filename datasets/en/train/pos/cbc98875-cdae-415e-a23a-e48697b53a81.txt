First off, I'm from WI, so i definitly have to come here to Represent my Brewers!!!   I couldn't believe we got tickets for $22.00 right above the dugout!  .  The Stadium is smaller, but i like that better since we were able to get autographs and pics.  I can't wait to come back here, we had such a blast!  GO BREWERS :)
