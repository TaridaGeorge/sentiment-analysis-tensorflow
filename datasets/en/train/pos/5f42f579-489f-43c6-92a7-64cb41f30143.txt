This place gets 5 stars because it is authentic.

You want ceramic tile to look at and bleach-soaked rags permeating your nose? Go somewhere else. This is an old-time soda fountain, and the only modernization to the menu that I could find was the fabulous black bean veggie burger. Score! I always have to get some potato salad because it tastes just like my Great-Aunt Margaret's.

It feels old and it is old. If that sounds good to you, it will be a pleasure to go there. If that sounds icky, go to McDonald's
