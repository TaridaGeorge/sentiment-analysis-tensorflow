Since I moved from Tempe to San Diego, I have been mourning for my favorite place on earth. Excellent veggie selection, great quality of ingredients, friendly service and perfect location.

You Tempe crowd out there, you might be suffering from the heat and you might be dying to move to San Diego. Let me tell you, DON"T if you are an Ethiopian food fan like me. You will be very disappointed as you will not find anything close to Blue Nile here. While there, enjoy it!
