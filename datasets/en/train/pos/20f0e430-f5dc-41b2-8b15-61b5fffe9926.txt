I have to say, I am not a wine snob, but they have some fantastic choices for pinot noir.  Also, I found many other things that I like that you can't seem to get in one stop.  They had Iniskillin Ice wine, which is hard to find other than in a restaurant which is wayyyyy too expensive.

The man who helped me actually cared about what I liked rather than trying to sell me really expensive wine.  I will be back for sure!
