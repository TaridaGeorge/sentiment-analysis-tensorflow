Been coming to Ichi Ban about once a month for over 3 years now.  I almost forgot to give them a good review they deserve.  

I have only eaten here during lunch time and I always get the same thing, the terriaki chicken rice bowl, sometimes with white rice sometimes with brow rice.  I've tried their sushi and egg rolls before too.  I'm always satisfied with their friendly quick service and hot fresh food.  I just might start going for dinner here soon.  It's very small inside, kinda a whole in the wall place.  I do like the interior and it seems very romantic.  First date place would be good here.  Prices are decent and they have a huge variety of sushi rolls.  Can't wait to try them all.
