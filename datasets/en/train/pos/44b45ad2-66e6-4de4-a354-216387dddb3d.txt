I really like this place. But to be honest, Ive only gone on a sunday and a monday. Seemed like our group was the only one in the theatre


The place is very nicely designed, you can just feel how modern it is when you walk in. Tickets are not anymore expensive then going to a regular theater. Got a beer which was around 6 dollars, not too expensive considering it is a movie theatre. I ordered a grilled chicken burger with sweet potato fries and it was surprisingly delicious. The fries seemed like it was unlimited, couldn't even finish all the food I had.

Leather seats were comfortable and service was polite. Overall a great experience
