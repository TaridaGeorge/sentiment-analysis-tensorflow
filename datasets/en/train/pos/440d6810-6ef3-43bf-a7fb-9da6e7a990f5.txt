A great little ma and pa restaurante with big flavor! 
The restaurant is small, very casual and I could tell the owners are very family oriented. 

The entire family helps out at the place at some point or another and are very friendly and their hospitality was a nice change. The food however, was even better... 

Alessandro's special is essentially a chicken piccata... the chicken was a bit dry, but the sauce was well prepared, it had just the right amount of citrus and capers and not overly sour or salty like most other places prepare it. The eggplant dish was awesome! Normally, the eggplant parmesan I get  is a little mushy, but it wasn't too dry or soggy here. 

What else can I say? I love this place.
