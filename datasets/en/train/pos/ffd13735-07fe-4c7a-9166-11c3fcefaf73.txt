The absolute must go bar in Tempe. Perfect for an afternoon drink with friends. Sit outside nestled in trees, blocked away from, but only a few feet from busy downtown Tempe. Perfect place to kick back, relax, and talk with friends. 
The atmosphere is very relaxed. The music is also a plus playing music spanning from independent artists to classic rock. 
If lunch is what you're looking for then look no further. Casey's has a terrific menu of sandwiches, appetizers, salads, and full meals. Famous for their oysters, Casey's is definitely not just your average bar. On that note it is also very laid back and very much so "every mans" bar. A strange paradox! Check it out! It's also haunted!
