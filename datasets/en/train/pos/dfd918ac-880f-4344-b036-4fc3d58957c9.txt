Easily the greatest bar in Phoenix, the Bikini has more moods than any other place I've been to.  Up for a quiet drink on a Tuesday evening?  The big booths, cheap drinks and incredible jukebox will keep you happy.  Want a completely packed place with an eclectic crowd?  Go to the Bikini on a First Friday.  

I've never seen a place where a more diverse crowd gathers to have a good time quite like the Bikini.  Gangsters, hipsters, drunks, yuppies...everyone is there and is seduced by the strong drinks and the miniscule dent it makes on your wallet.  $3 for a small pitcher of PBR?  $3.50 for a White Russian?  

One of my favorite places of all time.
