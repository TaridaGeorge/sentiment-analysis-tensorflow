We had the house pizza, well done, minus the green peppers. It was awesome. The beer list was great but the best part of the dinner was the bartender. Danielle was so nice to us and was really fun to talk with. She made the experience truly memorable. We'll come back not just for the pizza but to hang with Daniel again too.
