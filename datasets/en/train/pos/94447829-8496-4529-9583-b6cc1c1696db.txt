Fenix is the place to go! 

They now have a sushi menu and it is hands down the best sushi in the area! I went there the other day and I had the best Tuna that I have ever eaten, and the crab cakes are to die for, and don't forget the short ribs... actually everything I have had there has been great!

Also they have a great wine list =) 

Since they have recreated their menu the prices are excellent too, nothing was over $30 and the average price is $15-$20
