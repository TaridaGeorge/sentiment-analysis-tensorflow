Great and friendly service and even better food.  Everything is prepared on the spot and has a delicious home cooked taste.  Personal favorites: Gravlax, Schnitzel Cordon Bleu, and Pork Tenderloin.  At the same time I always try to order a new dish because all plates are phenomenal.  The portions are huge but I  suggest saving room for dessert because it's also fresh made and the type you only find at a European baker (especially the Pannacota with lime & berries).
