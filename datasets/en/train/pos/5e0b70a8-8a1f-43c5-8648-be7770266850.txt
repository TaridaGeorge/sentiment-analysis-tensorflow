Yep, 5 stars yet again Penske auto group.

After turning in my leased BMW and going back to Range Rover's I was sure upon SURE that I would be here rather frequently (those of you who have had a rover know what I mean ;) )

I must say, service at BMW was good but service at Land Rover..... unreal.

My service advisor, Mike D. is the man to see!

Breakdown of a service appointment... 

1. Drop car off for issue same day
2. Receive keys to badass new Infiniti or other awesome rental car
3. Pick car up in the afternoon fully detailed

How DOESN'T that suck?? 

Way to GO Penske!!!!
