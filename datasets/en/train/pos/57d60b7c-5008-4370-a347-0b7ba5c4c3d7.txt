I've lost count of how many shirts I've made here. My favorite is my "I like to shoot things" shirt, which was an idea in my head that the BrandX designers were able to put into pictures. I love their creativity and what they can come up with for a simple phrase. I only wish I had more creative ideas for them to make into shirts.
