Amazing authentic Lao/Thai food. Based  on years of eating in North Eastern Thailand and Laos, this  is as good as it gets.  The curries with pumpkin are exceptional.  The chicken "laap" is outstanding and the waiter kindly brings extra lettuce leaves to cup the "laap" in.  The sticky rice is hot, fresh and  served very "handily" (Pardon the pun).
Service is gracious and excellent. Soon Lao-Thai will have a beer/wine license and one need not travel to Laos to enjoy Lao beet along with  the best of Lao cuisine.
