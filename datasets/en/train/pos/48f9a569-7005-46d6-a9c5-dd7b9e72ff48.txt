Excellent restaurant! Made reservations for NY's eve, seated immediately. Service excellent. Food delicious. Lamb perfectly prepared. Enjoyed Daal soup & Naan. Several children with families present, welcomed. Had "dinner for 2", required "go boxes" so much food. Delightful people, food, and decor. Would definitely go back. Highly recommend.
