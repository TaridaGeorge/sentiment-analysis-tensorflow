OM mutha funkin G!!!!!!
This place is amazing. The food was spectacular, and the vibe was perfect. 
I had the market salad and for some reason I was craving pears so the waiter offered to add and it was utterly phenomenal. 

You have to get the sweet potato chips. perfectly crispy and delish. 

This place has it right. Good Job Herb Box. You will for sure see my ass there again!!! Guaranteed!!!!
