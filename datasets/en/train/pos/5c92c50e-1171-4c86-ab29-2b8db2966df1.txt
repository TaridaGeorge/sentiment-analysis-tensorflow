Watch for the opening of SOUL cafe....opening planned for end November 2011....as in Monday after thanksgiving...

SOUL cafe....a new dining destination by the owners of Heart and Soul cafe...let's do all we can to support them ....I can't hardly wait for them to open....just excited  for this new location as I know they have a reputation for outstanding cuisine.

Now hurry up and open will you....already craving your pancakes. Arrgh !

I may camp out by your front door the night before you open...you wouldn't do breakfast in bed would you ?..:-)
