Another "here I am, thanking you for this later" review that would make my mom absolutely pleased as punch to see.

The education is unmatched, the teachers are passionate, and I am so very proud of my vocabulary.

I didn't make any "lasting friendships" and I'm not really one to take advantage of nepotism, so I don't foresee any incredible networking opportunities stemming from my high school education, but I really got to experience some wonderful things at an appropriate age.

The most important factor of my education here was the integrated empowerment. This comes innately with most same-sex educations, but Xavier really encourages the girls to become strong women.

If I do have kids in the Phoenix area, they will go either here or to Brophy.
