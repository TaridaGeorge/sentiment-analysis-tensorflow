Can you give a pizza place 10 out of 5 Stars?!

Sauce can make or break the pizza and the Sauce at Nellos is incredible, Give me a Straw!!  This is hands down, the BEST pizza I have ever had.  I moved to San Diego 10 years ago and whenever I visit home, have to stop in.

Originally started as chicago style, crust is absolutely incredible.  Last time i was in they were also doing woodfired thin crust which was amazing as well.  Now I have to order 2 pizzas everytime I visit, 1 thick crust and one thin crust.

They really layer on the toppings too (super high quality stuff also) 

Hey Owners - how about opening in San Diego!!!!
