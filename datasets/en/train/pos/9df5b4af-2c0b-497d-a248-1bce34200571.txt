I LOVE soft and creamy Golden Spoon and luckily my family and friends feel the same way ;)  The peanut butter cup and heath bar are standouts and you can try the flavors in little cups first.  I like to get two flavors like Dutch Chocolate and Peanut Butter both in the same cup....thank goodness it's fat free and I can walk there to help offset the frequent visits.
