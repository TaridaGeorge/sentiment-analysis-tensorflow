I do not even know where to start with Cornish Pasty they have mastered the English food restaurant in this area. The ambiance is out of this world the food is to die for and the beer list is as good as it is long!. I have taken multiple parties here and enjoyed it every time. The Staff is possibly some of the coolest and most respectful and fun people i have ever have serve me and the owner will take the time to walk around and talk to you and his patrons. 5 Stars and that is a rarity!
