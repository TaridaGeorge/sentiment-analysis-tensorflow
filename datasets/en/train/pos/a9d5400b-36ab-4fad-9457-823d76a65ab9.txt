I love love love brunches! And this is definitely a must. The service is nice and friendly. A table for 2 is no wait at all but make sure to call in advance for larger parties.

Their european crepes is a must! It satisfied any crepe craving - top with berries and apples and more whipped cream...YUM. Their omelets are just as good. I liked their California omelet :) And if you have the room, their warm bread pudding. If you can't tell by now, I love desserts. Get creative and pick something different every time! This is an excellent choice for good ol' traditional American cooking.
