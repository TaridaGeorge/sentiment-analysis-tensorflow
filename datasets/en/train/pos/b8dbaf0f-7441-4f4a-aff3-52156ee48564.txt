This place is definitely as good as it gets in the west valley, but it is pretty close to as good as it gets all around. I really enjoyed this place ...and no more trips to Scottsdale. Yippeeee! This is my new favorite sushi place around. I have ate sushi fresh in Japan and Guam and this is as close as it gets to that. Other sushi places in Arizona don't really compare. :)
