Yes, there's a wait even on a Tuesday night but the wine bar next door was quaint and had some games (chess, checkers) for you to pass the time, along with drinks.

Enjoyed the level of thin-crustedness that the crust was.  Pizza was delicious.  My wife and I got the Biancoverde (Fresh Mozzarella, Parmigiano Reggiano, Ricotta, Arugula) and the Wiseguy (Wood Roasted Onion, House Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage).  Both were good, though we regretted it a bit after for eating so much.  Would definitely go back again.
