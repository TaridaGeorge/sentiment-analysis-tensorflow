I went back again of course for Happy Hip treats for my dog and ended up speaking with Jay. He was great. I am so happy I went back, it was like the 1st time I went. Super relaxed and not power selling. 
I am going to keep going back, hope I just dont run into that young girl, that follows me around like a hound.
