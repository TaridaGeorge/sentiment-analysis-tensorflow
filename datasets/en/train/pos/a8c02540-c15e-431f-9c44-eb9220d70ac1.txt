When I need a quick delicious bite to eat, I head out to Pei Wei Asian Diner.  I know that I will get quality food and excellent service.  I love the lettuce wraps here!  The Pei Wei spicy chicken is one of my other all time favorites.  It comes out with just the right amount of crispiness.  I have tried to duplicate this recipe at home and can never get it quite right!  It is much easier to head to the restaurant to have it served to me!  

My food always arrives very warm, and I usually find that this restaurant is clean.  These are two things that are very important to me.

If you have never tried this restaurant, you have been missing out!
