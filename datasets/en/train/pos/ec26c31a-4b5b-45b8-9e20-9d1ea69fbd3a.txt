My favorite bar in Scottsdale! Great selection of beers and the food is amazing. You can do healthy and have an excellent salad or go the other way and have one of their delicious pizzas. Also, the sandwich selection, especially the Italian, is so F'n good. The bartenders, Jess and Zack do beer blends as well so you never have the same beer twice. I usually grab a mixed 6 pack from the coolers in the back so I have an eclectic selection at home, too. Can't beat this place!
