Time for an update to my original review!

Since trying this place a few months ago, I have been back SEVERAL times (I am on my second Loyal Customer Card).  I seriously must get take out from here at least once a week.  The Chicken Pho is still scrumptious and delightful and I crave it quite often.  The staff is so friendly too!  Noodles Ranch is a gem in the desert so stop by and try them soon.
