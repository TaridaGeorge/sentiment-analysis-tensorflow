Loved it! Tucked away next to Tops Liquor is a little pizza place serving up piping hot slices of heaven. The pepperoni pizza was hot, cheesy, and tasty. Combine that with a side of hot wings covered amply with sauce and my friend &I had an excellent lunch. This was the perfect pizza! I'm glad she introduced me to Tessio's! For $10 we each had a slice of pizza and we shared the wings. Take that, Rachael Ray.

Seating is limited inside - just two tables. Most people appear to pick up or have it delivered. Either way, it was excellent.
