Robert's work shows his artistic passion!! I love my hair everytime he styles it! (not too often you can declare that!) Easy access off the 51 and Shea. His intimate salon is charming with loads of his personality. I recommend him to everyone. Beliefs and work ethics make him a honorable business man. Thanks Robert for all the joy you bring me.
