The best urgent care ive been to hands down. I Had gone in without a appointment and yet they got me in and out really quick. Nurses and doctors where really friendly too. They are open from 8am to midnight every night. Lol the cool thing was they had 22' inch plasma tv on each room and let you watch whatever you wanted. All went well and deffenetly will return.... "well at least I hope not" but if im hurt or somthing I will.
