My girlfriend and I went to Shimogamo for the first time tonight, and we were very impressed by its authenticity (proof: we were the only white people in there). The restaurant has a chic but casual feel, and the entire staff was super friendly from the get-go. The highlight was definitely the sushi. We've been accustomed to the overly fried and overly saucy sushi from over-hyped places like Ra and Sushi 101. The sushi at Shimogamo was made with fresher ingredients and was simply delicious in its own right (e.g. not drenched in sauce to cover just OK sushi). We can't wait to come back for happy hour! AND definitely try the "Crazy Surprise roll"...you'll be surprised by how crazy AWESOME it is!
