I found out about Cary's through a friend who has many cars. He also sells loans to dealerships, he has scene them all. I needed a place for my girlfriend to take her car and I'm glad we choose Cary's. He may be the most honest mechanic I have ever dealt with. I have since sent many people to him and all reviews are the same. This week I brought my car is for a 30,000 mile check up, after going over it he only recommended an oil change. He found other things that were going to need fixing but told me I had a few thousand miles to go. I have never heard that before, most of the time shops pressure you to get it done right away. Just a tip, make an appointment, word of mouth on this guy is huge, you won't regret it.
