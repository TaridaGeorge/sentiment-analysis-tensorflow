Went to Chuckbox yesterday with my dad; hadn't been there since the early '90's when I was a student at ASU. I don't think ANYTHING has changed there; and that's a good thing! Still the worlds best burger! Although I can't handle a great big one as easily as I did back in the day! 
I went to Smash Burger for the first time a few weeks ago and it's mighty good. My dad and I decided we had to make a trek back to Chuckbox to decide who has the best burger. We both agreed it's pretty much a tie. Different tasting burgers. VERY different environments; both outstanding!
My dad's comment was that Smashburger tastes 'corporate' and Chuckbox tastes homemade. 
If I had guests from out of town we'd go to Chuckbox every time!
