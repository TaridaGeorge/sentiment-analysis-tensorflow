Some people think there is better pizza to be had, and maybe there is, but for the plain cheese variety that reminds me of the East Coast the most, Buono's gets 5 stars. I always get my slices with extra pizza sauce on top because I like it sloppy!

I found this place not long after moving to the Valley in 1996 and have been eating here ever since. Sure the 2 slices and a coke lunch deal is now $5 (used to be $3) but what restaurant hasn't raised prices? This place hasn't changed a bit in 11 years, the walls are still plastered with the same NY flair (albeit with a few more Twin Towers) and sometimes there's even the typical grumpy old lady from NY behind the counter. Despite that it's consistently good and friendly.
