This was a great HIE to stay in while traveling through Sun City. The night clerk upgraded us to a suite when we signed up for the Preferred Club, and our room on the top floor was very pleasant.

Their workout facilities were a little less than stunning (an elliptical and a bike machine), but adequate. You get the breakfast downstairs, and that was nice.
