I love this place--- just walking through Red makes me feel like I am in a time warp.  It's so chic and cool.  I instantly needed a dirty martini (extra olives please!) and a ciggy.  

We found some really great pieces we liked that would work perfectly in our home.  And some we fell in LOVE with other stuff but have not purchased.  It is pricey but they are like pieces of fine art.  It is Eames-era heaven.  There is the most beautiful desk I have ever seen and other pieces that just left me in awe.  If this is your style, you need to go to Red.
