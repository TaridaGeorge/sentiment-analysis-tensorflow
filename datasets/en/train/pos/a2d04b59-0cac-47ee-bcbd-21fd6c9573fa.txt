Best of Philly in my opinion is hands down the Best Cheese Steak in the Valley.

They build sandwiches to your liking with fresh baked bread, lean steak grilled with olive oil and real American cheese. 

Yes the place is small, however the owner has a giant heart. He and his wife have stayed true to form and their passion for cleanliness and quality shines through with every menu item.

My business partner and I have made the pilgrimage to Best of Philly in Phoenix every week from Tempe for six years running.

Best of Philly experimented with a second location in Mesa; however, they sold that store off, so be sure to stick to the real deal and grab a coupon from the website.
