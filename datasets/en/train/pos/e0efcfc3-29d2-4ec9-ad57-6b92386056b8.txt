I work service industry and I know good service from great and this place takes the cake. The sushi is spot on every time and the servers can mix a mean drink. Together with their killef happy hour (and reverse on the weekend) Moira is worth the drive if you don't live downtown and a local jewel if you're a townie. I can't rave about it enough.
