I stopped in here last week because it is directly across from my dry cleaners. I was having friends over to meet mine and JD's new pup-pup and needed some white wine to serve along with the beers I already had. One of the proprieters was behind the counter and was extremely helpful in picking out just the right bottles for my price range and taste. She told me about the wine tastings that they have as well and that if you go-get there early because they fill up quick. I will definitely hit this place up again for help trying new wines instead of making a random guess at Albertson's.
