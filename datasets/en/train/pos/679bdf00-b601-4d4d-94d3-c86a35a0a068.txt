Time square is very small mom and pop type of restaurant! There is not a ton of seating inside but the food here is excellent! There always seems to be a wait at dinner time! They make a ton of unique dishes! If you like pasta, pasta seafood, and pizza this is your place! The pizza has excellent sauce and crust! Spaghetti and meat balls are delicious! Manicotti was scrumptious! Sandwiches are large and filling! I haven't found anything here I don't like here! They also carry a few unique beers that other restaurants don't carry!
