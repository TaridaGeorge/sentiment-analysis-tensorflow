Looking for an after dinner drink and a bit of relaxation try the Hyatt Regency at Gainey Ranch.

The music of Mosaico, playing flamenco guitar (using fingers to pic rather than a traditional plastic pic created a great sound) along with flute and flamenco dancers set a setting all too perfect under a star filled sky. The views of the mountains in the background weren't bad to look at either.
