Friend invited me here for lunch one afternoon. Being a science major/nerd I'd never wandered over to the side of campus Sacks is on- mistake #1 on my part. Mistake #2 not knowing about this place sooner! When we went they were having some trivia question game going on where you get a free drink if you got the answer right- I bet you can guess who got a free soda: THIS GIRL!

Ordered the Sacks Van Gogh- so tasty!
