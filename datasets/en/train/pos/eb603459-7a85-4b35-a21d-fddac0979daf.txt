There is nothing that I don't like about KUPD.  My husband finds it annoying that I come home and talk about them after listening for the day.  I'm sad when they go on vacation.  Good show.  Everyone compliments one another.  Chuck (top brass) you have a wonderful show on your hands.  Don't change a thing!!!
