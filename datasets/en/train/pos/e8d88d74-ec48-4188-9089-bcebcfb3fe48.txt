some wives come home with expensive shopping bags from the mall.  I come home with plastic bags filled with $2 and $3 dollar books from the used books sale section of the downtown library.  2-3 DOLLARS for hardcover books!  

I use their digital library alot and getting started had some technical difficulties that their staff was willing to go above and beyond to help me fix. 

Everytime I've had reason to speak with someone they were always nice and helpful.  I love this place.
