I have only been here once, and found it to be fun!  We went on a Monday, which has $4 burgers when you order a drink.  Being that it was also happy hour, I got a good sized burger with a big plate of fries (they will also substitute sweet potatoe fries for $1) and a large glass of sangria for a whopping total of $7.  Not bad for a dinner that totally filled me up!  Parking was a bit of a pain since the lot in front only has about 3 spaces, but we found street parking only about a block away.  I will deff be going back, though probably on Monday (just due to the prices!)  Enjoy!
