Went there last night with my daughter.  WHOA!  This place is fabulous!  Ask for Jordon as your server.  He's very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  I had the two corn tacos with tilapia.  Yummm!  Just the right amount of fish and veggies, and the flavoring couldn't be any better.  My daughter had the curry rice with grilled chicken.  Very large serving -- took most of it home to enjoy today.  (I think I'll eat it while she's gone.)  It had the right mix of spices and the chicken was grilled to perfection.  We also tried the chips and salsa.  Jordon said the salsa is spicy hot but could be toned down.  Since we both like hot, we said no to that suggestion.  He wasn't kidding!  It is hot!   I put it on my tacos, and it added just the right kick.
