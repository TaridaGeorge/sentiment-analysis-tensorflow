Came in for happy hour the other night. It wasn't too busy or crowded. The service was super attentive, felt a tad rushed by the server but no biggie. The Ahi Tuna salad was GREAT and priced well. Dressing was really tasty and tuna was perfect. They had quite a few happy hour drink deals. Definitely recommend!
