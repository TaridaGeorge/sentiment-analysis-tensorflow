I was VERY reluctant to try this neighborhood place because of the past reviews but I finally gave into my young, picky son who has been bugging me for weeks to check it out.

Wow - this was one of the best, tastiest burgers I've had since I can remember!!!  My caprese burger was fantastic and my son was thrilled with his bacon cheeseburger.  The buns are toasted just perfectly and the toppings were fresh and generous.  The staff was very friendly and the cook checked on us to see how our meal was.

I'm very excited to have such a great, inexpensive burger place right down the street.  We'll be back often - I'm on my way out the door to take my husband there for lunch right now!
