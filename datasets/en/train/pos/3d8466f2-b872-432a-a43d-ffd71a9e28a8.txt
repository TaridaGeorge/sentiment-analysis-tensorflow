Luv, luv, luv Joe's Real BBQ!!!  Great western decor, outstandingly delicious food, good old-fashion hospitality!  The menu is extensive because BBQ is not simply one taste.  The portions are generous and the prices are affordable.  The best part is one can feel the pride in everything the staff does, from greeting guests to serving diners to bussing tables.  They make the dining experience memorable leading to return patronage.  Like its brother restaurant, Joe's Farm Grill, the seating choice and decor makes one feel welcomed.  Thanks, Joe's Real BBQ, for making us want to eat with our hands!
