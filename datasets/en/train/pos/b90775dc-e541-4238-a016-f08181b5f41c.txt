Seriously awesome BBQ in a totally random place.  The ribs were unreal, seriously, fall off the bone, meaty deliciousness to the face.  Be prepared to wait for a little while before being seated, we came on a Tuesday night and had to wait for about 30 minutes, always a good sign that you're in for a treat.  I will definitely be back!
