I LOVE this pizza place. I am a natural fan of pizza. I love the avocado pizza, the gladiator, and just plain old ham pizza from here. The staff is friendly and easygoing. Pizza is to die for from here! It is a nice relaxed atmosphere if you go during a weekday for dinner (plus you can find parking easily). If you go on Friday or Saturday night be prepared to wait about 30-35 minutes for a table. The Sangria's are also very good here. Cannot wait to go back, awesome pizza.
