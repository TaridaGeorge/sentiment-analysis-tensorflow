I am so glad I found this place!! I just moved to Phoenix from Los Angeles with my 3 Pomeranian "babies". Even in LA I was having trouble finding a groomer I felt comfortable leaving them with. 

I immediately liked the atmosphere at Hug N Pups and had no problem dropping my babies off. The best part is, when I picked them up, they were happy and beautiful!
