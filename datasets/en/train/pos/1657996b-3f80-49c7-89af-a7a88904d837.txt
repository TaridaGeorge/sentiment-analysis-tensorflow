I was at my wits end by the time I got to this Best Buy. I was shopping for appliances for weeks and wasn't really satisfied with what I was finding. Then I met Andy, who works for Pacific Sales inside the Best Buy store. It was the cleanest and most organized appliance department I had seen yet. Andy answered all my questions, made recommendations and helped me narrow it down to specific models. The prices he offered were the best and all the items were in stock so I could get them delivered on my day off. NO OTHER COMPANY could do that. I'm so glad I went to see Andy. I was under budget, comfortable with my decisions and didn't feel like I was getting run over by some pushy salesman.
