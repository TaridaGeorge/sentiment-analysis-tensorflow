This is definitely one of our favorite restaurants! On top of the hill w/ a great view of the city. I think the best bargain is the Cowboy platter. For about $20 a person, you get ribs, steak, chicken, fish, fries, corn, and sides. Plenty of leftovers since you will be snacking on the Indian fry bread. The staff are always friendly and service is fast.

There is live entertainment and very family friendly. A great place to take out of town visitors.

I recommend making reservations if you want to sit by the window which has the best view.
