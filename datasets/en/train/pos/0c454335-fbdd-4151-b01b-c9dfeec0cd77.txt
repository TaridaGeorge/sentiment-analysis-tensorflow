I love this place.  Me and my roommate are regulars here (Marco and Ryan - the guy with the hat on all the time haha) and we love how we can walk like 2 minutes to get there.  The staff is great especially when they have Bryan back there cooking up the food.  They have great food for being a little dive bar.  Some nights are super dead, but there's usually a nice crowd on volleyball nights and friday and saturday.
