Had an amazing meal! We were seated right away, however, it was a Sunday night and it was 5:30pm. I ordered the trout, it was fantastic! My friends had the meatloaf, steak and ribs. All had great reviews. The desserts were equally as fabulous! Service was great. Only complaint, it was too dark in the restaurant. I will go back!
