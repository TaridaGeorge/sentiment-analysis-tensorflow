I give this place 5 stars because I don't know of any other places with good Philly cheese steak sammiches. Their cheese steak with whiz is great as is the chicken Reuben cheese steak. There is also a good amount of meat in their sandwiches and the bread is soft and fresh. I personally think the regular size is enough for me. I love their fry sauce and their sweet potato fries. Their regular fries are not anything to get excited about though. Prices are decent and the service is quick as well
