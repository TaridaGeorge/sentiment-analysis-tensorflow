Rent a Tomcar - awesome experience!!!  Best offroad fun you can have with the family short of dirt bikes or fourwheelers.  Drove on the road to Tonto National Forest - plenty of trail riding to do.

I would HIGHLY recommend renting for the day, as 4 hours goes by way too quick.  We got back 30 min. late but they didn't charge us.  Can't wait to do this again next year!!!
