UltraStar offers a great option for something fun to do.  I love how comfy the seats are- you can actually enjoy watching a movie without being crammed and you can order an adult beverage!  Their specialty popcorn is delicious and I rather enjoy their hotdogs.  I recommend this new spot for locals looking for a new spot to enjoy a flick.
