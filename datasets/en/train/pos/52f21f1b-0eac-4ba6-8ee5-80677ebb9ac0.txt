Absolutely amazing.  I love that their flavors change yet they keep some of the classics, like the real mint.  It truly tastes like you're chewing on a mint leaf!

My first time here I had a two scooper of mint and lavender ice cream.  Absolutely amazing. I promptly announced I wanted my birthday cake to be from there with their mint and lavender ice cream. 

Sadly, that was months away at the time, and when my birthday came around, they weren't making the lavender anymore.

Hubs had a guiness and caramel two scooper... and he loved it too.  This is just a great place for gourmet ice creams.

A cool note is that the labels for the ice creams will tell you if they are gluten free, dairy free, sugar free...
