It was an awesome experience. My wife and I had one of our best meals of our life. She had Lamp chops, I had Salmon Kebab. My wife is lamb eater. She said it was the best Lamb chops ever. So was my Salmon Kebab. Owners were very friendly as was our service. I would give more stars if it was available.
I am taking my in laws there soon.
