Ahh I LOVE Ted Baker.

Great clothes and accessories, fun and courteous staff, all and all a great shopping experience. 

I need to lose weight to fit into more of their clothes but at least I can still buy their accessories. My boyfriend also loves this store, great suits and shirts. This is definitely a trendy place to shop but they have a ton of classic items that are fine for multiple seasons. 

They are right next door to Barney's and use their tailoring service. 

Keep in mind Nordstrom has a deal with Ted Baker so some items are less expensive at Nordstrom than this store -- but it's not much, like $10-$20.
