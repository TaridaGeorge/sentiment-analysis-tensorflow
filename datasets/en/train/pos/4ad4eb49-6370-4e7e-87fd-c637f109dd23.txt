The variety of gelato and sorbetto flavors here is amazing! I love the blueberry, mango, strawberry, and strawberry lemonade sorbettos. Yum! Gianduia is one of my favorite gelato flavors there. If you love Nutella like I do, that is for you. They have interesting flavors too like black sesame and taro. The taro is actually really good if you like taro.
