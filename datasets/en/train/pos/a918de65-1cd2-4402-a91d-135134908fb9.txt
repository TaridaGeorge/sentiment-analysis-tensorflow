I enjoyed my time at The Moon. My Brother and I hung out here for HH and it is great! According to my Brother it's "Fogey". He was interested in the ladies. However, I am sure knowing that we were together, the ladies may not have known we are siblings. Awesome HH specials both the drafts and the sliders. I will definitely be back. Surprising that they do so well with the neighboring competition, but the bar hoping was fun. Christmas Eve was slow, empty; yet expected for the holidays. Yes, I had to explain this to my Brother. He was disappointed. (Throwing him under the bus, but helping to hook him up!) :)

Amanda our server/Waitress was great!
