So sad.. I stopped by Mills'  End this morning on the way to work... I loved this spot.. Chai, wifi, delectable crepes, made on a crepe stone and comfy seating...
As I approached the coffee shop, I saw the Members of the family owned business stacking chairs and boxing up... 
So sad! Another local spot is closing... You will be missed greatly!
