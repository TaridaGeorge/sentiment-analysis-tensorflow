Six stars for this Costco!  Costco rocks as a general matter, but man, this is one great Costco!  They have a killer selection, better than the average Costco, and they really shine in wine, liquor, and cheese.  Plus, they have a great car wash.  Take the awesomeness of Costco, stir in a bit of Scottsdale fanciness, and you have the makings for a warehouse shopping destination that is frankly worth driving to even if it's not the nearest Costco to you.
