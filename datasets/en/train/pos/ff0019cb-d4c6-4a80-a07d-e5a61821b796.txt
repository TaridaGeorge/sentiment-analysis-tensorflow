The paletas are absolutely delicious! From the first bite, you know that they use fresh ingredients. The pineapple paleta is very fresh and not artificially sweet. The pecan paleta is a surprise. You can definitely taste that the pecans were roasted to perfection. 

It was my first time here and the guy working at the shop was very helpful. He explained to us the process of making the paletas we got and answered my questions about some of their paletas. 

Highly recommended. With less than $3 for each paleta, it definitely beats going to any of the frozen yogurt stores on Mill.
