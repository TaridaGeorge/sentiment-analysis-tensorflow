Simply the best (non-tart) frozen yogurt in the world!  Okay, that might be a little hyperbolic, but it's certainly the best I've ever had.  Golden Spoon trumps TCBY, Miss Karen's, and all other fro-yo competitors - perfectly light and creamy at the same time, with the most delicious flavors, and the best variety anywhere!  Mounds Bar, Cookies 'n' Cream, Heath Bar, Peanut Butter Cup, Espresso, Winter Mint, Cake Batter...the flavors are just fantastic!  I like that they have many sizes, although I inevitably end up taking home 3 or so larges for the week.  I guess what I'm trying to say is...I'm addicted to Golden Spoon!  Ah, it feels so much better getting that out there in the open.
