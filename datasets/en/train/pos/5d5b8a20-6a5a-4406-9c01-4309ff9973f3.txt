Okay I have grown to love this spot!!!
 ** I am in a good and stable relationship with the Beach Club sub right now!!! 
 :) The dynamic combination of Turkey, provolone, avocado, lettuce, tomato and sprouts with added hot peppers and super light mayo!!! 
********Oh soo delicious!!! **********
PLUS!!! The staff working here is oh soo nice!!! Maybe the last time that I came here I over analyzed the place, which I sometimes do!! So I apologies for my previous review, I now know where you guys place your napkins and I'm no longer feeling pressured to make a fast order!! 

See ya around!!! :)
