I love Go Kat Go! They are always friendly, have great items for sale and it just feels great looking through the shop. I got my awesome retro diner style table there. It wasn't an "antique" or original, but it look great and seems as good as new still since almost 2 years ago when I bought it. They even held it for me for almost 2 weeks until I actually was moving into my new home.
