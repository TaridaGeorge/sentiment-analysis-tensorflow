"Never judge a book by its cover". This is one of those small gems that people might not give a 2nd look. It's a free standing building that has had its share of restaurant tenants. If a buddy hadn't told me about Luu's, I might never have spotted it. The food is cooked fresh, and it is GOOD! Chicken and beef dishes are my favorites. Very casual, fast food ambiance, but definitely dine-in restaurant quality. Tam and Christy are very friendly. There is a convenient drive-thru, also. CHECK IT OUT!
