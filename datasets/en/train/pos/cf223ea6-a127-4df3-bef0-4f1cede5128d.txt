Hands down the BEST Gelato in the country, or in most countries I imagine. I have had Gelato in Italy and this place is better!  No exaggerations. The flavors are VERY consistent. If you have one flavor and then go back 6 or 12 months later, it will be just as you remember. Presentation is excellent and you can have as many tastes as you wish before you order. If you go, try the Fruits of the Forest flavor. :)
