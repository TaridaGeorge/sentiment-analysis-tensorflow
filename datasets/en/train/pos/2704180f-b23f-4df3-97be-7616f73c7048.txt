$19.99 All-You-Can-Eat + Happy Hour = Awesome!
Happy Hour is M-S 11:30-2:30 and M-Th 5-7 where a good list of rolls are half off!!
Pancho (head sushi chef) is super nice and personable. The food/sushi has been consistently good and of great quality.
It's definitely one of the best sushi places with an all-you-can-eat sushi option in the Phoenix area.
