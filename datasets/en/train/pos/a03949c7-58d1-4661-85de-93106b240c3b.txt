I am giving them 5 stars. 
Why? The main reason is because I have a gluten allergy and when I told the cook that I needed them to be careful about what my food touched he HAPPILY took the time to completely clean and scrape off the entire grill for me so that I wouldn't have an allergic reaction to anything left on the grill. Yes! THAT is customer service. 

The portions are wonderful, the ingredients are fresh and the price is unbeatable. For $10 a person you get a HUGE bowl of stir fry, rice, soup, wonton chips and dessert. 
Bottom line: this place kicks way too much ass.
