Have been to the buffet twice for dinner and every time i leave totally satisfied with everything that is offered. I actually wish i could fit more in my stomach. The chefs do a wonderful job and have a exceptional variety from around the globe. Service is also top notch and pleasant. Cant wait to go back.
