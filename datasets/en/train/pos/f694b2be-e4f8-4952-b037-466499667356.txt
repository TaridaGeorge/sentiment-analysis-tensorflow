Okay.. my second time to Thai Spices..  No complaints on anything.  This place appears new, clean and the staff is friendly and attentive. The chicken satay is tender with just the right amount of spice.  Pad Thai, calamari salad all very very tasty.  The star of this meal was the Tom Ka soup.  OMG I swear it was the yummiest soup I have ever tasted.  Full of flavor, lots of meat and vegies and the presentation of course was excellent.  That flaming hot pot just made me smile, the soup made me moan!  Oh and the peanut sauce, I could just drink it from the bowl.
