Kick ass fries.   No more McCrappy meals for me ever again!!!

Went through the drive through, got my food and started driving away. Started to eat the fries and went "hmmm something different about them".  They were perfect! Potatoes, oil, salt, that's it. Not the tiniest bit of grease on my hands or the bag and cooked perfectly.

The burger was the best fast food burger I have ever had, seriously.  Again, they keep it simple.  Toasted bun, tasty meat and not greasy at all. How'd they do that?

People, next time you need fast food, and I know you all eat it don't lie, go here and see for yourself.   The chains are crap, this place does it right, and it's a cool find your friends don't know about.
