You know that scene in Fast Times at Ridgemont High where Jeff Spicoli takes one of his Vans off and hits himself on his head? Well that's what I did when I went to this place for the first time.   Why haven't I been coming here for the last 10 years, this place is great!!!  

I would say this is the best non-Pizzeria Bianco/Cibo pizza in the valley.  The crust is awesome, sauce and cheese just perfect!

The really impressive part is is how picture perfect the pizzas are made.

The lobster ravioli were huge, easily enough for two.  Baked Ravioli's were better that average but needed more basil or something.

You really can't dine here, so it's take out or delivery.  They have one table and a few other seats inside if you had to eat here I guess you could.
