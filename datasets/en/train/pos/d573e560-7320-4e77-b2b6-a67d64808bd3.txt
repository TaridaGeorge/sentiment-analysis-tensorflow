4th year for this event and it only gets better. Amazing food vendors, all local from Chandler, wonderful beer, wine and spirits. They closed down the event at capacity which allowed everyone to enjoy the event, shorter lines etc. a great experience and just remember to pre-sale your tickets for next year so you can get in.
