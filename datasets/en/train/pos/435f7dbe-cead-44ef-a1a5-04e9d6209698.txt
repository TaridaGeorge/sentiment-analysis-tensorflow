So, I am salivating as I write this....

I usually get the red or green curry, here, both of which are amazeballs.

My bf usually gets the Cashew Chicken.

This is just...the best. The flavors are amazing! So much so...and I'm embarrassed to type this --- We drink the broth. Literally. I used to order extra rice and mix it all up...but why bother?

Their lunch specials are fanastic! You get soup, a little vegetable roll and an entree for 6.95. 

Oh, word to the wise: Unless you can handle it, order a 0, or a 1 spice level. I'm serious. You aren't tough. Thai Hot is different than Mexican Food or Indian Food hot. This is serious.

Other than that, go and enjoy.
