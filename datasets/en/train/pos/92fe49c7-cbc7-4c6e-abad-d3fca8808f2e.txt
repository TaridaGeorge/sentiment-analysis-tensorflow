Sorry for the late review - been doing other races and just now am collecting my thoughts.  Good: flat course, on-time start, HUGE on-course support, fun fans along the course including those offering beer.  Great transportation options to the start line.  Lots and lots of food options at the finish line plus a few hundred places to buy a cheeseburger 200 hundred yards after the tape.  Sorry that the taco guys aren't there anymore but what the hell?  One of the best R "N" R races.
