My school has held our alumni events at Bombero's multiple times over the past couple of years and have never been disappointed!  They have amazing food (especially good appetizer options for group events), the wine selection is wonderful, and the service is the best I've had in Phoenix, hands down.  The owner, Kristi, is incredibly responsive and flexible in setting up events and their patio is the perfect venue for a group.

I've always had phenomenal service at Bombero's but there is one server, Tim, who you should ask for - he is friendly, quick, and has an amazing memory!  Your order will definitely be right with him!

This place is great all-around - for group events or just for a casual dinner.
