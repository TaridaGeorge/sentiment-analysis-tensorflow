I went here with my boyfriend recently on a Tuesday night. There was a twenty minute wait, but the waiting area is cute and comfortable and the host served us wine and checked up on us periodically. The restaurant is trendy and romantic. Food was amazing!! I love that the plates are meant for splitting, but still generous in proportion and well priced. The service was outstanding, everyone was very nice and the food came out quickly. This is the best restaurant I have found so far in Phoenix. Just know that the restaurant is quite small, so parking is limited and there may be a bit of a wait on weekends. Well worth it!!
