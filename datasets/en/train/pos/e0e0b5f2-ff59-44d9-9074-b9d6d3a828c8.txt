Always have had a good experience at Zest, but it has been several months.  From the soothing urban comfort atmosphere, to the warm friendly servers to the expertly cooked food - give this place a try.  Items of note - eggplant cheesecake and shrimp goat cheese melt...I'm a sucker for anything with goat cheese, but was really impressed.  The salads tossed for you right at your table and served with cranberries orange and nuts are outstanding.  The citrus glazed chicken was outstanding as well.  The wine list was pretty comprehensive and had some of my favorites, incl. Cakebread....For dessert try the mocha cappucino creme - you won't regret it.
