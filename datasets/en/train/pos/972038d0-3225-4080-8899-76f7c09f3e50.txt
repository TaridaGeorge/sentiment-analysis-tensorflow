Everytime I visit Pita Jungle I am always surprised at the quality of the food.  I love the hummus, rice, and really everything on the menu!  The only negative thing I could ever say is that it is very loud at lunchtime.  A suggestion would be to have individual water pitchers at each table-and throw some cucumbers in the water~:)
