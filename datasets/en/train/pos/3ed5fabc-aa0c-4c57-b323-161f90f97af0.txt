We are a vegetarian family and while this restaurant also has a wide variety of meat dishes, they are always more than accommodating to our needs. The folks who work here are so friendly and helpful. They clearly enjoy their restaurant as much as we do.
Don't forget to ask for the spice rack! Yum. 
This restaurant is so clean and pretty, a special place to take a break from cooking dinner during the week to come and relax. The vegetable soup is especially satisfying during the recent cold snaps we've been experiencing. Nothing quite like a nice hot bowl of delicious soup on a rainy day. The pot of green tea and/or jasmine tea is a perfect way to stay warm! 
Awesome curry and tofu!
I hope you're in the hood for a long time Lao Thai! I'll be visiting often.
