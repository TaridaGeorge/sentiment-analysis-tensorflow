After driving to Phoenix from Minneapolis, I was in desperate need of a new set of tires. A friend recommended this location as being very good. I agree. I had several and complicated requests to be done to my vehicle, and the gentleman assisting me (even with a line of customers waiting to be served) waited to fully understand what was being asked of him. He did understand, and he even gave me a discount on labor costs. Customer service was excellent, and when I waited longer than the quoted time, he completed the work himself in order to fulfill our agreement. I have worked in the tire industry in the past, and I will return to this location.
