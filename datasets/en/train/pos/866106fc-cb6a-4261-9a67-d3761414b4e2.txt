So it's been about 6 months at Maximum Pilates and I love it. Pilates has changed my life and how I carry myself. When I have to leave town, I miss it. Heather and Jessica are great instructors and the studio is so welcoming. If you're looking to get started in Pilates, I would highly recommend Maximum Pilates.
