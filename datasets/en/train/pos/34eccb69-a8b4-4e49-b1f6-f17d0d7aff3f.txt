I love, love, LOVE this location. In all the Frys I've been to, the customer service here and food selection can't be beat.
You are always greeted by someone when you walk in the door. I always go to Fry's late in the day so the same lady is there greeting customers. They have expanded their Organic/Natural Food selection which I think is fantastic, aswell as offering more produce (I wish they're organic section was a little bigger, but I understand that alot of people aren't on the organic bandwagon yet). The only time I have gotten not so nice customer service is right before closing, which I can undersand, these people want to go home! The store underwent remodeling and you can tell it was for the better. It is always clean, staff is always nice and helpful, and it is just overall a great place.
