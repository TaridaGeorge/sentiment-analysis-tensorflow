A moment for a brief political commentary. I kept thinking as I walked/climbed up this thing, "Man, this is red-state awesome!" I am originally from New England - if this mountain were in the middle of Boston, it would have concrete steps to the top with handrails on both sides, or more likely just an aerial tram and multiple laws forbidding anyone from ascending. But here in AZ, where life is cheap and the political ethic is - you're on your own, hombre! - this thing is amazingly gnarly, with lots of really fun ways to come close to killing yourself. I absolutely love the relative wildness of this route; the perfect antidote to a day in the cubicle!
