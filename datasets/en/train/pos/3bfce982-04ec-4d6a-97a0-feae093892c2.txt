I went to Ticoz this weekend for brunch and really enjoyed myself.  I had the french toast sticks which came with bacon, and I was told that it also came with strawberries and raspberries.  Well, holy cow....the "strawberries and raspberries" were really the star attraction of this meal.  The fruit was served as a parfait in a large wine glass.  A base of granola, topped with the berries, then topped with a VERY generous serving of fresh whipped cream!  Yum-O!  I hardly touched the french toast after eating my parfait.  I would order this one on its own!

Also, for brunch, they have mimosas and bloody mary's for two dollars.  What a steal!

Head to Ticoz for your next brunch, you won't be disappointed.
