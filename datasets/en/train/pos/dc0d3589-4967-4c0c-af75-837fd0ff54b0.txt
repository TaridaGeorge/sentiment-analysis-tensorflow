I really enjoyed coming to this place. Stopped here in the evening for a late dinner. I loved the patio area, indoor dinning, and how the bar was separated. The service was great and so was the food. They do have a somewhat small selection than most restaurants, but all places vary. I will definitely be coming back here.
