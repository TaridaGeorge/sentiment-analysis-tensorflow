I met Tom the owner about 6 years ago.  There is a computer store next door.  I had to get my laptop repaired and decided to check the place out.  I work in the restaurant industry and I almost don't want to post this to keep it all to myself but the prices are unbelievable.  Meaning in a very great way.  

Go see them!  Do not go to another grocery store or the corporate big houses ever again!
