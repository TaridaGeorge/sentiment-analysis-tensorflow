This place is groooovy!!

We came here on a Sunday afternoon. It was slightly busy and kind of confusing. You order your food at the counter and then find a seat after they call your name out (during the day, not sure about the evening). We order the margarita pizza and it was bomb! Our friend has the BLT and it looked pretty good....she had no complaints. I had the potato salad and it was freaking delicious. Maybe I was smitten by the groovy atmosphere, but I love this joint.
