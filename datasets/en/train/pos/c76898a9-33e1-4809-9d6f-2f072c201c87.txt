So many negative reviews!  I just recently moved and got a raise so I went for a little spree.  Got myself a new suit and what can I say, Cynthia in the Men's Wear Department really knows how to put a tie with a shirt with a suit.  Extremely helpful and offered plenty of recommendations.  Got some new cologne, bath towels, and I was set.  Important to note that there are always great deals abound, so unless you're looking for a Hugo Boss suit at Neiman Marcus or Nordstrom this is the place to be for designer brands at a bargain!
