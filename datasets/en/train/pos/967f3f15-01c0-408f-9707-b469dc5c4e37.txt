Seriously - some of the nicest people own, work or go to this pub. The food is decent - especially their pizza and wings. I love their jalapeno cheese curds. One of the few establishments that still respects the tradition of Fish Fry Friday!  I appreciate their regular entertainment nights and food specials.  Everything is priced well, so what is not to love?
