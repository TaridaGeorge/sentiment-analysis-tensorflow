Go figure -- worldly sushi in Gilbert?? This place is quickly becoming one of my favorites. Have been here three or four times since it opened. 

Susan takes good care of you at the bar, suggesting all kinds of crazy drinks and food and will even arrange to have a staff member give me a foot massage when dining.  Well, haven't asked for the latter. 

And I like crazy.  So the escolar, the quail eggs, uni are all up my alley. Same with the exotic "Susan-concocted drinks" like cantaloupe martinis or cucumber martinis made with sake and cucumber vodka. Oh, and have Jay make you a sake shot with a Kumomoto oyster, Uni and quail egg. :)
