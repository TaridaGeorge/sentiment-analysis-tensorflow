Got 3 different bids for a big yard work job. Urias was the lowest bid. Sometimes I am a little hesistant about going with lowest bidder, but this time it worked out perfectly.They actually exceeded our expectations. Our yard has never looked so good and so cleaned up. There was a minor miscommunication regarding the grass growing under the trees, but other than that it was 100% perfect. They also fixed our sprinkler heads and our drip system, in addition to all the tree pruning and yard clean-up.
