uhm, this is the most amazing library i have been to, to date. it is simply ridiculous!!!! well organized, huge selection, TONS of seating and study carrels... this place is a bookworm's DREAM. 

beautiful sections dedicated to kids, teens, etc.... and did i mention that media rentals are FREE!?!?!?! (socal libraries CHARGE you for cd and dvd rentals!) they have a great new books section, as well as tons of copies of new and highly requested books. simply divine.

the husband and i happened upon it early one saturday morning... and come to our surprise to find a HUGE line/crowd of people waiting for the doors to be opened!!! well... we soon realized why. 

we will obviously be making this a regular spot... and i may even spend more saturday mornings here! love!!!!
