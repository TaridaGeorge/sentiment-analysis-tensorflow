Wow, what a 5 star resort. I've come here in the past to enjoy the great lobby area for drinks & always knew it's a great place but we booked a room for fathers day weekend on special $150/ night with a $50 credit to use on the property. The pool is awesome & the kids loved it. It's so big with so many areas, they have a lazy river, slide, kid play area & several pools with tons of chairs. The service is great & they have these great tacos at the taco stand. They had free s'mores at night & lots of grass areas for the kids to play. Even a garden with real vegetables growing. I love this place.
