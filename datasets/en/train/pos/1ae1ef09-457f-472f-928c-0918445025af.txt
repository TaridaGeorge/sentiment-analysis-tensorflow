Shady's is my Cheer's. 
They play movies like Teen Wolf and A Christmas Story.  The jukebox is hot with swinging tunes and rocking punk.  They have one pool table.  Rounded booths, patio for you smokers and these fun grey leather chairs in the middle.  I swear it's where Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin would get a nightcap.  I love you Shady's!
