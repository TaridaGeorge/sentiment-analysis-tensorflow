Went here for lunch today with a colleague, and I have to say this was the sweetest lunch break! This old house is charming!  

If you love sandwiches made from the most amazing biscuits-made on the property by the owner, desserts that are decadent, tea that soothes the soul, this place is for you! Their 'high tea' is worth looking into, which I do plan to experience when the weather cools.

Every bite was delicious, and I felt so relaxed and refreshed, and a little sad to leave this treasure today, but look forward to the return!
