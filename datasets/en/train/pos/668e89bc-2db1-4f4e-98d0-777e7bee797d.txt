Probably the best restaurant I've found in Glendale.  It is a nice change of pace from the chain restaurants in the area.  I've been here 4 or 5 times since I moved here and always had the same thing.  I keep telling myself I'll eat something other than the empanadas, tamales, and arepas; but they're so good that I can't stop myself from ordering them.  

I wasn't very impressed with the ceviche.  You get a huge serving of it, but there was way too much acidity for my taste.  

The restaurant is small, and service isn't very fast.  But it's owned by a husband and wife with the husband taking care of the front of house and the wife cooking, and they are super nice.  I will definitely be back!
