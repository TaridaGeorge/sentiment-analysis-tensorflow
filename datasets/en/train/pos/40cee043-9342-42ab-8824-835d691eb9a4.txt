We opened up a savings account here about eight months ago with an insurance settlement that we had received from a car accident.  This was our first joint account after getting married about a year ago.

After being given the runaround from another bank when trying to set up a joint checking account, we came back to Desert Schools and talked with our personal banker.  We both had Visa Debit Checking Cards within five minutes of coming inside the bank.  Literally five minutes.

I'm going to be a Desert Schools customer for life.
