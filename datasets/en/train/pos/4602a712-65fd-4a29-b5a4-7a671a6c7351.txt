My & my husband's favorite restaurant! We love happy hour with discounted prices on our favorite appetizers - the turtle soup is amazing!  We recently got shrimp san remo but not during happy hour - I hope it's on the HH menu because it is great! My husband's favorite dinner entree is the stuffed lobster. I've had one or two of the scallop entrees which were delicious although there was not a lot of food. I got the Ahi tuna once (which is my FAVORITE fish) but it was REALLY thoroughly cooked which was very disappointing - I didn't say anything though and I'm thinking that they probably would have been happy to redo the dish for me had I said anything. The staff is always delightful. Also, the fish is super-fresh - they fly everything in each day. Yum!
