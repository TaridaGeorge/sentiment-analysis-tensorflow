Went to LoLo's today for lunch.  Oh my!  Everything we had was good.  I had a fried chicken breast, waffle and mac'n'cheese.  My husband is from the south and he said the mac was as good as his grandmother's.  I hear she was a good cook.  Definitely not for those who are on a diet.  We'll be back - soon!
