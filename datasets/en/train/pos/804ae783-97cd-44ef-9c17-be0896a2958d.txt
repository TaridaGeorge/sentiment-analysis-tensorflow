people eat at the grapevine?
the only people i know go to the grapevine for karaoke and drinks.
the "host" with his fiddle is priceless.  it's especially great when you don't even know it's coming and he just joins in your song!
this place is great - the people watching is amazing ... especiially mr. dancing queen (he shows up late!)

highly recommended ... just dont take our table! :)
