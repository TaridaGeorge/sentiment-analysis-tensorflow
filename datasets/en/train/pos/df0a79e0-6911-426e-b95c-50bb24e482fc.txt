This is the store of all gourmet food stores.........maybe rivals and beats out Dean & DeLuca in NYC.  Paradise Valley was my fave location..  I mean, AJ's is one TOP NOTCH gourmet food store.....definitely beats out Gelson's in Southern Calif. (and I really like Gelson's).  AJ's has one of the most comprehensive wine collections anywhere.  Their bakery and prepared food counters are outstanding.  The fruits and vegetables are almost too pretty to touch, and yes, EVERYTHING has a huge price to match its stellar quality.  It's just so PRETTY to feast one's eye's on all the delectable things they have to offer.  I haven't been since leaving AZ, and I sure do miss it.  When I return, though, you can be sure AJ's is on my list of things to visit/see/do.
