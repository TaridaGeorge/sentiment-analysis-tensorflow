For some reason, this particular location is better than others.  I think it may be due to the fact that it's a very busy location and they've got their system for serving a ton of people down like a well oiled machine.  Our food is consistent here...always tastes the same and cooked perfectly.  Service is great.  We don't go to Olive Garden anymore unless it's this particular one.
