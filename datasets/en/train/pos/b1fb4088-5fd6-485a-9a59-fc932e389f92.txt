I've been going to this Zia for 15 years. Yes, I know. It used to be on 7th and Indian School.  
Growing up in a lower middle class family, Mom's suggestion to us if we wanted to get new music was to trade in old. And we did. I remember doing the math. If I traded in 4 CD's, I could afford to get 3 used CD's. Not a bad return. 
Since they moved, they got to expand a touch. They now have a METAL section, which is brutal. No more thumbing through Brittney Spears or Kenny Chesney when I'm looking for some heavy shit. 
Customer service is always top notch. The customer rewards card is cool. You accumulate points just for purchasing. 
A nice place to get CD's, DVD's, and even VHS.
