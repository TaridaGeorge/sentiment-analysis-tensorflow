LOVE LOVE LOVE.  Fantastic coffee shop with fantastic atmosphere.  The staff plays great music!  the best part about sola is the fact that the staff seem like they actually want to be there too.  I find at other coffee shops (places in general) that the employees are simply counting down the seconds till clock-out.  Here, the staff seems like they enjoy the coffee shop, its patrons and are proud of it. Just great. 

I am a huge fan of the Turkish brewing method they offer here.  They use cardamom as well and its absolutely fantastic.  I love trying new places as often as I can but I keep coming back to Sola because I crave their Turkish style coffee. 

I don't know why anyone would pick the Starbucks in Old Town when Sola is just a few blocks up!
