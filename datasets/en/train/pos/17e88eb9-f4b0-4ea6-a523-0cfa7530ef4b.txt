GREAT FOOD! Petite cafe tucked along the southwest corner of the Safeway shopping center at Tatum and Greenway. It's very simple and unpretentious, and you could easily overlook its presence. Upon walking in the door, you are greeted by very friendly proprietors and, whoooosh -- a  remarkable wave of aroma and flavor in the air! 

I have ordered food from TCF several times now -- My favorite selection is the chicken taquitos that are served open-faced with tasty minced chicken and spices accompanied with a flavorful green salsa! The taquitos with the TCF salad are a delicious pair for a light and healthy meal!
