Total Wine is amazing. Fantastic selection and prices, helpful staff and a nice ambiance for such a big store. They hold wine tastings on the weekend and offer some good education on wines and wine pairings at said events. I have tried many good wines there, but I highly recommend the Albino Armani Valdadige Pinot Grigio.
