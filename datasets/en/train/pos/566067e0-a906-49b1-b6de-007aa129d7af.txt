This is for Saguaro course. Golfweek says this is the #1 public course in Arizona so when i came down for Thanksgiving i had to check it out. We got there with plenty of time to warm up and hit some balls on the range. The range balls and the range itself was great. There are a few really long par 4's but they counter back with a few really short ones. There was a par 5 around 600yds. There was nothing to complain about. We where the 2nd group out and it was cart path only and we finished in 4 hours.
