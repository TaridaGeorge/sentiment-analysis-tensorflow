We walked in and were surprised to be personally greeted and offered assistance.  When we told the young lady that we were there to have some key copies made, she directed us to the back of the store, and as we were walking we heard her call to alert the key cutter guy that we needed some help.  He met us at the back counter immediately and was super pleasant and fast!  Thanks Ace Hardware for wonderful service - it was so wonderful not having to run out to the usual big boxes.  We were in and out in less than 5 minutes :)
