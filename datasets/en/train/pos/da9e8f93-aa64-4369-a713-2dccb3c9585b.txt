This place is fairly new and right around the corner from me. I ordered the won ton soup as usual. It was excellent. Then the cashew nut with chicken. Requested 4 out 5 on the hot scale and was not hot at all. So if you like hot go higher then 5. My wife got the pineapple fried rice. It was ok. Not my favorite fried rice. But what throws them over the top is they have Pepsi. Not Coke.
