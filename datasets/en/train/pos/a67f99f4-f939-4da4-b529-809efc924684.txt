I felt the need to sign up for Yelp just to write this review for Hillstone. In the hokey world of Phoenix / Scottsdale Arizona it was refreshing to walk into a restaurant and not feel like you were in a scene from "Hey Dude". The food albeit nothing surprising was great. The service staff may have beem a bit too friendly for a person used to the Big City, but it was welcoming. All in all enjoyable visit.
