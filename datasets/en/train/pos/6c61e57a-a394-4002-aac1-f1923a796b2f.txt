Heard about this place at work and decided to check it out for lunch. The customer service and hospitality was awesome, not to mention they gave me complimentary beef patties while they prepared my order. The oxtails with rice n peas was on point! Oh yeah, their prices are soooo much more reasonable than the other caribbean restaurants I have visited.

 I only paid like 6 bucks for my meal versus the $12 ones I am used to. Great Reggae music and comfortable atmosphere. I even watched some crazy dance hall videos on their flat screen. 

The owner invited me to an after- hours party that they do on Fridays with a live DJ, I will definitly attend. Great place to be only less than 2 weeks old. MY personal experience was awesome.
