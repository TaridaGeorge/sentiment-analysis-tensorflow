Fantastic place and huge!  Amazed at all the instruments from around the world, history and the beautiful sounds they make- the audible guided tour throughout is fabulous!  The section where you can try some select instruments is wonderful.  Kids will love this place, our daughter and her friend did not want to leave.  Enjoy!
