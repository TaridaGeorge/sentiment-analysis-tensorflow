I've used Aaron for a number of contracts for my startup internet businesses.  He has always provided awesome service and got back to me promptly about any questions or concerns I had.  He actually understands the online industry and definitely does not give off a creepy money grubbing lawyer vibe like a lot of lawyers i have worked with in the past.  Would recommend his firm to all of my friends.
