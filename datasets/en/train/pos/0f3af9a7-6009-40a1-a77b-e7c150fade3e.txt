PLASMA SCREEN TV's,

are everywhere you look!  If you head out on the patio to have a smoke there is one placed just inside the window so you do not miss any of your favorite game.  The food is excellent and the atmosphere fun and accepting.

I have been here several times and have enjoyed the wings (better than long wongs), the nagasaki (sizziling cheese caught on fire in front of you and served with Pita) and of course their mouth watering sliders!

The excellent service, partnered with the friendly owners who make it a point to say hi to the patrons add the final layer of icing on the cake!
