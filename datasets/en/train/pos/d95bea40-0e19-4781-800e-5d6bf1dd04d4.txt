There is one reason why I go here and one one reason only -- breakfast.  I love that I can get breakfast anytime of the day here.

I always get greedy and order a #4 and end up taking the rest home.

I have been known to deviate from my normal breakfast loving self and order their sandwiches and salads...all are out of this world in terms of proportion.  So much food for such a reasonable price!

Now I no longer have to drive all the way to Phoenix...this one is just down the street!
