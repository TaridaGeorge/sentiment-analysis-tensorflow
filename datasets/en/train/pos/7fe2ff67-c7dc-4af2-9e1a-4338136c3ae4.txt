Comida buena! I'll admit, I've limited my options to their Machaca and Egg breakfast with their fantastic beans on the side and one of their yummy, homemade flour tortillas. It's hard to veer to another dish when you've found perfection. Yesterday was about my 5th or 6th time eating there and I realized that I just noticed that they don't put cheese on their beans. Normally, I'm the type of girl who asks for extra cheese on the beans but to not even really notice at this place means the beans are fantastic without the added gooeyness of queso. And I love queso! Their red-chili Menudo is quite yummy, as well. It's hard to find good Menudo in restaurants but this one tastes homemade. Yummy, authentic Mexican food is what you get here!
