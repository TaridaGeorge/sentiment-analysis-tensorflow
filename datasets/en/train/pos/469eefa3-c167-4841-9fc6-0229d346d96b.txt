Fresh food made to order. Had the stuffed french toast which was awesome.  Wife had a breakfast burrito without the tortilla which was very tasty.  They have good coffee and loose-leaf teas also.  Service was very friendly.  The patio is dog friendly which is always worth extra brownie points.  I will make it a point to eat here whenever I am in Phoenix.
