This review is for Friday nights - an event called Party Foul.

As the website says... "bloghouse/ bmore/ remixes/ hip hop/ retro/ hyphy/ straight up fuckin bangers all night"

If you like that loud new school dance-punk indie-electro techno-infused music that goes beep-beep and a hyperactive, slightly crazed party crowd, this night is for you.

I invited a friend recently, who asked what the crowd was like... Here is the convo:

Friend: "what type of crowd?"

Me: "Hipsters homos dance music scenesters trannies drug addicts drunk people and assorted perverts."

Me: "You'll love it."

Friend: "oh yes... my type of peeps."

If you found that amusing and intriguing as opposed to totally repulsive, go. You'll thank me later.
