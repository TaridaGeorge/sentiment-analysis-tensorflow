Just for a change of routine on a Sunday morning my family and I went with Phoenix Palace rather than C-fu. 
Hubby ordered Duck Beaks and said "Now I can say I've done that and can now cross it off my bucket list". 
The usual dim sum fare--which is great--but we didn't see anything that unusual nor different from dim sum places (except the duck beaks). But do try the turnip cakes! I recommend them highly. 
C-fu still makes better congee and curried tripe though.
