I had the cajun last week with a giant 34oz cider..  The food was awesome.  Pasties are typically pre-made, although by pre, I think they mean within the last 20-30 minutes..  Mine was fresh out of the oven.  So delicious.  Never eaten anything like it.

The service was great, everyone was very friendly.  I sat at the bar, so I got to watch the chef's preparing the next batch.  Be sure to tip those guys too. 

I'll be back soon, with company.  I have a few more pasties to try..
