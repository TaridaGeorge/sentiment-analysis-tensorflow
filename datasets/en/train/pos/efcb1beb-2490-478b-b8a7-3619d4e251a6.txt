I'm upgrading the review to 5 stars because they've been very responsive. Soon after I posted the review describing the lasers they let me know via facebook that they were adjusting the lighting issue, and I noticed today that they did in fact do so. The lasers are no longer eye-searing. They're also open to providing calorie info for Seed. Winners.
