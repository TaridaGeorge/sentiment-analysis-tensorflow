This place is truly a hidden gem in Chandler! 
Inside the building they have tons of educational information and a really cool display of live indigenous animals. There are snakes, scorpions, lizards and more. 
Outside is really cool. They have miles of hiking trails and plenty of wildlife to watch. The have a large lake where you can fish (with the proper license of course). Don't have a fishing pole? No worries you can borrow one from the center. 
The staff is so knowledgeable and friendly. 

Go check this place out! You won't be disappointed!
