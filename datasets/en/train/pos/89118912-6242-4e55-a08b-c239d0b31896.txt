Nick's Italian is a small, quaint restaurant with friendly staff and great service. The food was excellent. I tried Nick's house salad (which is made with no lettuce) and the pizza. My husband tried the chicken parmesan. Both dishes were great. I am glad we decided to eat later than intended, because when we arrived at 8:30 it was still very busy. But, I can see why with such a great atmosphere and wonderful food. It's definitely worth the wait. I will be going back to try their homemade ravioli! Cheers!
