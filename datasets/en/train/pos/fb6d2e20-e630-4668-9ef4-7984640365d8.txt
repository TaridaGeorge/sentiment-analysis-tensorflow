We got our wedding cake form Slice in May of 2010 and it was amazing!!! Chef Chris even came to our home with mini cakes of different flavors so we could pick our favorite. I told her to bring a more traditional white chocolate rasberry for me to try and my wife picked a key lime cake. I thought she was crazy, but of course, she was right! It was delicious!!!! Everyone at the wedding said it was hands down the best wedding cake they had ever had. I would reccomend her to anyone. Give her a try. You won't be disappointed. I still crave that key lime cake all the time... :o)
