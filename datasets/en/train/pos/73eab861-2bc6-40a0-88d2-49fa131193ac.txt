Love this place.  Great beer, fun atmosphere, and good food as well.  They have a good menu with some interesting items that you don't find just anywhere.  My favorite appetizer is the spanakopita... yum!

You can't go wrong with a brewery with good beer that serves good food as well.  Their Kilt Lifter is by far the best I've tried, and they serve up some good seasonals as well.  Looking forward to visiting this place again and again!  Great place to watch the game.
