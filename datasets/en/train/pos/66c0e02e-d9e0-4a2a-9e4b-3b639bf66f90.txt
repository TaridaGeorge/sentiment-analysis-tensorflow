A friend of mine brought me here and I can't thank him enough for doing so. The restaurant itself is very charming. I ordered the fish special. Now, in my opinion it's hard to prepare a fish entree. Not many can do it effectively. But this was the best fish that I can recollect.  It was superb. It was cooked in a white wine sauce with artichokes and capers and it was bursting with flavor.  Not only that but the portion size was perfect. Not too much not too little. Just right.

The ambience is great. The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.  I can't wait to go back for a date. And I just learned that they'll be having live jazz every friday.  Even better!
