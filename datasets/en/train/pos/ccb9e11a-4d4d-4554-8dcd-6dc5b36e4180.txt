the most unusual botanical garden i've been to.  it will make a desert lover out of anyone.  so many species of blooming cacti and agave (so that's where tequila comes from).  the herb garden was surprisingly diverse.  it was great to finally see chaparral upclose in the flesh.  never knew there are so many species of birds in the desert, they are so happily singing atop the cacti.  really neat to see a roadrunner, and the speed definitely lives up to the reputation.  even the little prairie dogs were cute popping in and out of their burrows.

these gardens took my by surprise and i've instantly fallen in love with it.
