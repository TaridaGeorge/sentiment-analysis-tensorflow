wow! who knew.  I've been suffering with knee and calf muscle pain which has put a crimp in my activities for over 2 years..  I ran into Dr. Steve at a seminar and found out... can you believe I never knew this?  that Chiropractic treats more than just back problems.. That's right joints too.  Well, I've been seeing Dr Steve for a few weeks now and NO MORE KNEE PAIN.. I can speed walk, bicycle, dance and my back and neck feel more flexible too.  I'm now a chiro-lifer.  Thanks Dr. Steve.  I spent months in physical therapy a couple of years ago and YOU not they were able to take away my pain and let me continue with my active life.  Thanks.
