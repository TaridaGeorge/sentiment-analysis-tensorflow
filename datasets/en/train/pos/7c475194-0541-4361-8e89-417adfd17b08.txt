YUM!  I love this place!  It's decorated nicely, and the menu has lots of choices.  My favorite dish is the Curried Chicken and Pear Pasta.  It's a nice blending of Asian and Italian.  Delicious!  My alternate choice is the Chopped Gorgonzola Salad.  My friends swear by the Steak 'N Blue Salad, but I haven't tried it yet.  I have been there many times with my family and have hosted parties there as well. The service has always been prompt and helpful.  I'm so glad we have this restaurant nearby; it's one of my favorites.
