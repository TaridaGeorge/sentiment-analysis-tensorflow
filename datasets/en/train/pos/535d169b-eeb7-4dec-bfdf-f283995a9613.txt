Years ago, while living in another city, I had eyelash perms and tint applied every 4 to 6 weeks and was always happy with the results.  Since moving to Phoenix 3 years ago, I have tried at least 4 different places at least 6 times (sometimes mistakingly allowing the same place a second shot at getting it right.)  No one has been able to make this service work until I tried JT.  She is wonderful!  I am so happy to once again wake up with beautiful dark curly lashes that I don't have to spend 10 minutes trying to achieve every day.  I highly recommend her.  She is professional, affordable, and achieves desired results.
