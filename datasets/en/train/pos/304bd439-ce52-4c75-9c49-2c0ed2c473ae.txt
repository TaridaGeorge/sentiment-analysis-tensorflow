I've been to Mesa Arts Center twice, and I love it!  The level of attention to detail throughout the campus makes it look really classy, which I love.  From landscaping to bathroom fixtures, this place deserves five stars.  

On both visits, I had to deal with the box office staff.  In this day and age, one would hope that I could simply buy the tickets I need online and be done.  But my group's plans changed (the first time) and the second time I stupidly bought tickets for the wrong date.  The box office staff should get their own review - incredibly helpful and patient (both times), everything I could have hoped for.   

In conclusion, this place is great, you should find lots of things to attend here.
