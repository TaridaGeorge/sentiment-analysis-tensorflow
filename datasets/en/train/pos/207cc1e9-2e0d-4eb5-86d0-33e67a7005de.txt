In n Out has never disappointed me (after I found out about "fries well done" that is...). For those who just don't understand the hype, it's very simple. Fresh, high quality ingredients. Doesn't taste frozen because it isn't (even the buns, cheese and veggies taste much better than other cheap eating options). The service is outstanding, probably because they pay more than other fast food joints. Now, I will say that the food is very good taken home or back to the office, but to truly experience it's greatness, it should be eaten immediately at the restaurant or in your car in the parking lot (so the toasted bun and everything else is crisp vs. soggy). It really makes a huge difference!
