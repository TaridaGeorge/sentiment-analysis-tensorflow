I love Home Fabrics! The staff has always been very helpful and cheerful whenever I have been there. They have GREAT prices on decorator fabric, trims, foam, etc. They offer free workshops on how to do drapes, etc. on Saturday mornings that I just found out about and I am very excited to go learn. They are strictly a home furnishings type of fabric store but probably should be your first stop if that's what you are looking for.
