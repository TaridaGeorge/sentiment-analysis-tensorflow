Such a cool, cozy place to hang out with friends and have some drinks.  They're food is rather tasty and the staff is super hip with a bit of a 'tude.  

We ordered the Loaded Chips as an appetizer and I couldn't pry myself away from them.  They were too die for!  I ordered the Crab Cake BLT with a side of Mac n' Cheese and it did not disappoint.  

Someone at the table had a side of Charlie Potatoes and they blew me away.  They are pretty much handmade au grautin cheesey potatoes and they are the tastiest things I have ever had in my life.
