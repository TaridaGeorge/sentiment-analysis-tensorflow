Went to Pork on a Fork based on the great reviews seen here on Yelp!  The reviews were dead on.  This place had the most tender pork and brisket I have had in a while.  I also tried the ribs and they were amazing.  We actually got there 10 minutes to close and were going to just get it to go, but they talked us into eating there.  The location isn't the greatest so they will definitely need some word of mouth.  Also it should be known that their hours are limited (10-7 Mon-Fri only).  We were told that there usually is a line at lunch time.  We will definitely be going back and this time be cognizant of the hours.
