I have been coming to Mitch's Econo Lube N' Tune & Brakes for over 10 years. Mitch and his team have always done a great job. A few months ago it was my brakes and today it was a noisy wheel that I though needed a wheel hub repair but they checked the problem first with a couple test drives and determined it to be a much easier problem to fix.
