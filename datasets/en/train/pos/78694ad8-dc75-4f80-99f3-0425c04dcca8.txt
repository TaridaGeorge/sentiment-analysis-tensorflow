D'lish has very delicious food.  This place has very healthy and tasty fresh food.  In addition, they have a major plus with a drive-thru window.  It is a good thing they have that because it gets quite packed with such a small location.  I have had their salads and sandwiches, and so far everything has been exceptional.  During my last visit, I tried the Breakfast Buzz.  The Breakfast Buzz has peanut butter, protein powder, bananas, espresso coffee, and skim milk.  It was a delicious blend of yummy.
