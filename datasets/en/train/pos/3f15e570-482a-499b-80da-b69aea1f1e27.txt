Great Vibe here...  tons of books can't my hands off the Jack Kerouac Collection, tons records you can listen to. Big comfy chairs and couch. not to mention WiFi.  They are starting up Open Mic nights too!! 

They have a variety of teas to choose from and drinks very good!!   both the guys who own it are cool.
