OMG, Scottsdale Sunflower is the best place outside of Tempe to pickup on chicks who don't shave their arm pits.

Oh, and it also happens to be the best place in the area for produce, really effing good cereal (the peanut butter Puffin sh!t), organic food and 50 million different types of trail mix.
