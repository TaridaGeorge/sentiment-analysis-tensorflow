This is my dad and I favorite lunch spot. Pho-real! Impeccable service and the freshest food. Their spring rolls ate immaculate, fried rice is pretty close to Peruvian friend rice, and their pho is truly unphoghetable. The servers are friendly, the owner always asks you how the food was. Nestled inside the Mekong plaza market this place will meet all your expectations in delicious Vietnamese cuisine.
