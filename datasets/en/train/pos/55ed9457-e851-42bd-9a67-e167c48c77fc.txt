This bar is amazing. It was super cool for numerous years as Mabel Murphy's and is now new and improved.  Those lolly pop chicken fingers keep you coming back for more. It's got a very laid back vibe and drinks are affordable.  Plus, it's super close to home and walking distance to other restaurants, bars or the art galleries.  I recommend it and its definitely one of my new favorites in old town Scottsdale.
