I love Lo-Fi!   This is definitely my new favorite place to hang out in Mesa.  
Plenty of seating for me and my friends, and you don't feel rushed or uncomfortable or that you're giving money to the devil for sub-par drinks, like at *bux.   
They had a special- lattes for $2 the other night... I can't remember the last time i got coffee so cheap.  The iced teas are my favorite though.   Plus the guy who's always working there, Sam, once brought my friend a cup of ice water when he noticed she didn't order a drink... how thoughtful! 
Thanks for keeping us all hydrated :)      

Also - Vegan baked goods = thumbs up.. I'm not vegan but this chocolate cookie with peanut butter inside was so awesome!

My friend said the biscotti is great as well.
