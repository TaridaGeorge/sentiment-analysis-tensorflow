This is one gem of a resturant!! The atmosphere is amazing only to equal the food! Every item on the menu is mouth watering and not to mention anyone that eats at The Deli will have to save room fo the homemade ice cream, if you can't decide on one flavor...grab a scoop of each!! This is the place one can walk in and say, "I want to try something different" and be very pleased with the choice!! Enjoy!!
