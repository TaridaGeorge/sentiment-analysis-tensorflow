We celebrated a birthday with a big group tonight, this was not my first time here but they exceeded my expectations. Great for large groups, they take reservations, service was awesome and food was exceptional. Great place for happy hour too, can't wait for the patio when the weather cools down. Queso dip by far is the best in he valley, beware. Tacos and margaritas are up there with the queso. Great location for me, but if you are far it's well worth the drive for a date night or happy hour!
