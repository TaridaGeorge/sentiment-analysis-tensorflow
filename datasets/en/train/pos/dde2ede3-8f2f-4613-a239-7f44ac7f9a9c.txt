Gotta tell ya, I went back twice more in the 2 weeks following my first visit!  Everything I've had has been great.  The grilled cheese that has ham and this cherry concoction/mustard ... so great!  The Kiltlifter fondue and Panzanella salad totally satisfied and tingled my taste buds. Bf and I even popped in one night when they had a short list of $20 wines by the bottle... Score!  I haven't yet made it to the dessert menu, but I sure hope to soon!
