We flew into the Phoenix arport and stopped at Q to U on the way to the Grand Canyon. What a great way to start a vacation! Delicious nachos followed by pulled pork and brisket sandwiches. We tried two homemade sides - potato salad and cole slaw. Both were amazing, and cole slaw was the best I've ever had. It's really great when the appetizers, main courses and sides are all top notch. I bet the desserts are too, but I was too full to try.
