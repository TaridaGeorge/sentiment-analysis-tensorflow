So - back to Eddie V's on a "leisurely" Wednesday night.... only to have the most AMAZING experience yet!  

In the V lounge, where the live music is at, the vibe and energy was off the charts.  They had a trio - Al Ortiz - and he was phenomenal.  I found out he plays with Stevie Nicks for 20 years or so.  That's some impressive talent and it was so much fun.  

I tell you, there just isn't anyplace like Eddie Vs for the entertainment and cuisine.  Not exactly a 'hidden gem' - but I was shocked the lounge wasn't packed to capacity with such talent on stage.  All the better for me until the word gets out, I suppose.
