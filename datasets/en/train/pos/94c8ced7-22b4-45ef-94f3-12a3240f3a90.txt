Doesn't get too much better than this place for a family day with the kids! The playground is fun and they have equipment for all ages next to each other. I always hate how parks have the equipment for toddlers on the other side of the park from the equipment for older kids. Who do I disappoint? Anyway, props on putting age appropriate equipment close to each other.

Also the train and carousel rides are uber cheap! Good for the budget conscious family. 

And don't miss out the train ride in December when it is all decked out with Christmas lights and sunbathing moose. My daughter loves it and it has become a family tradition to go for her birthday every year. Plus you can go visit Santa in the big train and get a photo for $5. Much cheaper than the mall!
