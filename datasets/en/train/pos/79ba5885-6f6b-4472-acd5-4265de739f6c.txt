We were first-time visitors to this restaurant on Saturday night. I was blown away by the personal attention given to us by the staff. The hostess asked if it was our first time there, and then she notified our waitress, who gave us a complimentary sweet corn tamale (which was delicious). They were also running a special on their facebook page for a one-cent margarita with the purchase of an entree. The margaritas and the food were delicious. The tortillas and the chips were fresh and tasty. The only blah items were the salsa (fresh, but bland) and the fried ice cream dessert (which came out soggy). Our waitress was so personable and spent lots of time checking on us and chatting. The manager also came by to welcome us. We will definitely go here again, and I look forward to trying the honey flan next time.
