i can't say enough about Sutra- 

great class selection and times, 
kind, capable instructors (Sebastian is especially good)
healing, meditative, challenging and fun workouts
a hip, relaxed atmosphere,
affordable rates,
a focus on individual practice - no ego - and a focus on women, with many classes for moms and even children,
and above all, what keeps me coming back is the amazing owner, Rebecca, who always remembers my name even though I come so infrequently. 

thank you for such an amazing past few months. I encourage everyone who read this to visit the studio!
