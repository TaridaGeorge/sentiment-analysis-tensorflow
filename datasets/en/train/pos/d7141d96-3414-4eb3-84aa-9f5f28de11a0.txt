Best burger in town, best beet salad ever.  Fries to die for.  Banana split off the hook.  Groovy ambience for dinner, casual chic for lunch.

My most recent trip, took a business partner for lunch.  Wait was negligible at 12:30, and the staff was fantastically friendly and attentive.  Water refills are a luxury on a 95 degree day, and they were on the ball.

They have a great drink menu, including some fun beers that go well with the burgers.  I got the house lager this time, which was crisp and clean for the toasty day.

Burger is to die for--I think it's gruyere, caramelized onions and a baguette.  Skipped the fries this time and got the beet salad--perfection with goat cheese and candied pecans.

Reasonably priced--$25 for Beer, salad and burger.  Sweet!
