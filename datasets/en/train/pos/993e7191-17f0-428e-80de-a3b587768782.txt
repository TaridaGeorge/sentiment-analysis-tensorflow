John Farrell from Service King came to my home in Mesa, Az. and did some electrical work for me as well as checking out my AC system.  John was on time, very courteous, in uniform and very knowledgeable in his work.  I will use this company again when I need repairs done around my home, and will also recommend him to my friends.
