Fabulous French Baguettes are baked on premises and used for their Vietnamese sandwiches - Banh Mi. The bread is so good, I bring two hot loafs home and 
freeze with my recently discovered frozen fresh bread method (double wrapped, once in paper towels and again in aluminum foil), although at only $1 each, one could go there every day to but fresh. My choice of the many varieties of Banh Mi (three times!) is the "Bar-B-Que Pork" and it is fabulous! It is loaded with pickled carrot, daikon radish, cilantro, onion and jalapeno. "Grilled Pork" will my next choice, as it is highly recommended by several Reviewers. One hint to make it even better, opt for "extra meat" at only $1 more.
