Went to ncounter for breakfast and thought it was top-notch.  Great selection of breakfast favorites like pancakes, eggs, omelettes, muffins, etc., but also some things that are harder to find.  For instance, my wife had the croque monsieur and loved it.

The location is right next to the light rail stop and the inside has been redone completely.  It looks nothing like the coffee shop that last inhabited the space (and that is definitely a good thing).  

Flavored iced teas are good, as is the orange juice.  I'm really looking forward to going back for lunch, as the sandwiches sound like they'll be as great as the breakfast was.  Give this place a try!
