*They are moving to the old HoodRide location soon!* Which will be a FULL coffee house with outdoor and indoor seating!

The owner John couldn't be nicer ... the coffee just rawks (it has a very full earthy flavor) ... He buys from Cartel Coffee but instead of telling customers what THEY want (as Cartel does) John makes it how YOU want it without the Douchebag "WE know REAL coffee and you don't" attitude.
