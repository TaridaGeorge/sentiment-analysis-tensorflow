service is great.
complimentary coffee and tea deliver to the room.
I really like the setting of the suite and a very nice size patio facing the swimming pool.
it's a quiet little complex next to the Phoenician. if you are looking for something a bit quiet. this is the place.
Too bad I came here when the weather is too cold to swim.
will be back again next year!
