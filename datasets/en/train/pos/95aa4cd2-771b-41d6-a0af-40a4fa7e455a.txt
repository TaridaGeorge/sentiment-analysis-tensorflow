My favorite place for wine!

I come here a lot, but mostly for the wine. The store is cozy, and the staff is super helpful. Their wine guy here can tell you just about anything about every kind of wine. And, if you're a World Market Explorer member, you can get some sweet discounts too!

Another favorite about this place, is the unique treats they have. From chocolates to jam, the food is great! 

Overall, the staff, selection and wine make this one of my favorite stores in Happy Valley!
