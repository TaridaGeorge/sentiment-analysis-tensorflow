The pancakes are the best that I have eaten in Phoenix.  Also it is one of our favorites in our area of town for breakfast.  The owner, Joe, stopped by our table to greet us and is almost always there to make sure everything is perfect.  It is a great local and family owned business.  We also thought the coffee was great for a breakfast place.
