My boyfriend and I ate her Sunday afternoon and from the moment we walked in to the moment we walked out there were definatly no complaints. Got seated immediatly. Our server greeted us immediatly, got out drinks immediatly, and gave us the perfect amount of time to look over our menus. My boyfriend got a chocolate shake - mmmmm I should have got one- Delicious. Side Ceasar salad to start - nice and fresh and crisp lettuce - always a plus. We got a Burger and a chicken lettuce wrap for lunch. His burger was cooked to perfection and my chicken lettuce wrap was very tasty. And ofcourse their french fries are awesome aswell . Got our bill- very inexpensive. Great atmosphere, Great food, Great service!! No complaints
