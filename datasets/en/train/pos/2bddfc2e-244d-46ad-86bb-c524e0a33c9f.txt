This is one of my favorite lunch spots, I have to admit this place is addicting.  Cilantro Jalape√±o Humus?  Yes sounds crazy but and amazing blend or love and spice, everything nice!  Glazed Chicken Lavoush is a treat and I agree the portions are hefty, but healthy.  

Great concept, the staff seem very happy, and it shows because their service is fantastic.  I am ready for lunch in a couple hours.... I'm bringing my flute for a little magic.  stay classy Pita Jungle
