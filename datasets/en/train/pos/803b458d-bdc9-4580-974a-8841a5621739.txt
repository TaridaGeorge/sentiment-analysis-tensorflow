This place is awesome.  It has everything you could possibly want.  Seriously, tortas, obviously, and other standard fare like tacos and quesadillas.  But they also have delicious soups (they gave us a sample of the sopa del dia last time we were there and it was some delicious creamy corn and green chile masterpiece that was amazingly good) paletas, and pastries.  There is even a very good vegetarian torta.  Food came out quick and was delicious.  I owe my friend big time for introducing me to this place.
