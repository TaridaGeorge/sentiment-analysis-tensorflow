Tott's - Tempe's Loss - Chandler's Gain...

Checked out the new location today - everything seemed spot on - the Orange Chicken still reins supreme... 

It's a bit surreal that they'd once again be adjacent to a Starbuck's but I guess statistically...um, the odds aren't that bad.  If you're hunting, it's the restaurant currently without the sign (used to be Pick Up Sticks I think...)

For something different - I'd also recommend the Malaysian Curry.
