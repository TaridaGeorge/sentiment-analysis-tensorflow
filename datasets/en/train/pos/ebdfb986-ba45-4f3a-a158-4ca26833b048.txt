I found this hamburger joint to be a complete delight. We stopped in more out of geographic convenience and ended up surprised at the quality and tastiness of the food. My well-done burger was juicy, carmelized, and delicious. We also tried among the table a spinach salad, regular and 'smash fries', a hot dog and a grilled cheese sandwich. From the artisan breads to fresh meats and produce, you will be pleased with your meal at this little gem in the shopping center.
