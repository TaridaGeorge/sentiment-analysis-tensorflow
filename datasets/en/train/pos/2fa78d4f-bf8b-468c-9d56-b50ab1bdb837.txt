This salon is the best in Scottsdale. I have been coming to them for ten years. I have never left unsatisfied. They also do the best extentions I have seen. The quality is second to none and they match your hair perfectly. You will look beyond beautiful. The atmosphere is always fun and you can sit back and relax with a glass of wine or champers and watch as you are transformed. I don't actual live in Scottsdale but like several other clients I fly in to have my hair done from New York and now from San Diego. They are just that good. Myriam is the best hands down.
