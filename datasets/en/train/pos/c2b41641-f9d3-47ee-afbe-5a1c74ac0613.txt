LOVE this restaurant.  Food is delicious, made to order, and generous portions.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed. Quality is outstanding, service excellent, clean environment, and GREAT customer service.  Be sure to try the curry noodles and rama beef.  Great together.  You must have the coconut ice cream.  Large serving, fresh taste.  Authentic!  Try it and you'll go back again and again.
