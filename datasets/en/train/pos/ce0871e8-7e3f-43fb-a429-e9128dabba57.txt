Let's put it this way -- Ticoz was so awesome that I am completely willing to come back for numerous happy hours -- even though I work about 40 minutes away, and gas is $3.75 a gallon.

Cool atmosphere, unusually friendly and down-to-earth staff, quiet enough for a great conversation, plenty of parking, and lychee mojitos. 
What else can I say?
