My girlfriend and I almost go to this place weekly.  They know our regular order now by my phone area code.  We've never had a bad meal, and the food quality puts to shame every other gyro place we've tried here.  If you go in and they have a bunch of baklava's sitting there grab one because they are fresh and delicious!
