Postino is my favorite cafe in Phoenix!!!!! The customer service is outstanding. In my first vist I was greeted by almost all the employees, asked if I wanted water or anything to drink while I was waiting for a table. In my second visit that was 2 months later I received the same service :)  I love the live music on Sundays and the food is excellant. The bruchetta board is the best and filling. Just enough food for 2. Having Sierra Navada on the beer list is a great plus as well.
