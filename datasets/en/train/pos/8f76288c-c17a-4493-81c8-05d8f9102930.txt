I eat here regularly and let my kids play in the play area. It is great food and I can take a moment to breathe. It is the first place I send parents that are looking for a play place in the summer. The demand for this type of business in this area is so high, I think Chick-fil-a should open another one near Johnson Ranch on Hunt Hwy!
