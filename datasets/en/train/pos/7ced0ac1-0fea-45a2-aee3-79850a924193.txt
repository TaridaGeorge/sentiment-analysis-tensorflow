This is the first time that I have given 5 stars to a restaurant.  But, they so deserve it.  Our waitress, Jill, was SO wonderful and helpful.  Her recommendations were spot on.   I loved everything about the place.  From the most amazing jalapeno cheddar grits to the banana split we shared for dessert.  The manager made many stops by our table to be sure everything was to our liking...and it was. I wish we lived in the neighborhood.  It would definitely become my neighborhood haunt.
