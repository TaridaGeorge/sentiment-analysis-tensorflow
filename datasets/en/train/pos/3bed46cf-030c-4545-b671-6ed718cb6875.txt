What an incredible addition to the downtown Phoenix bar scene! The independently owned FilmBar has a great beer and film selection. It's the type of place that I want to bring all of my friends from out of town and say, "look at this! See! Baby Phoenix is growing up!"

Make sure to check the website to find out what film is playing. No point in going to the FilmBar if you don't stay for a movie. I take that back. Go to the FilmBar for a drink, and realize that you should stay for a movie too.
