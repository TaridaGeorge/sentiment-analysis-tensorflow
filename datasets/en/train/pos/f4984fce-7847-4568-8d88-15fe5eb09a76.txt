Now, I know there are science centers in every major city. But right here in downtown Phoenix, we've got one that's world class. The Arizona Science Center holds more than 40,000 square-feet of gallery space and over 300 hands-on exhibits. Great for the kids, the relatives, even for a unique first date. 

Here on limited engagement, the Body Worlds3 exhibit is an amazing collection of 200 authentic human specimens! Not for the faint (and probably not for younger children without a lot of explanation), the display include skeletons, individual organs, transparent body slices, as well as entire bodies.
