I love Nielsen's! Both locations are very nice. The food is good quality and the employees seem very efficient and industrious. I love the "Finer Things" sandwich.

An aside (which does not affect my rating): Many of the people here don't control their children - almost every time I have gone to either Nielsen's there are kids going crazy. It's worth it for the food though!
