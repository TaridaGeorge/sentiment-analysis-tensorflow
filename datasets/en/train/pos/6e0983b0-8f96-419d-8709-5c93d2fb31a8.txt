Last night we visited Kelly's for the first time. What a great little gem! I use "little" loosely as it's actually is 7500sq ft! It has a huge patio, a few private rooms and a great big bar! We loved the couches they have throughout the inside and outside. Some of the people we were with ordered food and had the chickpea fries. I thought they were very flavorful and the sauce that came with them was super yummy too. I know we will be back very, very soon for more food (and more cocktails). I also saw they have some different type of cocktails that I will for sure try soon. If you are in the area I would certainly suggest giving Kelly's a try. You will definitely not be disappointed at all!
