Wendy McCroskey is one of the most compassionate, caring, and thorough Realtors I have ever come across.  She genuinely cares about her clients and takes a real interest in them.  One of the most impressive parts of Wendy's services is her Buyer Consultation in which she often spends an hour or more on the front end getting to know her clients and educate her clients on how best to find a home that fits their needs.  I highly recommend Wendy for your next home purchase in Arizona!
