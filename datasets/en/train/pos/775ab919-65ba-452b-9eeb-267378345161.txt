Great group of dudes - always happy to quickly diagnose issues, in my case a dying car battery. 


A quick lookup of my warranty info (from 2006 - I certainly didn't still have that receipt!) and I was good to go with the new one installed at a pro-rated cost for replacement. 

Only thing missing is their ability to save all my radio presets after disconnecting the battery :)
