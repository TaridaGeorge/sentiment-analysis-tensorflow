Blair was extremely knowledgeable and helpful during my recent search for a house.  He was extremely prompt in returning phone calls and emails.  He gladly showed my wife and I as many houses as we wanted and took us back to review previously viewed properties.  He is extremely knowledgeable of the Phoenix market and can provide great insight into housing trends.  He recommended a neighborhood that neither my wife nor I knew about and we ended up buying our house there.  I would recommend him to any friends or family.
