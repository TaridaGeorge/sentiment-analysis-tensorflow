This is a great little neighborhood bar. The staff is super friendly and fun to hang with. They make you feel right at home. My softball team went there while in town for a tournament and they were more than accommodating - especially when such a large group shows up all at once. They even slipped us some tokens for free games of darts when we indicated we were gonna play. If you stop in Phoenix I would definitely recommend spending a few of your gay dollars here...
