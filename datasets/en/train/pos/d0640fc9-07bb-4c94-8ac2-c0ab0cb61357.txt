Love this place, in fact got married there in 1999.  It is one of the most extensive collections of Native American artifacts and history that I know of.  Goregeous galleries.  My one suggestion would be to offer maps of the museum, can get kind of confusing.  If you have very young ones I wouldn't take them, this is more in line of an art museum.
