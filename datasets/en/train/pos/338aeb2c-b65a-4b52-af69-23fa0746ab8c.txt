Where do we start! We LOVE this place! An Australian wine bar that recently relocated from Chandler Fashion Square Mall to the new Lakes area at McQueen and Warner. Its hard to believe they've created such a wonderful atmosphere in an old Baja Fresh Location! Amazing! Phil, Rodger, Josh and staff have worked very hard transforming this new location and it has kept it's quaint, casual and comfortable atmosphere. Wine selection is reasonable priced, compared to Pesto's in Chandler. New steak on menu is FANTASTIC, try with blue cheese crumbles! Yet another place that carries my favorite local beer from SanTan Brewery! If you love wine and enjoy exotic foods this is a place to try!
