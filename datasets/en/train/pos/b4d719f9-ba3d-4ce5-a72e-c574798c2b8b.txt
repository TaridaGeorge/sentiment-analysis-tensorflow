Have to say, this is one of my new favorite places because of one host. I came in looking for hot chocolate for a special occasion with a good friend and they said they didn't serve anything like that, but he would see what he could do. 15 minutes later, a chef came out with two, delicious cups of hot chocolate made just for us. A+ customer service and definitely made our night!! Thank you again!
