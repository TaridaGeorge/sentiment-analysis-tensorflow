This location of Buffalo Exchange is amazing.

 I usually start by satisfying my denim addiction and peruse through the jeans. They have all the top designer brands (True Religion, Rock & Republic, William Rast, Seven) found for over two hundred dollars at Nordstom. After I finish it's straight to the fitting rooms because there's no way I could carry around 40 pounds of jeans very long. Sometimes the staff will ask if you'd like to start a little collection back there while you look.. tricky little buggers. 

The prices are great and the condition of the clothing is always pretty good to excellent. I can't think of any times I didn't get a friendly hello on my way in the door. 

I've had quite the good luck in selling items to this location also, which is great considering I go in expecting them to not take anything.
