I love Nello's!!!  My boyfriend and I have been going there for over a year now and have never had a bad experience!  We love the Barbecue Chicken pizza.  If your in to pasta, the Alfredo sauce is amazing!  We love the atmosphere at the restaurant.  Service is great!  The servers are all very friendly and attentive.  (Service is huge with me and they have never let me down)  When we have family or friends in town, Nello's is always a must!
