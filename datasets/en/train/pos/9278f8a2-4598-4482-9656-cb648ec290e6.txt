After noticing the signs showing good deals, went here for lunch on a workday.
I had 3 street tacos and a drink for around $4 and they were fantastic!  Lots of flavor!  My boyfriend tried the hamburger and fries for around $5, he liked it!  The fries are freshly made (like In-N-Out) and were good.  Overall great value and location for a quick lunch!
