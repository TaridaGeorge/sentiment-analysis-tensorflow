I only had the 5$ martinis while there, next time I will try the food. The bartender was amazing and attentive. The atmosphere was between relaxed and extravagant, I don't know how else to explain it. The music was cool, a bit to loud to talk near the bar but it sounded amazing. There was a bit of dancing and a very happy feeling here. I will be going again!
