I went there for the 2nd time last week and the food was real good. 
Mostly I'm impressed with the service. 
The first time we went there our waitress thanked us and shook our hand. 
I appreciate when someone makes an effort that goes beyond the norm. 
The second waitress was really good as well. This is a well run company. 
I hope they do very well.
