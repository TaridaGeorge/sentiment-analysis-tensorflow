My husband and I love going to Babbo's for date night. Our bill averages out to $25-30 dollars. The decor is warm and romantic, and the food is delicious! I haven't tried anything there that I didn't like. My favorite is the Tuscan turkey sandwich. We tend to eat out at 4:50, so we haven't experienced the server problems that other people have at this location.
