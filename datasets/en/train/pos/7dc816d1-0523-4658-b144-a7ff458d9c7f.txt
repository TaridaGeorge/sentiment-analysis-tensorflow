Can you say black velvet Armani jacket for under $70? I've been consigning and shopping at Regal Rags for years. Whenever I get compliments on my outfits from RR (happens a lot), I love to say, "It's free!!"  (or at least feels that way when you have credit on account from what you've consigned). So if you look in your closet and don't have anything to wear, clean it out, consign the clothes, and start shopping. You'll find fabulous buys on amazing clothes and you won't worry about showing up dressed like someone else who just shopped at the mall.
