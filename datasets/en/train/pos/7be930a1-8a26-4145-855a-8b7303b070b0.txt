Beckett's  Table has many modern food choices and everything is good. I forget exactly what it was called but there is an all chocolate dessert that is to die for! the customer service is great! In all my experience the waiters and waitresses there are kind, funny, and considerate. I also am very happy that it's located right next Ballet Arizona.
