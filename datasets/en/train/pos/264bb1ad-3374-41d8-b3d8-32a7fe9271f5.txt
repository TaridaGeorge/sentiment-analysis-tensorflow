Seriously one of the best breakfasts I've ever had....you have to check out this place. Our waitres (Susan I think) was a nice older lady who lovingly referred to everything on the menu as her's..."I have the best coffee in town, I only use organic local ingredients", it was super endearing.

Fresh squeezed OJ that gets REFILLED...yum. Awesome coffee..and HOMEMADE jam that they make in house...seriously heaven. I went there both days that I was in Scottsdale, it was that good. Can't wait to go back to Cafe Zuzu's
