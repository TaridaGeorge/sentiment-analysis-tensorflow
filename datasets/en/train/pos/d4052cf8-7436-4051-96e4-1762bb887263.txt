This place is absolutely delicious!!! I loved the Stetson salad - couscous, roma tomatoes, corn, arugula, smoked salmon, cheese, black currant topped with a basal pesto dressing. Their gnocchi was delicious as well! But what I absolutely enjoyed with their SERVICE!! It was a 10 star service that exceed above and beyond the expectations of even the restaurant each self. Our server even offered to switch out any plates we didn't like since it was our first time there. Their decor was a very warm dining room kind of feeling - dim lights, dark cherrywood tables and chairs. I'ld go back just to be treated like a princess!
