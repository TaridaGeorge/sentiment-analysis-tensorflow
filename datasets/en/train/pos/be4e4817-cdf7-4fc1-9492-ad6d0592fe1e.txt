Just as a point of reference, I'm not a hippie, I love to eat meat, and I don't have any tattoos or piercings.  That doesn't change the fact that Sunflower is my absolute favorite grocery store of all time.  

Their prices on produce are awesome.  Generally speaking, the produce is smaller, but very flavorful.  Awesome.

The bulk bins are great.  Not only is it a deal for everything inside, but they have all kinds of stuff you won't find at a normal grocery store.

This is a great place.  The atmosphere is good, the service is good, but most importantly, the products they sell are awesome, at a great price.
