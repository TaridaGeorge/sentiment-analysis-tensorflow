All I have to say is WOW to the carrot cake. Reminds me of grandmas carrot cake.  But seriously, everything I have ever ordered in this place is delicious. Even down to the mac & cheese.  Yes, I said, mac & cheese.  Don't worry, as one of my co-workers put it.......its adult mac & cheese.  But man was it delicious. The club is amazing & apparently so is the french dip. Can they go wrong w/ any dish? I think not. 
Definitely one of the all time favorites in my life!!  I should go right now.
