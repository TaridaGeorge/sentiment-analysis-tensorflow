Um, what to say about Target? It's Target!

Everything is displayed nicer than Wal-Mart and it's a litte bit more expensive because of it. Other than that, I'm a big fan of their clothing for men. Yes, they do have the crazy looking vintage t-shirts, but also a handsome selection of casual/formal clothes that just look good for a won't-break-your-budget price. I go here for everything except food. I haven't struck up the nerve to use Target as my grocery store and I don't know why.
