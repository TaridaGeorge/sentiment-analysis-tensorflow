If going to a super sized store & spending 2-3 hours on Saturday morning doing your grocery shopping is your thing than this probably is not the place for you.
 
But, if you have a busy life style, you want to run in & out and get something healthy to eat, then  Fresh & Easy is the place for you.

A very friendly staff, affordable, a great sampling area in the back, and exceptional quality (produce, as well as pre-made meals.) 

They also have the best Lemonade in their refrigerated section.
