I have been eating at this Waffle house since I was a teenager and it has never failed to provide good food.  The employees are courteous and the service is fast.  The portions are good for the price and the small dinner feel is great to eat in.  I have gone here many times with my disabled brother and have never had any problems with the staff or employees.  I also like the fact that they are one of the few 24 hr restaurants available to eat at and this has come in handy many times.
