This is definitely the best place to get pierced in all of AZ. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. They give you all of the information you need to make an informed decision and are also helpful if something goes wrong with your piercing. Kat in particular has been extremely helpful to me but no matter who you see you will be in good hands.
