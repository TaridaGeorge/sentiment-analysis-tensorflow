I went to Crudo with some friends for AZ Restraurant week and it was one of the best meals I have ever had.  I started with the Butterfish and it was really good.  One of my friends had the Albacore and said he also liked it a lot and another friend had the Mozzarella and said it was the best cheese he had ever had.  I had the squid ink risotto and it was amazing.  Dessert was good, but not great.  

The service was also fantastic and I can't wait to go back!
