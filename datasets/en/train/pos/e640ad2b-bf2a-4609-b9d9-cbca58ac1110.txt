This place is awesome.  

The gelato is really good and comes in a ton of different varieties (though, never having had gelato in Italy, it probably tastes completely different) and it's reasonably priced ($3-4ish).     

Also, this place makes some pretty good coffee, too.  I would definitely stop by just for the espresso.
