Ill try not to talk it up too much but I have to say it was one of the best dinning experiences I've ever had. My wife and I stopped in and were really surprised on how authentic the inside of the restaurant looked. The meal was perfect and the service was out of this world friendly. Even the owner took time to sit and talk with us and share stories.  I thought places like this only existed in movies. Thanks Zur Kate for the good time and we are looking forward to visiting your fine establishment again!!!
