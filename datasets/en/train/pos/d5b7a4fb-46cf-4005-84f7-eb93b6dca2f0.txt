Excellent food, charming atmosphere, and great service. Love the rainbow roll and eel roll. Tempura cheesecake and green tea mochi ice cream are both delicious and unique dessert items. Bathrooms are classy and clean. Overall superb dining experience. Take out is excellent as well. Soy sauce, pickled ginger, and Wasabi are all chemical free. Be sure to ask for the fresh Wasabi!  The best!
