Had a fillet - was as good as any I've every had.  Tender, cooked to perfect temperature.  Terrific flavor.  Seafood chowder was good as far as Arizona goes.  You just don't get great chowder here.

Waitstaff was attentive, but otherwise invisible, which is exactly how I like them.  

Eating here is different that most places.  Ignore the prices, I would say even ignore the menu.  Tell the waitstaff what you want, they will bring it and charge you what it costs.  

If you are price shopping this place, you will not be satisfied.
