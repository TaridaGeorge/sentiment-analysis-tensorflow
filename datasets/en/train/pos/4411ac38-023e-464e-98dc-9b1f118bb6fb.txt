Went here in December....breakfast for two, food came out in a matter of 5-7 minutes...it wasn't a particularly busy Sunday morning because it had rained all morning, but there was dry seating available. Had no problems with the service, it was pretty much on par with what you would expect from a restaurant. The location of the restaurant is what will leave you satiated. Fresh air, great place to walk around after your meal. The breakfast itself was great..i had the waffles, she had the truffle eggs, they both tasted great, but i will say that i preferred the eggs. The waffles are more than filling and will quickly fill your sugar tooth, so if you are looking for something healthier and less sweet - the eggs are definitely the way to go.
