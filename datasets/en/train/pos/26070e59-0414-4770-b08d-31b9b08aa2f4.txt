I took in two pairs of expensive shoes (my only two pair of expensive shoes!) to Broadway Shoe Repair...just a round the corner from where I live in Tempe. One pair was a pair of flats whose souls (oops, I mean soles!) had worn out and were fraying around the shoe tip. The other was a pair of sandals with a back strap that had stretched out so was rather unsightly to wear out. They did a superb job on both shoes. Flats: polished (which I really didn't have to do) and stained the soles so that they look good as new. Sandals...they took in the back strap perfectly (tried on in the store before leaving. This was a week's turn around and charged $16.00. Think very worth it and would return again as needed.
