Loved this hotel! Even though I live in Phoenix, stayed with the BF for a night as a mini-vacay, and to enjoy their lovely pool (it's not a big pool, which was fine by me, but I'd say if you're coming with a brood of kids, it might not be the best hotel for that). The hotel itself is stylish, comfortable, romantic and everyone we came in contact with was super nice. (I think it's hilarious one reviewer here said staff was overly friendly. Yeah, I hate when the staff is nice to me...such a pain.) Would definitely stay again.
