Love this new gym! It's super clean and nice, the machines are all powered by green energy equipment! Awesome women's locker room.. couldn't ask for a better place. I use to be part of 24 hour fitness, but the there lockers smell, this place is great!

Ask for Eric, he's awesome and will help you out with any questions for your training needs.
