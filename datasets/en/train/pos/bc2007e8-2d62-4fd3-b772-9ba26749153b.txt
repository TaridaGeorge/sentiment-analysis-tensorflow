The zoo is cool! I have enjoyed the Zoo lights in the fall in the past and this weekend visited for the giraffe encounter. I highly recommend seeking this exhibit. It is $3 in addition to the fee to get into the zoo, but it was worth it. My friend and I got to hand feed a couple of giraffes - how cool to be that close to the animals. Thankfully they also provide a spritz of hand sanitizer to get the saliva off.

The exhibit is 7 days a week 9-10 AM. Highly recommend going being this exhibit is gone. Also stop by to see the new jaguar on display.
