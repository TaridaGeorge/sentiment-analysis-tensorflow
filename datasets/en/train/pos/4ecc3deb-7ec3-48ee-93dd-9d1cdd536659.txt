Awesome! The best tasting pizza in the history of us ordering pizza. The bread sticks are fit for a King. No one has Bread sticks like Barrows. The pizza has thick crust and plenty of cheese and sauce. Their not stingy on their toppings. 2 slices is actually satisfying when little ceasers is not satisfying at all. Not a bad after taste. If you are looking for a bite of pizza that will give a lasting memory of the best pizza you ever had, look no further than here.
