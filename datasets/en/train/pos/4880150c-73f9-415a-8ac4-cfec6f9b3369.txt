This is one of the first places in Queen Creek that I've found worth mentioning on Yelp. In fact, If you like Olive Oil this is heaven on earth for you! The building looks like an industrial garage when you pull up, but they have done wonders inside. Stop by for lunch, a glass of wine, and take home a bottle of their high-quality olive oil.
