I can't say enough about this shop.  We brought my daughter-in-law's car here when we heard her brakes squeaking.  We explained that we needed the car to be safe but didn't have a lot of money.  They looked it over and told us what needed to be done right away and gave us a list of repairs they thought could wait a little while.  The service tech was so professional and seemed to genuinely care.  He took the time to highlight the items on the list that should be watched and put a star by the future service items that should be done next.  I have a feeling that if we had been at another shop, we would have been told that all the items needed to be done right away.  Thanks Brake Masters for being so honest and professional!
