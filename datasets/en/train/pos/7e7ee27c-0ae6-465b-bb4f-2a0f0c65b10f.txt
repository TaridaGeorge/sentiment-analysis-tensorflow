I went to Central Car Car for the first time today to get an oil change, and this place is GREAT! The owner, Paul, is very friendly and patient...definitely has a family-owned vibe! The waiting room is clean and comfortable, and they are not pushy at all (like most other car places I have been to). I am so happy to have finally found my neighborhood car place and will for sure return the next time my car needs servicing.
