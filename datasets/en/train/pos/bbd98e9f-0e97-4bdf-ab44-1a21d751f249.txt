Being a Vegetarian for a long time, my husband and I are always looking for a great place to eat and were so lucky to find this jewell!   After walking mill avenue and not finding anything exciting, we came across Desert Roots Kitchen.  This is a top notch vegan restaurant.  I asked as I entered for a menu, which they said we don't have one our selection changes daily!.  The choices were fantastic and the owner wonderful!.  After we received our food, they came out to make sure that everything was going well.   

Be aware that this restaurant is tucked away, so look closely for it...you will not be disappointed.
