An amazing place to eat. I lived in the south for about 6 months, so when i first went here and heard accents, and obvious displaced southern folk, i knew this place was gonna be good. Everything i have eaten here is delicious, and the staff are incredibly friendly. Do yourself a favor and check this place out. and if you feel bad you can go burn off what you ate at LA fitness next door
