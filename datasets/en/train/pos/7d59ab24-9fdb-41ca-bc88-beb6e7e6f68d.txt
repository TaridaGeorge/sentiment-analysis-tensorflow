I love this place. 
I've been going to Dutch Bros for about a year, and I have literally never had a bad coffee from them.I went through about a month or two of experimenting, and I love the creations that the baristas come up with.
They always have great service and are pretty quick to drive through.
I love how they have stamp cards for regulars like myself. they have whats called "double stamp tuesday" and after getting 10 coffees, you get the 11th free. they also have a service where you can get weekly texts or emails on specials that they are running.
I definitely recommend to everyone that I meet to give them a try, and they have never been disappointed.
