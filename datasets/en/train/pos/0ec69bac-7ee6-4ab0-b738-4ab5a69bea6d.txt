Do you like things that are delicious?  What about things that are cool?  Or how about friendly people? You know. Cute girls/guys? Or maybe you like really tasty coffee? What about an establishment with good taste in music? No? Not into those things?

Well shoot.  I don't really know if you'd enjoy Giant Coffee then.
