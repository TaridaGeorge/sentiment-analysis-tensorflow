I have tried about 6 chinese food places in Mesa and they all sucked. I had given up on the possibility of having delicious chinese food until my boss referred me to this place. I got the sesame chicken which had a perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The crab puffs were super good the filling had an awesome taste and they use a thicker wonton than most place which I liked. Don't let the fact that it looks like a crap hole on the outside drive you away.
