I live in California and was looking for a local florist in Phoenix to send a friend an arrangement, I looked on Yelp and found the Garden of England Flower shop and decided to give them a call. 
I want to thank all the people that recommended this florist! When I called the owner answered and was very friendly, she made some suggestions for the arrangement and scheduled the delivery for the same day. I didn't see the arrangement but I did get a call from my friend a few hours later thanking me for the "gorgeous floral arrangement". I will definitely use Garden of England again if I ever need so send flowers in the Phoenix area again and I highly recommend this florist.
