I love this library. It is huge and very modern, but easy to navigate. The librarians and staff are all friendly, patient and helpful. There are the usual resources (computers, wifi, printers, etc) and there is plenty of it. I've done quite a few papers here when the internet at my apartment was down. Also a huge selection of movies (lots of interesting foreign classics) and a quick self checkout. Plenty of parking and I've enjoyed quite a few exhibits in the front gallery during First Fridays.
