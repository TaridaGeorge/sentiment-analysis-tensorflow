Was in the area so my friend and I came here for lunch.  I ordered the Korean dish, bi bim bap.  It was sooo good!  Just like my mom makes it.  The only difference is the red chili paste sauce they give you is far less spicy then it would normally be.  They modified to satisfy those who are not used to the "ethnic hot" as I like to call it.  I wish they had a location closer to me!  I crave the food here all the time!
