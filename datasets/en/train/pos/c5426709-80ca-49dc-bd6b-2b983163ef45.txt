From jersey shore & Paris Hilton wanna be d-bags to homeless aliens; this place has everything downtown Phoenix can only dream of someday having.
Tons of high end shops & eateries; surround by local dives & haunts.
It beats the other valley areas hands down!
Chandler- Brady Bunch
Phoenix - 9 to 5 crowd & sport events, then bums.
Glendale- why the f@ck were the stadiums built out there again?
Tempe- campus d-bags and BUMS.
Mesa- immigrants, pawn shops & used car lots-boring & rednecky
Gilbert- great place to if your Mormon or into another cult.
