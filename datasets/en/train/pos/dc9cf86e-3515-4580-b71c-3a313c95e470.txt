What a complex for Spring Baseball for the Dodgers and the White Sox !!

This is an large complex with multiple fields with the stadium as the center piece. 

Some of the other playing fields for the Cactus League team's are small and great for sitting right on the field to watch a game. This complex is big time.

I like this stadium for being a grand complex ( around 12,000 seats, I would say). You will still find me in the smallest of the playing fields with only a couple hundred people watching the games. Depend what mood I am in.

Good experience
