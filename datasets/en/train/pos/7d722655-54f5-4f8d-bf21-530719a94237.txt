I spend a lot of time here as a remote office. Meghan, the proprietor, is *always* very welcoming and warm. She remembers my standard order, and does not seem to mind that I spend a lot of time working out of her establishment. 

The varieties of coffee is good. The pastries are good. I have not tried one of their sandwiches yet. 

I enjoy the "homey" atmosphere... puzzles, cards, and books.... for the clientele to enjoy. 

I also enjoy supporting a "local" coffee house over a big chain.
