If you want to have the best coffee in the Valley, come here. I've been going here for years. My favorite drink here is horchata with a shot of espresso-it's to die for. When ordering it be sure to call it by it's appropriate name "the dirty-hore".  These guys go straight to the source for their beans and ends up being better for the farmers than Fair Trade standards. Not only that but if you get lucky, you might be able to chat with the kid that roasts the beans in house, he's super knowledgable and it's a very exact science. This place is great for studying or any romantic date. Don't miss the attention to detail in the foam design on their hot drinks, they made me a fern shape one time!
