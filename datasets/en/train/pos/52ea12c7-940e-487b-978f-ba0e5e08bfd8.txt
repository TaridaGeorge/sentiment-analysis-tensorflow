Had the rib tips and Georgia style chopped pork, and it was probably the most amazing BBQ meal I have had in a Looooong time.  I am a fan - a huge fan of daves even more now.  Fall of the bone goodness, and amazing sides.   They took care of us - and there was 9 of us, and we all had full drinks, and never had a want.  Worth the money spent, and will go back to this location soon.
