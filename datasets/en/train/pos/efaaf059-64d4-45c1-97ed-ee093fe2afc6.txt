Been going there for years.  Love the food and the service is great.  When I have my Japanese counterparts in town, that is the only place they want to go for sushi.  If you are looking for a show, sake bombers and assembly line manufactured rolls, this is not the place for you.  If you want fresh fish at reasonable prices, this is the place to go.
