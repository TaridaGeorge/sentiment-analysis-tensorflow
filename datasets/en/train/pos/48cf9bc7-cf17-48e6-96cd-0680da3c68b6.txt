Why are you so far away? 

The best Pho I've had since moving out here from California. Cheap and good, just how I remember it. :) 
The food is usually out pretty fast and portions are generous, for 3 people the total came out to be around 30 something dollars, drinks, spring rolls and pho bowls all around. I'm sure that I'll be returning multiple times.

You know you've hit a gold mine for a pho place when everyone working there has a thick Vietnamese accent and is located in some dingy Asian plaza.
