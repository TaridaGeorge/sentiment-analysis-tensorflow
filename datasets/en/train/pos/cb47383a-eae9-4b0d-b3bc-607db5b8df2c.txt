Dear az88,

I have been a fan of yours for about five years.  I love sipping on French 75's and devouring your delicious dipping fries. Your patio is great on nice AZ nights and your resident dj spins just what I want to hear.  Your eccentric taste in design and furniture is something to come back for - since it changes a lot - but more importantly it's the whole package of food, fabulous servers, rockin' jams and interesting art installations. 

I either want to move in or marry you.

See you soon,

xo! j

P.S. the grilled veggie plate, grilled cheese, hamburgers, galettes, hell's fire chips, four seasons salad, and the s.s.s. - just to name a few items - are fantastic!!
