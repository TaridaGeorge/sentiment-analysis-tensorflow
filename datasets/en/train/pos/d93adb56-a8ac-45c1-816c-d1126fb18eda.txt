This place has amazing breakfast, good coffee, and delicous orange juice! I have only been here twice and im hooked. Inside the decor is old school like 1800s old. It still has some of the original structure built into the roof and high parts of the ceiling walls. For the quailty and quanity of food and service, the price is spot on perfect.
