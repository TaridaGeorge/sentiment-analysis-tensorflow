I have to give Emergency Animal Clinic 5 stars for their care and treatment of my beloved dog, Emma. Grief-stricken and tearful, I rushed into this hospital on a late Saturday afternoon, after coming home to find Emma bitten by another dog in our house in her abdominal/inguinal region. All the staff that I came in contact with from the triage stage through to the subsequent surgery were stellar. They were supportive, understanding and very patient with me. I am a healthcare provider for humans and I know that those qualities are very hard to find in staffing a hospital/clinic/office, etc... I definitely recommend this facility to anyone looking for good, honest, emergent pet care.
