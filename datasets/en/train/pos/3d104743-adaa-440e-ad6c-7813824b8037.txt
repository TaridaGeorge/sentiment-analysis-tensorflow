I cannot say enough great things about Changing Hands. I was lucky enough to live right behind this neighborhood gem for a year, and I could only survive a few days without walking over and exploring. Free wi-fi? Check. An awesome selection of new (and used) books? Check. Author talks and other great creative workshops? Check. Fun, quirky gifts? Check. Direct connection to a delicious sandwich and soup shop? Check, check check! I would send anyone in the Valley to Changing Hands. Find a quiet corner, cozy up with a book that was lovingly cared for by it's previous owner, and relish in the stories that surround you!
