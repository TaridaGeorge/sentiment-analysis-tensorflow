I loved this place. I went alone one day while doing some house searching in downtown Phoenix. I just picked this place randomly not knowing it'd be so yummy! I ordered the salad with chicken, strawberries and panko-crusted goat cheese. It was SO delicious! I ate every bit of it. The chicken was so tender and moist...and sometimes grilled chicken can be quite dry. Not here. The portion size was more than enough for me and the service was great. It was a such a lovely day to boot. I definitely will go back.
