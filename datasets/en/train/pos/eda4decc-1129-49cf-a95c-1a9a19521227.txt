Mmmm...I've heard some okay things about this place so I had to try it out.  Really, just okay?  C'mon this place rocks!  Food was awesome!  I can't handle much spice but my dish was just hot enough where I rather enjoyed it.  DÃ©cor is your typical Thai restaurant look - a lot of traditional artwork and statues of Buddha.  Also, some pictures of local politicians and news reporters with autographs; which is always nice.  This place must bank during lunch hours because of the office buildings close by.  I eat a lot of Thai food and this place is definitely a return place.  Sorry Malee's I love you but you are more of an Americanize Thai joint.  Enjoy!
