Favorite sushi place in Scottsdale! Sushi is fresh, reasonably priced and service is great! Try the JPop and the Samurai Warrior. They have a really good happy hour, $1 Saki...can't beat that lol and they have happy hour on Sunday! The Saki infused drinks are tasty as well. The vegi wraps are pretty good too. Try the Karaoke there for groups!  They have heated toilet seats in the bathroom which is a plus! Be aware of the giant green rock in the middle of the restaurant if you've had too many saki...I don't know why it's there but can be hazardous haha.
