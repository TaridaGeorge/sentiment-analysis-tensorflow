What can I say... Tops has the location and the selection.  Whether you want to drink cheap on naty ice light and boone's farm, or get all snooty with some Belgium beers, fine wine, or high end spirits, Tops has got your back.  The dudes that work there are cool and now their stuff.  They know the stock, where it's at, and can give a good suggestion to an overwhelmed prospective buyer... the amount of booze in this place pretty much stops everyone in their tracks the first time they roll in.  Top's pricing competes with circle K's and supermarkets as well.
