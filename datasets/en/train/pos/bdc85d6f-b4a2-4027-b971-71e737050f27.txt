Liberty Market is by far my favorite restaurant in the Valley. Everything I have eaten has been fantastic, the featured burgers are always my favorite. Fabulous pizzas and sandwiches and cinnamon rolls as big as your head! The food is so fresh and they have a way of taking something simple and making it something extraordinary!

The atmosphere is really awesome, it's just so... cool. Everyone who works here is so nice and always makes sure we are happy with everything. I just love it!

If I had to complain about something, it would be that the menu isn't really made for kids. There are no smaller options for kids at all. Of course you could always share and that's what we do with our toddler, but we can only do that so long before we are spending as much on her dinner as our own.
