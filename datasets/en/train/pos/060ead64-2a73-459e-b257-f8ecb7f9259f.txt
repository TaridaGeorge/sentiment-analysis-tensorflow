Holy smokes. This is awesome.

I'm so happy we ran into some other yelpers that talked this place up. You enter in speakeasy style - you call, wait, and someone comes to get you. They ask for any allergies, and then you're on to drinking heaven.

The drinks are different in a good way. It's all about the melding of things you wouldn't normally try in an amazing presentation. Take the Dunkin' Pumpkin'. It's bourbon, served warm, with a pumpkin butter 'dipper'. You'd stir the pumpkin butter until melts down into your drink. Continue to stir with the rock candy center to add sweetness. It was fantastic . I also had the 'Other side of the Pillow.' It was elegant, herby, and wonderfully refreshing.

Overall, the evening wasn't cheap, but worth every penny.
