I'd planned to stay here one night during My Great Tri-State Tour, but ended up here for two nights.  This is an excellent hotel and should be on the cover of that missing but really needed book called How To Build and Run A Hotel For Dummies.

High points:
* All staff actually acknowledged my existence with a "good morning," etc... even the housekeepers sneaking a smoke near my room,  
* Cool-looking modern architecture with big open public spaces, and big-ass room,
* Only $129 a night... WTF?
* Grassy courtyard just outside the bar,
* Free front-row parking in the adjacent uber-mall/stadium parking lot,
* $2 Bloody Marys and Negra Modelos in the adjacent uber-mall... OK, I'll save details on that for another establishment's review.

Nice work, Renaissance people!
