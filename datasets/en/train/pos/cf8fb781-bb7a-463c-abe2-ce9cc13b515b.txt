We have been eating at Sesame Inn since we moved here six months ago.  We do not eat meat and are so happy with the tofu offerings.  We particularly like the Spicy Thai Basil Tofu.  Hearty, spicy, vegetables that are al dente and the tofu is cooked just right.  The service is always excellent. Food is always hot off the stove and consistent in its preparation.  We are "regulars" now.
