All Californians love the In&Out.. and after a stressful ASU loss a couple weeks back.. I had to get my burger on.. These workers are the happiest I have seen.. I love their red aprons and have always wondered, 'How can I get a big safety pin like that'?? LOL.. doesnt take much I guess to make me happy.. just a cheeseburger...and fries.. and oh yeah.. Id love the big red safety pin and red apron too! :-)
