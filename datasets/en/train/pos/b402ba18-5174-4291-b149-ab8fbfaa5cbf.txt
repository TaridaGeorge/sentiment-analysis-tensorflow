I'm a big fan of Camelview.  Nowhere else in greater Phoenix will you find the indie art-house selection they have here.  I've seen many of my favorite films here over the last 3 years, almost by default because other cineplexes won't show them.

The average age of patrons here is about 53, but it doesn't stop me.   I just wear mahogany loafers sans-socks, pleated bermuda shorts and a Tommy Bahama shirt and I blend right in.  The get-up looks hot too.

The facility itself is rather small and dumpy compared to newer suburban joints, but I like it.  Closer restrooms and easier-to-access concessions owes itself to the smaller scale.  It's always pretty busy, but come Oscar season it can be a MADHOUSE. 

4.5 stars.  But if there were a Laemmle's theater here, Camelview would have a serious run for its money.
