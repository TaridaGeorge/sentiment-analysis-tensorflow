This salon does not elicit 1 star.  Upon entering, I was greeted very warmly by the staff.  Heather was my stylist and she was very welcoming, took the time to understand my desired look - and not only executed perfectly, but added a bit of freshness to my typical style.  Additionally, not sure how the previous review claimed "unsanitary".  This salon is impeccably well-maintained with a great atmosphere.
