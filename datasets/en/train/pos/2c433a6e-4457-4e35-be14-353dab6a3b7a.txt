This is one of my favorite dive bars in the area. There is sports stuff all over the walls, great drink specials and daily food specials, and some of the best wings in the valley. Rick, Jeff and the rest of the staff are all super nice and the bar has a really homey feel to it. Be aware, the bar is known to be haunted and sometimes weird things happen when you are there. Sit back, order some wings, down some beers, and try not to get attacked by a ghost.
