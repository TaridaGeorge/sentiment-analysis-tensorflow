This was some of the best food I have had in a restaurant.  It has a very home-cooked quality.  The mushroom sauce on the chicken schnitzel was so good.  The Swedish meatballs were very flavorful.  I like that you can choose up to 4 sides with each dish so that you can get a good taste for all the different items on the menu.  We can't wait to go back and try the Flying Jacob dish, but it takes 45 minutes to prepare.  Although this restaurant is very casual and not fancy at all, it can get quite crowded on a weekend evening so be prepared to reserve a table in advance.  Also, bring your own wine/beer.  There is a $5 corking fee which is waived if you bring your own glasses.
