Wonderful! You can't go wrong here!  From the drinks, to the ambiance, to the food - top notch!  
First let me correct earlier posts by saying they serve small plates.  So you need to order about 3 per person for a full meal.  There are only about 4-6 pieces on each plate to you won't get full if you only order 2 dishes.  
We started with the Teeter Tots - panko crusted tofu in a sweet/spicy sauce. I think I could have ordered these all night long.  
The pork buns, grapfruit w/ himachi, steamed clams,  and the curry lamb were all amazing.  
I don't have a single complaint.  oh and they have a great beer selection - the sweet potato (I don't remember the name) was awsome.
