They have free wi-fi. Yes! I usually eat here when I don't feel like cooking breakfast at home or before hiking with friends. 
 I've always had good service here and  I don't know why people are hating the place. Our service has always been pleasant and food is good. I love that they have Stevia sweeteners instead of that dangerous pink aspartame stuff. 
This place is now called "The Good Egg", so maybe the bad ratings are from the Eggery. 
They now have Hazelnut coffee which is great and they have stamp cards for frequent guests. 
My friend Sage has already gotten 4 free breakfasts here 'cause they are so easy to accumulate and the breakfast prices are reasonable. 
I think people need to give this place another chance. It's no longer called the Eggery, so maybe the rude waitress is gone.
