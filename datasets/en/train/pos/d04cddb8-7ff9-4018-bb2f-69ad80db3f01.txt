Yesssshhh ! Cocina like its made in Mexico, and by that I mean the food court is authentic and yummy. The amount of meat selection is just huge and I mean replete with Tripe, Tongue, Blood slabs and all that.
The Panaderia is huge as well...... "heaven"

The condiments are nice and spicy (not overt but just a little over the edge)

The prices for the groceries are pretty decent as well. Have to come back here for the avocados
