Wow!  What a great bagel!  We found this place from a coupon in Savvy Shopper.  I think they have one of the best bagels I've ever tasted!  Seriously.  We were talking to one of the owners and she said we should try taking a 1/2 dozen to go.  She told me to try freezing the bagels - when I am ready to have one, just pull it out an hour or so before we're going to eat it.  I'm not big on frozen foods - but decided to give it a try.  I'm not kidding - we had one this morning and it was as good today as the day we ate one in the restaurant.  Very fun!  My teenage son now has a quick meal for the mornings before school!  I definitely recommend this place.
