whoa!! 
this was a great treat.  i hear some buzz, i read some reviews....i tried it, and i loved it.  sunny on the inside.  over easy all around!  extra friendly staff, my waitress did a rhyme and dance when i ordered the wolfpack breakfast !  awesome.  i like to look for the "best bite" when i'm really enjoying a meal.  i thought one bite midway was unbeatable...  i was wrong cuz i said to my friend the last bite gave me slight chills and a pang along my jaw line.  all the best bites i could handle.  if you want extra crisp hash browns, this would be the place to get em.  whew!  i won't eat till tomorrow.  starch overload and satisfied till i get to go again!
