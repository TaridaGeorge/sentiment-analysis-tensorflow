This is my favorite place at Mekong Plaza. Their Bun Bo Hue, a noodle soup with beef and blood pudding, is actually better than some of the versions I had in Vietnam: very beefy with lots of fresh herbs on the side. It's a large portion for a good price. I would review their other dishes but I just can't help ordering Bun Bo Hue every time I go :-)
