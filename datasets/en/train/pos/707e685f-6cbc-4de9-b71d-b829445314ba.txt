When it comes to Trader Joes, I think this location really takes the cake.  Even with it being across the parking lot from Whole Foods, the place is always busy and always full of happy employees.  I enjoy their fruit section which is not something I usually find appealing at other Trader Joes.  

Great selection
Great produce
Plenty of parking
Friendly employees
