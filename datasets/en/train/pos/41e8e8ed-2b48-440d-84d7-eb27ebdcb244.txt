I loved the service at the Mac counter. The girl that helped me I didn't catch her name. Damn. She helped me get the look I was going for and made my eye brows look amazing. All the girls working there were nice and easy to talk to. One of the better mac places to shop at so far my favorite service wise. They were out of my eye brow pencil that I came in looking for but I got to get everything I needed for my eyes and the tips I needed to make it look amazing when I get home.
