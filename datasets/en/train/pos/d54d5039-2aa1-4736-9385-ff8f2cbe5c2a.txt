The fish that they use is pretty decent.  It's not the freshest, but for the price it's definitely not bad.  I love the concept of this place, and the staff is really pleasant and patient.  What was a big selling point for me was all of the gluten free options.  Their menu is clearly labeled, and all of the soy sauce is gluten free as well.  The person behind the counter also was sure to verify any ingredients that he wasn't sure of instead of simply guessing.  I was very impressed.  And the total for my hubby and I?  under $20.
