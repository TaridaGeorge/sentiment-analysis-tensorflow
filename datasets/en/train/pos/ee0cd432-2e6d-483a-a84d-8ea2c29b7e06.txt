I'm straight. It's my cross to bear. 

And as I texted my friend tonight, it takes a comfortable heterosexual male to venture to a gay bar alone. I go almost every Monday night. I love Bao the nail guy. God, I hope that's his name. I love the Martinis. Try the rose tea martini. Like nothing else. 

Here's the most impressive part of Amsterdam for me personally. I have gone there regularly on Monday nights and a very occasional Friday or Saturday nights and I've never been hit on. Not one time. I attribute this to one of two potential reasons: I'm hideous and shouldn't venture out in public or these dudes have really good gaydar. Either way, I've never been uncomfortable there as an open-minded breeder. My friends are a different story.
