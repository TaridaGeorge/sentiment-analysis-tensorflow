GREAT used bookstore.  They have a wonderful selection of used books, and many of them are obscure and/or out of print books of various genres (their history, and particularly local and Western US history sections are especially impressive).  The woman who works here (seems to be the owner) was extremely friendly and knowledgeable.  It was cluttered but well organized, with just the right amount of "messiness" - not so messy that you'd trip over something, but plenty of character so you'd never mistake it for a Borders.  I live near Boston and went to college in Amherst, Massachusetts - areas known for their great numbers of high-quality used bookstores - and this one honestly is one of the better used bookstores I've ever been to.  And it wouldn't be a complete used bookstore without a resident cat, which of course this one has.
