I don't normally opt for sandwiches, being gluten-intolerant and all, but this place makes such yummy sandwiches that I find myself craving it. Even worse, it's walking distance to my house... Here come the cramps! It is so worth it though... Turkey and Brie, Doughboy, you name it...

Also, they have great German side dishes. When I am too lazy to cook (more often than not) and I am required to bring side dishes to Mom's home (the full-German Grandma), this is where I head. Warm German Potato Salad.... delectable!
