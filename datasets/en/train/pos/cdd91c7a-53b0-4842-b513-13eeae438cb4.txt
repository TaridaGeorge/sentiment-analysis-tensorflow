Great friendly staff!!  They are always helpful and smiling!  I was talking with a girl there making a decision on what I wanted to try ( I wanted to try something other then my usual)  she recommended the 5 fruit smoothie, I am now OBSESSED!! The owner seems like a pretty nice guy too, I was in there one day and he was messing around with the staff.... Just gave me a good feel to know they have fun where they work, makes me enjoy giving them business!
