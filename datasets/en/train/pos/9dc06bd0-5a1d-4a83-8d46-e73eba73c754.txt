The Tuck Shop's owners have done something absolutely right. They have taken a modern space within a quiet transitional neighborhood, and turned it into a hip and delicious find, that if your not looking for it, you may just drive right by. 

Great places, with excellent food & ambiance should be hard to find. There shoudn't be a giant blinking neon sign, you should just happen upon it because your friend told you the secret route. The Tuck Shop delivers with top quality and innovative foods filling their menu, and thats the reward for your journey.

After visits on three different occasions, I can honestly say that for independent restaurants destinations here in the Valley, Tuck Shop is at the top of my list.
