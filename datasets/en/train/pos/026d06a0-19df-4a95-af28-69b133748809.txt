Love this place!  IT is by far THE best Whole Foods in town!  It is the size of a Wal Mart almost and has a smoke house, beer bar and much more!  I LOOOVEEE THIS PLACE!!!  It is a great place to shop if you have any special diet needs as well, they have a whole gluten free section and anything else you could imagine for a special diet.
