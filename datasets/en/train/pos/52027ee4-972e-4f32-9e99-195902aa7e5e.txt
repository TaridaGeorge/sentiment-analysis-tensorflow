I love this Trader Joe's. The location could not be any better given that it is located right next to LA Fitness where I end up after a hard workout.
The staff is exceptional friendly (Kat, Jade ,Andrea, Kamal,Betty ,Joey Lance............ 5 Stars to all of you!!)
Best selection of cheeses and wines and the TV dinners are also awesome.
Betty keep up the good work serving those dishes and Kat thanks for the wine.
I 'll be back for more.
