What a cute little vintage shop! I can't believe I haven't stopped in sooner. The owner was a nice gal and she had a lot of great stuff packed in the space, such as: mens clothing and accessories (cuff links, tie claps, and the like), womens clothing, jewelry, hats, purses, glasses, and broaches to name a few. I will definitely be back for my vintage fill in the future!
