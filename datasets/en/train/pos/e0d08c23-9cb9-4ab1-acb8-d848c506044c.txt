Last time we went here was a few years back when this establishment wasn't doing the best. We went back here about a week ago and we were pretty content with what we got.

The food was good. The bloomin onion is much much better than Texas roadhouses' and their steaks are just as delicious too. Their house salad, however, could've used some improvements, but I was really more interested in the entree itself.

 The waitress we had could've cut back on the side serving though, as my mother requested mint jelly with her lamb and was given more than enough! That is money going right into the trash.

Otherwise their carrot cake and key lime pie were pretty good, and their food was good as well! We will be back.
