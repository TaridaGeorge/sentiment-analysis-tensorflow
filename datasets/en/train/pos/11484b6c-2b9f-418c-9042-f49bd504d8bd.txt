Butter & Me is wonderful!  I write a cupcake bakery mystery series and when I was looking for a cupcake bakery to bake cupcakes to match the the cupcakes on the cover of my book for an event, Butter & Me was recommended to me by a friend.  I emailed them right away.  Kelly was fantastic.  I sent her a picture and we talked flavors.  The price was incredibly reasonable. The cupcakes looked exactly like the cover, they were delicious and they were delivered to the book signing in plenty of time.  The crowd loved them and so did I.  They made my book signing perfect!  Highly recommend!
