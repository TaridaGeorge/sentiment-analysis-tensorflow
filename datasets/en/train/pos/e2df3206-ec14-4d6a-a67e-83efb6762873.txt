Awesome place! Always cool, great atmosphere, classy people!

I used to go here everyday after work and relax in the grass! It's an amazing place to go with a friend or family, especially on Monday nights, when they show movies on the lawn! The misters work the best out of any location in this state! It's always cool, and surreal, like heaven. This would be a supreme place to have date.

You'll see how life in America (heck, this whole planet) should be at this mall. No drama, happy faces, disciplined children, respectful citizens, good times, multi-cultural, classy, upscale, etc.

I love this place, not because of the shops, but because of the people, atmosphere, great landscaping and most of all the misters! You wouldn't be disappointed if you're professional, middle-aged and looking for a daily spot to relax.

Lovely place!
