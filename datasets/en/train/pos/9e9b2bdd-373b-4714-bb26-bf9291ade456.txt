The Lucky Strike has been our go-to to kick off nights downtown. The atmosphere and crowd are very fun. The bartenders were very friendly when I asked about a new drink recommendation and the waitresses were very prompt and kept a good eye on my party. The DJ was great as many of us noted were noting through the night the good mix of music being played. I have yet to have had any complaints about my time here!
