I love this place! The choose 2 option is only $7.99 and you get a ton of food! Large selection of salads or you can create your own by choosing from the greens and add-ins. All of the sandwiches I've tried so far are good and they've got a lot to choose from. I've only tried a couple soups so far but they'll offer you samples of any you want to try. They include a piece of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. Good selection of fountain drinks as well and syrups to make Italian sodas.
