Got a basic four piece. Cole slaw is banging, fries are crinkle cut, comes with a kind of r√©moulade sauce, or a spicy ranch, that is really good. Chicken had been sitting in a steambox for a while, I was just about to get grumpy, when dude came over and asked if everything was okay..you know me..lol. I told him everything was great but the chicken, he ran back, and brought me 4 fresh pieces that were juicy but not rubbery. Place has a disco ball, and a bose sound system, playing all the crappy house covers you can imagine, I figure they support gay marriage..lmao
