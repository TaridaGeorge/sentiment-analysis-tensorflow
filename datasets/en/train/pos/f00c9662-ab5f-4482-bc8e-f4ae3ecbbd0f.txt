I needed a haircut and a shave. It is 5:50 on a Wed. Those lame chain barber wannabe's won't do it right. I found Buzz Boyz on google and made the drive. First thing I see is that this place is serious about what they do. Old School barber chairs, Wood all around, and TV's everywhere I look. Jonathan the Owner and Barber offers you a cold drink when you walk in (Amazing). The service is top notch. I got a hair cut.. a hot lather shave.. and walked out with my wallet not feeling like it was drained. This is my new barber.
