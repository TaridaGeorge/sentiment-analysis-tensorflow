Dropped in today for #SMUNCH with @SMUNCHPhoenix.

I think I am in love!

Had the Bananas Foster French Toast, and the Sawmill Gravy with Biscuits.

Wow.

The french toast is indescribably delicious! The bananas foster topping is simply delectable, and the thick-sliced challah bread makes for a treat of epic proportions!

Plus, the full order of french toast is a meal for two! Huge!

For the kids, we ordered the PB&J french toast, half order.

They couldn't even finish it!

We sat outside, near the bar. The verandah was PERFECT!

Local Breeze is one of the places that make me wish I could live downtown.

Well done!
