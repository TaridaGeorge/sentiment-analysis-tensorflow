Every time I'm out in Phoenix, I HAVE to stop off at Wildfish Seafood Grille for dinner.  I had the Wildfish Chopped Salad with Crab and Shrimp and it was delicious.  I also ordered the small truffle mac and cheese and bacon shallot brussel sprouts and both were very good too.  Great service and great food!
