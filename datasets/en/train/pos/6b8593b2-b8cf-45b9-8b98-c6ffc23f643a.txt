Most delicious breakfast ever! The breakfast bowl made your way is massive in size and tastebud-electrifying. There are about a million different things you can add. I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu. Tasty diner/homestyle food made with fresh and organic ingredients... Staff is super friendly and fun singing orders on the mic too. Another successful Hippie joint!
