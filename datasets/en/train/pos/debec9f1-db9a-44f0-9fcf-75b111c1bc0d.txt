mmmmmmmm....


I friggin love this place.  The greatest damm subs in the whole world. straight from NJ.  I moved here about 4 years ago from NJ and missed this place so damm bad.

It is a little overpriced, but the fresh ingrediants are so far and above any other sub place out here it makes it worth it.

Whether you get a #11, a Cheesesteak, or a Turkey Provolone and Bacon, you will not go wrong.

Wow my mouth is watering right now.
