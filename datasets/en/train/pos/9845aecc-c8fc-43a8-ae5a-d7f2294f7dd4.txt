This is the way food should taste!!  I remember eating tomatoes right out of my grandmother's garden and the organic fruits and vegetables from Boxed Greens taste just as fresh!!  Things from the store just are not the same or as healthy for you.  The earl ybird option for us works great.  Like getting fresh milk "back in the olden days".  (not that I'm that old).  If there is ever a problem I can call them up and the friendly staff is willing to solve the problem right away. You won't go wrong by making the healthy   choice by ordering from Boxed Greens!!
