Good local brewery--nice to see a place like this in downtown Chandler. Beer is really good (recommend the sampler--try them all). Food is fairly good. Really like the beer battered fries. Everyone should give them a try!

Updated to 5 stars - July 2012 - We eat semi frequently here. And I would say that over the past 6+ months their food has greatly improved. The mahi tacos are delicious. So are the turkey sandwiches, grilled cheese, burgers, jalepeno caesar salad, fries. The kids turkey sandwich/meal is also really good (real bread, real turkey, big sandwich). Beer is still good, but now the food is really good!
