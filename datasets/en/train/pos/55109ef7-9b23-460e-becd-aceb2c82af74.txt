My friend and I stopped on our way home from work and when we got out of the car we could smell the fresh baked bread all the way out into the parking lot.  The aroma was so inviting.  I was craving a Concha and believe me it was the best I've had here in Arizona.  My friend is a huge flour tortilla fan and the ones she bought at this bakery were really really good according to her.  I'm sure I'll be stopping here often.
