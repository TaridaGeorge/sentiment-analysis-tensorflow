Bought a groupon deal for my son and his roommates. Since I dont live in the area i called the shop to find out the details before purchasing the deal.  The staff was great!!!  They were very nice and answered all my questions. The boys went close to closing time  but the staff still attended to them with great services. My son said the sandwiches were great and full of meat.  I am very glad that I can purchase a deal and have someone far away utilize the service with no worries.  Therefore they deserve my 5 stars
