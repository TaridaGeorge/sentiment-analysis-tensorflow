Wow!  I have not been to a gelato shoppe as excellent as Frost. The range of interesting flavors with the classics is impressive. Plus the presentation is beautiful. And you can sample it all. Big samples too!  

The service is impeccable. Super friendly. One of the ladies stopped cleaning to talk to me and my husband for 15 minutes about the products and the business. You can tell everyone enjoys working there. She even remembered what we both were eating 20 minutes after ordering. She was extremely knowledgable. 

I WiLL be back
