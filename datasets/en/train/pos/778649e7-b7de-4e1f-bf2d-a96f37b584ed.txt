TAMALES BITCHES....

Man this place has awesome tamales. If you eat nothing else here (and you should try all the other delicious food) eat the green and red tamales. They are really the best. You can make a meal out of the chips and tamales. You won't regret it.

This place is famliy run. The waiter (the father) is impossible to understand (just smile and nod)...but the food is unique, fresh, tasty and very reasonble.  Pretty easy to get a table. Very casual. Scary strip mall...right next to the nicest Taco Bell I have ever seen.

Try the coconut flan cake for dessert. Really good.  And check out the unique beers. I really enjoy both Quilmes and Xginu (sp?).
