This is the type of place that Phoenix needs more of.  Their selection of clothing is great for both Men and Women.  I stopped in here on a First Friday right before our Arizona Winter came along.  I spotted a bright mustard yellow 3 button, 3/4 sleeve flouncy jacket.  I couldn't live without it.  It was soft and cozy but PERFECT for Arizona weather.  I bought it immediately, lending 110 dollars to our local economy.  I have worn this thing non-stop for the past few months.  Point being the clothes here are very high quality, fashion forward, but not trendy.  They don't stock a lot of everything, so you don't end up seeing every girl on the street looking just like you.  Plus, the owners are great.  Bunky, thanks for making Downtown Phoenix your home.
