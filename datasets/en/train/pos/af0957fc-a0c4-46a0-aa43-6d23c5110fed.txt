Super crowded and chaotic on a busy night; nice and comfy on a slow one.  Either way, it's fantastic.  The vibe is electric and the clientele are bound to be at least half as weird as you are.  This is the perfect place to go  with a friend, or to strike up conversations with strangers, sipping some ice cold beer.
