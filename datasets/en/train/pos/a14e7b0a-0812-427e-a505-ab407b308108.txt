As everyone else seems to review, I would give the service a B. That said, the food is just too good to not give it five stars!! I had the curry shrimp and it was fantastic. Chose medium spicey and it was perfect, but it was spicy so go with the mild if you don't want borderline hot. My wife has been several times and the quality is consistently great. I plan on returning often.
