This place always amazes us.....always fabulous food, always friends attentive service and well worth the drive from Mesa.  There are 2 German restaurants in Mesa but neither are worthy of 2nd visits so we just make the drive and always are glad we did to get the best of the best at Haus Murphy.  Just love the outside area.
