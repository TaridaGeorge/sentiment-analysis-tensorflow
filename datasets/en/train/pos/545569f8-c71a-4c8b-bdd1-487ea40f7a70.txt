Its always happy hour when you have alcoholic ice cream. Loved every flavor, Lee was the nicest owner in Scottsdale. She makes it hard to decide which delicious flavor to go with I couldn't decide. I eventually went with apple pie with spiced rum! Sooo good, And she rotates flavors. I will be back very soon. Go here!!!
