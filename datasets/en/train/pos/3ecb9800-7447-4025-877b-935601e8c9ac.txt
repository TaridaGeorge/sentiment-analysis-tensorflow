Yum! Zoe's Kitchen is a healthy, inexpensive and casual spot for lunch. 

My boyfriend and I split the Chicken Roll-ups and the Steak Roll-ups - both were very tasty and came with dipping sauce and a side. And the homemade chocolate chip cookies were delicious - soft, chewy, and lots of chocolate chips.
