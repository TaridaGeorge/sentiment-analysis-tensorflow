I purchased a buywithme.com coupon to get my first ever shellac polish.  Glenda (the technician) is located in the Salon Boutique in suite #32.  When you walk in, you think your inside a mini mall, as each suite is set up as an individual work station for hair stylists, nail technicians, etc.  

Upon meeting Glenda, I was offered a glass of complimentary wine, which was delightful.  (She sure knows the way to my heart)  I opted for the black shellac polish as Halloween is nearing, and my nails look so happy!  They are literally smiling at me!  She took her time doing my nails and made sure they were perfect!  

I would highly recommend coming here because she delivers quality service at a great price.  (623) 329-9443.
