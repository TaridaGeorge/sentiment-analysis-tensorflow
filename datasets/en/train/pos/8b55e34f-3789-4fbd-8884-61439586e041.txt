I love this place for breakfast.  Everything I have ever ordered has been good.  I normally stick to my Eggs Benedict (I get the California style w/ avocado and tomato) and call it good.  But here I have tried the breakfast burrito, the whole wheat pancakes, the protein pancakes, the huevos rancheros, the veggie omlette, chocolate chip pancakes, and it was all good!  Yeserday I saw they have a pumpkin pancake, I think I'll wait for the holiday spirit to hit me before I try that one, but I'm sure it will be awsome.  If I had to gripe, I wish they had a bar for mimosa's and Bloody Mary's, but I should probably cut down on my morning drinking anyway.
