This place is the SHIT. The flavours are actually unbelievably heavenly (the most notable variety I tried was the oatmeal cookie, and it was far better than any actual oatmeal cooke I've ever eaten), there are an amazing array of toppings, and I was honestly surprised at how cheap it was. I had a decent portion for something like $5, and I've gone to places that charged double that price for the same amount. This place needs to haul ass to Tucson asap.
