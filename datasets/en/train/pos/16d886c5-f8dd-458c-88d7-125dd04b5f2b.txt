I got to see a show at the Music Theater inside the MIM.  What a treat!  The theatre is beautiful, and the acoustics are amazing.  It reminds me a lot of the Ikeda Theatre at Mesa Arts Center, but it's a bit more intimate (500 seats instead of 1,600).

I haven't been to the museum itself, but I'm hoping to come back soon to check it out as well.

The design of the grounds and buildings is really beautiful.
