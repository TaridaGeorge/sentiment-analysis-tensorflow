So as expected I have nothing but good things to say about Postino Arcadia. In fact it would be silly for me to comment since it will be a repeat of what everyone else has already said. So I'll just say its a great place to hang out, drink great wine, eat yummy food and soak up the vibe. Must haves are: bruschetta, salted caramel sundae and the pub board.
