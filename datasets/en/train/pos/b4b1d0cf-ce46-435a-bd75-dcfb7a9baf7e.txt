I went here for brunch based on the recommendation of a trusted friend, and the place did not disappoint! We went around 11 am on a Saturday, so needless to say it was packed. The hostess quoted us a wait time of 15 minutes (grr.. I hate waiting.) But it turned not to be a problem. They have plenty of seating in the front courtyard, and on this day they had a live musician. We sat down and enjoyed the music (a dude strumming his guitar and serenading us with an acoustic version of Nirvana's "Come as you are".) We were soon seated on the patio and promptly served. We shared the pancakes and rum banana french toast. The french toast was definitely the highlight, but the pancakes did not disappoint. For me, Palatte has it all - great food, reasonable prices, and a lovely ambiance.
