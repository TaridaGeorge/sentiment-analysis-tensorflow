Well DUH!

I could eat their bruschetta for days and days. I think the plate is well-priced and perfect for sharing. And the bread is so soft....yummy! Oh yeah, they have wine.

Plus it was where me  my boyfriend went on our first date (and my first time there), so obvs. it holds some sentimental value.
