If I could give Daily Dose 10 stars, I would!! I have been going to this old town favorite since their doors opened and it has turned into my (almost) weekly happy hour, or breakfast spot! Everything on the menu is fantastic, from their southwest breakfast wrap, to their chicken nachos, to their delicious burgers served on a pretzel bun, you really can't go wrong!! Weekend brunch is PACKED, but don't let the wait, scare you off because it is definitely worth it!!
