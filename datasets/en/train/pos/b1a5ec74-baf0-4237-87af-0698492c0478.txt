Love love loved it! I've had the opportunity to sample their food at local festivals but this was my first time to the restaurant.  Seating options include inside and two patios- a louder one off of 7th street and a quieter on at the back of the restaurant.  We ordered the hummus and the chips were perfect accompaniments.  We also spilt the secret BBQ chicken sandwich. Okay this is where I tell you that I am not a vegetarian but thought this was amazing! Also ordered a side of the curry past salad- good add on.
