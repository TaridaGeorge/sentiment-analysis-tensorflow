I have hired Chance to do regulare maintanence  work for me on rental property along with some other work. Chance is very professional, on time, and fairly priced. I really enjoyed being able to "communicate" with him. I can easily reccomend him to anyone for weekly yard maint, as well as more in depth projects.
