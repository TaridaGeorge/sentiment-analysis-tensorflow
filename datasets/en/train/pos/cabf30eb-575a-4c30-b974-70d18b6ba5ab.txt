Fabulous Spring Training/ St. Patrick's Day/ Birthday weekend! I personally loved everything about this hotel. The location is unbeatable - walking distance from everything you can imagine doing in Scottsdale. I loved the colors and decor. My boyfriend asked for an upgrade since it was my birthday and they really went above and beyond to make me feel special. Not only did they upgrade us to a beautiful, spacious suite, they also comped our drinks and apps and gave me flowers and a card! I honestly was extremely impressed with their customer service. I am a Spring Training junkie and will definitely go back every year and stay at The Saguaro!
