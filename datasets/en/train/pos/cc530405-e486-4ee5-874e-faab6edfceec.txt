I love small museum that pack a big punch S.M.O.C.A. delivers a hard conceptual hook. Yeah, the museum closes before one can truly experience Turrell piece but that's modern art for yea ! But what this museum has going for it - is that unlike major institutions that have to caterers to their collection - S.M.O.C.A.  can host cutting edge curatorial projects.

Go, if your in the area...
