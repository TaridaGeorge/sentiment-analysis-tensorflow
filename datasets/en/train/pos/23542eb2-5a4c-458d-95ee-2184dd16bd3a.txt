You'll pay a decent price for your meal but here's how I see it.    You might save a few bucks doing the fine dining thing elsewhere but you are missing the complete experience that T. Cook's has cornered. Yes, the food is great, particularly anything from the sea, but it is the ambiance, service, location, history, and attention to detail that make make this a truly masterful Phoenix experience.
