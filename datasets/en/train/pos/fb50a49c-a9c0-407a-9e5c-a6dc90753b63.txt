Ahi Tuna Tacos...I feel like that should be all I have to say.  

I have been an on and off low-carb dieter for years and consider Chelsea's Ahi Tuna Tacos with a side of cottage cheese to be the closest thing to hedonism a low carber can experience.  The soft taco shells come on the side, so you can just attack the Ahi, a little Guac, and the Taco Fixins without restraint.

This is besides the fact that it's a clean, well managed, high service operation.   You won't be disappointed.
