For a sports bar, Ko's is about as good as it gets. Good food. Very friendly service. They have a dog friendly patio. Reasonable prices for N Scottsdale.  And no matter what your request, the staff will try to help out. This is an important aspect of a sports bar where patrons are all scrambling to get the game they want on the nearest TV. Ko's does a great job of juggling all these requests.
