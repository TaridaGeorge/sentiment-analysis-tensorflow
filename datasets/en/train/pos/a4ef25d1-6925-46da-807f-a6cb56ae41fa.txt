A few years ago my husband bought me a gift certificate for this spa. Oh my god - it was the most beautiful spa I had ever went to! I had a facial and a massage. In addition to that - I got unlimited day usage of their spa stuff! They had a beautiful locker room that had a sauna and jacuzzi in it. An secluded area where you could lay outside - naked! They also had a huge pool out behind the spa where you could just layout and be lazy. Oh- also they had some sitting rooms with magazines, fire places -oh my goodness. It was awesome! AND - the prices weren't that high compared to other spa's in the valley. Check it out if you can!
