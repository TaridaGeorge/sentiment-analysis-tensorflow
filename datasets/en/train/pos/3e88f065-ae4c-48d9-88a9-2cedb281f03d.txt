Mi Cocina Mi Pais is a wonderful Ecuadorian restaurant.  It's a tiny, quaint, family-run affair.  First of all, everything I've eaten here is good.  The sango de camarones is a wonderful shrimp stew.  The argentinian steak was too spicy for me, but they have a less spicy version I loved.  All of the tamales are good, especially the Ecuadorian.  The fish in banana leaves was awesome.   The combination plates were all delicious.  They were out of the coconut flan, so for dessert I had the guanabana confection  which was light and refreshing.  Everyone should eat here!!
