i've been here numerous times. it's very hit or miss. if i knew how to hang cabinets, this would be my store. they have some good stuff, lots of old, not really any good stuff. i've heard people have found top of the line appliances on some occasions. 

this trip we found box of mexican tiles for 15 bucks (at lowe's they cost 4 bucks each), and an old gate that we plan to take apart and make into a bar. 

like i said, sometimes they have good finds and sometimes not. they also take drop-offs mon-sat. Bring a truck because some of the stuff you might buy is very large!
