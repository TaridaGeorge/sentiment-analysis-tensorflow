I couldn't believe my eyes. I went to pick up my take out order from Pita Jungle and oh my, a FRO-YO place (yes I was screaming in my head).  Just a few days ago, I was telling my hubby that Desert Ridge needed a fro-yo place.  I have to have one close by.  Why the 5 stars, because of Pistachio.  I hope they are smart enough to keep that one all the time.  My favorite fro-yo place does, but they are 22 miles away from home.  The place is clean and the space is pretty nice.  As other reviewer said, it will be a great dessert after PJ.  I know my twins will love it.
