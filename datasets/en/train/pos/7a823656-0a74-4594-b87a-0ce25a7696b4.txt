I'm a huge fan of Fresh and Easy because the food there is good, inexpensive, and they have great deals on several items. 

It has the look of yet another hippie market, but in fact it has normal food, does not smell of patchouli oil, and sells products you've heard of before, not just knockoffs emblazoned with the word "organic." Those products are there too, but at least one is given the choice.

Trader Joe's this is not - though the smaller size is roughly the same, it has better selection and will cost a lot less to find food for dinner.
