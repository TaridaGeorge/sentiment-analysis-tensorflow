I was so excited when I received my invitation to this last Yelp Elite Event of 2012.  Lindsey and Tanzy staff really did splendid job!  Tanzy staff did a wonderful job serving and were very gracious and considerate throughout the evening. 

The champagne, wines, apps and many entrees kept coming all throughout the night were so delicious.  If it wasn't time to start the gift exchange, I might just have kept eating.  The gift exchange is already hilarious. I just wanted to give a BIG Thank You to the peeps who got my gift.  You know who you are.  If one gift wasn't enough, we all received a goodie bag from Tanzy with a shaker and iPic passes.  Wow! 

Thanks for a fabulous evening!  I look forward to seeing you again soon.
