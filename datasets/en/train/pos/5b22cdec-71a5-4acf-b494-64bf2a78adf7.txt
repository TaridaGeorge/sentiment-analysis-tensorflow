Went there last week with a friend for lunch.  Yumsters!  She had the caesar salad with chicken and I had the pasta special.  Both were absolutely delish.  Just the right amount of salad dressing and lots of chicken in her salad and my pasta dish was perfect.  I am definitely going there for dinner and/or happy hour.  Oh, yes, we mustn't forget the service.  The server and the hostess were quite friendly, efficient, and professional.
