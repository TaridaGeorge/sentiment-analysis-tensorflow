I really like this place, it has fine ambiance, excellent patio, great selection and very knowledgeable staff/ownership. Dave and his wife do such a nice job of making you feel at home and welcomed. You may have a glass of wine or buy a bottle from the retail store and enjoy it right there. 
Priced right, a real treasure in Fountain Hills..
