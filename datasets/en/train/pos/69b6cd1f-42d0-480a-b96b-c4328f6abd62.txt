After living in Thailand for a while and feasting for pennies, it gets painful to pay American prices for Thai cuisine unless it's top notch. Yupha's really hits that notch. The food is authentic except for the spice rating. Mild at Yupha's can be bland compared to the intensity that was considered mild over there. 

The environment is really pleasant and it's one of the few Thai places  where the staff actually indulge my poor Thai language skills with enthusiasm and a smile.
