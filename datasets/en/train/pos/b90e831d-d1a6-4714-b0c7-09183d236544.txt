Best pizza on the planet!  Wouldn't hesitate recommending this place.

We went for dinner even though we had heard there would be a LONG wait.  Only waited about 20 minutes but was worth the wait.  Best pizza, great service.

Went back for lunch the next day and the manager greeted us by name.  Makes one feel valued;-)
