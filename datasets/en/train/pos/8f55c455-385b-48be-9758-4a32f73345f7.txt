Ah-may-zing.  Oysters? Check.  Bloody marys? Check.  Spiciest shrimp boil ever? Check!!! Depending on the chef, a shrimp boil ordered at level 10/10 on the heat scale truly delivers. I'm a huge chile head; very few dishes deliver that spice I crave. But when I found myself sweating, nose running and mouth ablaze, I knew I was in heaven. The chef told us they use cayenne, habanero and ghost peppers to achieve the level 10. It was nirvana. On top of being spicy, it is actually very flavorful.  Two thumbs up.
