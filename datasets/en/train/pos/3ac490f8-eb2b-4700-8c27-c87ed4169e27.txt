living in san francisco, it's really easy to be chain averse...

but when you're away from san francisco, i say, embrace the good stuff!

Houston's is one of the "good stuff". i'm not a huge meat eater, but i will never say no to their barbequed pork ribs. no gimmicks or frills, they deliver well-marinated, well-portioned, well-serviced ribs -- and other food for that matter. the ambiance is comfortable, and the service was super sweet with a cherry on top. 

when you're away from home, it's nice to know what you'll be getting is that familiar friendly food.
