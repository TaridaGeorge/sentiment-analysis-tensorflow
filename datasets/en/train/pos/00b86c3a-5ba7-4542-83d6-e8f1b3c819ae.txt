You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't stop at the SLICE tent at the Scottsdale market.  I have sampled everything they have to offer and always leave tent with a couple of the offerings.   I want to somehow find a way to be featured on the Food Network's "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" so I can tell the whole world about those coconut Congolais!  INSANE INSANE INSANE!!!!!
