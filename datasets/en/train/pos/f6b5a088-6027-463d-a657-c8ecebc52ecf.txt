THIS IS A GOOD COSTCO.  I've been to quite a few of them and this location is primo!  Stocked really well, clean and nice employees.  The photo center has the best price in digital printing that I know of in town.  The items I need are always stocked and available.  Very much worth the $50 membership fee.
