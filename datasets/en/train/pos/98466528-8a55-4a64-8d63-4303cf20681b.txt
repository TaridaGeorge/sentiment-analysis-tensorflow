Stumbled upon this place by accident. twice!!!

First time i went inside one early evening just because of their great gyro deal.   GOOD FOOD and found out it was a full bar!!!! 

Next time I walked there one evening to get some food and found it was KARAOKE night, 8-10 and all the seniors make great singers.  

good prices and good food and beer
