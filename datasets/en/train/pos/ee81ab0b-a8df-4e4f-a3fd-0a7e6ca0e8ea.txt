A family dinner tradition! My family is from San Francisco but when they come into town I always take them to Tottie's because its always delicious and authentic.  We usually get the Spring Rolls, a curry, and AVOCADO ice cream.  Always good service, I've gotten take out a couple times and once I ordered wrong and they corrected my mistake without charging me :) Definitely go.
