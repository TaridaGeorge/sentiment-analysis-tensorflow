$4 awesome bloody marys on weekends! And $4 bud drafts too. Tons of food, so do your health a favor and split a meal with someone else.

Cooper donates a lot back to our community. A friend of mine from college received a scholarship to Grand Canyon University funded by Alice Cooper. Support local! :)
