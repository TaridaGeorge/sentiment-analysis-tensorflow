i love Lee's and love that Lee is always there to generously offer samples and scoop her delicious booze-infused ice cream! i've visited Lee's several times even bringing in friends and family from out of state and each time we've all had a great experience.

Lee is friendly and helpful and what's more, her treats are super yummy! last time we were in she told us she caters weddings... which sounds like a really awesome idea!

if you're on a nice dinner date in Old Town, Lee's makes a perfect conclusion to a night out. (though, let's face it -  booze-infused ice cream is easily enjoyed anytime, under any circumstance.)
