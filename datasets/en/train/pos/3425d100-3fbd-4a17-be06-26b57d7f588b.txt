Update: This is the closest to the bay area you can get! They really make some real authentic Chinese food! I wrote a low star review about this place due to bad customer service from a certain employee but I hear she quit all by herself and I'm glad management is starting to realize how important customer opinions really are! Kelley is one of the waitress there and she always lights my experience every time I go there! If management can produce more people like her they would be very success! Keep up the good work!
