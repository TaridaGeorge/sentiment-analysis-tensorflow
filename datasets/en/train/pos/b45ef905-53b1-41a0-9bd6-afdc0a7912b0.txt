I failed to find any flaws in my Sushi Roku experience last weekend. 

The designers of this place had a clear vision of what they wanted in mind, and they executed it with complete, meticulous precision. You can dislike that vision if you want, because you hate Scottsdale's douchebaggery or whatever the case may be. But then, I would question why you'd bother to come here in the first place. 

The environment was typical of W's I've seen around the country: upscale, chic, a bit clubby, all the things that attract male douches and female hotties. The service was professional and prompt. The sushi was the best I've ever had in the desert with the glaring exception of Yasu. The bill for four of us was well over 200 bucks before tip, but we left happy because we got what we paid for.
