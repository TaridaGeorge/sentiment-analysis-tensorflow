I love this place and I would go every week if the pocket book approved of it. Which I have several friends who do go every week and love every minute of it! I was in here yesterday afternoon and it was my second time going. I adore the stylish design of the salon and the color scheme as well. My first time going I ordered up the Mia Tai which was a few curls and tame. Yesterday I took on the Cosmopolitan and I must say it made me feel super hot! I received lots of compliments and my sister looked passed me because she was looking for my curly mess! The staff is very friendly and check in with you through out. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!
