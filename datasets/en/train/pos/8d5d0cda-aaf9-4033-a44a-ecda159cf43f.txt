I stopped by at around 8:30 on Wednesday and I was shocked to see the place nearly packed.. On a weeknight! I could have sworn it was a Friday evening. I enjoyed the happy hour menu, the music selection, and the energetic staff. Zipps is a lively place to go, where it's hard not to have a good time.
