Salmon Cesar Salad = the bomb dot com! The salmon is always cooked perfectly. Lettuce is always fresh and they always modify the dish for me! Love the atmosphere and the places is always clean. Good wait staff! I hate the service at the Ahwatukee location (Ray Rd.), so I travel all the way to Mesa to enjoy the Charleston's experience.
