I love Golden Rice Express...I've been eating here for like 15 years, the food has always been consistent, generous portions, and darn good!

This place is NOT fancy, (but it is CLEAN) it is a quick sit down place to grab lunch or order take-out for dinner. The prices are very reasonable for the portions. The beef is very tender (most places have chewy or tough beef, NOT here!)

Try any of the entries from the "Chef's Specials", many are different stir-fry dishes served over rice or pan-fried noodles. My favorite is the #815 (shrimp with veggies)... for $6.25...WOW! The portion is very generous! 

The service is ALWAYS friendly! (which is very rare at Chinese restaurants)...eat here and you'll become a regular!
