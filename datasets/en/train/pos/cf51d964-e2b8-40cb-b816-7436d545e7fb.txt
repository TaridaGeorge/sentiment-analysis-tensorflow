I visited this place a couple of times with Phoenix-area friends, the interior is pleasant though almost a bit too slick/trendy for my tastes, they also have a nice outdoor dining area (heated during chillier winter evenings). All the sushi & maki I tried were very good, they really ought to have some combo/sampler platters on their menu to help those who are not sushi-literate or just can't make up their minds. The menu offers other entrees for non-sushi people. For dessert, I recommend strolling over to the gelato place just south of Zen 32.
