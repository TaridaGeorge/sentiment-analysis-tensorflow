So glad we stumbled upon this place while we were visiting from California. Four Peaks was very good! The beer was extremely tasty & I don't usually care for beer. The food was also really tasty. I had the portobello veggie sandwich on beer bread and the stout-tiramasu. Both were delicious! I will definitely go back when I return to Tempe, AZ. The waitress was also very attentive & the atmosphere was fun!

The only bad thing @ Four Peaks is the parking! There isn't a lot, only street parking. 

The prices were very reasonable & it seemed like a really fun hangout for the locals & ASU students.
