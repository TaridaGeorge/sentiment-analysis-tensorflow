I have been coming to Kona for a very long time and what keeps me coming back is the great food, awsome happy hours and great staff that work here. 

You really can't go wrong with this place, try the happy hour from 3pm to 7pm or reverse happy from 9pm to 11pm Mon-Thur & Friday & Sat from 10pm to 12pm. 

The managers are great here, Shadi when managing runs a tight ship here.

Breana, Brett, Joe and Russ are awsome bartenders.

Gina, Jen, Sarah and Heather are great wait staff.
