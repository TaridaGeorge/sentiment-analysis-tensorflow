I love Sprouts.  They sell the best fruits and vegetables.  All are fresh, some are organic and the prices are reasonable.  They have all the veggies and fruits you could possibly want, without all the added pesticides you might find on the produce at supermarkets.

But that's not all.  They also have tons of vitamins and they're often having good sales on them, so you'll save some money that way.  And they have a small frozen foods section as well as some organic groceries, like macaroni and cheese, cereal and canned foods.  

Their deli section is impressive too.  Their sandwiches are delicious, but you can also buy ready-to-eat items out of their refrigerated section that are really good too.  

If you check with the store, they can tell you of any upcoming classes that are holding there, they range from classes on healthy living to beating depression.
