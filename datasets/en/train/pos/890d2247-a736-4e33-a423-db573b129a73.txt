My brother turned me on to this spot. I was first skeptical about going to a place that sounded like all they served was large hot pockets. But to my surprise this place was anything but ordinary! The whole concept is very creative for a restaurant. I love the history of the pasty too. They also serve my very favorite beer in the world on tap...... HOGARDEN! I stop by on the regular now for a Pilgrim pasty (the best!) and a hogarden! If you haven't been you gotta try it!
