I can't say enough about how much I enjoy these 4 nights a week, 40 minute, high intensity, boot camp style work outs. Curtis is inspiring, motivating, and innovative in his training. He is consistently and constantly mixing up the sessions, and each is more challenging  than the last. I have seen results in 2 weeks of this boot camp, as opposed to 1 month of Fusion Fitness Boot camp. Curtis has us squatting circles around the competition.  Best yet, Rock Star Boot Camp has my boyfriend panting like a dog!!!
