I love Bakers! I've bought MANY trees and quite a few other things here. Every member of the staff is wonderful about answering questions. Not just answering them, but consulting each other, researching things in books, whatever it takes to make sure all questions are answered really thoroughly. Any time I have free time, I stop in and consult--okay, I really mean"browse".
So much fun!
Oh, I almost forgot! Bakers hosts really cool workshops and lectures!
