A Chandler favorite.. and one of my favorites as well!  I love (you guessed it) the Rigatony w/sausage.  Make sure to dine in because the salad is included and its AMAZING!  They have great "dinner for two" meal combos too.  One time they messed up our take out order and gave us Rigatony Pizza instead of the Rigatony pasta dish.  We ate it anyways and loved that too.  I have yet to be disappointed by anything on their menu.
