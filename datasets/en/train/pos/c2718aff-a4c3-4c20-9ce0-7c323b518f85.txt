After reading the reviews here we went and checked it out.  Staying at the Red Roof accross the steet so it was a nice walk.  
We've been there 3 times for the past couple of weeks and each time the food has been awesome.  Just had the best Egg Drop soup I have ever had.  The food is very fresh.  The people are really nice too.
Like others have said, it is a hole in the wall, don't expect a fancy place.  Well worth the trip.
