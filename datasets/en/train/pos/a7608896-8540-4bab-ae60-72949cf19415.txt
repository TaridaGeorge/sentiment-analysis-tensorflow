I had the pork fried buns and the scallion pancakes. They were both just amazing. I had never had NE Chinese food before, but had seen a TV show featuring the food, so I knew roughly what to expect. It's very hearty, very tasty, and is very obviously handmade. The ladies behind the counter were both really nice and helpful.
