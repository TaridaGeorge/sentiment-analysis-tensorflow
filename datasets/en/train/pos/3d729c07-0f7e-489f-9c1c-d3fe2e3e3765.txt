One word: Porkwich.

Okay, well, here's some more words, provided courtesy of The Oatmeal, "I will never forget you, porkwich. I will love you until the end of time. You are my oily pigflesh soulmate." Pair that porkwich (ham, bacon, and pulled pork with coleslaw and sauce on a yummy bun) with the perfectly seasoned mac and cheese, and add a $5 pitcher of Dogfish Head Ale (pitchers are $5 until 5 pm, and you get a little more than two full glasses), and you have a recipe for happiness. Or a heart attack. 

I'm going with happiness.

I hadn't heard about the "rad" campaign, but it's funny that I used that word specifically to describe the environment. Well, it is pretty rad.

I'll be back!
