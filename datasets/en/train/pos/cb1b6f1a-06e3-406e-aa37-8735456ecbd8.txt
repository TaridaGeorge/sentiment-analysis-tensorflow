My parents just arrived in town yesterday for a few days to meet my fiance's parents and celebrate our engagement with us.  They are staying at the Biltmore and wanted to try something close to the hotel.  There was only one truly amazing place that I could think of....POSTINO'S!!!  This place always delivers amazing food and service.  We had some wine(which was delicious), the always spectacular bruscetta(we had 2 bruscetta boards and all were fantastic) and I had the Autostrada panini....wow, that was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had!  It had a bit of a kick to it and was very tasty.  If you haven't visited this place yet, you are definitely missing out!
