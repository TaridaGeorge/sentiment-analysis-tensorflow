Charm, character, and delicious food, what more could you ask for?  I really love this place - it's so different than any other restaurant around.  Love that they use fresh, local ingredients and I really do love the charm of the place.  Had the ahi sandwhich, YUM, and the hubby had the BBQ sampler plate and a shake and loved everything he had.  Will be bringing out of town visitors here for sure.
