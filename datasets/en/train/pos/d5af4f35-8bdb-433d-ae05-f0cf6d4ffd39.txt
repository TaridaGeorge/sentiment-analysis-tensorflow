My favorite sushi place.  I go as often as I can. Certainly some dishes are better than others, but I have never been disappointed.  Some of my favorites are:  albacore tataki, spicy tuna roll, and anything with scallops.  Non-sushi food is also good: tempura, green lip mussels, agadashi tofu, and gyoza frequent my plate.  Full Japanese menu in addition to sushi.  Not sure if they have a full bar but beer, sake, and Japanese wine are available.

It can get packed during the dinner hour, especially on Friday and Saturday nights, so I mostly go for lunch.  Service is always good and friendly.
