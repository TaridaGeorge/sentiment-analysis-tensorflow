Wandered in here after curiously passing by several times. We were greeted by a pleasant man that helped us order. I got a grilled cheese sandwich with mayo and tomato. It was good, not the best. I went in a few days later and tried the veggie burger with french fries. I was very happy. The fries are perfectly seasoned and the burger (being vegetarian) was the best I've had in a long time! The vegetables are always fresh and the environment is very comfortable - hometown diner style. One of my favorite places to eat now. (:
