I got to stay here for work and had the best time! They have so many pools. I would spend my afternoons in the smaller pools and have the pool all to myself. It was great! They let me send free postcards which was fun, too. My room was beautiful. It was large and had great amenities. 

Food was disgusting though. I didn't have access to a car so I was pretty limited to eating hotel food for a week. Everything I ordered was gross and I tried it ALL!

I thought customer service was fine--not great, just adequate.
