Delicious home made food from scratch. 

Very very VERY affordable prices!  

The restaurant is run by a friendly couple who makes all their food from scratch.  I ordered a veg pannini for with fresh roasted eggplant from that morning for $4.99!!!  I added a couple of brown rice soup for $1 more!  My boyfriend ordered a beef pannini with juicy, generous slices of beef.  GENEROUS servings of food too!  Considering it's prime location, this place is hard to beat.
