This is possibly one the best Thai places I have ever been to. It's in strip mall and nice-casual inside. But the food is great. The waitress told us their chef is generous on the spices so we might want to be careful in order our food "spicy" - we took a chance and went for the spicy number 7 (the hottest). Wow, she was right. My mouth was on fire but was so good. The right mix of sweet and tangy. Will definitely check this place out again.
