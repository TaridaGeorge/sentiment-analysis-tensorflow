Theres always something cool about drinking a locally brewed  beer when you see the big tanks that it was brewed in just sitting in the background! As a huge fan of all kinds of beer this place is heaven on earth, everytime i go there i always get a different beer everytime, i just want pick a favorite, their food is great, the people are always there to have a fun time.......overall whats not to like about this place? NOTHING!!
