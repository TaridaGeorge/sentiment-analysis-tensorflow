Returned to Lo-Lo's downtown with some other friends who had never been.  My friend Trish makes her own soul food so I was curious what she would think.  The verdict:  we all agreed the chicken was great, the waffles, too, but the greens just don't match up to hers.  I had cheese grits for the first time and liked them a lot.  Also, took Trish's cue and ordered red cool-aid.  Loved it!  Never been a big fan before, but it just worked with the rest of the food.  It is served in big mason jars.  Lo- Lo's remains a fave of mine.
