Unbelievable!!! Cal (owner) is an amazingly gracious and friendly guy!! He will know and remember you after your first visit. These are far and away the BEST bagels I've ever eaten, ever! Made completely from scratch ON SITE!!  You can see them being mixed, proofed, boiled and baked!!  Taste them fresh and hot straight from the kitchen!! This place, the staff, the food feel like home!! THE BEST!!!!
