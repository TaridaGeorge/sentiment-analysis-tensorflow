I am a BIG fan of this place.  The establishment is very clean, the employees are very friendly and very helpful.  They don't have the attitude I have received at a lot of other places.  Their jewelry is superior to any other place here in the Valley I have bought from.... I now buy from them exclusively.

They also, surprisingly, are more concerned about you, the customer, than about making the sale and have actually talked me out of certain things if I seemed to be not 110% sure about something.  Their customer service is also excellent, which is HUGE for me.  I simply wouldn't go anywhere else.
