These guys are very trustworthy, quick, and affordable. My Jetta has been in here on several occasions and Jake has done an outstanding job every time. 

Recently I had him install a 1/8" jack into the back of my car stereo so I could plug in my MP3 player... Great investment as those FM transmitters are worthless. (what's with manufacturers still including tape decks and not 1/8" inputs - how freaking out of touch are they?)

He has also done several other less exciting but necessary repairs for me over the years.

Simply put, I highly recommend Jake and Shuman's Auto Clinic in Tempe.
