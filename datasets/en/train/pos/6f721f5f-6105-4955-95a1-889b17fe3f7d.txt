So one of the downsides to owning a place... you pay for anything that breaks! I had (what ended up NOT to be an emergency) for the kitchen sink. Right in the middle of cooking dinner, water starts coming out from the cabinets underneath. Great. I'm hungry and now I'm irritated...

We actually called another handyman for a referral and he suggested we call these guys - specifically Howard. I wasn't too sure if I'd be able to get someone out right away, but Howard was the man and made it happen! We called him around 6pm and he showed up shortly after. 

He was very knowledgeable and really upfront about how much everything would cost. All around nice guy :) I'm very sure I'll be calling him if we ever need any other plumbing services... hopefully not any time soon!
