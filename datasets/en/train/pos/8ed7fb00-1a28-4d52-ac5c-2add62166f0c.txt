I've been to a lot of places in the Phoenix area, and this is the best overall value you can get. Tons of TVs, horse races, great food, great drinks, all at very reasonable prices. I was impressed, not only with the taste of the food, but with the presentation as well. Love this place.

The bar tenders are attentive, receptive, and personable, without being overbearing. This has become a weekly spot for my wife and I to visit, and one which we look forward to spending our money at.
