I didn't like sushi until I went here. Our family LOVES this place, and everyone we bring here is hooked. You can't go wrong with Akai Hana, the sushi is the best in town and the prices are zoo cheep. Go during happy hour (12-2 and 8-10pm) My favorite rolls: The Blue Flame is by far the best one, very addictive. Love their California Rolls, The Las Vegas-wonderful. Another great roll is the Golden Buddah. My kids don't like sushi but they love getting the chicken Tatsuta. Also they have tempura cheesecake-one of the best desserts, sometimes we go there just for that.
