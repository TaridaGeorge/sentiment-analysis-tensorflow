Rarely do I go to Tempe Marketplace without a stop at Cost Plus. The international foods, the furniture, and oh... the CANDY. Oooooh the candy. I lived a short time in Germany as a very small child and all the German candy brings back fond memories. There are candies from all over the world, so if you have a well-traveled sweet tooth, this is your place.

There's great deals to be had on wine, too. Truly something for everyone here- and a fantastic place for unique gifts.
