This is my favorite lunch spot when I am in the north west part of town.  I LOVE the green chili chicken salad so much that I have never ordered anything else.  However, my dining companions have had lots of different menu items and they love it here as much as I do.  I am a pretty picky eater, so the "assembly" line style here is a plus for me since I can choose exactly what and how much of something I want on my salad.  Looking forward to eating here again soon.
