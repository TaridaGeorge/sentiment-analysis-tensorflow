I LOVE Metta yoga. I moved here about a year ago and after visiting several studios around the area, I finally found one where I feel at home. My favorite classes are Karin's, but all the classes make me feel wonderful. There are a nice variety of classes. I would highly recommend Metta Yoga, especially if you are looking for feel-good or spiritual yoga.
