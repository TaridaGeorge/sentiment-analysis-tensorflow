I have known Serina for years and have watched her transition from "the big girl" (ask her and she'll tell you all about it!) to "the Zumba Instructor and gym/club owner" with pleasure and pride. Her contagious, boundless enthusiasm, knowledge of dance, natural rhythm, and - now that she's running her own club - ability to identify and bring aboard others with her same drive and love of helping others achieve their fitness goals while having fun, is inspirational. Check out the club; try a Zumba class, try a Hump a Donk class (Ryan's a great instructor for this!), try a Real Ryder class - but don't put it off if you live ANYwhere near In the RA Fitness! There's nothing in town quite like it!
