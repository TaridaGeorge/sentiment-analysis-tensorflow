Went here for a Spring Training game on Saturday, not one complaint!  Parking was only 5 dollars, we got great seats for only $20 a piece.  Everything was clean,  the food was great.  Next time maybe I'll venture further than a hot dog, but it was a great hot dog at that!  

Washing it down with a nice cool budweiser on a spring afternoon, it doesn't get much better than this....
