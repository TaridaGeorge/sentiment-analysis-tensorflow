Some of the best Pizza in AZ. I ordered the Funghi Pizza, and now it's all I can think about. "I wish I could quit you", Funghi Pizza..but I can't. Yum.. and 2.50 PBR! Effin A mane.. The architecture was tits..Our waiter was friendly, and made great recommendations. (see above) The price was right. Parking was abundant. I will be back to try more. You need to check this place out.. Btw., my friend got a pizza with sausage, and radicchio on it. His was ok. Go with a friend or 2 so that you can try more than one type of pie.
