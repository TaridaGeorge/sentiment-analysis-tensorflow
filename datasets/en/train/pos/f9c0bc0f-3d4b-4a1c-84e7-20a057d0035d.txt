Believe the hype people this place serves up some of the best pizza around.  We were in AZ visiting friends so on our way to their house, aware of the outrageous wait times,  we stopped by this place and put our names down. They told us it would be a 4 1/2 hour wait. This was at 6pm. So we left an returned right before 10:30 and still had to wait for another hour. Finally, we were seated and we tried the Rosa and the Wise Guy. The Rosa was definitely our favorite, loved the combination of pistachios, rosemary, red onion and cheese!
