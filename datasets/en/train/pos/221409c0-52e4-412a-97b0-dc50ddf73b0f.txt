Eating out is always a challenge with two kids under 5. However, the folks at this location make it easy and enjoyable, EVERYTIME!! We keep going back because our service is always that good and if course the happy hour is the best! Even when we've had rough service due to short staff or whatever, the sever recognizes that and offers to make it right! Love it and since kids live it, we will continue to go back!
