Really friendly staff that know card games and sports (even though they wouldn't turn off the NBA playoffs for the NHL ... step your game up!). Plenty of great players hang around here and they usually have a packed house on the big nights. Plus, they offer MTG in multiple formats, so you can't go wrong there. My favorite place to play on the West valley.
