I didn't actually stay here but I spent a lot of time there one morning when I had an accident right in front. The early morning security guard was a great help and the valet even came to check on me when it took forever to be helped and offered me some water. If everyone who works there is that nice,  I will make sure to recommend it to all my out of town guests.
