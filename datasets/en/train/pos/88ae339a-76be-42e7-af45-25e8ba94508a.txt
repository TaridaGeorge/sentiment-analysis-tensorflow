It's so refreshing to find a restaurant in Phoenix that offers you flavors you can't find anywhere else. Who puts chili, coconut, spicy chipolte mayo, and slaw on a hot dog? Maui Dog does! The perfect combination of spicy and sweet. It's one of those menus that you look at and say - how in the world did they think of putting all those flavors together? But they work, and it's amazing. Just went there for the 2nd time tonight. My fave so far are Tiki and Lava Dogs (shaggy style). My fiance thinks the spam sliders are the bomb. The specially made bread? PERFECT for a hot dog or slider. It holds everything together without being too dense or stiff, and yet doesn't get soggy. I really hope this place makes it!
