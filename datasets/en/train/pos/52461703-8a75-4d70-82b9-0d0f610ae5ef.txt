I was a bit skeptical of Postino because I had heard so many great things about it and didn't really understand how bruschetta could be that great, but now I'm a believer. It's the whole package of the location, the vibe, the constant crowd, and of course - the amazing food! I ordered a board of bruschetta, planning to split it with my friend, but then remembered she is unable to have gluten! It was so delicious that I finished the whole board by myself! I just couldn't say no to the brie, apple & fig, or red peppers & goat cheese, or prosciutto, fig & marscapone, or the burrata, bacon, arugula, & tomatoes. My fave of these four was the brie, apple & fig. Deeee-lish!
