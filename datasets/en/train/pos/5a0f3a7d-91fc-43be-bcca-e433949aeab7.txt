I always have a great time when I'm at a Valley Movie Group event.  The people in the group are friendly, and I usually have some great conversations. Jayson, the group's organizer, makes everyone feel welcome and has a gift for remembering people's names.  He is not just gifted when it comes to people's names, he successfully gathers large groups of people for movies and other events and negotiates discounts at restaurants after the movie.  

On a side note, last time I was there, I was having a bad day due to a flaky friend cancelling at the last minute for meeting up with me.  While I initially felt angry, his words of encouragement made me feel better.
