Have been here a couple times now and cannot stop raving about it!! I was lucky enough to have had a girlfriend that worked there a while back tell me about the "hidden menu" that no one really knows about. I ordered the "Senorita" off that menu and have been going back for it ever since.
Of course their happy hour is RIDICULOUS, so cheap and really good!! I feel sorry for the waitresses because of all the horrible customers they must get that don't know how to tip at happy hour (in case you don't know its always tip what the meal would have been before the discount). But if they have bad customers I wouldn't know, I always get the best service!!

Awesome, yummy, and healthy! Now go have some Sushi;)
