I have eaten here twice, and can say it is easily some of the best food in Phoenix.  (I would eat there a lot more often, but it's a long ways from the Northwest Valley).  
You MUST get the chopped salad, it really is THAT GOOD.
The scallop appetizer may have been the best scallops I've ever eaten.  Our table had ordered one or two of these to share.  Do not make the same mistake.  Order it for yourself, if someone else wants it, tell them to get their own damn order.  Next time I may just order these for my entree.
We also really like the halibut.
The drink menu is very creative, too, and worth a dabble.
