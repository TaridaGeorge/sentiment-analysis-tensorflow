Don't exactly know how to rate an urban "Riparian Preserves"; but I love this place. The first time I stumbled upon it I saw a crane fly low over the water looking for fish - forgot for a second that I was in Gilbert. The spot is not only beautiful but also one of the more serene places in the east Valley. It's a great place to sit down and let all that is troubling you slip away.
