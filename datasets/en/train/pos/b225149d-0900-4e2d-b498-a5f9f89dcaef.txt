This is the coffee place located inside Conspire. John, the owner and barista, is super friendly, knows a lot about the area, and makes a great cup of coffee on top of it all. The Chai Latte is superfantastic too. He actually makes it from scratch, mixing all the ingredients. It's not the regular store-bought or normal coffeehouse stuff. It could maybe have a bit less nutmeg though.
