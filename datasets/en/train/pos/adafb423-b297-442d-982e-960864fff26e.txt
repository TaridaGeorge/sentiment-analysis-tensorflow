Love Yard House!  The beer selection is amazing and the food is really good also.  

Great for large parties.  The server I had was awesome and not only split the checks correctly, but also split the guest of honor's check evenly among everyone else.  Make a reservation first for a large party.

I like the dim lighting and atmosphere.  The only thing is it gets loud, so loud that you can't really hear the music that's playing.  But who really cares to listen to the music when you're having fun?
