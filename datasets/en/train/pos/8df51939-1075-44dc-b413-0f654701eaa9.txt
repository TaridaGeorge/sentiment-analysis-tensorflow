Kierland Commons, and now Scottsdale Quarter (across Scottsdale Road) is one of those great outdoor Malls. Lots of shopping upscale and eclectic mix. Great restaurants if you want to eat, better chains include Cheesecake, PF Changs, Morton's, Tommy Bahama's Restaurant as well as smaller trendy places. The shopping has chain stores such as Anthropologie, Banana Republic, BCBG, Chicos, Coach, Michael Kors, etc. as well as smaller shops. Wonderful way to spend some time (and money) outdoors. Across the street at Scottsdale Quarter, you have more great shopping and eats. The Kierland Commons condos located directly behind the mall are high end, beautiful modern condos that you can rent or buy. They are quite pricey, but what a great area to be in....
