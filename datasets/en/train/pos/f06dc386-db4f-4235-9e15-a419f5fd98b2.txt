SOLID SPOT!!! Good Food, Great staff!! I believe Steven and Brad are the owners.  Met them today...Good dudes for sure!!! I had (The Greek Breakfast Burrito and a white chocolate mocha) all I can say is HEEEAVEN,HAHA!!! Sat in the very cool ambience of the breakfast burrito spot i had sought after on Yelp!  let me tell you i was not dissapointed but rather impressed.  It had everything i could ask for in a little cafe.  Good atmosphere, great decor, amazing food, sociable staff, loose seating (couches,chairs,coffee table,etc.)  and right on the street so your eyes can get down on some people watching.  If I had more than two thumbs they'd be raised high!!!
