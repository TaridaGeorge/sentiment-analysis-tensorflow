I've been coming here for years, so when they shut it down for renovations I was devastated. I've been there a few times since they reopened. But I wasn't impressed. That was until I saw a movie in their new Cinema Suites. This is it. They got it right! There's a 50% premium but it's worth it ($15 per ticket).

-No kids, 21+ only
-Assigned seating. You get to pick out your seats on a touchscreen
-Blocked seating. There's a partition that separates rows from each other, so you don't see the seats below you. All you see is the screen.
-Leather reclining seats
-Complementary gourmet popcorn
-Full dinner menu, and bar

Oh and when you leave there's a guy waiting at the door with Ghirardelli chocolate mints. And it's on a silver platter!
