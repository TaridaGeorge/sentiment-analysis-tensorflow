Great place, food was fresh, reasonably priced and tasty!  Simple recipe for success. They gyro is amazing, the falafel and salads are good too. It appears to be a family owned "mom and pop" place and the kids were helping, which I thought was really cute. I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner since it is right around the corner from work, but so glad we did today. Will definitely be back.
