I've been going here for 5 years!  I've tried Beef teriyaki, shrimp/veggie tempura, orange chicken, and beef broccoli..all are goood!!!!! For 4 yrs I was only ordering the beef teriyaki bowl. I've only tried the other stuffs this year and I'm planning to try the other stuffs on the menu. My bf always gets the obento which he loves. I'm not a big fan of katsu that's why I dnt usually get that. 
The man that owns it (I think his name is Mr. Wong) is super duper nice! I love coming here after a long and frustrating dat at work bc he's soo cheerful, positive and peaceful person that makes my frustration go away.
