I loved this place!  My dining partner and I shared a carmelized onion tart, then I had the gluten free spaghetti with cauliflower, kale and shrimp.  It was very delicious- wonderful flavors and textures.  Nice service, cool people, and a very neat space....If I lived in Phoenix, I'd go here more often.
