Fantastic service.  second to none.  I always get a fair quote and great service every time.  You get the feeling that Bob and the rest of the family and crew are really looking out for your best interest with respect to your vehicle and what is really needed.  I always get a "thank you" note in the mail with every repair, which says a lot in my opinion about the integrity of the shop and how they value their customers.  I've referred others to them and will continue to do so.  Great Job Premier Auto!
