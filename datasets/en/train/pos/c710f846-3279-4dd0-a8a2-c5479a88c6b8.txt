In college (not that long ago, but boy I am getting old fast) I had the opportunity to spend a month in northern Italy.  Marcellino Ristorante takes me back.

You will find no finer Italian restaurant in Phoenix.  The pastas are exceptional, unique, and fresh.  The atmosphere is superb.  The wait staff if phenomenally proficient yet down to earth and friendly at the same time.

You owe it to yourself to treat you and a loved one to this experience.
