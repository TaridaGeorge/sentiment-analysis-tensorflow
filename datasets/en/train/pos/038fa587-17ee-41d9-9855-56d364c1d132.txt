There's a new Donut shop in town and it is outstanding!  Golden Donuts has a great selection of donuts.  The store is very inviting with fresh displays and menu boards.  The staff are friendly and extremely patient while I selected each donut individually.  I am a fan of apple fritters and Golden's apple fritters are incredible.  They also have blueberry filled white powder donuts which I had not had before.  Golden Donuts also offers a great sandwich selection. I will need to try the sandwiches on my next visit to Chandler.  This is definitely "the" donut shop!
