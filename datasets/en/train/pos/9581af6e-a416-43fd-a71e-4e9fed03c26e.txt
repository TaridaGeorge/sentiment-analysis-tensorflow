I love the bar here, of course it was $10 bucks for a cranberry & absolute but the atmosphere is great and I love the decor... the bartender was uber nice & very attentive and that's what I like in a bar!

The valets are great too! 

I would love to stay here one day; it looks like it would be fabulous!
