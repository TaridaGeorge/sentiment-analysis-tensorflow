I love this gym!!  I have been a member for about 2 years and just recently got serious about dropping my BMI.  I've hired a trainer his name is Josh and the man kills me in every session we have!!  Well worth the extra money for PT sessions!!  Plus not to mention they have a great ABS & MetCon class, plus Saturday Seminar that will take your body to the next level.  I heard that LA Fitness maybe merging with PureFitness...  I don't know how true that is but I hope they keep up the great work!!
