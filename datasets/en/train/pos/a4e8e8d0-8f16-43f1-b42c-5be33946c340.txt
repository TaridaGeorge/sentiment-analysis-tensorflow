I went to a Speed Dating event that Kliquenow put together, and I had a blast! It was more fun than I expected. There were normal people just as curious as I was, it really wasn't too awkward. I met some cool girls- but if none of them pan out I would definitely try it again! It might be even more fun if you bring a friend.
