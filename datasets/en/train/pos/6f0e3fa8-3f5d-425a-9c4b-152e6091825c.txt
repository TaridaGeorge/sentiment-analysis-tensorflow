So glad to see other great reviews for this place - we discovered this place because my husband's company used to get delivery from there - we have lived in the area for 5 years and never even knew it was there - in fact that is both it's biggest downfall and part of the draw for those "in the know".  If you didn't know it was there, you would probably never know - but once you go - you'll be SOOOOOO happy!  The staff is really friendly, the menu is easy to understand, the food is hot, fresh and oh so yummy.  The waffle fries are awesome!  So...  find it, try it, love it!
