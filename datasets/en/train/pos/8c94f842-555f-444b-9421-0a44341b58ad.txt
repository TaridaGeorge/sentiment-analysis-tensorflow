When so many restaurants here are closed on Sundays, it was great to find a good one that was open. And not just good - we had an absolutely marvelous meal here. Tasty bean pupusas made with rice flour (instead of wheat), scrumptious and moist chicken tamales, and delicious fried plantains for dessert. (We did not get the sweet plantains & cream but the 'dinner' ones with pureed black beans, and I found those sweet enough by themselves.)

The staff was quite friendly to us, and it didn't hurt that my companion could hold her own conversing in Spanish with them. Yet the food by itself was so enjoyable, my stomach was grinning the whole way home. Â¡Ricissimo!
