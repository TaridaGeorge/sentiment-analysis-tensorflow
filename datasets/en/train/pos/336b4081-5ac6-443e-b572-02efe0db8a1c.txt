Windsor has everything I want in a restaurant!
Fun & Tasty Menu
Great cocktails
Delish beer selection
Outdoor Dining
AND and ice cream shop next door!
I really love everything about Windsor, namely their ceviche.
It has knocked LGOs off the top of my list.
I love to go (when its cooler) and sit on the patio for their $5 pitchers. (daily before 5pm).  I just wish I lived closer :-0
Keep it up, Windsor!
