Very solid red eye. Coffee plus espresso plus soy milk. The espresso gives the coffee that lovely crema on top and the soy milk rounds out and softens the flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the sidewalk sipping my coffee and chatting. 

I think I'll have to stop here whenever I come to the Quarter to shop.
