I love this place!  The best soup/sand which combo you can find.  You must try their BLT Plus sandwich if you like that type of thing...all of their soups are amazing.  Even the vegetarian ones, which i get mainly...and normally I'm not into the vegetarian thing!  I have not tried the breakfast, but if one were closer to me, I would guarantee you, I would buy stock in the place and throw away my pots and pans!  Plus, they have wonderful sweet treats to put an end to a fabulous lunch!  Their bread for sale is wonderful and makes amazing sandwiches.
