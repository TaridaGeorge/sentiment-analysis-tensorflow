Yummmm. I am so surprised how amazing these cakes taste. I had one for someone's birthday and I thought it was such a cute idea but that it wouldn't taste great. I must say that I was very wrong. The cakes are so incredibly moist and flavorful. The frosting is the best it is so light with just a hint of cream cheese. All together scrumptious. Not sure how much they cost but they are more than just a unique look (that reminds you of My Big Fat Greek Wedding) but they also are delicious.
