This is so close to home, but we tried this only recently (and I can't think of a reason why because I love greek food and kept going to my fave spots all the way in Tempe). It is kind of tucked away and not prominent, so we thought they might be empty, but we were pleasantly surprised to see many patrons.

We had dinner, but returned for happy hour and I think it's a great place for happy hour. There were groups of people who were definitely having a good time. The service was a bit... brusque. The waiters are constantly rushing around. I am not a fan of fake smiles and high pitched greetings, but this was a bit unsettling too.
