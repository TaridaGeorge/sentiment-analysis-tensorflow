Cute and quaint brunch and lunch location.  It looks smaller than it actually is because the place gets packed out the wazoo.  Outdoor seating is optimal if the weather is pleasant.  

The apricot iced tea was brewed just right without any additional sweeteners.  And our server brought us carafes so we could refill whenever we wanted.  The brie appetizer was sinful!  

I got the veggie quesadilla which was stuffed to bursting and toasted to perfection.  My friends ordered greek and shrimp salads, chicken pesto sandwich, and the salmon.  No complaints all around.
