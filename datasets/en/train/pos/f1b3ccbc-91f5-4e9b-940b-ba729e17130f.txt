By far one of my favorite, go-to happy hour spots. The food is excellent (and the oysters are a steal), the drinks are a great deal and the atmosphere is just right - not too loud, always bustling, low lighting, not too stuffy/Scottsdale-ish. Honestly, it's my fall back place when I just don't feel like trying to come up with an idea for happy hour, it's consistently good and the deals are some of the best around. If you haven't been, you're missing the boat.

Oh and if you like Wedge salads, you must try theirs...the dressing is...beyond. I've been dying to get the recipe for years now, if you manage to squeeze it out of someone, I'll be your best friend.
