I'm not going to say what has already been said, this place is the jammy jam, there isn't a bad item on the menu.  I love the atmosphere, very intimate, hole in the wall.  I guess the only downfall is in fact its size, which can be limiting, if they are busy.  

The only words of wisdom I would have, is don't shy away from the desserts.  The banoffee pie seems like it "might" be a good idea, but I can ensure you, it is amazing!  

Definitely one of my favorite spots in the area!
