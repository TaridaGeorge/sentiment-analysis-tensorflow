I recently attended a business meeting at the Marriott at McDowell Mountain.  There are so many things I liked about this beautiful hotel.

1.  Convenient parking.  No need to valet.  
2.  Beautiful grounds, pool, spa, next to golf course.  Stunning view!
3.  Lush and comfortable environment!-They just completed a multi-million dollar remodel so everything is new!  Absolutely fantastic!
4.  Banquet service was impeccable.  They were as quiet as they could be while our speaker gave the presentation.
5.   Food was beautifully plated and absolutely delicious!  I had a seafood crab cake, filet mignon, real mashed potatoes and fresh steamed veggies.  Beautiful salad and delicious dessert.  All the food was served at the right temperature.

I highly recommend this location for your next business function or event.  Weddings would be nice here too.  Absolutely wonderful!

Enjoy!
