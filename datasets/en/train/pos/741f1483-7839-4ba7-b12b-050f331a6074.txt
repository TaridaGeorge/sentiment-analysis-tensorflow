We just had Brad out yesterday to clean all our windows in/out and he did a fantastic job.  
He was on time and even though it took longer than estimated he kept on going and got the job done.  We have alot of windows....alot.  He stuck with his quoted price, which I appreciate.
Brad was professional and friendly.  
We will use Brad in the future and recommend him.
