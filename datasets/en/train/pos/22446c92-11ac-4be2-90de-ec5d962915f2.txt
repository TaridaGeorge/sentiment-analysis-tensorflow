We love love love the Old Spaghetti Factory. I don't think there's been a single time I've been that I haven't had to wait, but it's ALWAYS worth it. I love their lasagna, the bread is really good. They have huge portion sizes, so we split a plate usually when we go, but it's so well worth it. The service has always been really good too. I will definitely go back again and again.
