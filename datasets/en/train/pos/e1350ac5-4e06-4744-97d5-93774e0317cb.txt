About a month ago my Car got wrecked in an accident that wasn't my fault.  even though the other drivers insurance takes care of repairs and a rental car.  It's still very upsetting to be without your car for an extended period of time.  A friend recommended that I take my car to Sterling for the repairs.

Sterling was completely professional, gave me nearly daily updates via text, and called me multiple times each week to update me on the status of my repairs.  When all was said and done, the repairs were completed nearly a week early.

When I went to pick up my car, everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, explained what was repaired, handed me some paperwork and my keys and I was on my way and back to normal.

utter professionalism and quality service.
