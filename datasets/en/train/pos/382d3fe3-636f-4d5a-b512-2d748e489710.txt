I don't know about you all but I think it is so hard to find great sushi and sake at a reasonable price. Especially in Scottsdale! That was until I went to Stingray for Happy Hour. I could not believe the prices. Every roll was only $3 to $5, the food was all under $5, and there was sake for a dollar and a glass of exceptional wine for like $4. You have to try the Gyoza (they are like dumplings). Delicious! This Happy Hour has all the favorites too. The spicy tuna roll, dragon roll (my personal favorite), the shrimp tempura roll, calamari and much much more!

I can't wait to go back!
