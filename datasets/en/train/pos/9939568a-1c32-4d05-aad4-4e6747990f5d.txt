This place is awesome.  It's a little Thai restaurant in a strip mall (next to Safeway) in Anthem AZ.  The food is great, well priced, and plentiful.  

The menu is huge!  I've been there over ten times and have ordered something different every time.

For you in the know it is an offshoot of the Dara Thai in Flagstaff AZ, but I don't know if it's a chain or family that moved down south.

If you are in the market for some awesome Thai but don't want to go downtown just shoot up the I-17 (bad traffic northbound Friday afternoon, and southbound on Sunday evenings) and give it a shot... You won't be disappointed.

Update: Consistently good.  Added a star because I would be sad without them.
