This review is for the smoothie bar in the front of the store. It's fantastic. We were in town for a day and a half and we had enjoyed their smoothies so much while we lived there that we went back twice in that small time frame we were visiting!

We always just get the green smoothies. Tasty, healthy, win.

I get the tropical one and ask for extra banana and sub one of the milks they have for the electrolyte water.

Husband gets the green trekker, and says he likes it better when he subs one of the milks for the electrolyte water, too.

These smoothies are not super sweet, so ask for extra banana or a touch of agave if you want more of a treat.
