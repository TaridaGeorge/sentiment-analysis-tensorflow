If you waited for years for a soft frozen yogurt shop, it's finally arrived and done so in fashion. Yogurtland offers the standard flavors and then some exotic and seasonal ones and all at $0.30 an ounce. The array of toppings is outstanding and you, yes you, determine your portion size. My personal favorites are the coffee and pistachio though the blueberry tart, boysenberry, chocolate, vanilla and banana all vie for top of the list. The shop itself is bare bones with only a few chairs and the parking can be challenging. But you won't find better yogurt of a frozen dessert anywhere. Gelato doesn't compare and there are few ice cream shoppes that rival Yogurtland. Who cares that the kids weighing your cup aren't slobbering all over you? The interaction is minimal and I'm just happy they're there to take my money and keep the yogurt stocked. Enjoy!
