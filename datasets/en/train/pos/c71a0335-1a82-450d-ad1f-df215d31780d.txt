This place is beautiful!! Great dessert scenic views!! Staff is very nice and helpful!! If I had a problem, they were right there instantly! This complex is awesome on community events!!! Pool parties (which is a huge Olympic size pool!), trunk or treat, Easter egg hunts, and plenty more!! It is a great way to have everyone together and have have a lot of fun! It is very close to the anthem outlets, if you love shopping like me!! :) Also very close to a full shopping center and Anthem community park!
