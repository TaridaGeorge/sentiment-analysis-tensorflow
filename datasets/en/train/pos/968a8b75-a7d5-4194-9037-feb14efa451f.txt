Found a great rate on Golf Now - called in and spoke with Brad. He was extremely friendly, courteous, and gave great advice on what course to play. Hole 15 on the Links Course has incredible views and I recommend this course to anyone looking for a great value. One of the oldest courses in Phoenix too!
