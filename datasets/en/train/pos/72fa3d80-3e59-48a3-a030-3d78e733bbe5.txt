Jeannie's salon, Spatini, has been my "go to" nail and waxing salon for several years. She does impeccable work and is organized.  As a busy attorney, I need someone who runs on time so I can get in and out quickly as well as someone who can adapt to my everchanging schedule -- Jeannie is that someone.  Jeannie recently began offering online scheduling - a great new perk at Spatini and can be done on my smart phone or Blackberry!
