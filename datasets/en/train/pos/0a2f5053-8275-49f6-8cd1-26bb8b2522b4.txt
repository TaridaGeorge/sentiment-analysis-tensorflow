Smashburger provides absolutely fantastic tasting burgers. There is a great deal of flavor in each burger and it's delicious. The bun is great, the cheese is great, the burger is great. The smash fries are really quite good as well, though they can get just a BIT oily.

$10 buys you a burger, fries, and drink, with tax, which is firmly right near Five Guys and Chuckbox. I'm a MUCH bigger fan of Smashburger than Five Guys, and it's neck-and-neck, burger-quality with Chuckbox. (They're different flavors, and Chuckbox's mesquite-grilling goes a LONG way, but their fries are freezer fries and bleh.)

The staff is very friendly, they typically hit their 5-7 minute statement, and it's one of my favorite burgers anywhere now. Definitely a good place.
