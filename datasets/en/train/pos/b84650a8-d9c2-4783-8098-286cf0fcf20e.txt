By far my favorite book store in Phoenix.

Every time I go in there I never leave without a book or two.  Their selection is constantly changing, and all of the books are in good shape and come at a great price (most are under $10).  They also have a large selection of DVDs and other misc items.  The staff is always friendly and helped me out by special ordering the GRE Princeton Review 2011 book.  

The inside is charming, and is literally covered floor to ceiling in books.  You're sure to find something in there to meet your interests.
