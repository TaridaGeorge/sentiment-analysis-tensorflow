By far the best home building experience we have had yet, having had 3 houses built previously.  Everyone we interfaced with at Richmond was friendly and helpful, from sales, to the design center, and the building supervisor.  Any issues were cleared up immediately and without question.  They hit every milestone schedule on time, and the various walk throughs went smoothly.

House building can be a stressful event, but these guys make it a pleasure!
