One restaurant for many occasions! I can go here for Saturday or Sunday brunch. Bring out of town guests to sit on the patio. Take a date on Saturday night. Watch a game with a buddy. Have lunch by myself without feeling like a dork. Drop by for Happy Hour. Etc. I'm a huge fan of the homemade corned beef hash for brunch. My only complaint about the burger is that it's too big! But that's life in America. I've never had service issues like some other reviews, and I've been there when it's been busy and slow. If you don't see a parking spot up front, swing around back or park next door at night. There are a couple bars within walking distance if you want a change of venue for a night cap.
