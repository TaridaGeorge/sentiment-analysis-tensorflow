Hands down the best meat I have ever had!

The moist brisket is like eating heaven.  I usually over estimate a food when someone tells me it is good and it never ends up meeting my expectations.  This was built up so much that there was no way it was going to be that go, i mean it is just BBQ, right?  Wrong!  This was like eating a new food that I have never had before.  Seriously, you can not understand the tastes that you will experience until you do it yourself.  And if you think you have had it before, you have not :' ) soooo goood.
