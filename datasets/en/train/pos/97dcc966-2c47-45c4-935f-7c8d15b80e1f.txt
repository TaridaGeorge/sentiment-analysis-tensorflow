Yardhouse at Westgate, didn't disappoint.  First, the hostess placed us in a booth away from the noise of the sports games and music, very considerate!  Second, the ceasar salad was the best I've had in a long time, chrispy roman, great tasty dressing, yummy.  I usually get the Mac and Cheese which is always awesome and went with Sirlon with Portobello Mushroom, Mashed Potatoes, and Grilled Tomato, it was worth it, and had it with a pretty good glass of beer with it..yum.  Server was really nice and allowed us to linger at the table after dinner for awhile.    Tasty meal for a cool winter Phoenix night!!
