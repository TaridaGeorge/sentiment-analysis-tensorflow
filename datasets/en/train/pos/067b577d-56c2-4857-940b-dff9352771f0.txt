One of the best resorts around.  Romantic, hidden and tucked away.  Staff is very accomodating and the casitas are spaced far away enough from each other that the patios do feel really private.  Depending on the time of year, you can get a decent price on a room.  The pool area is smallish compared to newer resorts but have been nicely rennovated.
