Have been here twice. Everything is excellent as far as food quality.  It's pretty busy on most evenings and that can slow things down so if you think you might be in a hurry I would recommend something else. Service has been outstanding each time that I have been.  The food is good and they have a reasonably diverse wine lists with mostly national wine offerings. The prime rib is superb. Most meals will cost in the range of 15-30 dollars depending on pairings and w/o drinks. Definitely worth it for a nice night out.
