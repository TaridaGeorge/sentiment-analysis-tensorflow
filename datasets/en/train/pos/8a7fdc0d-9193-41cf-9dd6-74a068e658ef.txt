I've been to FEZ countless times in the past few years and must say, it's one of my favorite places in the downtown area. They use eclectic blends of pesto and cinnamon and fruits-in-places-you-don't-think-they'll-fit to liven up your ordinary burger or salad. Yom! 

Their service is amazing. They have daily drink specials. My favorite is the $3 vodka pom-presses on Fridays and the $5 martini Mondays. 

Whether you get one of their main dishes or a burger, you'll leave satisfied.

I've had the FEZ Burger, the Bleu cheese balsamicburger, the Tangier burger, tried all of their fries, had their mushroom risotto, the apricot salmon, the chicken lettuce wraps, seafood kibis, and have tried a handful of their martinis. I always leave with tons of leftovers and am never disappointed with their service or their food.

I love FEZ!
