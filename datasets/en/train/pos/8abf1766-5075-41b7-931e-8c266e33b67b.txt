Located only minutes from Scottsdale and Phoenix this Maricopa County park contains a variety of hiking trails suitable for anyone from beginner to expert. There are six named trails in the park including Dragonfly, Elephant Mountain, Metate, Spur Cross, Tortuga, and Towhee.   The park borders the Tonto National Forest to the north and some of the trails continue out of the park and into the forest intersecting the Cave Creek trails system.

This is a well maintained park with hikes that range for easy to difficult. There are excellent views, porta potties, and a flowing creek (Cave Creek flows at least in the winter).

I hiked extensively in the park in February of 2011.
