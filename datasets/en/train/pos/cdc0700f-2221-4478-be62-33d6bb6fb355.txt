The Cue Club is my favorite spot on Mill. 

There are a cluster of pool tables and big screen TV's in the back and music bumps throughout the bar. The crowd is laid back and the drink specials are superb. 

On top of that, you can order food from Bison Wiches and the Cue Club staff will run over and bring your food back to you. That is what I call going the extra mile.
