So i'm an avid movie watcher, love to go out and enjoy a good flick with my boyfriend.....but when you have kids running around and babies crying, it ruins the night. .....

Which brings me to UltraStar Theater: This place is awesome...you can get upgraded to star class, which bascially means no one under 21 allowed!...yep not allowed even with a parent. They have a separate family friendly screening. So yeah I love it.....plus you can order food, 10X better than harkins food and you can enjoy a nice glass of beer.. $7 for a blue moon was ok but cheaper elsewhere of course.

So if you hate when people/kids bump your seats, come here and enjoy the space, food and drinks...

Oh and the service was awesome too, so friendly and ready to serve!
