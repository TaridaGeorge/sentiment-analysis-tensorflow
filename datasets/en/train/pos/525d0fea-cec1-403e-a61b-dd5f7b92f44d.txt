I've recently become a regular here. Every wednesday night they have an open mic. You never know what to expect because it's always something different!

The Baristas are exquisite. Always in a great mood and they make everything perfect!

Everything I've had here has been great. Also, the pizza is pretty good too.

A great way to spend a wednesday night if you want a little entertainment and coffee!
