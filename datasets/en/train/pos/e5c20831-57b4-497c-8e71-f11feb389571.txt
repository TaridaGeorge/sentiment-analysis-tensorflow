I've seen a few shows at Greasepaint over the last year and have been impressed every single show I've seen!  The shows I've seen are more teen and young adult oriented (PG-13) -- Les Miserables (serious drama with really impressive period costumes, incredible mature-sounding male singers, and hilarious rendition of Master of the House),  13 (lighter, tongue-in-cheek high school drama with clever choreography - I'd never seen this show before and it was truly funny and the youth actors were perfect).

Sometimes youth theaters just don't work -- but I'd actually pay for tickets for these shows.  Really, really good and located in downtown Scottsdale within walking distance of bars and restaurants -- another plus !
