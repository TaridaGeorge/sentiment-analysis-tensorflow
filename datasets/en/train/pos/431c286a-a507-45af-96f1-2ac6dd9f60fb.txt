I'm a regular for their meatball subs with sweet potato fries and aioli. So much so I'm beginning to look like a meatball! I wish the kids meal was a little more extensive. They do give the kids dough to play with and they'll bake it for them too. Picky as my husband is, he didn't like the pizza, which I know is sacrilege for some, but he's a pizza snob. He does like the Italian sub and said the Italian sausage was "wonderful" a little sweet and a little spicy, made fresh daily. If it can please that persnickety guy who eats sausage a minimum of once a week, must be good. So, a little something for everyone. Tip: order the junior size, neither of us has ever been able to even finish that! And the salads I've seen could feed four. Enjoy!
