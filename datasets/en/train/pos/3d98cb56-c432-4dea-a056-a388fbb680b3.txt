I am a big fan of Bandera's food, atmosphere and location. I have been dining here for years and always enjoy myself. The employees seem to take great pride in this place, and so should we. Try the steaks, ribs, and the chicken (their pride and joy).

It is somehow affiliated with Houston's (though I haven't figured out how exactly).  The happy hour crowd here can be fun on occasion.
