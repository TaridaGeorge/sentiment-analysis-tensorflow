Fans of "Whose Line is It Anyway" will like Jesterz Improv.  The cast is smart, funny, and welcoming.  It's a treat to see how five very different personality styles combine on stage to assemble stories from audience suggestions.  We took friends on our first visit and had a great time.  You'll definitely have something to talk about after the show.  I appreciate that the ground-rules keep things from veering into the gutter, thereby encouraging creativity.  That doesn't mean it's the best fit for young kids though.  The sweet spot for this "all ages" show is probably teens to adults.
