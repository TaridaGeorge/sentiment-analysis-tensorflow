my boyfriend and I actually prefer chibo over bianco and not just because we only have to wait half as long at chibo but because the pizza is just better! The crust is just the right combination of crunchy and soft. The sauce was amazing it was not as sweet as I ususally prefer but it really worked with the sausage. This was an amazing experience for us and will pass up bianco any day to eat at cibo!

OH!! and thanks to the waitress for not being rude when I walked out after leaving $30.00 on a $30.87 bill oooops! I don't know how I managed that! I thought I had left $36.00! I'll use my debt/credit card from now on lol! She just caught us walking out to the car to let me know I hadn't left enough to cover my bill.
