I have been having parties for years and I wish I would have discovered Windy City DJ sooner. This was the most professional, fun experience ever. I used Windy City for my daughter's Graduation Party and the DJ was knowledgeable on all types of music. Everything requested by the kids and adults was available. (We had a meeting prior to discuss music choices) I was very impressed by the range. The owner, the Dj, the equipment (fog machines, lights) made the party an incredible success. Thank you Frank and staff, I will be using you again and will recommend your company to all of my friends
