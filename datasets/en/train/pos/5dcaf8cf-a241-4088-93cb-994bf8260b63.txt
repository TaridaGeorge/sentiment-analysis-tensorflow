My husband, daughter and I have been going here for over a year, and absolutely love it.  Aside from everyone being so incredibly nice and attentive, the food here is just fantastic.  We initially came here for the sushi, but Chen talked us into trying one of the Korean bowls, and now we're addicted.  We have not had one bad meal here.  The prices are very reasonable, the restaurant super clean, service quick--couldn't ask for anything better.  They also have a couple of plasma tvs which are usually tuned to a sporting event, which my husband loves. Contrary to a previous review, we did not find the menu confusing at all--it was very organized and descriptive (which is very helpful for the special sushi rolls).  
Highly highly recommend this place!
