Took some friends who just moved here to Tesoro.  As always service was great and the food outstanding.  We had to wait while they made fresh mozzarella for our salad-wonderful!   All the meals were outstanding and the wine was luscious for the price.  Love the small, family atmosphere versus the typical large, noisy and slick interiors of some many places today.
