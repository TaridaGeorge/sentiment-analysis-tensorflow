I have good luck at this place.
Love their dresses, and how everything is always an additional % off.

Case in point, today I got a FCUK dress for $30!
YES!!!
(and not one of their plain/basic ones, a v fancy one)

Now, it is a clearance center, so like any other bargain place, it is hit or miss.  Have left here empty handed a few times...
