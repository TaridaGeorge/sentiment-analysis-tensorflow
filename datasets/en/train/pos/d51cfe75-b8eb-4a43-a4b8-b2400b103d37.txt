Is this place gay?? Its tottaly color cordinated from the decorations to the guests. I love the various retail outlets located on the lower plaza level. I never realized they had a panda express there too. A little commercial for my taste, but still has a unique feel. The landscaping is well maintained and the cooking class is original. Cheers!
