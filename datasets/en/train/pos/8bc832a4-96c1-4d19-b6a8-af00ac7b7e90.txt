Love it here! It was my 2nd time there but the first for the rest of the family. Very peaceful and serene. Great photography opportunities. Very educational. As a family of four midwesterners, we loved walking around looking at the beautifully designed and cared for desert landscape. 

We paid about $40 to get in, for a 16 year old, 6 year old, and two adults. Both times I've gone it has taken me about 3 hours to very leisurely walk the entire gadens with a stop for something to drink and relax. 

We saw plants that looked like they were from another planet! We saw lizards too!

I highly recommend a visit! Stay for sunset, it's beaituful!
