Im confused why others gave mixed reviews.  I've been coming to this location for years for my three dogs. I have the Banfield plan so a lot of routine care is covered what's great with the plan is I something comes up unexpected, they will squeeze you in same day, and the visit is free unless u need meds or something extra! They also make multiple courtesy calls to remind you that your pet is due for a check up which busy people that forget appreciate. Love te docs and nurses here too. They treat your poochies like family!!
