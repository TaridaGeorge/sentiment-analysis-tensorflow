I started shopping exclusively at Trader Joe's years ago. Well, almost exclusively. If I didn't need a wider selection of produce I'd only shop there. I enjoy that their food has higher quality ingredients than the regular grocery store. I like looking at the back of a package and not seeing 35 ingredients with names I can't pronounce. I also dig the fact they don't use preservatives and that they have dried fruit without sulfites. Their food tastes better, there's not a whole lot of added crap, and everything is fresher. 

Some food is seasonal, like those specialty shrimp they sell around summertime, which are fantastic! Everything about it makes me happy. I'm in and out in no time and the people working are always friendly and give me good advice on new food.
