This is where we held the SMX Social Media Epic Dinner AZ .... the staff was amazing.  The food was even better.  I loved doing it the way we did because I got to try a lot of dishes I would not normally order.  Lots of food and dessert and everyone left happy.  Again, I can't thank the staff enough ... they were amazing and paid attention to detail.  Our waiter specifically was awesome.  I forget his name, but he was the one who could pick up an odd shaped M&M with chopsticks .. YOU ROCKED DUDE!
