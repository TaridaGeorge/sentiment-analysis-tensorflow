This review doesn't need to be long.

Everything already has been said about Pizzeria Bianco.

Their margarita and marinara za is killer.  Better than places like Luzzos or Patsys in NY?  Pretty close, and damn good.  

I wouldn't compare it to NY za anyway, closer to za in Rome or Naples.  More sauce, less cheese, the way za is meant to be.

Great crust, fresh ingredients, great sauce, quality olive oil.

Who cares about the wait.  You knew about it before you got there.  Grab some wine and put a zipper on da mouth.

I give it my highest sausage and garlic rating, from the NY Pizza Guy.
