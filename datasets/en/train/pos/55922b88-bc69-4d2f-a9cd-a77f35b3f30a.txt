Feeling lost, I remembered imagining how this area would have looked the same during the time of the dinosaurs.  I've never been to the top.  I guess we got lost, even though the trail includes steps and is usually marked.  This was a highlight of our weekend in Scottsdale.  We took the easy short hike and followed my friend to a dried riverbed that led to a fence.
