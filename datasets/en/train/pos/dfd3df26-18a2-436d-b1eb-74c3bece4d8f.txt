We have been searching Scottsdale for good Chinese for almost two years and finally we can stop. We got some traditional Chinese dishes as well as some sushi (Tiger Rolls are amazing). Everything was excellent and plentiful. By the time it hit the fridge we barely felt like we had dented it. All in all it is the best Chinese food in Scottsdale for our money.
