We found Scott working on a neighbor's yard and we had given up our previous lawn care service a couple of months ago.   He agreed to take our yard for an initial clean up fee and a relatively low monthly fee for bi-weekly service.   Scott came out and did an awesome job on our yard.   He trimmed the front tree and got everything cleaned up great.  Scott told me had previously owned a lawn care business that he had then sold.  He regretted that and now was starting from scratch again.  He did a great job and I would recommend him to anyone.
