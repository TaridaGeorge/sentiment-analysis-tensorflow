This is a great shop.  Stopped in a few nights ago just as they were closing.  I was trying to hurry and look at everything so I staff could get out of there on time.  But they were super cool and said they still had lots to do and take our time.  I bought a really cute necklace - its a tiny wishbone on a very thin thread that you are to wear until it falls off and then your wish will come true - how cute is that!!!!  
Wonderful wine racks too!!  I love this place.
