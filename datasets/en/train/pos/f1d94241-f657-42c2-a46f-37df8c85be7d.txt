5/5 for me!  What a great burger place.  My husband found this place online and because of the great reviews, we decided to try it out during a trip out to Phoenix.  We were definitely not disappointed.  The portions were generous and well worth it.  It definitely is a little pricey for burgers and fries (we probably paid about $35 for 2 people)  But if you want quality, go to Delux!  Our waiter was one of the best servers we have had in awhile.  He was on top of things and very friendly.  We never had to ask for drink refills or condiments, he was always 2 steps ahead of us.  The ambiance was very inviting as well.  And the best part?  ITS OPEN LATE!
