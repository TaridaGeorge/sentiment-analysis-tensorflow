Not much to say here, but if you love sports and have not been here GO.

During Spring Training or weekends, make a reservation or be disappointed.  They have an incredible collection of sports artifacts, allow an hour plus to just look around.  The food is straight-forward mid-west steakhouse and the meat is exceptional quality.  Forget the fish and vegetables, this is a steakhouse.

No pretension here, don't embarrass yourself if you see Hall of Fame athletes (any sport) or celebrities at the next table.  Take a cab, parking is limited and the Scottsdale PD doesn't tolerate DUI.  You'll have more than a few cocktails between dinner and checking out the vintage pictures, jerseys and autographs.
