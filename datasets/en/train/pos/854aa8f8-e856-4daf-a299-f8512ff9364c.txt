I just polished off a 1/4 lb burger and fries from Lucky Boy.  Holy freaking yum!  I haven't had one of their burgers since I was a kid and my Dad's office was right down the street.  I feel like I've just been reunited with a childhood friend, the one who can put a smile on your face anytime without even trying.
