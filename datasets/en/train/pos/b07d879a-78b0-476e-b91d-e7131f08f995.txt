5 stars? What did you think I was going to put?

I heart Trader Joe's. Got to love that place. What drives me crazy is people say it is so expensive! I think the place is cheap. (and I am a poor college student) Especially when you look at what you're getting. Charles Shaw ($3 buck chuck, $2 if you're lucky enough to live in CA) need I say more?

I heart TJ's
