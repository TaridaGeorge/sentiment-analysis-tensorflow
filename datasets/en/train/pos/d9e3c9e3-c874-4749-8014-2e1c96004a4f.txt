This is the best pizza and wings ever. I used to go to Native New Yorker for cheap wings, but these are soo much better. I love how saucy they are and not too fatty. The pizza does not skimp on cheese like most places. I've only gotten carry out so I'm not sure how great the delivery service is. I believe this is a not a chain and you can tell by the quality of the food. The place is usually busy so dont expect individual service but it is all worth it.
