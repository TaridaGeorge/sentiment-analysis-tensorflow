Amazing family owned sandwich shop.  I can't believe that after almost 30 years of living in the Valley, I only discovered it this year.

The food is delicious.  Great hoagies, good salads, and great hot sandwiches... the cheesesteak is not to be missed in my opinion, but there hasn't been a single sandwich I haven't liked.

What really sells it though is the family.  They are amazing- friendly, will get to know you by name (right off the bat on your first visit), and will make you feel at home.  They are pretty incredible and they make this place extremely special.
