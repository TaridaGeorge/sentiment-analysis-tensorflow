Divine thin crust pizza, great salads, appetizers, wings, and pizza cookies (left a little doughy with ice cream on top). The service is always great as is the atmosphere. The wait can be a long on weekend nights but the food is worth it. Lunch specials are also good and it's a great place for a work lunch. Large patio area is a perfect place to eat most of the year. 

My go-to menu items are the Pablo Picasso salad, the NÃºmero One-O on thin crust, and a peanut butter pizza cookie.
