We came here on a beautiful Sunday morning. We sat outside, which i don't think there is inside seating here. But, not sure.                        Anyway, this is such a peaceful and beautiful place!                                  The Coffee and Tea were great. The Food wonderful!   So romantic and beautiful. This is the place to go to just relax and remember what a great place the Valley can be.
