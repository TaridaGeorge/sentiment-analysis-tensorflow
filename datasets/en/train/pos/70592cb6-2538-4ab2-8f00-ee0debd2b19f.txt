oh the glory days back at Four Peaks! I loved this place when i lived in Tempe. I was there at least once a week, and i always go when i visit. All their food is excellent including their desserts. The spinach and artichoke dip and the fish and chips are super good. The peach beer which is seasonal is amazing and refreshing. The patio is one of the nicest places to sit, so chill.
