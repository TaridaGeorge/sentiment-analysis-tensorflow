All I have had from here are their cupcakes.  Can we say heaven in my mouth? 

Vendors visit my work and they like to feed us, I have had Main Course cupcakes twice now and they were superbly delicious.  All of my coworkers agree.  I have tried the red velvet, lemon, and boston cream (coworker and I shared so we could try more than one) and they were all noteworthy. My fav is the lemon. 

I am interested to know what their other food is like, as I'm sure it is delish as well.
