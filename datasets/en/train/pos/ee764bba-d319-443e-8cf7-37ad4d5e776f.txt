mac makeup is expensive but the pigmentation is soo freaking awesome! the pigmentation of their eye shadows..SUPER WORTH IT! the paint pots good for base! i love their sculpt and shape to contour your face powder, i wish it was part of their permanent line.  if you wanted to splurge on make up, this is really good and recommended, ate wasy $400 worth of my bank account lol. soo yup.  they give great customer service, friendly and helpful, and spent $50 or more you get your make up done.  plus they do back to mac where after a certain amount of containers for eyeshadow etc, you get free lipgloss etc. their blendability factor is great, and it glides on like silk.  man did i get addicted. .
