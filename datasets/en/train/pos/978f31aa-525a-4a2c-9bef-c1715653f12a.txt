My goodness, Torched Goodness! This is some darn tasty creme brulee. If they are offering their lavender flavor, you have to try it! It's not too floral so don't worry about it tasting like soap. I live in Gilbert and made the trek out to North Scottsdale to visit them at the North Scottsdale Farmers Market (Saturdays, 94th St. & Shea). I wasn't ready to eat my dessert so early in the morning, so they were awesome and packed my brulee in a cup of ice to keep it cold on my way home! These guys are great! For only $4 you get a yummy cup of happiness.
