GREAT GELATO!! If you do not know anything about Gelato you need to check this place out!! It is some of the best Gelato/ ice cream/ frozen yogurt i have had in a long time! If you go on the Weekend Night you are going to have to wait in line! Last time i went it the line was out the door! We waited for 15 minutes, Well worth the wait! Do not be turned off by the line! You will be happy you waited!
