I was just married out in Sedona, and used Windy City DJs. They did a fantastic job, and everyone danced all night - the dance floor was still full at the end of the night, and guests didn't want to leave. It was a challenging crew, because we had older people who like to dance to latin music and swing, and a big younger crowd who wanted club music. Curt walked the line beautifully, and everyone had a blast. He also kept the volume just right - loud enough to keep the party going, but low enough that the older people could hold a conversation. I had a lot of requests for Curt and Windy City, and they hit each one of them. I'm delighted that my cousin recommended them to me, and would recommend them to anyone.
