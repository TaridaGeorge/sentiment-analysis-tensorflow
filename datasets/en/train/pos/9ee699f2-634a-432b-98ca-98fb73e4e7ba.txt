You can find so many good gifts in here to give away. I signed up for their emails so I get the info on when they are having sales or have gotten something new in the store.

You can find polished gemstones, mineral specimens, beads, jewelry, magnetic bracelets, salt lamps, fossils, jewelry making supplies, and huge, giant geodes. This is a great place to take a Geology buff. I am always able to walk into the store and name every rock and gemstone, nerdy I know.

I always go in for their incense, cool incense holders, tribal masks, and hematite rings. Large selection of petrified wood, drums, wind chimes, and wall ornaments. The staff that works there is very friendly as well. Always a great place to stop by in the mall. Did I mention their prices are ridiculously cheap?
