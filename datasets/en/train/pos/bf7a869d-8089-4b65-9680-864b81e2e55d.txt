I loved Smeeks! If you're looking for a novelty birthday gift I would go here. They have such a fun assortment of items. They even have a wide variety of klutz books which were my favorite as a kid. As far as pricing. they seemed pretty reasonable to me. Nothing looked higher than it should be. I will definitely be going back.
