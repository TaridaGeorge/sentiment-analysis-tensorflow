Ordered drunken noodles with seafood last night--was expecting wide rice noodles, but it came with the rice noodles typical of phad thai.  It was bursting in flavor, though and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

Been there once before--can't remember exactly what I ordered, although I think we had spring roll appetizers, a curry dish, and perhaps phad thai.  Loved the food last time.  One of my favorite Thai restaurants in Phoenix.  Plan to try something not so staple next time, like Tiger Crying (had that dish at only 1 other Thai restaurant I've been to & loved it).
