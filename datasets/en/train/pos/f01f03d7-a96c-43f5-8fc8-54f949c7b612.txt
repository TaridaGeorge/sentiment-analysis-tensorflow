The customer service here was great!! Was in town for my boyfriends birthday and they made it extra special for him by sending up a card signed by all the staff AND a cheesecake with ice cream. I would stay here again in a heart beat just because of the friendliness alone. The hotel itself was very nice, clean and modern. No complaints here.
