The MAC rocks! It is a fully modern arts venue with great architecture and 4 (count 'em) four performing arts spaces. I've seen three shows at MAC  and I've had a great time, every time. Add to this the fine arts education center and the museum (which I have yet to visit). 

The Store, as they call the gift shop, is full of the regularly gallery store crap. But it also has handmade ceramic, glass and jewelry pieces created by students in the education program. All are affordable, and some of the pieces are actually really good. Check it out next time you need a cool gift.
