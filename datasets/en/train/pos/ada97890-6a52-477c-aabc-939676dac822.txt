My boyfriend and I were visiting the Phoenix area for a few days and were recommended J&G by our hotel conceirge. We went out for drinks beforehand and were surprised to learn that many locals did not know about the steakhouse.

The restaurant is located near the top of the Phoenician and had a beautiful view. All of the tables in the dining room were set up so that you could see the view during the meal. We went at sunset- it was beautiful. The food was delicious, though pricey (it's what we expected) and the service was impeccable. I would recommend J&G for a romantic date or for a special occasion.
