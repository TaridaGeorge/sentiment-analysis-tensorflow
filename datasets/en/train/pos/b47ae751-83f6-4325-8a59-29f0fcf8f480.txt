This place was very comfortable with some great food and wine.  The food we had was delicious, and service was always prompt.  Don't think my water glass ever got under half full as many times as someone would walk by and top things good.

The appetizer menu of various dressed chips is well worth an order.  Anything else on the menu for a entree is probably going to be a good choice.
