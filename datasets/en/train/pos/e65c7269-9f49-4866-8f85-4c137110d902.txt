So after coming here for the first time the other day, I'm thinking about starting a monthly "Golden Girls" fan club meeting and having here at Pugzies, anyone want in?    Wow, they have tried to keep this place unique with the entire building pained in the brightest teal blue you have ever see. The floral patterns throughout the place just want to make you run out and buy some Velcro walking shoes!

Anyways, the food is great. A half sandwich is more than enough, I don't know any people that could eat an entire sandwich in one sitting.
Plenty of sides to choose from, pasta salads and the like.  Several soup options with a few daily specials.

This place is open at 10am (my lunch time) so I'll be here about one a week from now on.  Why have I never been here before?
