I'm a big fan! Postino's has the market on Bruschetta... it is scrumptiously delicious! I have tried their salads, sandwiches, desserts and all were excellent. And the Butcher Block was amazing! They also have the market on the best pitcher price for great beer, not just domestics, crafts as well for only $5 until 5pm... what a steal! Also on Monday & Tuesday nights they have a House bottle of vino & an order of Bruschetta for only $20, another great deal. Atmosphere is nice, relaxed and fun. Service has been good, very friendly & knowledgable. It can get very busy and have a long wait but if you plan ahead, you will be eating and drinking in no time at all... Totally worth it!
