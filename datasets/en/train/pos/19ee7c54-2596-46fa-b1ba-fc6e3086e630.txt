This review will seem very similar to the others.. like many, I've been going to Capt'n Bills since it  opened in the early 80s. I don't live on that side of town anymore yet I make at least one weekly pilgrimage..

First.. I get the 10" vegi sub.. its simply the best vegi sub you can get anywhere.. and like other reviewers.. the Italian dressing is the special sauce'. 

Secondly, the shave ice they use in their fountain drinks is the best. I don't like my kids drink any soda .. except at Captain Bills.. its good enough to break the rules.. :)

Lastly, the 'stuff' that  decorates the restaurant is not some corporate creation.. its paraphernalia that have been added, layer by layer, over the years by the employees themselves.. I love it all and so do my kids.
