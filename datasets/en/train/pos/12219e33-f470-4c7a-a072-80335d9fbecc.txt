The only bad thing about this place is that they only accept cash. Other than that this place is on my number 1 list for having the best burger I have ever eaten. To describe the burger I had was sooo juicy inside, the outside was chared crispy from the open flame, the bun was air fluffed soft and the cheese was very cheese. I would take a bite I can see the juices from the burger drip. Everytime I think of this place my mouth begins to water :-P
