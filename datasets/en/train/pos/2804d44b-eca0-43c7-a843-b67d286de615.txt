Another great Pat's Run! One of the best t-shirts I've ever gotten from a run before too! Sold-out again this year but somehow it seemed a little more organized and let people know what to expect. 
Three water stations along the route and water, bananas and oranges at the end. There were also some outside sponsors there handing out freebies-I did have a refreshing smoothie from jamba juice. 
Cool finish line inside Sun Devil stadium, that's probably the best part. Along with being there with all those thousands of people for a great cause!
