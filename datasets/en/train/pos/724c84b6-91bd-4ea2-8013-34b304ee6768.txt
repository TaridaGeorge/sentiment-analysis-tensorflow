This is the best Filipino Restaurant in Phoenix!

The restaurant is nice and always clean.  The staff there are friendly.  The food is reasonably priced.  

They offer a lot of variety each day.  I believe they offer around 15+ entree options and that's not including their silog menu.  My fiance and I usually get a two choice with a boba drink and that usually comes out less than $20.  If we're really hungry we get a halo halo supreme to finish our meal.
