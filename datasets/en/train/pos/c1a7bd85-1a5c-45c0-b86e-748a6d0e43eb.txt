Amazing is all I have to say about this place...the end!

Okay, I have to rant on about this place, it's delicious!! I was looking for a location that served the best of the best for pizza and saw Spinato's come up. The service here was exceptional and our waiter was soooo nice! We started off with a salad and I had the raspberry vinaigrette which was awesome. We also had the medium thin crust pizza topped with extra cheese, spinach, and ham...amazing!! To end the meal we had to try the desserts so we shared a holy cannoli and brownie bella which both were mouth watering and a must have.

I will be going back to this place, although that wait was longer than expected and the waiting area was HOT! It was all well worth the wait. :)
