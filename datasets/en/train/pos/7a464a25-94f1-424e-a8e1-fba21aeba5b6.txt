If you want a perfectly made drink...and you live in America...this is your place. I had the perfect martini---blessed is Ketel One. Also, I do not like gin due to a number of young mistakes. The bartender assured me he could make me a gin drink I would love. Hendrick's gin, cilantro, and a few ingredients later, and I gulped that sucker down in no time. This place just feels classic, and like a good man it feels like it knows exactly what it's doing. As far as the food--I only had the blue cheese stuffed olives that were in my martinis; like everything else, they were perfect.
