Started coming to the area in December 2010 and Tommy's is on my list every visit, which is once a month.  The food is made from scratch and the service is great.  they make you feel welcomed and appreciative that you are visiting their restaurant.  Last visit I sat at the bar to watch the game and met Tommy and several of the local patrons.  Great atmosphere, especially if Renee is working behind the bar, or serving or what ever they need her to do.  
The Alfredo sauce is the best I have experienced.  Also the Sausage Penne with al Vodka sauce, WOW!  

Try the chicken wings, too.  Three areas of dinning, front restaurant if you want a quiet area, the bar area for the neighborhood atmosphere or outside on the patio for taking it all in.
