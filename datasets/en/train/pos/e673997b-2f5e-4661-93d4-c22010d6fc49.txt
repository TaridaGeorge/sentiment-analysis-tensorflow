Great service and food was amazing. I got the Mongolian beef lunch special. The portion was enormous and I took half of it with me (cold Chinese food makes a great snack.) The Mongolian beef was perfectly spicy. The hot and sour soup was delicious as well... And they gave me a free refill on it too. My drink was never more than halfway empty and I felt like I was being treated like a king. I will definitely be going back.
