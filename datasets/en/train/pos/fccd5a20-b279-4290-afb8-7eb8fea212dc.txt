The BEST Japanese food in AZ! Guaranteed! When you are looking for original Japanese food, or the closest taste to Japan, this would be it! The sushi is soooo fresh and they always carry out items that are not available in other sushi place like uni or sweet little octopus that I love! Their ramen is also superb and if you come here for lunch, don't forget to check in their special of the day cause they offer a great price with superb taste and lots of variety for lunch!! Love this place so much!
