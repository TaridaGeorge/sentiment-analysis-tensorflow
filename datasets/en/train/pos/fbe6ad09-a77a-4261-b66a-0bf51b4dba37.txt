As far as a McDonald's goes, this place is always pretty quick and efficient!

I come here pretty often for coffee in the mornings.  The lady in the drive-thru knows me and is super friendly!  They are always fast!

I've only had a few instances where there's been a bit too much cream or something in my coffee where it had to be thrown out.  More often it's done perfectly!

And with the new remodel, it looks great!
