My parents took me to brunch here for my 20th birthday, The staff was super friendly, brought out a delicious birthday cake that they were kind enough to box for me to take home so that I could enjoy the desert selection at the buffet. The Buffet was fantastic, everything was delicious from fresh fruit and cheeses, to eggs benedict, prime rib, and a large selection of mouth watering deserts. I would definitely recommend coming for their Sunday brunch anytime, and come hungry because there is so much to eat and it's all delicious.
