I didn't even know this Cafe was on the other side of Desert Ridge.
My husband and I didn't know what to expect when we walked in but it was surprising on how comfortable and unique it was. 
We got recommended the Hawaiian Breakfast and the Breakfast burrito so we ordered that.
The food was amazing and it came out quick, but then again it was 7:45 In the morning so we were the only ones there. I honestly have no complaints, the food was great, the server was kind and its only minutes away from our apartment. Tryst has a lot of potential, especially since there are not many breakfast places in the desert ridge area.
Definitely a great place for breakfast or lunch!
