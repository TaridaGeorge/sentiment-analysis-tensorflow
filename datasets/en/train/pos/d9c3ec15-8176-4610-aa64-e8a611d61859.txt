Still loving this place!  The hostess always greets us with welcoming smiles and remembers us - every time.  The owner always comes around to say hello to the customers and are always engaging in smiles and welcoming.

The fish and turtle pond is so neat.  My boy loves to look inside and so do all of the other little kids there.  All staff is warm and friendly with the children.  We usually go there just for sushi, but we see lots of customers having fun with teppanyaki.  

The sashimi platters are amazing as well as the special rolls.  We are always impressed with the portions and freshness of the sashimi.  LOVE the happy hour.  

Everything is just always 5 star.  Will go back again and again.
