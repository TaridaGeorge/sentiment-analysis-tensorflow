Ive been here twice now, and looking forward to the next visit.

Their food is awesome. Unique and delicious pizzas (and like Jennifer mentioned, huge air bubbles around the crust. *whispers* Thats my favorite part.). Their bruschettas are ALL amazing. And, IMO, the best dessert is the trio of salty caramel, banana toffee, and actual mint mint chocolate chip ice creams. I would honestly go back just for that.

The first time we sat at the bar, and felt like we were hanging out w/ one of our friends the bartender was so nice (and she poured a great martini).

The second time we sat in one of the comfy couch corners for happy hour (drinks only) and our waitress was equally as inviting.
