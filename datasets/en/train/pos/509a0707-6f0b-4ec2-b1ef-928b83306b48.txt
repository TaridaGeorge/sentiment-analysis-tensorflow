The employees here are super helpful and provide great service. I went in recently and had Jose (who also went by Joe) help me with replacing the bulb in my headlight. I'm so glad I went here to get this done before I went to a shop because it saved me a good chunk of change. I will continue to go to this autozone for smaller car needs because of the money saved and the awesome employees!
