Just saw Mission Impossible (Ghost Protocol) at Tempe Cinemas tonight. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and even more than that, absolutely loved the fact that I didn't feel gouged by the prices.  
I brought a $20 bill to pay for the two of us -- something that would have not even paid for the tickets at a regular theater -- and came home with a lot of it left!  And we didn't skimp on the concessions either! Next time, with the refill popcorn bag and refill dollar cups, I will bring a $10 bill for the two of us and still come home with change!
What a lovely evening! I'll definitely be back!!! :-)
