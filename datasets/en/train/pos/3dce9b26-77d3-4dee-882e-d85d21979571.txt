Absolutly LUV the neighborhood nites special @ M&T - combine that with happy hour = an amazing deal, and a fabby nite out, GR8 drinks, good wines by the glass - o and did u know kids eat free 5-6 ?!?!  try and top that, i say!

1 of the best filets i've ever had.  YUM caprese salad!

I'll be back next week, i'm sure of it !  (after i vaccum out the cookie crumbs from the car because they hand you a fresh baked cookie upon leaving!)
