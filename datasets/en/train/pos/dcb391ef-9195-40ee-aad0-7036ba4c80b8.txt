The staff here is awesome, especially at the bar! We asked the chef about what she put in the empanadas to make them so great; she was super nice and personable, not to mention forthcoming. 

Even though I really like Fuego Bistro (same owners), I have to admit all the food here really has that extra something (maybe it's the chef? Hells ya.) Also, the decor and ambiance at Tacos caters to a more trendy, urban customer. Tacos is more polished, slightly funky, and modern; whereas the bistro is a more traditional Caribbean-style place. 

I love their Sangrias, especially the red one. Still the spiced pear sangria is very interesting. It doesn't taste exactly like what you'd expect, but worth a try. 

RECOMMENDATION: Come for their happy hour and TRY EVERYTHING!
