Evermore Nevermore is a new locally owned retail/consignment shop breaking up the monotony in downtown Mesa.  There's a ton of one-of-a-kind alternative-esque.. well, everything.  Art, clothing, jewelry, accessories, collectibles, comic books, Steampunk goodies, zombie survival gear, mostly crafted by Arizonans.  They host a bunch of fun events like the Steampunk jewelry workshop, life drawing, and Crazy Guy Video Nights, and have free sketches by Oddity Commodity on 2nd Fridays.  The staff is friendly and also knowledgeable about what they carry, as it's all hand picked by them.  Probably the best thing ever to happen to Mesa.  If you're into local art and supporting small businesses (and who isn't?) and you haven't been here, you're seriously missing out.
