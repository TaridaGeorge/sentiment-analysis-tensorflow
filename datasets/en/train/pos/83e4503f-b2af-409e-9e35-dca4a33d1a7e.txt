Oregano's is probably my favorite restaurant in Arizona so far! I love that they serve Chicago style pizza!

The restaurant is very unique and it makes for a very neat place to dine at even though it can be hard to get a table at times and parking is always somewhat of a challenge. The pizza is excellent and when I go with my fiance we also always get their pizza cookie for dessert, which is so good! The service here has also been top notch when we have visited, so I am very pleased about that!
