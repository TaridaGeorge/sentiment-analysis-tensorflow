My favorite place to eat in Phoenix!!!! My family and close friends have been eating at "los" since 1969. We love it. The food is so good and always consistant. It reasonably priced, and if you like a fast in and out meal try it.  YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!! My sister gets # 1, I get #6, and leesa gets a bean burrow enchilata style. Oh yes and uncle vic gets 
# 9.  YUMMY
