The Keg gets 5 Tickled Pink Stars!

This is absolutely one of my favorite restaurants!  The food, the ambiance and the service is what keeps me coming back.  It is a little more expensive, but I consider this place a treat!

My husband and I recently indulged ourselves for my birthday at the Desert Ridge location.  We usually visit The Keg at San Tan Marketplace, but have also been to the Chandler Fashion Square location.

Two of my must haves? Mushrooms Neptune and the Creme Brulee!  We've enjoyed a great steak before with an amazing flavor...cooked just right.  Every visit we've enjoyed either up at the bar or in a booth in the bar.  I'm still wondering what the restaurant looks like. LOL

We will be back again and again!
