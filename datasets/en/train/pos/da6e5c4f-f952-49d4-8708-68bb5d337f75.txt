This place is my favorite out of all the self-serve yogurt shops round town.  I could eat an entire bucket of the oatmeal cookie flava.  Topping options are prime.  They even have gum balls, which I thought was really unusual, but I'm not gonna hate.  They also have $0.35/oz Tuesdays.  Get it, cuz!

THIS PLACE IS BOMBBBB!!
