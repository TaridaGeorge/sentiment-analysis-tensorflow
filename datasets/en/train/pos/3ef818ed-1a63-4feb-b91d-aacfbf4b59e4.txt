Just had their latest creation - the chicken tender bites salad. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-ZBfr1BHvArFp1d6XH8jOQ?select=VQg07pVUi7ZiSTao92KkRg  It was mega-flavorful! I love that this is not a chain eatery; it frees them to be creative, so they keep coming up with delightful new things to offer.
