Needed supplies for a home brew and I work in Mesa. I thought I was going to have to drive all the way into Tempe and get stuff from "those other guys." I completely forgot about a small little store in a business park I remember seeing EVERY DAY when I drive to work (like an idiot). Much to my surprise, these guys were awesome. I may have been the only guy in the store but they gave me superb service, advice and showed me around a little bit. The store was very clean and organized, with almost everything in stock. I will continue to make this my only LHBS and recommend them to all.
