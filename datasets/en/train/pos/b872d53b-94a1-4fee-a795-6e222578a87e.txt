I actually only had their garlic knots, but I am so impressed that I gave it five stars. Why? Because I do NOT like marinara sauce. I never have. But their marinara (which is made in store) was SO good! Usually I'll just eat my garlic bread w/out any sauce, but this was fantastico! I'm not a huge pizza person, but I'll probably be seeing these guys again soon.
