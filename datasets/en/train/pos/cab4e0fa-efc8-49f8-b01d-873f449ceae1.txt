"I'm no food critic" but this place is amazing. I has the salmon dinner tonight and it was fabulous. The gourmet pizzas are also amazing. but my most favorite item at the cider mill is the "honey Weiss" beer. You gotta have one and then get the history on this particular hand crafted beverage! Outstanding service. Vicky the chef is extremely experiences. Definitely worth the money here. Them go to the pantry next door. This is a bonus!!!!  Thanks guys!!!
