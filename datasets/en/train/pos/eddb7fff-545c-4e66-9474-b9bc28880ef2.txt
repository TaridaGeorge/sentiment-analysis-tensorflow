Had a excellent lunch today at Thai'd Up.  Great variety of food on the menu and excellent service too.  I will be coming back with some friends for dinner soon.  Really like the location along the light rail and across from Starbucks.  Very good value too, my lunch came with soup and a vegetable spring roll.  The spring rolls are outstanding.  I asked and they make them homemade in the restaurant.  I would recommend if you like Thai or Vietnamese cuisine.
