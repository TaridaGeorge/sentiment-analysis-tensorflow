If you like subs, you really should try this place.  They have two types of bread (white and wheat) so the selection isn't as varied as Subway but it's very fresh and tasty.  It has a real deli feel to it and they have arranged it so there is a meat and cheese case next to a toppings case.

The staff at this location is very friendly.  I've been at the Happy Valley location three times now and each time the place was extremely clean and the staff was energetic and warm. Highly recommended.
