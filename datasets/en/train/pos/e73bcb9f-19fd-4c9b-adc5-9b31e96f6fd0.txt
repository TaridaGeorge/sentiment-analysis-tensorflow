I almost wet my pants with excitement after six days of stringent dieting... when finally my prescribed 'binge and eat whatever the heck you want' day came upon me. What better way to splurge on calorific goodness than with a thin crust NY style pizza!  A nice pizzeria... which, although lacking in that authentic original hole-in-the-wall Grimaldi ambience... is well worth a visit. The calzone was marvellous, as was the custom margarita with extra sauce and fresh tomatoes. Being all authentic and such... no chillies or hot sauce. Salivating already at the prospect of returning to this shrine of thin crustiness!
