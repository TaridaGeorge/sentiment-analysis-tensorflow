I am from upstate New York so I must warn you that this review may be a little biased. Any place that has a white hot dog on their menu is going to be a favorite of mine. The onion rings were also yummy and next time I want to try a milk shake!. I definitely recommend stopping in. Ted's is a unique restaurant that makes me miss upstate NY!
