I took a car in for a pre-purchase inspection and was glad to know i have a reasonable Mercedes service center 20 blocks from my house. They did a very good job at scoping out the whole car to make sure I wasn't buying something I may soon regret.  They also do the type A and type B services here at a cheaper than dealer rate as well.  

When I stopped in I noticed several classic Mercedes in the stalls getting serviced and I know if people that trust them to work on those beauties I could trust them in the future with my car.  I will be back as I bought the car and I'll feel that my car is in great hands.
