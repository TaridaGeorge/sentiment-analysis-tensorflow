Wow, after reading mixed reviews i wasnt sure what to expect. We went here for dinner and drinks before a show at the Dodge Theatre. It was packed, but luckily we found a seat. It seemed to be understaffed for such a large crowd, but the waitress was great. The food was even better. My girl got the fish n chips and i had the shepards pie. Very conventional irish fare and a safe bet. For $8 an entree the food was amazing. The beers were cheap, tasty and always full. The atmosphere was a typical Irish pub, being loud and lively.  This place is great and will only get more crowded as soon as the light rail opens. They also have a great whiskey selection and great decorations. FYI this place is perfect before any major event downtown.
