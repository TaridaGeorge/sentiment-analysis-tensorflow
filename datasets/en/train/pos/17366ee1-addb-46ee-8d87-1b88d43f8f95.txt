Johnny did it again. 

Sens was my favorite restaurant, yet somehow with Sochu, Johnny found a way to improve on what was already fantastic.

While I admit the location is not the best (especially with recent construction) the bigger space, the separate bar and dining room, the extra bathrooms, the expanded menu, and the newly added happy hour more than make up for it.

The expanded menu is exceptional; including an expansive tapas and family style section, and accommodates veggies, vegans, and carnivores alike. 

The outside patio is another really fantastic element. Thank you for the heaters.

Well done, Johnny!
