This is the best Pizza EVER! We order it here at work all the time and everyone loves it. For dine in it is nice too, and at lunch they do two types of service... if you want to get your food and get out you can order at the counter and they call your number. If you want to be served, they have waiter service too. It is a bit pricey, $18 per large pizza but well worth it.  PS, They DO deliver as of a couple months ago.

My manager says "MMMMMMMMMM"
