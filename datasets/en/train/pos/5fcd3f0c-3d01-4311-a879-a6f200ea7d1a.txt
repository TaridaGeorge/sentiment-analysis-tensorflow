I overheard a bartender at Sleepy Dog Brewing tell another patron about this place, and I decided to stop in and see what they had. They have an absolutely amazing selection of American micros, including some beers I thought I'd never see outside the brewery. For example, I bought a couple bottles of Lost Abbey Angel's Share -- a beer I've been lusting after for years, but never found. There were many other special beers, but I have only so much room in my suitcase.
