A wine lover`s heaven or ultimate dream!! I went in here to pick out a gift and ended up emerging 2 hours later with not only my wine gift but with more knowledge on wine and feeling pretty good after indulging in a tasting as well!! 
They have an incredible inventory of wines from all regions, and plenty of spirits and specialty beers. I like this place way more than Total Wines, more intimate and the staff is so helpful! That`s how I ended up staying for the tasting and getting a worthy intro on four different wines, with a cheese plate, delish!! They also serve light salads and sandwiches. I`m coming back here definitely! Need any suggestions for wine, come here!
