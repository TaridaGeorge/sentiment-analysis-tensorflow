I have to raise this review of mine to five stars.  I went here again after a year absence, and have to tell you...Florencia's still rocks and it is even better than before!

The up and comer in town was Rosies and now they are off the grid.  But Florencia's is still here and still making GREAT pizza.  Loving the pepperoni and sausage thin crust!!

ENJOY!
