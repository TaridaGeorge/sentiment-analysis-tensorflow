OMG!!!!!!  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I had a Chi Latte that was UNBELIEVABLE!!!  Go here!!!!!!!!!!  I think that their hours are that great but I was told that they are changing next week, so maybe they will be open later.  My husband got their signature drink that is an espresso with cream with agave nectar, he get it with soy and it is still DELISH.  The prices are great for what you are getting, they are truly putting a lot of effort into their creations- the prices are comparable to Starsluts but the drinks are better.

What I get:
I would really try anything here, and will update as I do but so far I have had the 
Chai Tea Latte.
