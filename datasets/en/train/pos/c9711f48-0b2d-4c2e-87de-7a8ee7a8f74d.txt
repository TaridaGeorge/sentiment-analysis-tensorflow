In this economy, there's not much of a better deal for entertainment.  I came here with my girlfriend, my two sisters, my brother-in-law, and my two nephews... 7 people in all... and we all rode the train for $12.  The kids had a blast, and everyone else did as well because they had so much fun.  I'd say fun for all ages, but that'd be way too cheesy.
