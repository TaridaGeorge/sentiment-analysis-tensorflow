Baratin made my day, truly a pleasure.

I started out with a salad with Maytag, roasted hazelnuts, pears and butternut squash, every bit of it was absolutely perfect. I almost cried when one of the nuts rolled off the plate. The salad mix was fresh and crisp, the butternut was, I think raw, or just barely cooked, and I kept thinking, why didn't I think to do that? The combination of flavors was a sin.

Next I had brussels sprouts with pickled red onion and some other deliciousness I can't remember. They were those perfect petite brussels, not the big honking ones that don't hold their shape. Good flavor, crisp, and the red onion gave them some bite. I enjoyed them.

You should eat at Baratin, probably more than once.
