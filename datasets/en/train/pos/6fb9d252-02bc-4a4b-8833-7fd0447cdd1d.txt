I wrote this review after I moved into the area, and thought I should give it an update.  I frequent this establishment on a regular basis and the service and cocktails are amazing.  The bartenders are very friendly and even take the time to bring water with fancy things in it like cucumbers and fresh basil leaves.  Just going that extra mile really provides a nice guest experience.  These things do not go unnoticed by me for sure.  The food is just as wonderful. They have amazing fresh mozzarella sticks with a lovely marinara dip.  Their salads and pizzas are well prepared also. Cocktails flow and we are always well taken care of here.
