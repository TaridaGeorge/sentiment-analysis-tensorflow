We are very happy with the work that David and his crew performed.  They the entire interior of our new house over a five day period, they were very fast, attentive to detail and priced fairly.  What impressed me most though is that David and his crew were very prompt, having worked with contractors in the past, when I spoke with David on a Sunday night and he told me his crew would be at the house Monday morning, I was somewhat skeptical.  Sure enough, I showed up mid-day Monday and the crew had already made it through our entire first floor taping and edging....very impressive.  I would recommend David without reservation to other fellow Yelpers.
