I called Wright's out the first time a couple of years ago when my clothes dryer stopped blowing hot air. He worked quickly and didn't try to push a service plan or anything. So last year when my clothes washer started overflowing I called the company again. Just like before, the serviceguy showed up on time and went straight to work. He told me what had gone wrong and in both instances the cost was far below what I would've expected to pay. When I work with Wright's I feel more like I'm working with a family friend rather than a business. It's nice to know there are still companies like this around.
