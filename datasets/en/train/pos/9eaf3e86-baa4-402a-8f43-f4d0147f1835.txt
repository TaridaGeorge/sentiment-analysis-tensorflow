This place is amazing. I can't say it enough. My boyfriend gave me his camera but the charger was no where to be found. After price hunting universal chargers at Target, Walmart and the like, I decided to pop into Batteries Plus. Their universal charger was more than $10 cheaper than Walmart!!!! That's amazing. To make it even better the gentleman who helped me made sure that the charger worked with my battery and showed me how to use it. Great service and great prices. I definitely would recommend seeing the experts first!
