We've take our daughter to Dr. Ramirez at TLC since we were released from the hospital.  I've seen all but one of the four doctors, and have been extremely pleased with all of them.  They offer both a sick and well child waiting room.  Our daughter loves the themed rooms.  With small children, you will have the inevitable emergencies that require a doctors visit.  My child is two now, and we have never been unable to get an emergency/sick appointment.  Our phone calls have always been promptly returned on the same day.  Anything they told us they were doing, was done as promised.  I cannot recommend them highly enough!
