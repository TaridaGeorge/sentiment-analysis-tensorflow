If you or anyone you care about has muffler problems, come here!! My FJ cruiser had a rattle underneath from a boulder mishap for years. I was referred here and 20 minutes and $25 later it was good as new! Dealer had told me it was going to be so expensive that I would be better off making an insurance claim. I am so glad I was given the right advice to come here.
