Was over at Lexus this morning getting the ES350 serviced, and let me just say - Lexus knows how to take care of you. Even if you bring kids. They have drinks, soda, water and juice. Hot chocolate or coffee. Snacks and a kids play area. Everyone is so nice and takes care of you so well. I will keep coming back because of the service. Whoever is on charge of this team/location give yourself a pat on the back.
