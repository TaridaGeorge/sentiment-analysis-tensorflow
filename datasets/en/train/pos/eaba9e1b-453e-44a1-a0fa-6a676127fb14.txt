The people here were very nice.  They have a great deal of patients for working around so many children in a small place.  There are tons of games fun for all ages.  I have a 7 and 4 year old and we all three had fun.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE the customer service at this location.  The food and prices are also great.  WAY BETTER than C. Cheese.
