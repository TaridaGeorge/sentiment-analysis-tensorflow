Excellent job at doing what they do.  Don't think I've had better Crème Brûlée anywhere in the Valley.  ( Maybe The Farm Kitchen at South Mountain's butternut squash Crème Brûlée would give them a run for the money. )

Anyway, I drove about 15 miles to get this food, and I bought 4 flavors - chocolate, vanilla, lavender, and pumpkin.

All were drool-worthy.  I'll be back to this truck...somewhere...sometime...:)
