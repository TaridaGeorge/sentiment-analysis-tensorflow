I f*ing love this place! It strangely feels like home, hahaha.. What's not to love about this little cool ass dive bar? Cheap (CHEAP!!) drinks, awesome music (finally away from that top 40s bs).. Everyone is there just do get s* faced and dance to way cool songs only a few people (with great musical taste) will listen to and none the less know how to dance to hahaha. This place you can wear anything and go. They have a electronic gambling machine by the bar which is hilarious. The bathrooms are disgusting but whatever,  you'll probably be too drunk to give a s* :)
