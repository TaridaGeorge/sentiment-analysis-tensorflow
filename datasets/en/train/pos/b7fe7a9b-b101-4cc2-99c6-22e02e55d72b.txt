Nestled inside the Downtown Sheraton lies the best kept secret in Phoenix. The District is asthetically pleasing to the eye, and gastromically pleasing to the pallet. The wait staff is friendly and professional. The food is fresh and phenomenol. We've been there numerous times and every time is the same, a wonderful experience. Their managers are the best in the business and make sure their customers are taken care of but they don't have to worry about it. My husbands steak melted in his mouth. My pork chop was delish. Save room for dessert or you'll be sorry you didn't. If I could give more stars, I would have!!
