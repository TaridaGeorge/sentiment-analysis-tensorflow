Really Really Good!!!! I got a chicken pita, it was so good, I would almost complain over stuffed, but how could I do that... I also got some hummus, oohhh goodness it was up there with some of the best I have ever had, almost maybe takes the place of my fav (shish kabob house).  I will be going back many times from now on, I can't wait to try the souvlaki.
