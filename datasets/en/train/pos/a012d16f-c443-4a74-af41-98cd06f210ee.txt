I've been to the Mesa location twice and visited the Tempe location last night for the first time. I think I like the Mesa restaurant slightly better -- maybe because it's bigger. But we had great service in Tempe (and Sunday happy hour lasts all day). 

Hubby and I shared the asiago chicken pasty and the eggplant parm pasty. Very different from each other. Both exceptional in taste. Haven't had a bad meal here yet. 

Now, if they could just do breakfast with a bacon, egg, cheese, tomato, avocado pasty, where the bacon stays crisp? That would be the ultimate food item.
