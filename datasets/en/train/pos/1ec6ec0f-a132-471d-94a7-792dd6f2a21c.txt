I have an addiction to mocha lattes,  Starbucks is usually my choice for at least consistency.  Most places have too much of an over-roasted taste for my pallet (yes I know how to spell palette)  So I went in here one day because it was next to cycle gear and the mocha here was excellent!  I went in again today and got the same great mocha.  It has the atmosphere of some great coffee houses of my college years.  I'll have to try something else but right now they are on the top of my list for mochas
