Kierland Commons is one of my favorite places to meet up and hang.  Where shopping is a-plenty and the restaurant choices abundant. I have often broused in the bookstore and then wandered to Coldstone for an ice cream and relax in the center plaza.
The mainstreet is enjoyable to stroll at leaisure, enjoyng the misters in the heat of the summer.
Kierland Commons is a fine collection of boutiques, shopping and restaurants - well designed and planned.
