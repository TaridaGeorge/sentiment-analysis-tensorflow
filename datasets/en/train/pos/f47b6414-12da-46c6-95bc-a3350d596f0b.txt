Short and easy review. Place is clean, service is friendly, environment is relaxed and cool. They have a decent build your own salad bar. Fountian machine for soda.  Short wait times for pizza/wings. I order their hot wing pizza, and have heard their white pizza is amazing. Boom. On my way right now to meet my family here for lunch.
