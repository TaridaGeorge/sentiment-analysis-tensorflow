Spacious place which is very accomodating to people working alone or in the group.  I feel comfortable coming alone and just reading paper.

Love the Choose 2. Such great deal and choices.  Plus, you can even customize what they have on the menu.  I am always trying to watch my weight so it is awesome that I can fill up on a turkey sandwich and greek salad for such little calories, high protein and low cost. Plus, its way better tasting than fast food!!   What is not there to love!!

Thank you for taking over the old Fuddruckers. You are becoming my 2nd home. :)
