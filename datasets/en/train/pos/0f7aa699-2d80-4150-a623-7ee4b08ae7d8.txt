Outstanding. We showed up at 11:30am & the place was empty. By the time we left nearly every seat was filled.

We had the Chicken Sandwich and the Rice Plate with Pork. The sandwich was so big that I took half home & the Rice Plate was so big that my friend who'd ordered it, a husky guy, couldn't finish his either. Both dishes had beautiful presentation. I also had the Vietnamese Iced Coffee and it was yummy. Will definitely go again.
