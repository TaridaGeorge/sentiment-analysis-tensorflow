There are so many good options for coffee now in downtown but for me, Cartel is the best of the best. They have a good selection of brews(particularly some really interesting choices from Costa Rica and Nicaragua)and an awesome breakfast and lunch menu. And the atmosphere is really cool. What also stands out to me is the service. I always get my Americano served up by a big smile and a "How's your day going?" Definitely no coffee snob attitude here and I love it.
