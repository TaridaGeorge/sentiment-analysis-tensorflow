Num num num its Bacon. Great breakfast. I had the waffle with Bacon and sausage. I saw this place on DDD and had to make the trip.  It was really busy and they do not have a lot of seating so be prepared to wait 15 - 20 mins on the weekend.  It doesn't sound like much but I went there early and hungry.

A must for Breakfast when you are in the area.
