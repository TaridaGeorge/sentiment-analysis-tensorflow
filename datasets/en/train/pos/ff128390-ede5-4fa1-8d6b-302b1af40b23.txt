Me and the manfriend came to Scottsdale to visit a friend.  We all came here for Sunday brunch.  Long story short: LOVED IT.   

The casual chic decor was lovely, causal chic with a sophisticated and nautical flair. The drinks were tasty (and strong), after 1 mimosa I was gooooood. And the food: WOW, let's just say I wish The Herb Box would open up out here in Los Angeles!  I ordered the crispy falafel balls as an appetizer and the urban market salad as my entree.  Both were delicious.

Not sure when I'll be going back to Scottsdale, but eating here will be on my to-do list.
