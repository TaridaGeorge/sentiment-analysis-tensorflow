Wow.

We have enjoyed this place when it was mobile, mainly at the Scottsdale Farmer's Mkt. But it appears that when the wheels fell off the truck, rather than calling triple AAA, they simply set up shop with some bricks and a lil' mortar.

The nutella-banana crepe was as good as I remember, but the star was the breakfast burrito!

This burrito is now the benchmark as to which all breakfast burritos will be compared.

The crepe takes the place of the ol' flour tortilla, and boy, what an upgrade! The crepe was super delicious on its own, but then when you add fluffy eggums and mexican cheese and whatnot, man, I wanted to order a second one... 

Also, the latte's were delightful!

We are sure to be back :)
