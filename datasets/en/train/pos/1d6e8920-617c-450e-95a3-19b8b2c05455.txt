I love the Good Egg.  Every time we come here, no matter what day of the week, they always take care of you.  My boyfriend and I visited most recently last Friday before Christmas and we were in and out in an hour.  They have prompt waiter service and are on the same level of service as First Watch.  Pick this place over The Breakfast Joynt any day!  They're famous for their cinnamon rolls which are the size of a plate (literally) but I haven't had a bad dish from this place.
