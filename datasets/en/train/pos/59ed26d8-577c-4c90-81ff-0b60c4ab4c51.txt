This is by far my favorite Thai restaurant anywhere!   The food is incredible as is the atmosphere!  The service is also top notch!  I highly recommend their Pad Thai and Tropical Pineapple, but everything I've tried from here has been very memorable!  The portions are large too, which is good since you won't want to put your fork down!  Just beware, once you try Malee's you will start to crave it ALL the time - it's that yummy.  Woohoo! As good as it gets!
