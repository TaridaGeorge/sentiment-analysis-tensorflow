I've stayed here twice in the last few months and have not been disappointed. The rooms are clean and the service is excellent. 

The bellman gave me a card with his name and extension...he offered help with any questions during my stay and concierge was also just as hospitable. 

I sat down by myself for drinks/lunch in the bar and was able to get to know Joanne the bartender. She made me the best mojito I've ever had and she also introduced me to the other staff and GM. When you stay there make sure to get a mojito from her!!! 

They took very good care of me and I plan to stay here every time I stay in Phoenix.
