This is the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix. The food is authentic Thai and delicous. The prices are good and the portions are good sized. The yellow curry is fantastic, as is the whole chicken. My husband and I are consistent customers, we go to celebrate anniversaries and birthdays and have always had good service. l always enjoy the food and will always go back. Too bad not open on Sundays. I highly recommend this restaurant for excellent Thai food.
