Fuckin delicious. I've tried several of their menu items and each time I end up making that "holy Toledo this is awesome face" that foodies are all guilty of. You know, the one where you close your eyes and moan a little? It's embarrassing but toooootally worth it. The Tsoynamis are rad and way better than ice cream. And the staff is super sweet! My only complaint is that it's rather stealthily hidden, or maybe my sense of direction is just lacking. 

That's all I got. Vegans, vegetarians, meat-eaters...everyone should eat here.
