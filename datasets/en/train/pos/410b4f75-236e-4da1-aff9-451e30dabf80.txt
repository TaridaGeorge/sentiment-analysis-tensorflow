My girlfriend took me here for my 24th birthday in September (yes, this review is a little late) and I will have to say that the food was very well prepared and presented. Additionally, the ambiance of the restaurant creates a "at home" feeling. Even beyond the food and the environment was Christopher's excellent customer service. He came and talked with us for about 10 minutes and was extremely friendly...and it wasn't just "oh hey the weather is nice" conversation, it was genuine and unexpected. One factor that I recognize and appreciate more than good food is customer service. This place has everything you can desire in a restaurant.
