I'm an out-of-towner who has been going to Rome's for lunch since 2005.  Everytime I have went there, I've been delighted.

Most of the time, I get 3 slices of pizza.  It's real great New York-style pizza -- nice thin crust, good cheese and sauce, and just the right amount of grease.  

I have found their stuffed shells w/meatballs to be outstanding.  They have great meatballs.  Chicken parmigiana and cheesesteaks were also good.

Service is great.  I have gotten to know the nice Italian lady who runs the counter over the years.  Very nice lady.
