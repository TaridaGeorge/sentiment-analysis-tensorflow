OH WOW!!! THIS IS THE REAL DEAL!

I was able to speak to the owners in my broken Italian-- it was awesome.  
Then he had a SPECIAL gelato made for me... you ready for this?  Pepperoni Gelato--- ha!  He did it as a funny and it was really cute.

Anyhow, next time I am further up north, I am stopping by again! 

DE-LISH!
