I have been to Liberty Market numerous times, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  By far dinner is my choice here.  Wasn't crazy about the breakfast.  Not bad, just didn't "wow" me.  

They have OUTSTANDING pizza.  I am a huge fan of brick oven pizza, and this is right up there.  The Grilled Chicken Pasta is amazing, and the Flat Iron Steak is one of my favorites too.

Save room for dessert, as they have some great stuff to offer.  Word of warning...if you order the ice cream sandwich, share it with a group of 4!  It's not small!
