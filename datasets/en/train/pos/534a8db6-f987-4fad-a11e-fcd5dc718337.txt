What a wonderful place to have Dinner. Our daughter found this place because it had alot of gluten free items. The people who run this place are the nicest and most genuine people you will ever meet. Don't be fooled by the location in a strip mall. The food was absolutely to die for! Talk about Scandinavian home cooking at its best, well here it is. There are some real surprise dishes well worth the wait for them to cook, just like you would at grandmas house! Wow, what a treat this place was, check it out!
