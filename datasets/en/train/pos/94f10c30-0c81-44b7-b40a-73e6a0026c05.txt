My daughter and I stopped there on Saturday and loved it!  This is the place to find very unusual home decorating items (and more..jewelry, garden decor...).  Two of the 3 buildings are open and filled with the most wonderful finds.  I can't wait until the third building is open as it will be filled with more stuff.  You won't be disappointed.  This home decor boutique is  much needed in the vast Phoenix arena of boring, run-of-the-mill, same-same stores. It's about time the shopping started to improve around here!  I think they just opened in Feb of 2011.
