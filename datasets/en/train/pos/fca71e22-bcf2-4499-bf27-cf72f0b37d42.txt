I recently made the change from a PC to a Mac computer. A friend referred me to Sharpie Tech to help make the transition easier.
Sharpie Tech came to my home and sat with me for over 4 hours to give me the technical support that I needed. They where patient, friendly and full of knowledge. Now I have my ipod, iphone, itunes, e-mail accounts and a back up of all my important documents and data are now secure and active. I will continue to use Sharpie Tech for both my personal and business needs.
