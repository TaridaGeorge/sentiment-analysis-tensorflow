The Papa K was excellent and the service was great.

The atmosphere, to me, feels a lot like a stationary version of a food truck. That's not a bad thing; I've had great food from trucks. Just be aware of that I'd you're expecting a fancy bistro-ish ambiance.

The menu is pretty simple: Savory vs. Sweet crepes, coffee/tea drinks, and a few other offerings. There are kids sizesI haven't had the coffee yet, but the iced chai wasn't bad at all.

I've only been here a couple of times, but I have yet to be disappointed and will most definitely be back to try the 'Sweet' side of the menu.
