Fantastic place!  we went tonight for my friends birthday-they were able to seat 15 of us without a problem.  Our waiter, Tim, was fantastic-he split the checks for everyone before we even asked.  They gave the birthday girl two pieces of delicious dessert on the house.  The food was great-we were all surprised by how large the portions were for the price.  Everyone was very polite and accommodating I look forward to going back!
