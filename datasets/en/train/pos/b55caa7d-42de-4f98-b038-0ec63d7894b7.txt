Sapna Cafe is one of those places I would have missed had it not been for the Urban Spoon App on my iPhone. I love to try new places and this place is certainly worth trying. The staff is very friendly and the food is very fresh and tasty. I had one of the daily specials. It was sort of like a breakfast burrito with eggs and other goodies in a tortilla with a side salad made of fresh greens. I also had the Ginger Lemonade and even fresh Strawberries and Creme. I wish them well, I will be back again.
