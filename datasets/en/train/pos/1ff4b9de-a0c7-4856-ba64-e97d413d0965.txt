Finally, an AZ restaurant worthy of NYC praise: high quality and innovative, like my favorite restaurants in Manhattan. We sat at the bar, served by an awesome mixologist/bartender named Brandon, who is a fellow foodie as well. Was blown away by their signature dish: Pastrami topped Pork Belly and told Brandon to tell the Chef/Co-Owner that his Pork Belly was better than the famed Momofuku of NYC. He immediately went to the kitchen to pass the message, and it was much appreciated by Chef Bernie. Drinks made by Brandon were outstanding as well, my fav was their signature drink The Im-Port (Jameson, Port, tobacco and leather bitters, rock sugar rim etc). We also had the Smoked Duck, Short Rib and Lamb Burger - all great dishes. Highly recommended and will be pushing for a No Reservations or Layover episode here soon. GO!
