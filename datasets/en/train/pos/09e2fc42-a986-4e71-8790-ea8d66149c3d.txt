A+++ Customer service. I am always greeted with smiles, and on a hot day a bottle of water. Here this bank is going over the top with genuine friendly customer service, and other banks are now charging you to walk in the door to make transactions. I have a personal banker! Yeah, that is correct! I am not a millionaire by any means, but MidFirst Bank makes me feel like one. Heidi is a wonderful and friendly person. She came to my office to introduce herself and drop off some banking information. Do yourself a favor, and drop that BIG BANK! This is a big bank with hometown values and feel! LOVE LOVE LOVE!
