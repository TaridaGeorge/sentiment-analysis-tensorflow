I love this whole foods.  Yes...it is pricey but such a great shopping experience.  The store is open and offers a variety of healthy options. The best part is the variety of food stations they offer.  Everything from sushi, stir-fry, Mexican, pizza, BBQ, etc. It is a peaceful store and I do not feel stressed when I shop like I would in a Safeway.  Friendly staff, clean environment and great food equals a winning grocery store in my book.
