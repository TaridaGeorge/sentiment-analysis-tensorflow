Had a wonderful dinner here last night with my husband. We sat outside on the patio which was lovely and cozy. Our food was delicious! We tried the escargot, mussels, duck, stuffed roast chicken, chocolate creme brulee and souffle. All were wonderful but the particular standouts were the escargot and the desserts. The owner also came out and talked to all the tables briefly which was nice. The waitstaff were excellent and the French background music completed the setting nicely. Also the prices were amazing! Highly recommend this restaurant....wonderful for cozy date nights or groups...but would recommend booking because the place was full all night.
