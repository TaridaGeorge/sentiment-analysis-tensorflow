Centro is a hidden little gem. Tucked away in corner of Scottsdale and Shea, it is a great place to have a relaxing drink or worldy glass of wine. The food is great and hits the spot and more importantly it is served until 2am. The crowd is a great mix and always warm and friendly. The servers are always genuine and make for a very warm, welcoming experience. I've met the owner, Kasey, a few times and he is always so gracious and shows a consistent interest in making sure that my experience is steller. We need more places like this in Scottsdale. Good food, great service, accomodating hours, and steller energy and atmosphere. Keep it up Centro, you are keeper! I'll be back!
