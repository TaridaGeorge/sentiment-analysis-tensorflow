I would give these guys 100 stars if the option was available. I have been going to see JJ and his team for the past 2 years. I am a business owner and drive for a living. Over 90,000 miles have been put on my truck since going to C & R tire...they handle 100% of the work on my truck and its going strong. I buy all my tires for my truck and trailer here and besides getting the best tires they are the cheapest around. They always get me in when I need to get in and are fast and dependable. I have sent several of my friends and clients there and they were completely satisfatied as well. Check em out, you wont regret it! Great job guys!!
