Commuter sandwich on homemade English muffin? Check. The best bran muffin EVER? Check. Tammie Coe coconut cupcake? Check. Fresh carrot/apple juice? Check. 

Been making the trek over here ever since it opened and have never been disappointed. And every guest we've brought has always asked us to bring them again the next time they're in town. Note: My single friends swear LGO has some of the best eye candy around. I'll have to take their word for it; I haven't noticed. ;-)

The valet option has pretty much resolved the parking crisis and there are always new goodies to bring home. Just received an LGO hat as a gift -- even THAT is perfect. I heart LGO.

Next time I swear I'll try the pizza.
