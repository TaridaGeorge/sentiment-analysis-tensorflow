Great service! Quick turnaround time too -- even on a busy Friday. They even matched a better price that I found online. Clean facility. Free bottled water while you wait.

I was already a fan of Discount Tire anyway, because they've fixed my tires (that I didn't buy from them) in the past -- free! A generous policy, to be sure. This particular location of Discount Tire upholds their consistently great customer service.
