I moved to Arizona for College and I haven't found a decent Italian Beef Sandwich ANYWHERE! The Italian Beef from Capistrano's tasted like something straight out of Chicago!! The beef was cut perfectly, it was seasoned, the au jus was perfect, it had hot gardiner, the bread was right...it was amazing! If you're from Chicago and are familiar with and love with Pop's or Rubino's Italian Beef...You'll LOVE Capistrano's
