The BREAKFAST BUZZ!!!!!! OMG!!!!!!!!!  I wish that I could have one of these everyday!  It is a patent-pending protein drink with espresso, chocolate, protein powder, banana, peanut butter, milk, vitamins and I think that is it! My friend introduced this to me and I do not even like coffee, but this drink is F'in Fantastic!  I love the vibe here...everything is fresh here!  I also tried their hummus plate with chicken and it was like the best hummus I had ever had!  It has some fresh veggies with it and a flat bread.  The Berries and Nuts salad is awesome too!!  The inside is cute! They have a drive thru if you are in a huge hurry!
