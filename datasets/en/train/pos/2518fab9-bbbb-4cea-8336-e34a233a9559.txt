This was my first visit to a Culver's restaurant. My first observation was the outside area, it was clean and litter free with ample parking. The inside was also very clean and neat, as was the bathroom.  The owner of the store personally took my order and he was friendly and very professional. I ordered the "Culvers Deluxe" platter, which included fries and a drink. The double meat, double cheese burger came piled high with bacon and fresh veggies. The burger was excellent, hot and plenty of juice. Fries were ok, crispy, could have been more of them. Overall, prices are about average for a burger combo. The food was above average for a fast food joint. The staff was friendly and helpful. I give Culver's a thumbs up and I am sure I will visit them again.
