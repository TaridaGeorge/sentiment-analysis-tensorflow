Pizza here is amazing. Try the funghi. Yum. Also their wine is good. The Slingshot Cab is an exclusive wine and they serve it for $10 a glass. I love their little herb garden out front. Cute. Nice independent restaurant with a funky atmosphere. Used to be a beauty parlor apparently...hence the name.
