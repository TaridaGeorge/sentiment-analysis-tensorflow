So its kind of an understatement that I am a bit of a picky eater. I pretty much don't like anything. My buddy Kris asked me to dinner one night and suggested to come to this place. He said it had good Yelp reviews and was close to his house. I reluctantly agreed, mainly because the last Thai place he took me to was kind of "meh". I'm very happy that I agreed because this place was awesome. So awesome, that I have been back multiple times!! I've been to a few other Thai places around town, many of which are good, but non as good as Yupha's!! I strongly urge you to try this place, I don't think you will regret it!
