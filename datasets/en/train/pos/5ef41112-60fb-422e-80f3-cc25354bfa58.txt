Such a great steakhouse! I could not have been more impressed with the experience. 

It started with a knowledgeable bartender that put together a refreshing gin mixed drink and a solid gin martini (I always recommend Hendricks).  

For dinner, started with the oysters which were very good. For dinner I got the double cut bone in fillet. Talk about an amazing flavor! I really appreciated being able to see an example the cut prior to cooking the meat, very nice touch. 

For dessert, I had the chocolate lava cake, which was delicious. The server was nice enough to give us a free VIP after dinner cocktail. 

I will be going back.
