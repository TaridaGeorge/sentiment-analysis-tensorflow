Yes.. after all my years of drinking haterade in Urban Outfitters I finally found one that is worth my coveted 5 stars.  

This place (like the rest of Scottsdale) is impeccably clean and well organized. The people are super friendly... there was a guy getting denim advice from one of the girls working the fitting rooms.. I have NEVER seen that happen in ANY U.O. I have been to.... more importantly she was giving sound and genuine advice about washes, fit and things to pair it with (or not) that he had in his fitting room. Moreover.... this place had tons of things in my size (which usually never happens since I have broad shoulders). I found a cute dress from kimchee blue for 30 bucks.... Happy Happy Happy.... might have to stop in here again before I bizzounce.
