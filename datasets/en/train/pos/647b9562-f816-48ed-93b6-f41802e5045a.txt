Absolutely love this place.  I've been going here for over a year now and I wont go anywhere else.  Janine is my favorite, she always does an amazing job on my eyebrows.  I use to wax but i've found that threading lasts a lot longer and doesn't irritate my skin.  It is also very inexpensive and if you bring your receipt they give you $2 off on your next visit.
