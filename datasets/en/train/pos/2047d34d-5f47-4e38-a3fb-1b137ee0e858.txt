DUH. THIS PLACE IS THE BEST.
It is so nice not to have to drive to Tempe for my favorite menu. 
The decor is simple and clean, the staff is adorable and sweet.
My favorite items from the menu?
1. No Harm Chicken Parm
2. Tahini Coleslaw
3. Orecciette pasta 
4. The secret bbq chicken sandwich
5. Homemade curry pasta salad
6. Balsamic picnic salad

Leave room for a Tsoynami. Just walk next door to NAMI and wait to be amazed. This place smells like sugar and coffee heaven.
