I love soup, could eat it every day. Rarely do I find a place where I enjoy all the soups available, but Mimis fits the bill. They have enough choices to satisfy my many moods. I usually get a grilled cheese to go along with it. Did I mention I love grilled cheeses too. I know I have ordered other foods here but can not remember what. I do know I have enjoyed it all. We have also been lucky to get an up beat server with each visit. I also love the building, I want one overlooking Lake Tahoe for a house.
