Left on a car trip to northern Arizona in May, and just as we were making our way out of Phoenix, an indicator light came on in the car.  Since we weren't sure where we would be able to stop en route, we turned around, went back one exit, and stopped at this Econo Lube.  They checked the indicator light, turned it off, and explained what may have caused it to go off in the first place.  They wouldn't even accept any money for helping us out, which I offered.  Indicator light never turned back on and we had a great trip. Very professional and helpful staff, and made us believe again that there are some mechanics you can trust. I give them my highest recommendation for service.
