Fish enchiladas or the 5.99 slices and a drink special. 

This was the dilemma I faced today, as Every Wed and Sunday is Mexican day. The Italian and other favorites are still on the menu, but you can also get an array of meat free Mexican dishes.

For 8.99 I had one of the priciest menu items, the fish enchiladas. Three talipa stuffed corn tortillas toped with cheese and green sauce, served with rice and beans. The rice was nicely seasoned and the enchiladas were full of fresh tasting fish.

My friends ordered a whole pie well done, and man it did look good.

This place is mostly veg (except the fish). They are kosher so they are closed on seemingly random days and Saturdays.

Most food is cooked to order and fresh, and fast. Nice staff and both bottled and fountain drinks are available.
