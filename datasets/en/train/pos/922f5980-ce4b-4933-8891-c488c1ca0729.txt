Very nice Ikea store. Pleasantly surprised that the parking lot wasn't a complete nightmare when we went the other day; I always park by the Exit so I don't have to lug my stuff around since you really can't leave this place empty handed.

Much larger food court than my MN Ikea - I like! The store itself is similar to the rest. 

All of my furniture that I've had for 4+ years has survived normal wear & tear as well as 4 moves. Still looks fab.

I've been coming more lately for accessories; super affordable picture frames, candles, plants, etc.

Froyo & furniture shopping; what could be better?
