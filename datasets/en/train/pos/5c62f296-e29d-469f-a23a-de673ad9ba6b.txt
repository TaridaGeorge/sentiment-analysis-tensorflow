For vegetarian fare, these guys are tops in my books.  

I've always wanted to eat vegetarian because I knew it was healthy, but every vegetarian place I've been to (or every vegetarian recipe I've cooked, for that matter) has been very ... un-delicious.  

Green is one of the few places in the valley that I would jump at the chance to eat at with a friend.  I've had their Kung Pao with mock chicken and it rivaled well known Kung Pao with real ACTUAL chicken.  It was quite satisfying

It's decor is neo-hippie-weird -- but don't let that scare you.  It works with this place. 

And don't forget to ask about, save room for, and try a Tsoynami (a frozen ice-cream-blizzard-like treat).
