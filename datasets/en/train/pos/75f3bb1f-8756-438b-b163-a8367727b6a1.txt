Bobby C's is gaining some clients. They were OUT of donuts today around 12:30. Good thing they are open tomorrow. LOL

I forget to take pictures but I had a great Philly here 2x already. It is a large soft hoagie roll loaded with chopped ribeye and onion, red and green pepers and swiss. I top mine with sriracha. Hits the spot!

I have tried to get Yelp to group all the names of this place into one but still have no response. Rainbow Donuts, Ninja Bowl, is actually Bobby C's. 

Also they no longer serve the Broasted chicken, there was not enough demand. :(
