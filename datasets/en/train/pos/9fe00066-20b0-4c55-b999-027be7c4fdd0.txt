My partner and I just moved downtown and The Roosevelt has become our hang-out. I love this place. The staff is so friendly, genuinely friendly. They are also knowledgeable about wine and we have had some amazing bottles. The food is also excellent. My favorite is the grilled cheese and tomato soup. It seems to draw a good mix of people so we don't always feel like the oldest people in the room. Great place to spend an evening.
