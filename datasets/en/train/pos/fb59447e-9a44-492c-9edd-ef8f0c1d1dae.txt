This is absolutely one of my favorite Asian lunch spots during the work week! It's like a Mongolian BBQ except it's CHINESE.

You select your meat (chicken, beef, shrimp, tofu), then your flavor (kung pao, classic, teriyaki), then choose between plain or fried rice or noodles, then you get a pretty wide range of vegetables to pick from, such as broccoli,  carrots, cabbage, mushrooms, snow peas).

It can get really crowded on a good work day, but you'll walk out full and satisfied.  I have been going here regularly and the best part about Mu Shu is the CONSISTENCY in the QUALITY!  $10 or less meal with a drink.
