Was lucky enough to find out that Island Loco was going to be in Gilbert yesterday.  We had the kalua pork plate, chicken Teri plate and the Teri chicken sandwich.  Everything was perfect!  My husband is from Hawaii and really enjoyed the flavors.  Sometimes the kalua can be very salty but not this kalua!  Looking forward to trying the teri beef next time.  The owners are friendly and doing a great job.  Mahalo!
