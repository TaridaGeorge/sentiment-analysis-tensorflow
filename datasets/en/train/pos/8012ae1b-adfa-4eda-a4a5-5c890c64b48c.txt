I have had 3 vintage (late 80's early 90's vintage) pieces repaired by Mtroniks. 
First was an SWR Goliath III with a torn dust cover on a speaker
Second was my SWR bass 350 head for service 
And third was a Ross pc5100 pa head with a channel that didn't work. 
All of my gear was fixed quickly and correctly and repairs were affordable on any musicians budget. None of my repairs cost me more than 80 bucks. Great guys, great service, I would never take anything anywhere else.
