super friendly hosts; very family-oriented; fun for the kids (mine were 5 and 3); free pony rides, hay rides, hay maze, face painting and petting zoo.  less commercialized than some other "farms" we've been too...gives you the feeling of a genuine working farm with family members pitching in to make this festival happen.  loved it.  the patch was indeed small as the previous reviewer noted...but it made the pumpkin picking easier :).  they weren't expensive either which is nice.  you can even buy a tiny pumpkin and they have some flexibility on the price.
