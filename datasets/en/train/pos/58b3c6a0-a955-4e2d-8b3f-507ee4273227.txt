Best wings in the world! With so many amateur places out there, claiming to know wings... this one sets the record straight. I've been going there for years, and have compared countess places' wings with Il Primo. Nothing comes close.

The pizza is also incredible. Not sure how they do both so well, but I'm just thankful they do!
