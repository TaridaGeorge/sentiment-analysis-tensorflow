The prime burger was absolutely amazing! I visited this location on 10/2/2012 with my sister-in-law and parents.  First ever visit ti Fleming's as I live out of state.  

The only (2) two complaints that I have: the prime burger is a whooping 1105 calories (and I'm not even sure if this includes the special sauce and the two onion rings that are served on the side). It's my fault I should've asked the server since the caloric intake is not listed on the menu.  Second issue, how many times do you have to ask a server for straws until you get frustrated. Also, wouldn't you think that an empty glass of water means " please fill up my glass". Come on servers this is a high end establishment. Get it together!!!!! Very frustrating!
