The chicken tikka masala was sooo tasy, and beef vindaloo was damn good as well, the owners were very inviting and helpful they also brought us honey balls after we finished eating which were quite tasty. Oh and did i mention, $3 fat tires all day haha, but seriously a good price on a great beer to wash down those amazing flavors and spices.
