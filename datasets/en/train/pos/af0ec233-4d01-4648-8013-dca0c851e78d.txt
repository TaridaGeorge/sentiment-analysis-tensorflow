I came here after buying a Living Social deal. This is an absolutely amazing salon - definitely on par with the ones from Beverly Hills, CA. I have a ritual of cutting and coloring my hair every 2 months and this is definitely the best I've found in the area. Katie was my stylist and she was amazing. My highlights have lasted me for 2.5 months. Usually I would get touch ups in between but I did not need to in this case. Best of all, they have Keurig machine with delicious pastries while you wait. I will definitely be coming back soon.
