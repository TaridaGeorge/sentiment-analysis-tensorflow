This was our first food truck experience and we loved it! As a healthy conscious family, we try to make good decisions as to what we eat and this one was a no brainer for me! They were delicious and the owner was very kind and personable! We will definitely return. We loved that he had pictures of everything, a lot of the trucks do not, and he even has his "story" published on the side of the truck. I thought it was very inspirational. My daughter is lactose intolerant and he was happy to offer an alternative. Two thumbs up in our books, we enjoyed EVERY drop. I even wanted to lick out the cup!
