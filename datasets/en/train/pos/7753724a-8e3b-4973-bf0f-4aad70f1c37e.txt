The front desk at Hotel Valley Ho recommended this place.  You have to have very specific directions to find it as it's got a parking structure in the way and their signage is the antithesis of itself.  That said, once found, it's a stylish, open, bistro style restaurant/bar with clean and clever design.  It was slow, as we went on a Monday but I'd assume this place gets very busy.  Good, friendly service, an interesting and appealing menu and great tasting food.  Nothing super complicated, but well integrated flavors and not overly priced.  A great value and good fresh ingredients.  We had a blast and were so happy about being referred to it.  I'd recommend to anyone!  I wish we had it in Vegas!
