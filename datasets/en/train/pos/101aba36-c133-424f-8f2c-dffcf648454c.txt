Great overall value.   Food is great and you can get
  good healthy selections, too.  Bar has great ambiance.  Tomato Gin soup, to die for.  Cajun fish sandwich is a favorite!  1/2 rack babyback ribs at happy hour for $6.00!! Other decent selections as well.  Regular menu has something for everyone that won't break your budget and plenty to share if so inclined!  Great place for a nice night out when you don't want to spend your entire paycheck! And I didn't even mention the deserts...heavenly!
