I had a flat this morning, and this shop is close to work...did not even know it! Awesome, friendly staff, quick and expert repair, checked out other loose and squeaky things to ensure bike safety, and an assortment of stocking stuffers and Santa-caliber stuff, too, in case your cycling pals need some Ho Ho Ho. Thank you! I will be back. Hopefully next time for fun and not a repair!
