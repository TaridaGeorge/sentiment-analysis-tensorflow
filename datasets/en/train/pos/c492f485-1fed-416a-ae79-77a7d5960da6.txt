Great mall. Big, but not to the point where you get lost easily. It has all the stores I personally prefer,  - Hollister, Abercrombie & Fitch, Victoria's Secret, Nordstrom, etc. So basically, your average mall located in a nice part of a metropolitan American city. 

But the reason I love this one and give it a 5, is the fact that the food offered in this mall is awesome. It has two of my all time favorites: Cheesecake Factory, and Hot Dog on a Stick. Yup, when I was looking at the mall directory and saw the two, I was like yup. I like this place.
