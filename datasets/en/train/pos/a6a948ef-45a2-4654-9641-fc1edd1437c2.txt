how could i have not yet reviewed the TT?

This was the first official AZ bar I went to (legally as a 21 year old, that is to say).

It was december, so they had the fire oven going, the window open, and they were playing punk rock on the juke box and skate videos on the television.. i was pretty much in love.

this place is tiny! about five booths big enough for four, a two-sided bar with another...15 seats... and small room with a pool table squeezed in. i haven't been in awhile - i fell out of a lot of phx tiny spots cause they just get too smoky - but it would get hopping every friday and saturday night - like you're rubbing shoulders it's so crammed.

they also have darts, and i kind of think it's real darts, not the silly plastic ones.
