This is a great place, one of my favorites, to grab a drink and relax. you don't even need to go with people because you are often guaranteed to run into somebody you know! The drinks are poured with a giving hand and the food is pretty damn good. Often times the specials that are offered are amazing!

Casey's is a great place to hang with friends or sit and relax on a weekend afternoon.
