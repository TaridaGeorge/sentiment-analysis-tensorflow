I have a 2002 Volvo S60 that had an oil leak. I brought it in to have them diagnose the issue and they looked over the entire car from top to bottom with the most accurate and honest assessment of the car. The staff there is very friendly and understanding of your situation. The price to get the assessment was very fair. He explained all of the issues in full detail with a most to least urgent list. He also mentioned the mechanics of each piece what the fault of one item does to the rest of the system.

There are a lot of auto shops out there and it's hard to pick one that you think will be honest and fair. I will undoubtedly go here any time my Volvo needs work.
