the guys @ this location could not be more amazing!!  my daughter had a flat and needed to get to a performance and the guys at Metro opened the door shortly after they were supposed to close and put tires on the car for us immediately.  they gave us information regarding the safety of the type of wheels on her vehicle and made an extremely stressful situation sooo much easier.  I would absolutely recommend to any of you in the Phoenix Metro area that you choose this discount tire when in need : )

these guys really went above and beyond for my daughter and I, personable, friendly and helpful even at closing time on a Saturday!
