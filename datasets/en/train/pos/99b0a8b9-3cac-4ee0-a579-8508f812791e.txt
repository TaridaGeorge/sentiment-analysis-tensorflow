Remember that book Corduroy where little Corduroy got to explore the WHOLE department store all by himself at night, in search of his button?  That's what I want to do here.  Except, instead of searching for my button, I'd be searching for happiness.  And I'm pretty sure I'd find it.  

Changing Hands is my new happy place.  It has a huge selection of new and used books, lots of sale tables, yummy smell-goods, paper goodies, even a small table of kitchen goodies.  I left with three books and an owl-shaped bag clip that hoots when you open it!  It HOOTS!  Ah!  Love, love, love this place.  Definitely check it out for unique gifts, books, or if you just need a smile.
