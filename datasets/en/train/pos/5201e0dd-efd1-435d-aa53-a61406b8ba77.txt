I had not been to a Ruby Tuesday's in quite a few years. They keep putting out coupons so finally we went.                                                           We went to the one in Tempe Market place, which is very nice.                  They decorated very high end i must say. The menu was impressive! I got Salmon and my date got Broccoli and chicken pasta. Both Items were great!   Everything was very fresh.                                                             I was drinking green tea and she refilled it for me several times.                 We can never seem to leave a restaurant even after we are through eating. So they were very good about that and we really enjoyed the meal and the ambiance of the place.  The location is great. Lots of parking and you can walk around in the marketplace with lots to look at afterward.
