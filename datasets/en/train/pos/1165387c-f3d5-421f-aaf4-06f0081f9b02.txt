OMG what a cupcake!  It was a really great, fun and entertaining place to go.  The staff were super friendly and very very nice.  I know you're thinking, "it's just a freakin cupcake"...Not so...These cakes are amazing!  The flavors are not too over the top and the frosting is not too sweet.  I had the Belgian Chocolate and OHHHHHHHHH it was better than.....my sister had the strawberry cupcake and she couldn't get her face out of the wrapper.  My son had the chocolate, hazelnut and was moaning...a little disturbing, but I completely understood.  it's a bit of a drive for me, but I'll definately be back!
