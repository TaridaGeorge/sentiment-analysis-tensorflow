I love this Frys..when I lived closer, it was one of the two that I shopped at.  This place has it all...electronics, food, pharmacy, and a Bank of America!  This particular store is georgous!  Very clean, well lit, I love the layout and its a pleasure to shop in.

I like it here because its not overdone...the meat and produce section does well for me, becuase its clean and inspires me to cook better food and cook stuff more often.  I love it!
