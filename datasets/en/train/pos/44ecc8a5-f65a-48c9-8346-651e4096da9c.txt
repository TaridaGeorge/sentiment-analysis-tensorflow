The buffet is amazing and the people are so nice!!!  Don't let one person's opinion of vomit throw you off.  It's just plain rude and distasteful.  My friends and I have been coming here for years and love it!  I finally have some week days off and get to come back.  Now I don't have to take a sick day to come eat at their buffet.  =)
