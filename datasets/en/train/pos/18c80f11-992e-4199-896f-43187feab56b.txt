I took my Goldendoodle puppy, McGillicuddy, to Petsmart for a trim and they nipped her schnoz. Unwilling to take her there again I searched Yelp for groomers and came across Hug n Pups, who had received stellar reviews.  I soon found out they were worthy of all the praise.

McGillicuddy and I were warmly welcomed and Stan explained the grooming needs of a Goldendoodle puppy. I picked her up a few hours later and was thrilled with the result. She was as soft and cuddly as a teddy bear and smelled terrific too. The staff is always friendly and helpful. I will definitely continue taking her there.
