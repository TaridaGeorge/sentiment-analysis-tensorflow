Though the restaurant has changed menus, I still find the eclectic combination of "world cuisine" to be steange enpugh to make me feel like Im eating at a fancy place, but safe enough that I can order just about anything knowing it will be good.  This is the place I take my wife when we need to have a special moment. The atmosphere is wonderful, the wait staff is friendly, and the open kitchen inspires confidence.  5 stars, I love this place.
