We had a big party here sunday night. 18 or so of us. The owners were really nice and only charged us for the big room even though we used the hall. She also helped us find songs (none of us read chinese derp) and hooked up the ps3 heh. The service was great but we weren't fans of the more limited english and japanese song selection.
