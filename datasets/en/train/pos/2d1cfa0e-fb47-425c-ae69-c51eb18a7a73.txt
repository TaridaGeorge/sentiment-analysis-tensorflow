Cute little place with both outdoor  (with misters) and indoor seating.  Excellent teriyaki and salad.  Very attentive owner and staff.  Large portions and great prices $5.49 & we could easily have split one.  Next time, we will, and we'll try some of the super inexpensive appetizers...pot stickers, egg rolls.  A fresh healthy meal.
