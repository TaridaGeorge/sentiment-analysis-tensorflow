Ok.... this place is just excellent. The food is great, the service is outstanding and they really set the bar pretty high for others. Although it's pricey, you get what you pay for and I feel that the return on investment was worth it. My boyfriend is more of a "Jack In The Box" kind of guy, so you can imagine my surprise when he raved about our experience there. I've yet to attend one of their many events, but plan to in the near future. Get on their mailing list!
