I've been here 4-5 times for lunch, happy hour and dinner...love it.  The team is great/cheerful, the food is interesting and the prices are right.  Happy hour is livelier than I would guess for a new restaurant and Dad's Grocery Bag and Tuna Poke are delicious.  They have some different beers that I don't see too often and the wines on tap are interesting.  They did a great job on the decor and can't wait til it warms up to sit outside.  Until then, I like the over-sized bar and the community table.
