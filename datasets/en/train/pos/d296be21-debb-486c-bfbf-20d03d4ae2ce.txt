Great atmosphere, great eating, great service.  I got the fillet and it was excellent, lots of butter used to make sure of that.

Oddly, my friend also ordered the fillet and 15 minutes later mine came out, and a minute after that my friend got the manager instead of the fillet.  The manager explained that they ran out of fillets (they had also been out of chicken but we knew that pre-ordering).  They apologize, took a wine off the check, and blasted a prime rib out after about 3 minutes wait (sorry person who had that snagged from the heat lamps).  Nice service save.
