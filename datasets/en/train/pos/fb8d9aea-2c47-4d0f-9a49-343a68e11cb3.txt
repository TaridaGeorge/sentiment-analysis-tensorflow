What can I add that has not already been said? Monday and Tuesday $20 bottle and plank of bruchetta, Wednesday word of the day for $5 glasses and Saturday, Sunday divine brunch.

The setting is awesome allowing you to dine in or outside,  and with 9 months of gorgeous weather you can't go wrong. Anything on the menu is excellent and the servers are really cool and helpful with suggestions. 

Only drawback is that the parking sucks, pay the "free" valet or get a 16 dollar ticket. Yes I speak from experience.
