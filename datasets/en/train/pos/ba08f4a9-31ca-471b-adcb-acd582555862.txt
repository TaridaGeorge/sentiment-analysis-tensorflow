Spinatos is awesome. I don't know this place slipped under my radar for so long. It's been here since the 80's. Went here for lunch 2 weeks ago and plan on making it a weekly habit since.

I went with 2 coworkers last time and we split a Chicago pizza, excellent, and less than $7 each with tip... Previous time to that was a spinach topped mini pie that hooked me. 

So hungry now and it's almost lunch time, maybe we should make it a 2 times per week minimum stop.
