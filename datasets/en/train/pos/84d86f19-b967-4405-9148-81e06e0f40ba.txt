This place is... different.

I can't say enough about those bathrooms, they're pretty cool. If you go there, you have to check out the bathrooms.

There were doughnuts on the bar one night when we went. That was awesome. We had the same bartender both times we've gone. She was really great, we loved her. I wish I remembered her name....

The place is cool, there are couches to sit on which are super comf. The stadium seating by the dance floor is cool too. This place is all around cool, just maybe not our "type" of crowd. Though they were mostly nice, and way better than your typical scottsdale douchy bar goers. Whatever they were going for when they set this up, I think they got there. It really is a beautiful little bar.
