The antenna went out on my Lexus RX and Lexus wanted to charge me close to $700 to fix it.  What can a single mom do but buy an after market part off eBay and pay AZ Auto Doctor $80 to install it.  It was even more complicated to replace than they thought, a piece of the old cable had broke off inside, but it was still only $80.  I'm on my third Lexus now and get the majority of the work done here.  As good as Lexus but far, far less.
