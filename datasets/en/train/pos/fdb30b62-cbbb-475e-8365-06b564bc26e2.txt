My husband surprised me one day taking me out to Chinese food Whe nwe arrived I was like what the heck is this place. I have lived in Tempe my whole life and never knew about this place..It has 80's decor`e but thats a given for a restaurant that has been there over 22 years who just wants to serve yummy food. Although when I am there I want to redecorate for them so so bad. BUT HANDS DOWN ITS THE BEST CHINESE FOOD AROUND...They are so friendly and attentive to your needs. Everything is good that I have ordered so far. Just writing this review makes me want to go there right now.. IT'S A MUST TRY
