Food, drinks, urban atmosphere, location -- this place has it all.

I have been her about 10 times, never been disappointed. The crowd can go from jammed to dead in a second - except for weekends which seem to stay busy. Their eclectic menu is fun to browse.

Great place to go to start an old town adventure.
