This is a major landmark in downtown Tempe. It is a great place for fast, small hike without having to travel out of town. The view is great for sunrises and there usually aren't too many people that get to the top early. You can get a good view of Tempe from the mountain, too. There are many people who use the mountain for exercise, usually in the evenings after sunset. The path is to the middle viewing area is paved and only gets steep in one small section. From there, concrete steps lead the way to the top. If you're adventurous, you might secretly sneak off the beaten path to other sides of the mountain, but be careful.
