We've recently moved to Phoenix and we've been looking for a fantastic Indian restaurant (and I think we've found it!)

The restaurant is nice, with nice decor. The service was friendly and quick. The waiter was a pro and we loved one to ten spicy-scale for our dishes. I ordered Veggie Korma, he got the Chicken Tikka Masala,  and we shared some Naan and the 'assorted snacks' (Vegetable Pakora, Samosa, Sheesh Kabab, Papadum). Everything was DELICIOUS. Giant food baby. We'll be back for the lunch buffet and we can't wait.
