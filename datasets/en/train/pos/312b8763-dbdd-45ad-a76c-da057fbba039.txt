Second visit to Timo this week. Had to make sure I was not dreaming about the first visit. First of all, last night's weather was perfect for outdoor dining. 86 degrees on the patio and that's where my two guests and I dined. 
We started with drinks and proceeded to enjoy some Tapas. Mussels ($11.00) wings (not your ordinary bar wings) ($6.00)and a luscious Brie soup, so creamy ($8.00).Superb! 

I had the Pancetta Flat Bread. This is the second time having this entre ($11.00), friends split the Prosciutto sandwich with kettle chips. "One of the best sandwiches I've ever had" remarked Michael. And the Pancetta Flat Bread...I'm hooked!

We thought it would be a good idea to split a couple of desserts, chocolate Crème Brûlée ($6.75) and Peach Cobbler ($7.00). Wow.

Liked Bomberos...love the Timo's.
