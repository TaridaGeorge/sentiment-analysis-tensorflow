I like this place.. if you ever want to feel healthy.. just walk inside this.  It feels healthy, it smells healthy and you couldnt eat bad here if you tried.  Well maybe if you drank 50 shakes, but you get the idea.

I like those peanut butter and banana shakes for a meal replacement after a work out and the few times I've been here that's what I got.  And damn they are yummy and refreshing.  

Sometimes a nice shake is more refreshing than a ton of food.  Plus it feels healthy too.. (depending on the shake).

Staff is cool and the place is ridiculously clean.  Plus it's close to work!
