Asian Taco Fusion Goodness... this stuff is down right amazing!

A couple of weeks ago I was doing some grocery shopping at the Gilbert Farmers Market when all of a sudden my nose picked up this amazing aroma of Asian and a hint of Mexican cuisine. I thought my senses where playing a trick on me until I arrived at Sunshine and Spice Food Truck! It was one of those days where my brain just couldn't make up its mind, so I asked one of the ladies what she would recommend for a first timer. She recommended their Asian Pork Tacos... Oh WoW... what an amazing combination of flavors!!!

This food is down right amazing and truthfully, I have no good way of describing it, you will just have to give it a try for yourself. JUST DO IT!

I'm looking forward to seeing them again soon!!!
