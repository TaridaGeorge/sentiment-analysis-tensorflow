I haven't experienced such friendly and good service in such a long time. Our waitress smiled at me and was up beat the whole time (I just don't see that genuine attitude any more) in addition to great service, the breakfast I had was delicious. I had their oatmeal and a side of seasoned fruit. The oatmeal was hearty and I love that my waitress brought me a whole dish of brown sugar (ohhh yee-a). The fruit was sub-par. I got two little pieces of pineapple, and the cantaloupe and honey-due were crunchy. But I'm not too concerned about it, I ate all the fruit and this place is a deli, not a fruit hut. I'm going to come again and branch out to something new - they had a lot of good things on their menu. 

Love this place!
