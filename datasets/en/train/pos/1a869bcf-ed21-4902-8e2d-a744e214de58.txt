Took this recommendation from the guy working the front desk at the hotel.  This place is huge and was filled with every walk of life - really good atmosphere for a fun dinner.

We got the nachos with blackened chicken for an appetizer.  It's big, so bring an appetite or at least 3 people to much on them.  For dinner my girlfriend got the french dip which was great, the au just was really good and the sandwich was a bundle of savory deliciousness.  I got the fish and chips; they weren't out of this world but they got the job done, especially after a few beers.

For drinks, get their Hop Knot and Kilt Lifter.  The Peach was also really good, but your lady might be more into it than you.
