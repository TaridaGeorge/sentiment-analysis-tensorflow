What's not to like about this place?

It's located in a gorgeous intersection - Shops at Pecos Ranch, they have incredible and diverse flavors that are ever-changing. I've been in like 6 times already, and today I had vanilla custard.

The interior is very bright, happy, and they even have a separate party room.

There is free wifi and computer available - what yogurt place does that?.

Staff friendly and courteous, owners are Chandler residents who care about the community. 

No complaints here, I'll be back, ALOT
