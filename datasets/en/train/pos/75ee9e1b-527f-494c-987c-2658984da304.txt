This store has a huge variety of amazing trinkets, jewelry, artwork, and clothes from all corners of the world.  The owner and his staff are very knowledgable about the items they sell and have great stories and pictures to share. The owner does all his own shopping from locals in other countries...a real importer.   Definitely worth it to seek out this store in a courtyard off of Mill Avenue in Tempe.
