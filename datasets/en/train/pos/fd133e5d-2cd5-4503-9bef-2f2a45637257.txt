I'm not a vegan. I've never eaten at a vegan restaurant, nor could I (at least right now) choose to be vegan 100%. Yet if anyone was ever going to convince me to go vegan, it'd be Green.

The sweet potato tator tots were delicious, as was my huge salad filled with fresh greens and figs. 

I'm not a fan of soy (unless it's edamame), so I was happy to hear this place offers alternatives to soy-based fake meats and cheeses. 

The decor is rad.
The place is eco-friendly too. 
The staff is friendly and helpful. 

Yep, this place is pretty damn amazing.
