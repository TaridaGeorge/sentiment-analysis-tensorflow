Awwwe - I call this "the little unknown Chinese food treasure of PHX" So good - cooked fresh, fresh ingredients and awesome staff. Doesn't look like much from the outside and inside is kinda plain and basic but the food is D'lish! I took some friends that didn't like Lo Mien, sweet and sour pork or fried rice - well now they like it! Don't forget to try the very healthy yummy Soup Fried rice :)
