The best fry bread in town.  While I havent had tons of fry bread I have had my fair share and The Fry Bread House was the winner by leaps and bounds.  They make the bread fresh everyday and top it with very delicious green and red chili and beans.  The dessert fry bread comes with butter and melted chocolate that drips off your bread.  I recommend sharing with someone if you have anything to do for the rest of the day.  Also the parking can be tight at peak hours as the spots are limited.
