I know that some chain restaurants can be hit and miss, but this specific Outback always treats us right. 

The Victoria fillet with horseradish is always my favorite, and it always is just the right amount.  And I can't say enough about the hot, fresh, brown bread - in fact, that's what usually makes me want to come in.

Our server was friendly and professional, and we got the Chocolate Thunder for dessert, and YUM! Keven isn't a huge chocolate fan, and I thought he was gonna start fighting me over the desert (not really, he's a super generous sweetie!)
