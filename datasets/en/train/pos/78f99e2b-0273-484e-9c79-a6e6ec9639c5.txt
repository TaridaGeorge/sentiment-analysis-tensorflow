YUM! This place is awesome! I stopped by here Friday night with my girlfriends and LOVED IT! The place was clean, the people behind the counter were very helpful, and they had lots of flavors to choose from (I went with mango for my choice). They also have sugar-free options, so I was impressed. I will absolutely be back.
