I could eat the New York Steamer everyday and be completely happy.  My brother intoduced me to this place, and I have since been taking other people back to try them too.
Long drive from Tucson for a sandwich, but worth the trip.  (Sorry Ma, this is the real reason I am coming home so often....just kidding!)
Steamer is an amazing sandwich......I want one just thinking about it.
