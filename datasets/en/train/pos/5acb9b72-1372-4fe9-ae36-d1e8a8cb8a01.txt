This delightfully charming grocery is proof that Phoenix is more diverse than it appears at the surface.  99 Ranch Market has inspired me to get off my butt and try something new and daring in the kitchen.  Anyone up to try some of Stevey's experimental egg rolls or sushi?

It's not for the faint of heart.  So if seeing chopped-up giant catfish heads and eyeballs or hundreds of huge fish swimming in a tank makes you queasy, 99 Ranch Market may not be for you.  

But if you don't mind feeling like the only non-Asian within 300 yards in hopes of scoring some ingredients (meats, breads, pastries, green tea ice cream, veggies, fresh seafood, rice and noodles) to whip up an incredible feast, by all means run (don't walk) to 99 Ranch Market.
