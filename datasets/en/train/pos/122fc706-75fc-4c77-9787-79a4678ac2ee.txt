I have been moutain biking and road riding for the last 18 years and have dealt with many bike shops over those years and South Mountain Cycles is one of the best in regards to product and customer service!

I just purchased a 2011 Stumpjumper EVO and they had the best price in the valley along with having a smokin deal where you would get a 15% of the purchase on a giftcard.  They even swapped out one of the tires, put carbon bars on which I ordered, and set the bike up to be tubless all without any additional cost.  

Everyone there was super helpful and knowledgeable.  It's pretty rare to find a bike shop that carries a lot of high end bikes and product to also SPECIALIZE in customer service.
