So goooooooood

After Jon S. introduced me to tsoynamis at Green in Scottsdale, a few friends decided to stop by on our way back to Tempe from Bliss. I was surprised to find a cute little cafe next to Green. The guy at the register was super friendly, and helped my friend decide what flavor to get. I decided on the Cookies n Cream but couldn't help to admire all of the baked goods that they had on display. And their drink menu looked delicious also. 

As expected, the tsoynami was amazing and I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area.
