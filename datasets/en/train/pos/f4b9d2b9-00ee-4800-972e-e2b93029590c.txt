Had it twice and I got to say I really like this place.  Very nice, friendly family staff.  Last time I was there they went out of their way to let me in early when they saw me waiting in my car for a take out order.  The food is great.  Beans slow cooked with pork reminded me of the feijoada, a slow cooked black bean dish I used to get in Brazil, fabulous.  I don't know what they do to make that yellow rice, but its texture is amazing, almost like a risotto but I have no clue what they do to get it that way, very yummy and flavorful.  The meats are great and well spiced and each dosh comes with a small side salad and cucumbers.  Yummy, a real treat for me when I am out that way, very satisfying and excellent.
