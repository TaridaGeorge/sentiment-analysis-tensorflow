It doesn't always have to be fancy schmancy to satisfy my hunger.  I much prefer Sweet Tomatoes to other salad bar joints because their ingredients are fast superior. They have several types of greens and the toppings can include fresh beets, butternut squash, garbanzo beans, and more! They always have multiple soups with at least one vegetarian option and different pastas, pizzas and muffins.  I also like their themes (strawberry, lemon, orange, etc.)...keeps things interesting. They have sodas, flavored teas, juices, milk and water and a soft serve machine with various toppings for dessert. Bring your student i.d. for a little discount, too!
