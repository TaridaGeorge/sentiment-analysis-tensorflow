I noticed I needed to update this review.  The Hungry Monk is by far the best place to have craft beers and great service in Chandler.  Jim does an outstanding job with his craft beef selection and there is always something new on tap. I was just in for lunch yeseterday and visited twice on Monday. (Hot Scotchy-wow!)  I cannot say enough good things about the beer and service at this very wonderful neighbourhood pub.
