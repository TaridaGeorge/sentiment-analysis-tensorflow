Wife and I have been on three different lake boat cruise! The Desert Belle in Saguaro Lake is the best one so far!!! Some times we just need to get away, and enjoy! This is a 90 min cruise, and has some of the most beautiful scenery around! Learned a lot on this cruise, about the history and about the volcanic rocks near by. Boat holds about 147 people, 47 inside! Has a snack bar, not food!! But you can purchase food at the restaurant and bring on board!!! Snack bar is more of a bar!! lol. Has a lot of booze, with snacks. Does have water and soda! This something I am really thinking about coming back for a dinner cruise?  Over all we had a great time!
