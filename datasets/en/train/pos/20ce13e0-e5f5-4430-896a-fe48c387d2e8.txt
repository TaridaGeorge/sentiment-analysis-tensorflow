Locally owned by great people! Yummy lattes, and live music and game night! What more could you want?!
This place really goes out of their way to offer more than the standard coffee experience.  When the owner found out it was our first time there, she went out of her way to tell us all about their nightly events, give us an extra punch on our first card, and make sure we knew about their specialty drinks.
Considering they're in the same parking lot with a Starbucks, you know they have to be offering something special to stay in business.
