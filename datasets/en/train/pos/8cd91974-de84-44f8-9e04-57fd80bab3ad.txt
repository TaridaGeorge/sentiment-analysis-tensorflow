Absolutely delicious!!! Read the reviews and knew I had to make a visit. The place was small, had plenty of parking, and had a  few jewelry vendors outside. Service was friendly and pretty quick with our orders. The ultimate taco with green chili sauce was sooo good. The bread was tasty- fried perfectly and was such a large portion. Try the ground beef taco as well, if you're not into saucy. The hominy stew was good- simple but flavorful. Sodas come with free refills. (wish I noticed the sign before ordering a 'Large') Their large is HUGE and comparable to a 2 person family sized portion? Lol I don't know how to describe it but large was definitely an understatement. 

The food here definitely hit the spot and the next time I'm in Phoenix, I will HAVE to stop by!
