Look I've seen this place compared to Venezia's and I have to disagree, Jimmy and Joes wins!  The amount of food you get for the price is spectacular.  They have their own hot sauce which is greatly superior to other Hot Sauce's.  The staff is friendly, and the food comes out quickly.  The pizza itself is delicious, great sauce and dough, and the toppings are wonderful.  Im glad they finally made a location closer to Tempe!  We used to drive quite a ways to the Chandler location.
