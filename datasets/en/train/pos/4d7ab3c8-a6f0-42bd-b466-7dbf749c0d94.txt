I actually REALLY love this place. It's hard to find a decent burger out here! The menu is small, but to me that's usually a good sign that they 'perfect' their craft. I love the toasted bun on the burgers. I ordered the Mushroom and Swiss char burger and it was super juicy and made-to-order. The french fries were delicious and not soggy or salty, but I would pass on the sweet potato fries next time. Didn't have much flavor and tasted like cardboard to me. My boyfriend ordered the strawberry malt shake and I ordered the chocolate malt shake and downed that thing like there's no tomorrow. I

Overall, it was a very unhealthy but delicious dinner! Reminds me of a burger joint in L.A. that I hit up every time I'm out there. Glad to find a place similar right down the street!
