To my homesick Indianz from Arizona, if you want home cooked food (beef, beans, tortillas) this is THE PLACE.  Tri-tip grilled on actual mesquite, tortillas that taste as close to homemade as possible, and they will actually grill jalapenos for you.  And the beans, oh the beans, just like Moms.  Eat here, you will be happy.
