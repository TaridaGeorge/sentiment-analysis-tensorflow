My wife and I have tried most, if not every, vietnamese/pho joint in the area and always find ourselves coming back to this place.  The broth in their pho has a fantastic depth of flavor (no MSG).  Very inexpensive for the quality and quantity you recieve.  I also highly recommend the salted lemonade with sprite or soda water.  The service is fairly prompt and polite.  It's never very busy.
