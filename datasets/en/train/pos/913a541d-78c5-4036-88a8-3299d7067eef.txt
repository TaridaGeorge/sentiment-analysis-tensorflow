My boyfriend is a student at ASU and every time I come to visit, we ALWAYS have to come to culinary dropout. The cheese pretzel fondue is to die for, you have to order it as an appetizer! 

Everything that I've tried is amazing. Fried chicken is always a favorite. Last time I tried the butternut squash cannelloni... It was so fresh and flavorful. One of my favorite dishes now. 

You have to go!!!
