Made my first trip to Sweet Republic tonight.... Shared the butter toffee sundae with my lovely bride. It was the perfect size for two people to snack on. 

The young lady behind the counter welcomed us into the shop warmly... And explained everything about the process.... How everything is handmade. This told us as soon as we walked in that this was a special place. 

She also told us that Alton Brown from the Food TV channel will be back this month...always a fun thing. 

I can't wait to go back!!!
