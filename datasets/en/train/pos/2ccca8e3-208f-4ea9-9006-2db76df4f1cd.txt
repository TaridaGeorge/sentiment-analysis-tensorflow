I recently moved to this side of town and noticed this yogurt place out of the corner of my eye and  figured I would keep it in mind next time I needed a cold sweet treat.   Yesterday seemed like the perfect time for a stop at Yogurtology!  DELISH!!! I love yogurt, and must say this is the BEST I have had in town! The yogurt is so good you don't even need to add toppings. I mean seriously the oatmeal cookie flavor and Butterfinger are decadent deliciousness!!!
