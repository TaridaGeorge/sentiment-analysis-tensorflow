Pretty much agree with all the other reviewers. Great indie bookstore, warm atmosphere, great collection of books and wonderful display. I was actually headed for the Trader Joe's next door, but spent a whole hour browsing here! The option of trading your gently used books for store credit is uber cool. The other day when I went there, there was sale of books for $2!! The books were all in great condition and there were some well known authors in that section. There's a whole section for kids, a small reading area, and a cafe. Apart from the books, the store stocks a bunch of cool items like Christmas tree decorations, wind chimes, keychains, bags, creative stationery, mugs, badges, gift items.  I picked up some Japanese incense sticks and an incense stick holder.
