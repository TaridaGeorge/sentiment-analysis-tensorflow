I typically don't Yelp about fast food restaurants, but this one really deserves the five star rating! I come here during my lunch break at least once a week, and the service is always super speedy. Whether there's a line of one or seven, they always seem to prepare the food and keep the line moving quickly. 

As far as the quality of the food goes, it's just like any other Subway. I do a 6" tuna on wheat, and it's always made exactly how I like it! It's MUCH faster than others locations I've visited. I will definitely continue to eat at this location :)
