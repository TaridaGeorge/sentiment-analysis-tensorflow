Pane Bianco holds a special place in my food-heart. Maybe because I only ever eat here with the special-est of people, but I always feel transported when I walk through the doors to dine in. I absolutely love all the food, I adore the giant green olives that come with my sandwich, the bread as always is fantastic, and the staff is excellent. I don't go often because I would WANT to go every day & then I would be a huge fatty...so I save the beauty and delicious simplicity that is Pane for special days.
