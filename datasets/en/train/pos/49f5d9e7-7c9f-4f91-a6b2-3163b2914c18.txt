I had dinner here with my mom, who spent most of her life in Taiwan, and my brother, who lives in San Francisco (where good Chinese food is abundant). 

We ordered Water Boiled Fish, Tong Qing Spicy Chicken, Xiao Long Bao and Stir-fried Green Beans. We thoroughly enjoyed every dish, but especially loved the Tong Qing Spicy Chicken. Sichuan cuisine is known for its numbing pepper corns and spicy chili oil, both of which were prominent in the spicy chicken dish. 

Authentic Chinese restaurants aren't really known for their ambiance and service, so if you're looking for a nice night out, you might want to go somewhere else. If you're looking for good authentic Sichuan food, this is your place!
