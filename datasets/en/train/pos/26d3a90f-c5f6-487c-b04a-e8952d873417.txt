Libraries are a wonderful thing, now if folks would just learn how to pronounce the word library. ;-{)

This library has such a good variety of books, recorded too. The video library is fairly good too. I also love the option of ordering a book to be ready for you when you arrive. The folks working there are consistently helpful.

The building it self normally would not catch my eye as I am not particularly drawn to the modern aesthetic. Yet I find myself looking at the corners of the interior and its structure it is actually pretty cool.

The parking too is quite easy.

We are lucky to have such a place where cheap folk such as I can get a good book to read.
