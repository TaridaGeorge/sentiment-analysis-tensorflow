Took the family here for a morning meal on our vacation. Yelped it first and found the reviews to be spot on. Good solid breakfast food. Great for the kids. The protein pancakes were AMAZING! Loved it! What stood out more than the good food was the sparkling service. The manager/owner and his staff were amazing! I can't say enough about them. This is a good place to patronize, they are doing everything right. Next time I'm in Phoenix I'm definately coming to US Eggs!
