Friday march 4th
An amuse bouche, appetizer,  salad, entree, and dessert and sweet for UNDER  $30? And well prepared AND well cooked and presented? Nahhh! Not possible right? Wrong! This place is fantabulous!
The food is prepared and served by culinary students, and the tips actually go into a scholarship fund.
The menu rotates throughout the semester, and the students are (mostly) allowed to execute recipes with their own interpretations. It's sometimes shockingly good. For example, this evening one of the sweets was a lavender cookie. Don't knock it 'til ya try it! 
It can be hard to get a reservation, so check the menu on line  and try to get in!
