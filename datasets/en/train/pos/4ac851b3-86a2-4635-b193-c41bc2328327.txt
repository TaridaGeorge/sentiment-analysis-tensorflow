I'm the type of person who feels it's romantic, calming, and enjoyable to walk through gardens, conservatories, and parks.  Desert Botanical Garden is a sprawling estate of really cool desert flora.  There were 3 different weddings going on the day we visited, and I have to say they picked a good day.  One of the really cool things was the Chiuly glass at the front entrance.  I wished I had been here when his collection was here!  I believe they are trying to raise money to make the other temporary sculptures a part of their permanent collection.  I'd love to go back someday.
