Well they got the name right with this place because it is DEEEELISH!

I've been here twice (it would probably be closer to 50 times, but I live in Tucson)... the first time I got the az burro,  the second time a croissant sandwich.  Both these things I feel like I've had a hundred times before... but somehow D'lish makes them taste 100x better!  Don't know what their secret is, but I'm lovin it!
