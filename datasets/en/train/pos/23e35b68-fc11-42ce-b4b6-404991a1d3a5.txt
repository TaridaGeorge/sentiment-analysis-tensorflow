Holy AWESOME! We had the pretzel fondue appetizer which was KILLER! I had the fish & chips and that was great to! They serve local micro brew beer from Sun Up  Brewery (I had the Light Rail Ale, of which, I was not a fan of).

The interior is beautiful and has a very open feel (high ceilings). There's really no way to describe it, but it appears that this place has a few themes that all work together just fine.

They have outdoor sidewalk dinning!

Now for the bad side ... it aint cheap. My girl and I had an app, two entr√©es and one drink each and our bill was $80. 

This place has the best location in CityScape and I have little doubt that this new Fox creation will THRIVE here. Yea!!!
