The food and service were outstanding. The omelettes and skillet dishes were the best that we ever experienced. The pricing is good. There were lots of people. There was a 20 minute wait in a breakfast line. Obviously, other people have the same opinion about U.S. Egg, otherwise why would so many people wait in a breakfast line. We will gladly wait in that line again to repeat our good experience with that restaurant.
