Woohoo!  Totally awesome!  I'm a huge gelato fan, as I am with most sweets and this place is wonderful for the taste buds.  I went here two years ago when I came to visit and specifically requested that we make a return trip.  I wasn't disappointed.  The price for gelato here is not cheap, but I've come to expect that at all gelato spots.  I had the chocolate caramel brownie and the vanilla bean gelatos.  They were fabulous and so deliciously rich and creamy.  So much better than regular ice cream.  It makes me sad that we don't have one in my town.  However, we've got the North End close by, but I still think the Gelato Spot is better!
