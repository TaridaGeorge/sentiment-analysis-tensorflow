This is one of my favorite 'celebration night out' places.  The owners are wonderfully nice and friendly.  The service was great - excellent timing on filling water, clearing table - it was all seamless. 

Now the food!  Home made pasta, fresh and original. Everything was tempting but I can never resist the specialty of the day - seafood linguini, mushroom sauce, or any other meats - gently cooked!  Perfect! 
With a bottle of wine, meal and dessert - it can get pricey but it's well worth it! 

They do offer Valentine 'take out baskets' which are reasonably priced (considering) and sound wonderful -i must admit, i have never tried them though.
