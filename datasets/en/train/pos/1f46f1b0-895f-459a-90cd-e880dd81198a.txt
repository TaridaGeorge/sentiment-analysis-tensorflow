My holiday gift to all. RigaTony's is the best.

Great food fast, friendly service, reasonable prices.

For the first time I had lunch at RigaTony's. I decided to have the lunch special. This is an awesome deal. Bread, salad and entree for $6.99. How can you do that? A fountain beverage was $1.00 more. This meal was as perfect as they come. The bread is served warm with a plate for dipping oil. The crisp house side salad  and the entree was good and the pasta was perfectly cooked. Everything tasted very fresh right down to the marinara sauce. I have to give it to you RigaTony's, you are pretty great and I will be back with my pack. And what I really like best about you is you are independently owned and operated. No chains for me.
