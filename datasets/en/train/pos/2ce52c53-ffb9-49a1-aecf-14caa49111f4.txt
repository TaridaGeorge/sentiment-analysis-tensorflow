I have only eaten 3 things from here - caprese, gnocchi, and cannoli.  

I live in Seattle but make sure to get the Caprese every time I come to Phoenix.  Actually, I crave it when I'm not here.  Their mozerella is so fresh and the mix of tomatoes and spices tops it off perfect.  Their bread is consistently fabulous and I think some of the best in the city.

The gnocchi I've only munched on from another persons plate, but I think it's pretty delicious.  

The cannoli is some of the best I've had since I left the east coast.  I love the bits of chocolate in the creme in the center.

The place is a bit pricey, but since there's not a lot of other quality places like this in the entire city.
