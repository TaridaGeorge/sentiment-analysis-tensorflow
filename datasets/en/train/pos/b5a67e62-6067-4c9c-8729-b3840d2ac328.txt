When we went here, we didn't realize that it was a real working farm. We just thought that was the name of the restaurant. We went for breakfast at the Morning Glory Cafe. It's all outside seating, self-serve coffee in a laid back atmosphere. The food was excellent. I got the breakfast tacos with eggs (although I would have preferred if they had a tofu option.) My husband got the cowboy breakfast and enjoyed it as well. Portions were large and service was fast. It's a very unique dining experience and I recommend it to all, especially tourists like us.
