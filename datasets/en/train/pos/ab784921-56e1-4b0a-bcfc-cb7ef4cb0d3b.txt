Really, as good as bookstores get! Of course you could find books for cheaper at bigger chain bookstores but if you like to support independent businesses, definitely stop by. I almost always find the book I need (new and used) and have always enjoyed myself at their various events. Stop by for lunch or dinner at Wildflower Bread Company right next door and take a look.
