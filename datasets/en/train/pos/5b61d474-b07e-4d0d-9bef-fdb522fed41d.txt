Nice place 
Great Golf .. 
Very relaxing
Food is fantastic
not too far from scottsdale. Ask for a ride to the outlets in Albany its free. But the resort is kind of expensive but all in all its worth it. Althopight many people will not visit this place. I had to put my .$0.02 in it .. i like this place and its cool nuff said
