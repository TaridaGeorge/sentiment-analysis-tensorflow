I LOVE apple...thanks Denise for taking such good care of me today, no wonder I've converted and won't go back.  :) Can't wait for my next genius bar visit...hopefully it's not for my phone again ;)  Oh and this store is so pretty...I loved the architecture and feel of it, the biltmore store can be a little stuffy at times, but you didn't get that feel at the Scottsdale Quarter even though the store was packed.  Thanks Apple!!
