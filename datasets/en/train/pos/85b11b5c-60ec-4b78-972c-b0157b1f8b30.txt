GREAT PLACE TO HANG OUT AND WATCH THE SCENERY
With a little help you can drink & choose from about 25 beers, 8 scothes,10 whiskeys,8 Really good tequila's (just ask me) along with the every day vodka's & some pretty impresive wines (or whines).
Don't miss this little gem in the rough & com listen to music or watch sports or just drink. Oh yea the owners are OK also
