Filet, Sirloin, and Ribeye, oh my!

This was my first Fogo De Chao experience, and it exceeded my expectations!  I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses in the past, but Fogo was fabulous!  Sure, I could've made a meal on the sensational thirty item salad bar on it's own, but I took a breather and then went for the meat.  Green light on!  I also enjoyed the crispy hot polenta and caramelized banana side dishes. Yum!

Rolando was the waiter I had the most contact with and he was remarkable.  Evan, the GM, was friendly as well... this was such a treat to be a part of, and of course, even more fun because I was surrounded by some of my favorite yelpers!

Thanks Fogo folks - once I digest my 2 - 3 lbs of meat, I'll be back to see you again!
