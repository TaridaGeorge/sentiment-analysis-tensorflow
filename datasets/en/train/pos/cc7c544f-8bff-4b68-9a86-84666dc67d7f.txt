SUCH a friendly and delightful little walk-up coffee shop. Good solid coffee along with an arrangement of fun seasonal choices!

What really sealed the deal was how incredibly friendly and approachable the baristas were! I will definitely be going back with the 2 for 1 card they gave me with my purchase. 

When the weather gets a little warmer, I think their outdoor seating will be the perfect study spot!

I'm also excited to try the salon next door!
