Ok, maybe I turning into a full-fledged "Yelper" by writing reviews of every where I get to eat...

I went to this place before the Fiesta Bowl.  Holy Cow!  Did, this place end up with a great location.  It is not the only bar within walking distance of the University of Phoenix Stadium, but it is the definitely the best.  The place is HUGE, with lots of BIG tables for parties of 6 or more.  We had a group of 10 GUYS and we all fit in a booth.

Their specialty is beer - lots of beers on tap, but they were out of several domestics due to the Fiesta Bowl crowd.

Service was good and the food was better than your average bar food.
