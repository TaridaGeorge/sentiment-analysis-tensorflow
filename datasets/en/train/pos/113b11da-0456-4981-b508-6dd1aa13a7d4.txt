This is my favorite place for appetizers and wine. Their bruschetta planks and cheese boards are delicious and they are the perfect size. They have a great selection of wines and I love that you are encouraged to walk around and choose your bottle. 

The staff there are always friendly and helpful during all stages of service. The environment is relaxed and the diners are usually groups for friends out after work. 

I've never had a bad experience here and it's the one place I regularly wish I could visit now that I've moved away from Arizona.
