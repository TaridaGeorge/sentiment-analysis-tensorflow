Pork bowl, chicken bowl, crab puffs. Absolutely delicious! 

Quality ingredients, super fresh and tasty side sauces. Honestly I have never had drive through Japanese this good. The owners are awesome and tonight they are staying open late to accommodate my order.

Fast, friendly and fresh. It doesn't get much better at this price and convenience.
