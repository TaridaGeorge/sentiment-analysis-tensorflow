Second only to her other restaurant, Flo's Asian Kitchen, five miles down the road. I really wish she'd open a location closer to ASU, where I lived. Three of her four locations are all a stone's throw from one another, all in Scottsdale. They're all excellent, and all half an hour from where I live(d). The exception is the airport location, and don't even get me started on that mess...
