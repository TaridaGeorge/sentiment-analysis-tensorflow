Go, go, go!! 

It is such a great movie going experience - I highly recommend! I  love supporting local businesses and this one is fantastic. They feature non-commercial films and offer wines by the glass, cream sodas, and much more for you to enjoy while watching the film. 

It has a hip, indie, chill vibe; the total opposite of Harkins theaters.

I'd go every week if I lived in the neighborhood.
