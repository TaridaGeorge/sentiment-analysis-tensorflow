This was a VERY PLEASANT surprise.  The food was phenomenal and the service was excellent.  I had never been to an all vegetarian restaurant let alone a vegan.  My lunch companion is a vegetarian and she had nothing but praise for this place.  We shared the 'Spicy Cha Cha' and the 'Sweet & Sour Devine'.  One word ... YUMM-O for both.  We left saying that we had to return SOON.
