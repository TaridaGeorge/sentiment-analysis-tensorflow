Not that I am in a position to treat myself to the Spa here at the moment (or ever, really) but as I am sort of from the Phoenix area (I did graduate H.S. there after all) I do know a thing or two about the town. And let me tell you..this is the BEST spa experience I've ever had.  Beautiful setting, totally serene environment..completely professional staff.  Boy do I wish I were there right this very second...
