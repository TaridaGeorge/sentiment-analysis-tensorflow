One of the busiest times of the year for my business (being a pet sitter during Christmas holidays), my car decided the alternator should die.  My husband tried to change out alternator on a Sunday (without correct tools) and the next day is Christmas Eve.  So, on Christmas Eve I called Tobias and they said they would be open until noon.  Called Super Hook towing and they went out right away and had my car to Tobias by 9:30am.  The tech at Tobias had my alternator changed and my car running by 11:30.  (The right tools always help.)  Thank you Tobias!!
