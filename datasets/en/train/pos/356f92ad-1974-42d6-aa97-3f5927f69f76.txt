Authentic food. Large portions. Friendly service.

There is a ton of selection, so you'll likely need to come back to experience what Persian food has to offer! No salt at the table, so if you'll need salt, it will have to be a special request (food is seasoned well though, so you shouldn't need it).

The purple shoots is great as a side on many entrees; really unique, tasty, and the sweet and savory eggplant is cooked well.

The brown and white basmati rice has a lot of flavor, and I love the raisins and almonds mixed in.

Quality ingredients, healthy food, a lot of selection lends this place to be a top choice for authentic Persian and Mediterranean in Phoenix.
