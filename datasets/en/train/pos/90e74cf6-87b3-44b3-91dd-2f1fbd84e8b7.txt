Loved this place!  We sat at the bar for a glass of wine for quite a bit, then ordered our entrees.  The bartender was SUPER friendly, and allowed me to try three wines before I ordered.  He made eye contact and didn't act rushed.  The service was excellent, food even better, and we left a very very very happy couple.  

(Unfortunately we had almost the exact opposite experience at our next stop- the Side Bar).  

Highly recommend the Public House.  Classy, yet casual.  Anything seems to go here.  Sequins and Sweatshirts.  I woke up this morning, yes, wanting my scallops entree AGAIN.  For breakfast. That is kind of gross, but you get the picture.
