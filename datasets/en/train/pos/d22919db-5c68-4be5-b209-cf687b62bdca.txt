My wife and I were in Phoenix for a conference and asked Yelp for help on a good vegetarian restaurant. We were not disappointed with Fresh Mint.

We started with the spring rolls (I think it was the Afghan rolls...can't quite remember) and they were better than average.

We shared two entrees. Pho and the Kung Pao Chicken. The Kung Pao Chicken was astonishing good and just this dish will give this restaurant a 5-star rating in my book. It may be one of the top 5 dishes I've ever had at a restaurant.
