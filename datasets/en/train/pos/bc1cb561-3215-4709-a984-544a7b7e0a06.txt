Anytime one of my friends says the name "Noodles Ranch," I laugh.  I don't know why really.  Something about the name just makes me laugh. 

Anyways, the food here is great.  And cheap! 

Here are my recommendations in no particular order:
the vegetable egg rolls
veggie spring rolls
crispy happy pancake- it makes you happy, I swear
tofu chow mein or pad thai
vietnam basket (this is really big, for like $7 and comes with a bunch of different vegetarian items, such as tofu, broccoli, noodles etc. etc).
and for dessert: you must get the warm banana bread pudding.  it's sooooooo good. 

Simply put, this restaurant has fantastic food at cheap prices.  Check it out!
