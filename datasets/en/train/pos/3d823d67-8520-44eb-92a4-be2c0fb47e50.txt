I've been coming here since as long as I can remember... and I still love it. I lived in Tucson, and would make day trips just to come eat here. 
I'm a little disappointed that they made their bows smaller, kinda seems to me like they were looking to follow the "genghis" way... considering their competition is just down the street. But nonetheless this place holds a little piece of my heart... and I will still continue to come here time after time.
