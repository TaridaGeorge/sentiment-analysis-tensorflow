Delta In Skin is awesome.  I have seen Delta for facials and waxing and Eileen, who is the massage therapist.  The environment is very welcoming, calming, relaxing.  Delta uses state of the art equipment and some of the best skin care products.  Eileen is an amazing massage therapist that I have seen regularly for several years.  I highly recommend this salon.
