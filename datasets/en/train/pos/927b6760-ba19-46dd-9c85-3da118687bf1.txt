I'm hooked!  After a new job brought me to the area, I've been going 2/week or more.  Good if not great teriyaki chicken/beef, all-white chicken and brown rice available, better then average pot-stickers (gyoza), and a very good "fast food" sushi menu.  Spicy teriyaki is available, and I actually found it to be too hot (I _never_ say that!).  I had to cut it with plain teriyaki sauce!  Also, the restaurant is spotless, the staff (after 8+ visits :-) friendly and efficient.

5 stars, as compared to other Japanese 'fast food' places, like Kyoto Bowl for example.
