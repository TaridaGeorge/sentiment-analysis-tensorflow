I may be new to Yelp, but I have been a huge fan of Pita Jungle for years!   I have dined at many locations including Scottsdale, Phoenix and Tempe locations.  

I love the cozy wine bar atmosphere!  My only wish is that there would be a sit down location in Old Town!  

I love the hummus, you can order ask for the humus trio - well worth it.  By far my favorite is the Glazed-Chicken Lavosh Pizza!  I get it with extra chicken!  The best!  I am also a huge fan of the Grilled Vegetable Salad.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu!  

I eat in or pick up Pita Jungle at least once a week!  The portions are great and for dine in they have a great wine selection! 

What can I say Pita you're awesome!
