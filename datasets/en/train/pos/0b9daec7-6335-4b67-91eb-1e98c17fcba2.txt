This is my absolute favorite restaurant in Scottsdale!  The escargot is to die for, as is their duck.  They also have the most delicious martini called a Le Poir--pear Grey Goose, St. Germain, and champagne.  And for dessert, their souffles are spectacular!  I had the Grand Marnier souffle at my last visit, and it was definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had.  In addition to the food, they have a very charming patio.
