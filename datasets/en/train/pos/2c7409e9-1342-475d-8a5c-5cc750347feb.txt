This place really makes me miss living in Phoenix.  Sure, it's not your average upscale Biltmore place, and the atmosphere is definitely relaxed and dive-y, but if that's what you like then the 'Dillo is great.  Drinks are way cheap, bartenders are very friendly and remember you, cheap pool, and I'm sorry, but I absolutely love their fried pickles (they're only $3 after 11!).  What more could a girl ask for?
