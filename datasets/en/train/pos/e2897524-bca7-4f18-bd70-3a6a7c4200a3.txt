I have been here several times now. Every time it has been really good.
For starters it is a great price, then they always do a great job.
They do nails and waxing as well. Which saves you a lot of time.
It is very clean, and the staff is very nice. 
They are always happy and not complaining about their boss or co workers.
They have upgrades but, they don't try to push them on you. Only if you want it. Parking lot is a good size and the bathrooms are clean. 
I never have to wait very long to be helped. Or not at all.
Again did I mention how good the price is?? Awesome!
