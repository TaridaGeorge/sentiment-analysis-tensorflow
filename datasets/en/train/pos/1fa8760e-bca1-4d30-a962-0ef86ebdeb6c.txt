Great place. As one reviewer said this is NOT a meat-market. Smart trainers, great use of space and allow you to get in and get out quick with 30 minute workouts. The trainers here don't rely on machine circuits like many other gyms. At Vitality you are using dumbbells, kettlebells, TRX, barbells, medicine balls and even flipping tires or hitting the heavybag. The owner is incredibly nice, and make sure to ask for Liz if you want a trainer who is high energy and will kick your butt!
