Buckle is 'the' place to shop when you are looking for a pair of jeans.  What I value about Buckle is their customer service.  They know their products and I go into a dressing room and they are always right there offering up different styles and sizes until I find a pair that best suited to me. 

My daughter shops there as well and when a pair of jeans she bought there became prematurly worn (9 months after purchase) she brought them back to the store to see if they would stand behind their product and they did!  She came home with a new pair.  

I endorse Buckle!
