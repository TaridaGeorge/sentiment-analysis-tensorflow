Checked out 5th and Wine last night (or as some prefer cinco y vino), it was great!  Happy hour til 6 p.m. = $5 glasses of wine. I recommend the Lucky Start Pinot Noir.  The bruschetta was amazing, we had 4 different kinds (Hummus, Salmon, Brie/Apples and Tomato Mozzarella Balsamic)....all delicious! Instead of dessert we went for the garlic fries!!! Everything was great!!
