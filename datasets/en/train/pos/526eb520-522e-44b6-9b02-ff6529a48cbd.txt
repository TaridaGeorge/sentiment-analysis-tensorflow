Rosemary chicken was scrumptious! The  mustard cream sauce was a great complement. One pasty will definitely fill you up. Then share some fries and you're golden! They have a variety of pasties and I want to try more! It is almost like a calzone but better...gourmet hot pocket!

Oven chips, or awesome fries are fantastic with jalapeno. YUMMMM. 

I brought it all to-go, but I'd like to eat in because the ambiance seems chill and pretty rad.
