I've been there twice now, I went yesterday and last Wednesday, and I don't hesitate to say I'm blown away and frankly pleasantly surprised! The service staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is cozy with a hint of a diner feel to it. And the best part? THE FOOD! Ohh the food! It was like nothing I've ever tasted. (And I've tasted plenty. trust me.) My group [4 people] got an order of wings with the house sauce, an order of trio skewers, a house combination sandwich, the chicken curry, and two filet mignon shaken beefs. No complaints the entire meal.. Which is rare if you know my friends. We left fat, happy, and ready for a nap!
