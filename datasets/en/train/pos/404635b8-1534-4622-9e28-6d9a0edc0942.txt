SO glad this place is in my neighborhood.. peppercorn burger, sweet and spicy burger are fab.  The chicken sandwich is also great. The pork..just OK.  Fries and sweet potatoe fritters are bueno, just need a yummy dipping sauce for the fritters.  MUST HAVE THE DONUTS.  Warm little donuts that have a fantastic butterscotch sauce.  Pinot noir choice is top notch, but not happy about a glass costing more than my burger.
