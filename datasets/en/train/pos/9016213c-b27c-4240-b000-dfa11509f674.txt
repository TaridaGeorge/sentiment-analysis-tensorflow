I love sacks and I also love the dirty puns I make when I go. The food is good the cookie they give you with each sandwich is good. I always get the symphony because I love anything that has avocado in it. I wouldn't recommend going at noon since it is PACKED. I also don't recommend the pasta or the pasta salad side. None of them are worth bragging about.
