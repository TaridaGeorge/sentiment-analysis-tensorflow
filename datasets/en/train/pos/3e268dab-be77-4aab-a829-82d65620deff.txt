Sushi and Japanese food heaven. We were in downtown Phoenix area and drove about 20-25 minutes here and it was so worth it.

This is a cozy and very hip place stuck in a strip mall but don't let the location deter you from it's fantastic food. The hamachi covered with jalapeno pieces was so excellent as the hamachi slices just melted in my mouth. All the sushi we had (spicy salmon rolls, rainbow rolls, tuna, salmon) tasted so fresh and every bite was like heaven. (Salivating as I recall my food there.) The only thing there that wasn't so impressive was their special Jidori chicken - that was good, but not too memorable.

Service was extremely nice and helpful.

Bottom line: Sushi heaven in Phoenix area. It's a small place so make sure you have a reservation.
