Excellent Service!  This is one of my go to places to meet friends for happy hour.  I have to say they did not disappoint when I took my cousin for her birthday.  The bartender was great.  She made sure we knew there was less than 30 left for happy hour, then again 5 mins prior, she made sure we had our drinks and food order by 6pm.  Great Atmosphere and great service.  We really appreciate the extra attention.
