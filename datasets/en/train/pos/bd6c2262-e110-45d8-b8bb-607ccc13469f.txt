This place never ceases to amaze. One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. The Sicilian scramble is a favorite--though the smashed meatball was great. We finally went back for dinner the other night and for the first time I had a burger. It should not be surprising that is was fantastic. Atmosphere is great, service is great, and the food is great--just go!
