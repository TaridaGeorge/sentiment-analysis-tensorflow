I stayed here for one night in May 2011. I was getting ready to move across country and we needed a place to stay the night before we left. I was really impressed with the cleanliness of this hotel and the excellent customer service. Starting with the front desk all the way through the breakfast staff they were very friendly. The continental breakfast was better than some restaurants. The price was very affordable as well for Scottsdale. We were so impressed we stayed at two other Holiday Inn Express Hotels driving across country to Ohio.
