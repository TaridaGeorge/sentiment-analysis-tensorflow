This historic deli is one of a handful of places Downtown where I've never had a bad experience. The pastrami and corned beef are the best in town and the French fries and chicken noodle soup are brilliant co-stars. 

Downtown Deli is definitely a place to go if you're eating in because the walls are covered with interesting pieces of Phoenix memorabilia and it's always busy at noon, making you feel as though you're smack dab in the middle of a bustling urban environment. 

One tip: You'll want to bank on taking an extended lunch because digesting a Downtown Deli sandwiches is a real chore. Of course I mean that in the very best way.
