Delicious!! I've tried Treehouse Bakery's scrumptious treats many times and I've never been disappointed! I'm so happy they have a shop now where I can go in and grab some cupcakes. I went in on Monday to get some to share with everyone at work on Tuesday. I got churro, vanilla, chocolate and pineapple upside down cupcakes.We decided at work to cut them up and split them so everyone could try them all. We started with the chocolate. Before everyone tried that one, someone was already digging into the churro. Everyone absolutely loved them, as did I. I love the churro, as well as the french toast cupcakes. I'm not vegan or vegetarian. Neither is anyone at work. Doesn't matter. These are so moist and delicious. Love them!!!
