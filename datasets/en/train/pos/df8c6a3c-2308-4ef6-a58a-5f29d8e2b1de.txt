First-class rare book shop with a comprehensive selection of mostly antiquarian books. Clean, spacious, well organized, and the books aren't pointlessly locked away. Also has a few autograph plaques with photos and mounted memorabilia (Tiger Woods signed photo, anyone?). Books are priced about where you'd expect given the amenities.
