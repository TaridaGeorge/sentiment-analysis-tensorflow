A hidden gem.  In these days of growing big-box bookstores and ever shrinking small bookstores, this one stands out as one of the best.  A wide selection of new and used books covering an eclectic range of subjects, I rarely pass up an opportunity here when I'm in town.  Friendly, helpful staff, inviting surroundings, good prices; what could be better.  I'd compare it to Denver's Tattered Cover before they made the move to their new store.  Superlatives fail me for this one.
