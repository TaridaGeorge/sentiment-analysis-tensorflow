I have gone here 2-3 times per week since it opened.  You could drive by and miss it because it looks like an office building, but look for the enormous mural painted on the wall outside.  It is fun to try all of the beers that are hard to find elsewhere.  

Appetizers are great - I don't remember everything that I have had, but the warm sausage plate was delicious (I was with five guys - not my choice, but it was tasty!).  Sweet potato tacos (I think that is what they were called) were also great, as were the Chet and the Blue Quesadilla.
