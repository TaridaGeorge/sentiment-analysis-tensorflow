I took five little girls and their mom's to the Arizona Biltmore's High Tea a couple of weeks ago.  We had a fabulous time!  What a way to spend an afternoon!  Great food, great service (kudos to Lindsay and Kevin) and the girls are still talking about all the fun they had.
The price is really affordable (little ones five and under eat free) and the seating is comfortable.  We are going back in two weeks.
If you want to treat a little girl or a friend to an experience they will always remember, take them to the High Tea at the Biltmore.
