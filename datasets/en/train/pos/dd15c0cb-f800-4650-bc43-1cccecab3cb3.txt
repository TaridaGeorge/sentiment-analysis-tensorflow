Jeff and his staff are great.. They really have a personal touch with their customers. The staff has been very responsive to any request I have ever made, and Jeff is a tremendous resource... not just for home/auto insurance, but also for financial services and advice. Jeff also has a great network of contractors/vendors he works with in the area, and he is always helpful with a referral. He has helped me with plumbers, A/C, contractors, etc..; he helped me get some dings removed from my car inexpensively without having to file a claim, he gave me good advice on buying a new car and financing it.
Like A Good Neighbor... with Jeff it is not just a marketing slogan, it is the way he does business.
