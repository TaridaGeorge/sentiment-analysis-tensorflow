I have been a member to many gyms and this one is by far my favorite.  The facility is very clean, their janitorial staff  also works 24 hours.  They also have plenty of equipment so Im never stuck waiting for an available machine (Very Important)  and the staff is very friendly.  I have already got my family, classmates, and friends to sign up and they also love it.  If you are looking to sign up for a gym, you should definitely check this place out.
