Tried this place for the first time today after reading the Yelp reviews on burgers and I think it was even better than I had expected. The California burger was awesome and I loved the fries. To top it all off I had a Dublin Dr. Pepper to was it down.  Was the best burger shop hamburger I have had in years. 

The have a soda shop also where you can pick out gourmet sodas with a really big selection. 

Service was fast and very friendly. I will definitely be back again when I am in the area.
