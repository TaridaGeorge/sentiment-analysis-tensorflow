I love love love their pizzas! They have a great one called "The Padre", which is not on the menu, but has prosciutto, fig, and arugula on it. It is lovely! My friends and I always get this one when we come here and enjoy it with a refreshing pitcher of their rosemary lemonade (with vodka, of course!). Other notable pizzas I've had are the Mother Earth, Rocket Man, and Roasted Corn (love goat cheese on pizza!). 

Also, great atmosphere, nice servers, and it's connected to a gelato place to boot!
