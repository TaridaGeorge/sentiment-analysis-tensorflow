I started using their services based on a recommendation from my manager.  I'd have to say that it is really convenient, and they have a wonderful selection of grain-free premium dog foods at fair prices.  I used to have to drive 25 minutes to my vet in order to buy my dog's prescription food, but all they needed was a copy of the 'script in order to deliver directly to my front door.  If you have pets and live in the Phoenix area, there's no reason that you shouldn't be using GooberPet to buy your pet supplies.
