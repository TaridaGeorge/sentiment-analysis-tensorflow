Just to start - have a homemade Margarita.  They come in several different flavors.  The staff is super friends and knows everything about the menu.  I have not had anything bad here that I wouldn't recommend.  I did try the variety of Humus and was not thrilled with all of them - but anything else was AMAZE!
