The owner is great. I stopped in to inquire about adding onto my OEM alarm system. He spent a lot of time explaining to me how my 2013 Accent basically has everything it needs, and how shock and tilt detection are things the dealer would have to do. I was really surprised how passionate he was explaining things to me which wouldn't lead to a sale. I just like this guy. I feel like he's completely trustworthy.
