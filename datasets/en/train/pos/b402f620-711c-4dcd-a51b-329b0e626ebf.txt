I have eaten at Roka and had their 5 course lunch and chefs dinner premium tasting menu and all I can say is I'm a huge fan of both.  
Lunch
At $23.50 the lunch course is an incredible deal and the quality of food is the same you get for dinner.

Dinner
Amazing.  Multi-course meal, amazing service, and got a special deep fried uni stuffed shizo leaf that was a bite from heaven.

Other stand outs:
Black cod
Wagyu beef sushi (fantastic)
Fillet

I'm drooling just thinking about it.  I can't wait to go back!
