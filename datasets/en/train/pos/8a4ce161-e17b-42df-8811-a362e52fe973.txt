This is one of my favorite places to come and enjoy myself. I can come with friends, hang out, 
have some delicious pizza and of course, finish with some gelato. There is a great selection of both pizza and gelato. The staff is friendly and offer samples without hast. Every time I come in Tiffany is bubbly and goes above and beyond here job expectations. It is always great to see that although rare, there are still hard workers out there. Thanks for a great gelato spot!
