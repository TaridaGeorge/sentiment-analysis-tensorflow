I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about. The staff at this location are friendly to me. The service is fairly quick as I've gone in at varying times throughout the day. I love the everything bagel with veggie cream cheese. The steak, egg, and cheese bagel was a huge disappointment. It was pretty bland and tasteless. Stick with the bagels and cream cheese. As for the customer who waited 20 minutes for a bagel, I don't have the patience to wait that long for a snack.
