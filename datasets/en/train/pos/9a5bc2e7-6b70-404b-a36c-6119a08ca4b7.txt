Took my dad (visiting from out of town) here for breakfast. It's a nice place to take company, because there's nothing like it anywhere else. Breakfast food was sooo good. I took half of my breakfast burrito home and ate it the next day, so that was even better. Two breakfasts for the price of one. I love this place!
