If I had 6 stars to give to one single restaurant, I would definitely give them to True Food! By far my ultimate favorite restaurant. Healthy but great tasting food, excellent customer service and great atmosphere. 

I have gone there several times and loved every dish I have ordered. My friends options were excellent as well! Their Kale salad is really good, but the shrimp & goat cheese pizza is to die for!!! I am also a big fan of their turkey burger. The sea bass melts away in your mouth. Yummy! 

There is nothing I dislike about this restaurant (with exception of sometimes having to wait to be seated during lunch hours)! I love the concept. Ingredients used are organic, hormone and anti-biotic free, and locally grown. Plenty of gluten free, vegan and vegeterian dishes. 

Highly recommend this restaurant!
