This place really is great -- but it is HOT!  The medium is not for the faint of heart.

My sis and I went Friday -- got the Larb (which I will agree should be ordered w/out the fish sauce) and the spicy basil chicken and green bean dish.

Both were great, and the medium pretty much burned off our tastebuds, and we love spicy!

I would most definitely recommend this place -- just be prepared if you order your food medium and up!
