Normally the food here is to die for so I'm going to give this a fiver. Kung Pao Chicken and Dry Chow Fun are always a hit. Last night we ordered the Satay tofu and vegetables and it was definitely not what we expected. It came with vermicelli noodles and a watery chicken broth. We were expecting it to be in peanut sauce but was far from it. We wont be getting that again but we also paired it with Chicken Fried Rice which was a whopping 5 dollars. I'm not going to lie, this Fried Rice was the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Chinese/ Hong Kong style cuisine!!! Don't you dare order off the AZ menu, try something legit off of the Hong Kong menu :)
