Sure you can go watch a Cardinals game at University of Phoenix Stadium, but this facility is clearly at its peak when it is hosting the Texas Longhorns.  This is the home of the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, which is also at its peak when featuring the Texas Longhorns, it is also brought to you by Tostitos.

This is easily one of the best stadiums I've ever been to, I'd even go as far as saying that it is better than the Dallas Cowboys Stadium on account of having a better view of the field from the upper deck, though it is important to mention that the Cowboys are the superior football team.  The stadium is VERY handicap-friendly and the shopping/restaurant area around the stadium is a great place for pre and post game activities.

Clearly the Cardinals were not messing around with this one, Kudos AZ!
