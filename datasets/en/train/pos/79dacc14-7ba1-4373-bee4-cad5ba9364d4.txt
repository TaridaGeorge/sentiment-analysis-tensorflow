Love this store!  Were really helpful when I helped plan a replica white house dinner for DESERT SHADOWS MIDDLE SCHOOL for 370 7th graders.  Gave me a discount on the party supplies I purchased for the event.  Even called others stores to find me the extra stuff they didn't have.  Love their halloween section too.  It's my one stop shop for parties!
