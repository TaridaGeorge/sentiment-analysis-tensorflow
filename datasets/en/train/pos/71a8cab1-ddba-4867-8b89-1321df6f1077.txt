Wow...if you are looking for a great date bar to take a lady for a fine drink and want to set the mood....this place is definitly at the top of the list for me and you would be wise to place it on yours as well.  Super dark, swanky, candles, couches,great dj and some nites they have live acoustic.  If your date is not into you by the end of the evening at this place she never will be my man.  I am pretty sure if Tiger had a mistress in Phoenix and didnt want to be seen he would take her to Merc Bar.
