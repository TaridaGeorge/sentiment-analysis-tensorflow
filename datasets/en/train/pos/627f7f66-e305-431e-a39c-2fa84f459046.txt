ATTENTION Eagles Fans!!!!! 

If you don't know already, this is an Eagle's bar during football season. And IT.......IS......AWESOME. Being a huge fan myself, imagine one Sunday, rolling in to what I thought would just be another normal bar where I would catch the game but instead, stumbling into EAGLES TERRITORY with the flags, the jerseys, and the offical song ringing through the speakers. I swear I blacked out for a little bit.

So since then this has become my fave sportsbar! The two-story layout is awesome and really gets the crowd into the game. There are screens everywhere so there isn't really a bad seat in the house. The food is good, above-average bar standards like burgers, wings, wraps, and nachos.
