I'm originally from the midwest and for some reason we don't have places like this there.  Yogurtland was heaven for me.  I love making my own ice cream and love lots and lots of "stuff" in my ice cream.  I hated going to Coldstone and other places where they controlled how much was in my ice cream.
Since I've lived here for awhile now I've experienced other places similar to this and sorry but Mojo's and Cherry on Top ain't got nothing on Yogurtland.  Mojo's sucks and is expensive.  Yogurtland is inexpensive and their frozen yogurt flavors are amazing!  And added bonus when I don't feel like being a fat child I can make a really yummy healthy treat from the low-fat/low-sugar yogurts and fruit.  LOVES IT
