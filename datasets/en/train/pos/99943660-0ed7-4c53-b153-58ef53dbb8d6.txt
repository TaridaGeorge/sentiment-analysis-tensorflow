Review #100 and appropriately 5 stars.  Gentleman serving at 6 last Sunday evening was very nice and accommodating.  You pick from 10 different breads (cookiez) and from many different ice creams, and make a sandwich of it.  I had a chocolate chip cookie with German chocolate cake (half because I was eating dinner soon) for $3.  He asked me and and the others in line if we were students (me years ago, same with the server).  He sure loves his job and I will go back next time I'm in PHX.
