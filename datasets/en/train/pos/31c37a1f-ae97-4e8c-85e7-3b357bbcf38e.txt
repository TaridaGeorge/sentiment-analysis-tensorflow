I saw this place on TV and they raved about the Onion Rings. So I was in the area and stopped in and tried them.  They were right,  these rings are in a whole other league from what I was used to.  I also tried the Steak Soft Tacos. Guess what,  they were full of steak instead of lettuce like a lot of other taco places.  And the steak actually tasted like steak! Not just some meat filler. I didn't try the fried chicken or the Calamari,  that's for next time. I will definitely be back. When you find a place this good you'll drive out of your way to treat yourself,  I know I will!
