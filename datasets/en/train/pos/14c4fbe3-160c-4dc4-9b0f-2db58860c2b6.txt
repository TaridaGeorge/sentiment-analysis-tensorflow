I adore this restaurant.

The service is excellent. The food is perfection. 

I've had the Butternut Squash Enchiladas and the Corn and Goat Cheese Flatbread - both are awesome. I also love the Urban Market Salad and I tweak it a bit - I swap the blue cheese vinaigrette for the dressing that comes on the Fiesta salad that accompanies the enchiladas and ask for no blue cheese crumbles. 

Worth your time, worth the money.
