We love this place.  My daughter can run around the picnic tables and we can bring the dog too.  Our dog enjoys hitting the nearby dog park afterwards too.  

I don't think I've had anything on the menu that I didn't like.  I like the fontina burger, the portobello mushroom sandwich with the green goddess dressing (yum), and the BBQ chicken pizza.  I also love that I can get the fresh beet salad with blue cheese in place of french fries.  I really don't have anything negative to say about it other than the drive.  We live about 45 minutes away, but still make a point of going there as often as we can.
