This place is the real deal.  For some background, I'm from San Francisco so I've had some great locally-roasted coffee, attended coffee cuppings, and roast my own.  On an extended business trip I went to Cartel every single morning and they always impressed me:
* really friendly, knowledgeable staff who takes pride in the brewing and origination of the coffee
* the barista offers great recommendations based on your tastes (as if you were ordering wine with a meal).
* every item I have tried - the breakfast eggs, the pastries, and - of course - the coffee, has been phenomenal.  Always better than expected.
* a great place to hang out with friends around a table, lounge on the couch, or even grab a laptop and meet with someone.  Quiet enough, but by no means a library.
