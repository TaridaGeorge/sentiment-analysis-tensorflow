Oregano's is hands down the greatest restaurant ever! When I lived in AZ, I would go there at least twice a week for lunch. Everything on the menu is delicouse. Thier hotwings are some of the best around and the boom dip is second to none as far as apitizers go. 

If you are in the mood for pizza, you cannot go wrong with the thin crust and i do mean thin! The stuffed pizza is also amazing but it takes a while to make.

The baked ziti and the angel hair with meadballs are the best pasta dishes.

When youre done with dinner you must get the pazookie! its simply the best!

I'm getting hungry just writing this.
