Great Food, Drinks, Fun Environment, Great Service! My husband and I drive by Otaku all the time and have said we need to go there sometime.  Well we finally dined at there this past Friday night and had a great experience. The sushi was amazing and we tried their Stuffed Jalapenos ~ delicious. Thank you Antonio for offering us dessert that we were just too stuffed to take you up on.  We will be back for dessert, lunch, happy hour and dinner.
