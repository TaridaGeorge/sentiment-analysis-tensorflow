OH MY GOD!  I HEARD ALL THE RUMORS ABOUT HOW WONDERFUL BUT HAD NOOOOO IDEA UNTIL I TRIED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME!! 

I had to use caps to discuss my love for In-N-Out burger.  I tried it for the first time - double animal style with fries and chocolate shake - I went for it...cut out he bada bing and just had the BOOM!   I was so nervous ordering but the lad was so kind and cute and probably like 13 1/2 years old. 

I'm in love.  I really am.  

I would get on a plane tomorrow again just to fly to get In-N-Out.
