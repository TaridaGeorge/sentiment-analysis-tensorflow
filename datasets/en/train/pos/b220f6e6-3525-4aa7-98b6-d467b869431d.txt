What the %$#@ just happened???  You have to try the "Mama Spinatos signature fresh spinach pizza!!!   Fresh spinach, tomatoes, and a handful of fresh garlic,  It was like a flavor bomb hit my pie hole!  This pizza is so good you can't put it down 'til your lying fetal position on the couch because you ate so much.  This is chicago thin crust at its finest.  

I eat pizza, its what I do and this place has great thin crust.  Do yourself a favor and order a take-out, trust me.

I wish i could comment on the rest of the food.  The pizza is so good I can't seem to try anything else.

Edit: The pizza here puts Oregano's to shame.
