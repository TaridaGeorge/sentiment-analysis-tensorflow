My co-workers and I go here for happy hour and my hubby and I go here to watch games. Went last Thursday and had a stein of Blue Moon as big as my head for under three bucks. Those who are not in love with the wings are clearly not choosing the right flavor...you can't eat their wings without trying the Maple Hot flavor. Great amount of drumsticks on the plate, with crispy skin and meaty goodness slathered in spicy, yet slightly sweet sauce. We always order a basket of their sour cream fries, which are hot, crispy and come with ranch dressing. A mid-westerner's dream! :) Slightly strange layout, but comfy, low-key, and super friendly service Highly recommend!
