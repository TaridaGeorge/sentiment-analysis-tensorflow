Loved, Loved, Loved it. Chad was amazing! This was an incredible ride. The company is super professional, responsive and did a wonderful job taking care of us. Chad made the experience for all of us. He was fun, very informative, and really customized our ride for us based on all our driving skills. I would do this again in a heartbeat. Totally worth it. Thanks Chad. (and JJ)
