I've been to LGO for breakfast a couple times, but have been waiting years to finally get over there and try the pizza. I wasn't disappointed, and am definitely adding this to my list of absolute favorite pizza places. The crust, cheese, mmmm it was all amazing. LGO is also a really great atmosphere. Only downside is that parking is very difficult and if you don't know those streets very well, it is confusing to know where to park.
