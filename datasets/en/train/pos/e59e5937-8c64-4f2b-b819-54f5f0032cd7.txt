I come here more than I care to admit. I've even met a few regulars over the last few months and we're always friendly with each other and chat after work. Mostly what's great about Skep is the reasonable drink prices and beer selection - $3.25 beers on happy hour with a bevy to choose from (I refuse to drink Bud or Miller Light). Konig Weiss is a personal preference. The food is also tasty with half-price appetizers from 3-7 daily (I love their crab cakes and jalapeno and bacon flatbread pizza). The decor is a nice break from the usual beach bars and overpriced restaurants in north Scottsdale, with wood paneling and old-fashioned medical and chemistry memorabilia (the name, if you're curious, is a nod to "The Sceptical Chymist: or Chymico-Physical Doubts & Paradoxes," written by Irish chemist and theologist Robert Boyle in 1661). Try it!
