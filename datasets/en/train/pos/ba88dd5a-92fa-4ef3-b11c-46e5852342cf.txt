Breakfast. It's easy to screw up. Even easier to make it a boring, forgettable meal.

If The Good Egg is the Coldplay of breakfast joints (see that review), Butterfield's is Reign in Blood era Slayer. 100% awesome.

The food is really good (example: California Scramble). The staff is attentive and mostly not annoying. The wait on weekends gets a little long, but who cares? You'll be glad you stuck around.
