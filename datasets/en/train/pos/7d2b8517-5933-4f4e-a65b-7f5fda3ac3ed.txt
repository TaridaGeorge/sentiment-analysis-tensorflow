In a never ending quest to find new lunch spots me and a coworker stumbled upon this place. Hearing it from another person we were originally looking for somewhere else.

Overall I thought the food was excellent. A generous portion, and a price you can't beat. A little difficult to order but got exactly what we wanted. Only problem I can see is no where to sit. So you have to take it to go. Still worth it.
