Oh Hell yes, this place is delicious!

The hubs and I went while we were running errands. He had the platter, with fried chicken, cheesy grits, fried okra and corn bread. I had the Betty Boop (#8) which consists of a piece of fried chicken and a waffle.

It was so freaking delicious. Not healthy in any shape or form, but it was delicious. The fried chicken is salty, and juicy and very well cooked, and the waffle (with real butter & syrup on top) was just sweet enough to make you go back for more.

The joint was clean, staff was incredibly nice, food came out fast, and it was very reasonably priced. If I didn't care about fitting into my clothes, I'd be back more often.
