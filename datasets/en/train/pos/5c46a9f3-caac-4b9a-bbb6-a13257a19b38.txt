If you are a sushi lover, you will love Shimogamo.  We stuck mostly to their happy hour menu and really enjoyed every dish.  The fish tasted very fresh and the employees including our server were all excellent.  I love shrimp anything and their Tempura (5pc) $6 was one of the best I have ever tried.
