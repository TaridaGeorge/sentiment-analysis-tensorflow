Trying to describe C4 to friends makes it sound schizophrenic:

"Well, it's a wine bar. And a coffee shop. They have an awesome cheese selection. Ooh- and there's that ampitheater in the back yard. Also, they have live music. In two different spaces. The bicyclers are the best."

But it works. It has so much personality and local flavor, I never let guests leave town without visiting. It's the best way to spend an afternoon/early evening, when it's too hot to go outside. 

It has a short menu of apps, a few sandwiches and pizzas, and a fair wine selection. The coffee bar is good, and the couches are extra comfy. Breakfast is basic, but good. It's not "the best" in any one area... It's the overall package that sets it above the rest and brings me back here.
