Are you looking for a reputable, honest AC company?  Look no further than Hays.  Excellent service, honest technicians and an owner who cares about his customers.   

When we realized it was time to replace our unit we got 4 quotes.  Hays quote was competitive and their labor and parts backed up by a warranty.  Chris (the owner) took his time measuring our home and answering our many questions.  Install was quick, painless and on time.  Not only did Chris follow up, but we received a thank you card a few days later.

I've recommended Hays to many friends and family without hesitation.  More companies should conduct business like Hays does.
