My boyfriend and I took a road trip to Arizona during Jan. We came to Phoenix and discovered how there isn't much to do! We didn't think we would go to the Desert Botanical Gardens but we decided to go. 

We were so impressed! We went on a tour with our guide, Archer, who was adorable, friendly, and knowledgeable. I really recommend going on the tour. 

We then just walked around. It was interactive and we got to see some animals. 

Then we went to the store and they had such interesting cacti! We bought the bunny ears and the dinosaur back. When we bought them, the cashier told us where they are from and wrapped the bunny ears for me and told me to be very careful since it really itches if you get pricked. Very nice and personable. 

It was a really enjoyable experience!
