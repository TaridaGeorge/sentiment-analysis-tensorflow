The Cilantro Jalape√±o hummus = heaven in my mouth. No seriously- the hummus and the grilled chicken on top is so tasty and surprisingly healthy. I was definitely a lil brought back that Pita Jungle came to the food court of the mall but I can say it hasn't lessened the taste or value of the food at all; just made it that more convenient to pick up some of their amazing food. Anything I've had off the menu, ranging from their salads (both leaf and fruit), the hummus and the pita plates, it's all great food.
