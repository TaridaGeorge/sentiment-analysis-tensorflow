When I discovered this cute little boutique I fell in love.  It's located in a shopping center where Houston's stands.  Next door to Mandy's is a cute little Boutique Shop for your cat or dog.

Mandy's has cute trendy clothing.  I had looked everywhere for zebra print leggings in gray.  Finally I had found them.  They have an amazing sale rack here.  If I only lived in Scottsdale, or in Arizona, I would be back a lot sooner.

You have to check this place out!  If you need a cute dress, shirt, jeans, leggings, accessories, or shorts, then you must take a peek in Mandy's.


Hope you find some cute things!!  Cheers and Enjoy!
