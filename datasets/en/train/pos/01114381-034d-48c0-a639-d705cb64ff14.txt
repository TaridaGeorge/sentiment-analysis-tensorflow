Mardi Gras proves their greatness over and over again and this week they did once again. While on the hunt for some costume attire, I walked into my go to costume shop, Mardi Gras, and was immediately welcomed by Bobbie (not sure the spelling). Bobbie is a former singer/dancer/actress who knows her costumes like the back of her hand. She and the rest of the Mardi Gras staff were so sweet and accommodating that I tried to figure out then and there when I would need a costume so I could visit again. 

I also learned of a Halloween special they have started. If you rent a costume, you get to keep it through the month of October. That sounds like a challenge to costume party hop until you win the costume contests at each of them!
