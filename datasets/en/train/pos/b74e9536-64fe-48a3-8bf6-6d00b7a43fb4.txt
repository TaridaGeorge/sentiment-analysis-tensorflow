Had both breakfast and dinner here today.

Breakfast, Bananas Foster French Toast, great and tasty.  $9.00

Dinner, Chicken Marsala, with a little gorgonzola, served with buttered linguine and grilled veggies.  $14.00, had a couple of glasses of house cab $4.00@ (Penfold's)

Very dog friendly outside, nice chef owned and operated neighborhood place.  We will be back.  Also next door is The Gelato Maker for a quick stop after dinner.
