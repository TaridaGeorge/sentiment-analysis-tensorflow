Yum! I LOVE Grimaldi's. Whenever I want pizza, I'm always stuck in a mental debate over Grimaldis vs. Nellos, since they're across the street from one another. But when I want traditional pizza (whatever I mean by that.. I guess I mean non-funky toppings!, just typical topping like olives or garlic) I choose Grimaldis.  Love the mozzarella they put on their pizza and I love the basil and the fact that they're light on the tomato sauce. Good drink menu, too, and hostesses are always friendly!
