I don't write many reviews but I thought that Blue Fin deserved another one.  Probably the best customer service I have ever had and some of the best teriyaki in the valley.  No corporate BS, just a family business that genuinely cares about its customers and people that genuinely want to be there.  I would recommend this restaurant to everyone!
