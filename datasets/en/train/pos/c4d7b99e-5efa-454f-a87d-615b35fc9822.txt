First went to Zupas when we were in Utah....then they opened here in Phoenix.  I was so excited.....and surely not disappointed. I love their salads and the chocolate covered strawberry they give with every meal. The only suggestion I would have is that they make some deserts without nuts in them....my daughter is allergic so she has to miss out on them.
They are opening in Dana Park the end of November....can't wait as that is really close to my house!
