As if it isnt obvious, I am a huge fan of the Crown Room. Honestly, my friends and I have had some epic nights there. I decided that I needed to write a little update on the Crown Room because this past weekend I learned something new about Crown. New you say? I mean, after 30-some check-ins what else could I have missed?

The White Cosmo. 

Hello delicious :) This is a house recipe and a refreshing twist on the original. I couldn't tell you what exactly is in it...but its tasty without murdering your taste buds with sugar. And the dried cranberries are a nice touch too. Rumor has it that you get real cranberries around holiday time...

Essentially, it is imperative that you take yourself up to Crown Room and try one. You will more than likely find me at the bar. 

Cheers :)
