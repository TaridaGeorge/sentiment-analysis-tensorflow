I agree with the other Yelpers in that Truckin Good Food is awesome!!  They bring such an authentic style crepe to the PHX area--something hard to find.... for a reasonable price too!!  I also had the sweet crepe with banana, vanilla pastry cream, and crushed meringue (I have never had anything with crushed meringue before and it was yummy!)  We also got the kimchee vegetarian crepe with cheese and shredded coconut  (what a crazy combo--I think I'll get another one today since I'll be volunteering at Tet today again--yay!)

Erin and Jeffrey are so sweet too--something very hard to come by these days :)
