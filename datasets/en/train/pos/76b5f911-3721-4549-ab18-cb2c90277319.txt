I absolutely LOVE Defalco's! Quaint, charming, one-of-a kind place with authentic Italian Food. What more could you ask for?

Start of RANT: In perusing some of the other reviews I noticed some yelpers don't agree with my rating. Sorry, but who in their right mind goes to an Italian Grocery and DOESN'T order Italian food, then gives the place a poor rating? WTH? I don't go to Mexican place, order a pasta and expect them to experts at it. End of RANT.

Back to the review. I had the combo sandwich cold, while my partner had the Italian Sausage with peppers and onions. Both were excellent and the service was great.

Now if we only had a place like this up in the vast wasteland called Desert Ridge.
