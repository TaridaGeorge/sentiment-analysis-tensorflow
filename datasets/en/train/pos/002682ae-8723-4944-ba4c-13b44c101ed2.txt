DAMN! this place has everything, sushi, pork, chicken, beef, soups, shrimp, fruit, Ice cream even pizza. OK this is the kind of place that is dangerous for a big man trying to downsize. I almost went and found the manager to have him bar me from this place! It's just too tempting! It's like one of the really good seafood buffets in Vegas. I saw no down side to this place. Me and a friend had lunch and it came to $24.00 for two, I could have easily ate that in shrimp and ribs alone. Man I'm getting hungry just typing this. If you like a good, clean and plentiful buffet this is the place. Damn they are good!
