My first time at Dry Bar. Didn't know what to expect. But with complimentary drinks and cookies I was sold. They had iPhone chargers at each station which is critical for me. Leah did my hair and usually I go nowhere but to my usual girl because I have curly hair but she did a fantastic job and I will be back!
