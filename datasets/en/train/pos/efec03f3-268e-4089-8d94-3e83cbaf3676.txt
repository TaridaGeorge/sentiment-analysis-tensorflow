We went for the fall festival and it was so much fun! Reasonably priced (plus $1 discount available with coupon or canned food donation) and plenty to do. We had four adults, two infants and a three year old in our party and all had a fun time. The kettle corn is awesome too and they are pretty generous for $5 a bag.
