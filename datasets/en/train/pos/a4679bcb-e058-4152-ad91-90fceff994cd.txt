All I can say is DELISIOSO!  I had the lunch special of St. Louis Style Ribs, Wilbur Beans, Corn on the Cob, and a Cornbread Muffin.  The ribs were definitely finger licking good as they melted in my mouth.  The beans were savory and the cornbread had a sweetness to top off the perfect lunch/dinner (would that be considered linner?)
Anyhow, if you like BBQ and have never ate at Famous Dave's, you do not know what you are missing!
