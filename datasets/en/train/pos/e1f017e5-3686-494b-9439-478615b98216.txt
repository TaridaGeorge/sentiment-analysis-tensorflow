These are awesome sandwiches! I'm not talking about the veggie crap. I'm talking cheese steak, Capistrami and Turkey pure love. I like to get the cheese steak with hot and mild peppers. It just melts in your mouth. I can't help but laugh at the negative reviews by the Vegans on here. This place is great, if you want Vegan go get some Humus.
