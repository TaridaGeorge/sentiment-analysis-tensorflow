Had to find that "fast food" meal and this was a perfect choice for this Cali fam to try.  My kids said this is "real" chicken sandwiches. Of course they eat at Mc D's alot. Not only that, the manager came by and checked on us and re ~filled or drinks personally.  Now thats service for a fast food place. We were out in 30 minutes and happy to leave Arizona satisfied in or tummies.  Can't wait til Chick Fil a comes to Norcal!
