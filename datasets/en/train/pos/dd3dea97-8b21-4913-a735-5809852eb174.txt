I love this dentist too.

Everyone in the office is very pleasant.  The doctor does not hound you for payments, which is nice, as dental can be expensive as we all know.
The office is nice and updated, very clean,

If you are looking for a new dentist, go here.  Request STEVE as your hygenist.  He is the best but is only there on Thursdays.

There is another rmale hygenist there, just take my advise and make sure you ask for STEVE.
