I'm not a beer drinker, so I cant rave about how delicious the beer is... but I will say that my boyfriend loved it!  He got the (very reasonably priced!) sampler tray, so was able to taste a little bit of everything and was impressed.

My review is based off of the food, which was fantastic!  I never thought I would enjoy a plate of nachos as much as I enjoyed a plate of these nachos!  We ordered a few other apps as well, and they were all absolutely delish.  

Very impressed with the food, service was good, prices were great... 5 stars from me!
