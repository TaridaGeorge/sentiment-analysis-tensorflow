Very impressed.  The two young men working were attentive and both offered to let me try gelato flavors, but I'd only come in for coffee.  I ordered my latte, the barista suggested some flavors, I went ahead and got a mocha.  I sat down to wait and he not only brought my coffee over to me, but picked up a table and set it next to the armchair I'd selected.  I thought that was super hospitable.  Even thought they were both helping other customers when I was walking out one of them made sure to shout out a nice thank you and good night.  It was very clean and even though it wasn't packed they were both working hard keeping the place looking nice.  It's easy to get good reviews when you have good product AND a good team.
