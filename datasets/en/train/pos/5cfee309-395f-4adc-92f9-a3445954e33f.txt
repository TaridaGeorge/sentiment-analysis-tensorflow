I was one of four women who hosted my friend Gabi's baby shower at Arcadia Farms last weekend and I can't say enough good things about this place. Not only is the food and decor just divine but the service is fabulous as well. We were in a private room across the street from the main building. It's next to the marketplace and very private. Our server Penny was delightful and so accommodating.  They created a fantastic menu for us and had an ipod and speaks set up for us provided delightful ambiance music. 

Would highly recommend Arcadia Farms for any occasion or just a nice Sunday brunch!
