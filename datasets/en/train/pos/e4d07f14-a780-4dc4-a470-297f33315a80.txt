I swung by after the recent YVE b/c I haven't been here for a few years - amazing how things look the same after all this time.  The reason I did an update is because I wanted to note that this place has a pretty wide selection of new bikes - not a ton of high-end new stuff, although he can special order something in if you want to support your local small business.  He does have quite a variety of sizes and models of, shall we say, more accessible mountain bikes, cruisers, crossover bikes which are like mountain bikes but more for on-road riding, and so on.
