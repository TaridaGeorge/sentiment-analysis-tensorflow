LOVE this place.  My dad (a diabetic) introduced me to this place and raved about how this place didn't make his sugar go wonky at all, and how the pizza is amazing.

A recently discovered celiac, it's my new favorite... and the fact that they are EVERYWHERE helps considerably.

I've never had any issues with service and I usually go at lunch time.  I have yet to see it super busy, but according to my servers when I go, they have their busy times.

One funny thing... in the women's restroom, you open up one of the stalls and there is this big painted goddess face staring back at you.  It startled my sister enough that she had to tell me about it so I had to go see it. haha
