I love love love this place. A friend told me about it, and even though it's about 7 miles out of my way...I decided to try it. I go back often now! Super cheap, very good food, great service, nice folks, and did I mention....good food? It's definitely fast food Chinese, but when you're in the mood for that type Kwan & Wok is a must. Try the house special chicken, yum! The restaurant could do with a remodel, but hey...you get what you pay for.
