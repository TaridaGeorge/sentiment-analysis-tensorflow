Rula Bula gets five stars from me for two reasons:

#1 Perfect fish and chips.
#2 One of the only correctly poured Guinness drafts in AZ.

They could punch me in the neck when I walked in, and i would still give them five stars for those two reasons.

Almost all the food is good (though I can count the number of times I've had anything other than the above on one hand). The happy hour is great, with half off appetizers, including the fish nuggets, which are the fish 'n' chips I eat before I eat the fish 'n' chips.

The world's most competitive trivia night. These people STUDY for trivia night. 

Great outdoor seating, good service. Decor is interesting, especially if you like this particular famous race horse that I currently forget the name of but is the subject of approximately 90% of the wall art.
