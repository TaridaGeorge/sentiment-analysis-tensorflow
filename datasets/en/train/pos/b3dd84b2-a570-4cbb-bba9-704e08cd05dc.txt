I came here to get a battery replacement after work one day and Leo helped me out. My battery was still under warranty which was great since I had just got back from Christmas vacation! But what made this experience a great one was I received an education on corrosion. Leo not only explained to me what it can do to your engine if not properly handled but then he proceeded to spend a good amount of time cleaning my battery connectors to help alleviate the problem. This Auto Zone is on my way home and I will definitely use it in the future...
