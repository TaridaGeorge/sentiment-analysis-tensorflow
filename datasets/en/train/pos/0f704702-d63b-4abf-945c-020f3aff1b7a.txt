When my favorite place can't fit me in for an appointment, i head straight to Luster. The deluxe pedicure is amazing! I love that they know I'm here to relax, so they lay off the small talk and let me read my magazines in peace. At the end they always give a complimentary shoulder massage... That alone is worth it! If they did massages I'd be in heaven! This place is always busy, clean, and not overpriced. Plus If you chip a nail within 5 days, come back in and they'll fix it for free. They take credit cards, but only tips in cash FYI.
