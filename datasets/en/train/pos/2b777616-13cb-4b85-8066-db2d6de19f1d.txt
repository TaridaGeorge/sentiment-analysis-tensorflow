Our family has used this Discount Tire store for all our tire needs for many years. I use their website to research tires before I show up to buy them, so I already know the reviews and recommendations before I show up at the counter.
All of the tires we have purchased there hold up well and the only reason why I ever need new ones is that eventually they dry rot from the intense AZ sun (my last pair were on my car for 7 years and still had lots of tread left).
I was there today for my routine tire rotation and inflation check and was only there for 7 minutes (service was that fast)! The employees are always friendly and helpful (even in 110 degree heat in the summer).  I highly recommend this Discount Tire store.
