Finally wandered over to San Tan Brewery, tried the sampler!  yee-haw.  I'm going with SUNSPOT if you plan on drinking several.  It's smooth, has an easy finish, very vague citrus aftertaste.  If you only want one awesome end of night beer its the Gordo Stout - full bodied, nice head, roasted coffee bitter with hint of sweet finish. Mmmmm good!  
Great service, knowledgeable staff about beer & food.  The Chips Trio is good AS LONG AS you are sharing, pico de gallo LINGERS on late into the date!  Awesome Local hangout!
