I try and eat here at least once every couple of weeks. I love the melon soupm which I add the jasmine rice in it. The Beef salad is awesome! My daughter LOVES to eat here. The food is very fresh. The service is great! I love that it takes a little longer because I know they are cooking from scratch. It was a bit toasty one night, but I asked for the fan to be turned up. No problem. I love the books at the tables and the quaint and cozy feel. I just read "Jess W. " review about cash only, but I have always paid with a debit or other card. Is this new? I alwasy eat there at night though. Maybe call ahead and see, if they swiched to cash only, it's worth the extra 2 minute atm stop to eat here!
