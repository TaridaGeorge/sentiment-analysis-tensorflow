For a motel, this place deserves more stars. I am rating this on motel standards not the Ritz Carlton standards. Stayed one night here on the way to Sedona. It was 55$ and our room was spotless and had a flat screen TV and a huge bed. We chose this motel because it is dog friendly and we are glad we did. Check in/out was painless. I would stay here again. Oh ya and to sweeten the deal  there is a Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts right there. We found a nice park to walk our dog at close by called Encanto Park on North 15th Ave.
