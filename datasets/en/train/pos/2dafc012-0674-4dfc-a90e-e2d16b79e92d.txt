Where else can you go in Chandler the will transport you to another country for free in a flash!!

I like to shop here and explore the foods of other countries.  This is not just an Oriental Supermarket, they are a World Market.  Each aisle jets you to a different culture or country.

I wish most of all their sake selection was better but oh well, they are bound by the limitations of their distributors.

I will be there again soon for a mini-staycation!!!!
