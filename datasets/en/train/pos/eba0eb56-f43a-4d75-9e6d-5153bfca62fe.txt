Made my first trek to historic Glendale today, and stumbled into this beauty of a treasure!  Loved it!  The co-op set up was really cool, and loved the different variety of products.  From bows to pin-up fashions, vintage inspired aprons to jewelry, all sorts of yummy fashions and gifts.  Next time when in Glendale I am stopping in, its a feast for the eyes for sure!
