Was just in Phoenix for Cactus League baseball and before I left I checked out local cheap eats in the area.  The Fry Bread House was something that caught my attention.  I'm so glad we came here.  We had the shreaded hatch red chile beef combo taco, it was AWESOME!  We also shared an order of the green chile stew, again great and we shared the cinnamon sugar fry bread for dessert.  All was great, the three of us were stuffed and all for $30.  If you like spicy, if you like new mexican and american indian food you will love this place.  Try it out if you are ever in the Phoenix area.
