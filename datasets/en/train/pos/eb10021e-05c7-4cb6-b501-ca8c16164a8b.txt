Okay yes this is my second auto shop review and yes I'm a girlie girl, but a good body shop and great mechanic are priceless tokens!! And when I had a BMW the guys at Auto Europa were my best friends :) (to put it in perspective, I was in a first name basis with the owner!!).  If you've owned a beamer you know how insane the maintenance and repairs can be (you've been warned if not!), and having a trustworthy, affordable shop is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  So here you are grasshoppers, my secret to Euro-car repair bliss :)
