How does this place seriously not have any Yelp reviews?! Craziness. Went here for the first time today and saw a PA, Christina Cousins... she is awesome! She takes the time to explain things and answers any questions very thoroughly. She is also not a pill pusher at all, makes sure you are totally comfortable taking medications and you know what they are  before she prescribes them. 
So, while I can't speak for any other PA's or MD's here, I can say that she made a dreaded doctors visit very pleasant.
