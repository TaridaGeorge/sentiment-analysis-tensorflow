Superb job, sweet republic...

Your small, clean shop has great (and very original) flavors to choose from, not to forget the teas and pastries. The workers are friendly and helpful, explained the non-fat/sorbet and the regular flavor section to me. I had the Madagascan Vanilla and Kris had the Peanut Butter Chip...both so creamy and delicious!! $8 for both, so it's not gonna be cheap, but it's high quality. I am amazed that they have their own line of peanut butter, peanut brittle, water, talk about branding more than just ice cream.

"Voted Top 10 Ice Cream Shops"... not surprised to see why!

Note: There is a minimum of $7 purchase if you plan to use your credit card, and they don't take bills over $50.
