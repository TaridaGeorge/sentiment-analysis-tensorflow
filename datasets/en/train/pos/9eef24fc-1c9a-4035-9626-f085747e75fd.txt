I've started going here for lunch with a coworker, and we're both hooked enough to go here at least once or twice a week. Everything tastes fresh, the service is great, the staff is friendly, the bathrooms are clean, it's fairly affordable, and I just can't think of any reason to really knock this place.

Edit: After checking out a lot of other sushi establishments, this is still the best one in terms of food quality, service, and value. It's the big kahuna.
