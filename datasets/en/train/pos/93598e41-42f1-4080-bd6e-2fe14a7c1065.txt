I love this spot for a quick, healthy drive-thru lunch! They offer a great menu full of healthy dishes. My favorite is the Veggie D'Light wrap. the sauce is so tasty and I love all of the veggies. Great staff, too - they're always friendly and fun.

I haven't tried their breakfast, but want to. Great local spot!
