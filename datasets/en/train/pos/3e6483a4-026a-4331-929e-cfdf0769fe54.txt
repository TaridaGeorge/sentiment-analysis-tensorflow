I really LOVE Mongolian restaurants. You really can't get pissed off at anyone but yourself if your meal sucks! I love how clean the restaurant is, and how friendly the staff are! They have a great vegetable selection and a good meat selection as well. 

Aside from the Mongolian/stir fry part, they also offer rice, soup, and other miscellaneous items to enjoy as well. I haven't found a Mongolian restaurant that I have liked as much as this one, and trust me, I've looked! 

I do wish they offered shrimp and calamari, and maybe some baby corn, but really, that's just my personal taste. 

I think they should offer a menu of sauces for those first timers who have NO clue what they are doing, but as for me, I've got my recipe DOWN!
