Chang's Spicy Chicken makes me go...Ding du du du ding ding ...nu nu nuh! Fan-freaking-tastic.
I love PF Changs...which we have renamed PF-Twang-Bangers...or PF Chizzle in Scotts-Dizzle.


I know how mature right....
Best way to go about it...

Big huge pot of tea- I like the OOLONG Dragon Eye
Calamari with the salt and pepper dip...
An order of the Spicy Chicken...bow wow chicka chicka...
Brown Rice of course!
And an order of MooShoo pork ask him to put half in a box to take home for late night munchie factor...
Followed by 2 fortune cookies...always spin them, whatever way the points are pointing thats yours!!

Oh yeah and remember after reading your fortune.. you must say "IN BED" loudly after reading it.....makes it better.

Rock on Twangs.
