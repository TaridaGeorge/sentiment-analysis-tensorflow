Great store!  In these days of fierce competition from the chains and the Internet, these gals have found their niche.  I went in there looking for a nice writing journal to give as a gift and the woman behind the counter was extremely helpful and friendly.  I liked the atmosphere in that place, too.  It seems like whenever I turned around there was one interesting find or another.  I will most surely be back and will recommend to friends.  This is what mom and pop store shopping should be.
