Dick's Hideaway is a great little bar (emphasis on the word "little") on 16th St @ Bethany Home. One part of Richardson Browne's trifecta along with Richardson's and the Rokerij, Dick's has friendly bartenders, Chimay on tap, a dark wood and copper interior, and the same New Mexican dinner menu as Richardson's - what more can you ask for?
