Tried it out on 7/3/12 with my husband and 2 friends. We each ordered a different pizza so we got to try a nice variety. Loved the pizza especially the crispy crust. Very fresh ingredients. There is no reason to drive into Phoenix for pizza at Bianco or Cibo when this gem is in the neighborhood! I will be back.
