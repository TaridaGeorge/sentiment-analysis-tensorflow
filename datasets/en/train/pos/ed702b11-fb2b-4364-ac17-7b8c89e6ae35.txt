I can't tell you how much I appreciate this business. The owner and staff are extremely helpful, they are pleasant and down-to-earth, they know their trade well, and I have never felt pressured to do something that I didn't need to.

I regularly visit them for my auto maintenance from oil changes to more heavy stuff. I had the stupid idea to visit a dealership to get my services done and felt completely ripped off. After visiting the C&R the next day, they went through leaps and bounds to make sure my car was road-ready...far better than a certain Toyota dealership near Mesa Riverview.

I can't recommend them enough. Great prices, honest staff, and the willingness to go the extra mile makes me a happy customer.
