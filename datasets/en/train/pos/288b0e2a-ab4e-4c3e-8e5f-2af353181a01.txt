I went to Arizona Livescan Fingerprinting yesterday and I was extremely pleased with the prompt and friendly service. Val was terrific! She got me in and out of there quickly and provided me with the forms and clear instructions on how to send in my fingerprints. She even gave me a preaddressed envelope. I wish every business was as pleasant to deal with as this one is! Highly highly recommend!
