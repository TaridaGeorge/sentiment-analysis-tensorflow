Just had lunch at Bobby Q. We had the sample platter which came with beef brisket, one side, St. Louis ribs and smoked chicken (which we substituted for more beef brisket) and the beef brisket sandwich. Everything was incredibly GOOD!!! our server saw that we were sharing the strawberry lemonade and ignoring the iced tea so brought out another strawberry lemonade free of charge!!! We were served corn bread as we waited for our food which came out super fast. All that and our bill was only $26!! I definitely recommend this place! And if you tell them you found them on yelp, you get 10% off your bill.
