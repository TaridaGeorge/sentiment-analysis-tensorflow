This place has always had good food and good service, but in the past the service has been sort of slow when I've dined there during the lunch hour with larger groups. However, I have nothing bad to say about them after the visit I experienced this week. The food was excellent, the server was polite and attentive, and two different workers were constantly refilling drinks. On top of that, they were busy and still able to give us ample attention!
