Great experience.  I took their "lock low and go" special and they gave me a Crown Victoria for 14.99 per day.  Very comfortable.  
Waited in line less than a minute and the young man was very nice and friendly.  He offered to sell me extra options but was not pushy when I turned them down.  The car was already ready for me.  It had a few scratches but ran great and they didn't charge me for damage.
A smiling young woman checked my car back in rapidly.  
So....  The price was great and there were no hassles at all.  I am very pleased.
