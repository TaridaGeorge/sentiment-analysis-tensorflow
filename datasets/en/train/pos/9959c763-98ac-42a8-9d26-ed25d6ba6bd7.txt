Great personalized, helpful, knowledgeable service for everyone! Great membership package for runners in their area and totally no pressure sales make me love this place. 

A lot of chain running stores are staffed by hollow eyed high school or college kids just looking to pass the time in a retail position, Scottsdale Running Company is by runners for runners and it really shows in their dedication to carrying good products and taking care of each customer.
