VEGETARIANS! EAT HERE! 

I've been a vegetarian for nearly 3 years, and the one thing I miss more than anything is a delicious deli sandwich. Capriotti's has filled that void oh so deliciously well. The vegetarian Philly Cheesesteak is delicious. The Veggie Cole Turkey with Russian dressing is killer. They use Morningstar Farms chicken and Worthington's Turkey - it is the best mock turkey I've ever eaten - and you can't buy Worthington's in AZ, so you've got to try it at Capriotti's!

My only annoyance was that I can't get a Vegetarian Bobby. The stuffing has chicken stock in it. What a bummer. You'd think, as veg friendly as they are, that the stuffing would be vegetarian too. Oh well. I'll stick with my Veggie Cole Turkey anyday.
