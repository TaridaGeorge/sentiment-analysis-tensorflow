I first need to state that I am not a Vegan, but rather a meat eater of the highest order. However, my girlfriend is vegan, and this is her favorite restaurant. If I could eat from this menu 3x a day, I would be vegan too. the Chicken Wings were an amazing appetizer, and both of the sandwiches we ordered were flat out great...vegan or not. This is a great restaurant and I know we will be back frequently.
