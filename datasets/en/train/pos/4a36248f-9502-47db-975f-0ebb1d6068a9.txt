I've enlightened a few people to this place recently (previous 2 reviews before me lol) and I've been going there for a couple years now.

1 of 2 best Gyros in Az... hands down.  Best gyros since moving away from Chicago...

Prices are extremely fair and the staff is always really nice.  Lots of seating too!
