We are a straight couple and we loved Charlie's. 
I (female half) love going to drag shows and have seen Barbra Seville (hilarious) and Angela Dodd (Hot as hell) many times so that was the big reason we decided to try it out on a Sunday night.
I was so not ready for what I encountered! Packed full with lots of very attractive people.  It was reminiscent of P-town in mid summer.  For those of you who are not East Coast people, you need to go there also.  :)
Charlie's was a big fun party, slammed full of very friendly, very good looking people having a great time.  I had a blast.  The only thing I was hoping for that didn't occur was an interactive drag show.  I guess I will have to head out to one of the less crowed spots to enjoy this type of entertainment.
Kudos!
