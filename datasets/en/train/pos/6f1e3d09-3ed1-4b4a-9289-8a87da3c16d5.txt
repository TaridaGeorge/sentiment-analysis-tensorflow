The food was sooooo good my party and i went speechless.  We tried the mac n cheese, pastrami, salad and chicken with waffles appetizers.  For the main course, i ate the scallops with grits.  I did get to try the meatloaf and both were excellent.  Get the  scallops medium rare.  It basically melts in your mouth.  Can't wait to go back and attack the menu again
