This place has a lot going for it!  They've got great coffee.  The staff I met were super friendly and a pleasure to talk with (thank you Elijah and Amber!).  

The space is large, and has something to offer (besides the great coffee) for everyone.  There's plenty of tables for those looking to study, or road warriors looking to catch up on paperwork.  There are nice couches for those who want to sit and relax.  They have a large space for either live music or art exhibits.  And they even have a good sized conference room with conference table for people looking for a place to hold a small meeting (10-12 people tops), or people looking for a quiet place to sit down with clients.  

Also, HUGE BONUS:  They have their own parking lot with covered parking!!
