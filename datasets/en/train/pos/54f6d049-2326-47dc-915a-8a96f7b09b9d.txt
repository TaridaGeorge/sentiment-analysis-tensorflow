I'm Greek, and usually very picky about my Greek food.

My Big Fat Greek Restaurant has a modern, fun ambiance paired with classic greek favorites.  When we came they had most of the seating reserved because they had a party of 50 coming in.  Even with the place packed we had speedy service and delicious food.

Try the flaming feta and humus.  For a great american/greek fused side try the greek fries.  To DIE for.
