Diagnosis: Delicious!! 

I've heard this place was really good but I was still suprised with how great the grub is. I recommend the secret bbq chicken sandwich. The thyme fries are killer and the fruit salad was yummy too.  Prices were reasonable. Cool vibe. Can't wait to go back and try something else!
