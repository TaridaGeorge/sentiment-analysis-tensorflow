This is hands-down my favorite BBQ place in the greater-Phoenix area. Great atmosphere. I love the brisket and the Mac and Cheese is to die for! Last night had another great experience with Amberlie as our waitress! She was outstanding. I also discovered a new yummy drink there: their sangria! Will have that again next time for sure! I always take out-of-town guests here and it never disappoints.
