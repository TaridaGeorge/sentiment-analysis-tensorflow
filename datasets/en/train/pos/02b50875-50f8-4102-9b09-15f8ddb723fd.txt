My daughter and I discovered this place when we first moved to Scottsdale and fell in love with it! The steaks are cooked perfect, The fish is delicious, and the desserts like strawberries with whipped cream  best eatin on the piano bar is superb! Its a great atmosphere to meet people and have cocktails. If you are really feeling wicked you must try the chocolate sin cake when you feel like indulging in a moment of ectasy.
