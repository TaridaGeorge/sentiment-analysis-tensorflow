This place has been here for a long time, and for good reason. It's great! The food is delicious, the portion sizes are big, the price is cheap, and the food comes out fast. It seems to always have customers no matter what time you go. 

Crispy spring rolls, and soft spring rolls are some of the freshest and best I've had. The pho broth is not greasy and packed with great, authentic flavor. Not watered down, like some other places. I'm not as big on the combination rice dishes, but love everything else.
