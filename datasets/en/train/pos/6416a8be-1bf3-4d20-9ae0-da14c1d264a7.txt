We got a chance to try this place while on the Holiday crawl last Sunday. SO good!

Their storefront is easy to miss. Theyre located on the west side of Goldwater just south of 1st Ave. The shop is small, mostly baking space, so they only have room for a few  2 seater tables. But it smells AMAZING. Since we were on the crawl, we had the chance to try their chocolate peppermint cupcake, so good. We each ended up buying a few of their sea salt/ chocolate chip, cranberry oatmeal (!), and molasses cookies. The molasses are my fave so far. The owners were super nice, and even gave my friend some doggie cookies to take home to her pooch!

Ill definitely be going back.

Keep your eyes out for their coffee shop annoucement!
