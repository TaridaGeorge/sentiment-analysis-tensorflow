We visited Paletas Betty on Saturday night looking for a dessert after sushi. THe store was spotless and brightly lit. It was definitely minimalist on the inside, but we loved the fresh fruit display.

They have 8-10 flavors of popcycles plus some drink options (and even a frozen treats for pups). We both got the arroz con leche, which was sweet. You could really taste (and chew) the rice bits mixed with cinnamon.

We'd love to go back and taste the other flavors! Handmade, real fruits, local biz... Check it out!
