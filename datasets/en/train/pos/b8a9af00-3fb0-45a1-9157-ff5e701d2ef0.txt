Wow, since my last post, I've replaced that dishwasher and I'm on my 2nd one. This one's a lemon too!!  I went in the other day to replace this one. They gave me an upgrade and I had to add an add'l $75 but I'm upgraded and waiting for the new one to come in. Third time's a charm?  We'll wait and see.  Thanks Lowe's...so far, you've been amazing.
