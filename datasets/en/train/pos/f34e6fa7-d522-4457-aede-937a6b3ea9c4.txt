Oh...Ooooh...Oooh my god! ...Yes! Yes! ...Oh erm...hi..ahem...didn't see you there...I was just enjoying some Sweet Sweet love..er I mean Sweet Republic... Oh who am I kidding?! Sweet Republic and I are having a naughty naughty affair!

Sinfully delicious ice creams that make you feel a little dirty to tell people about...and you almost don't want to because they might eat up the limited flavours before you get there...but it is so goddamned good that you have to brag...so you do it anyhow...and people look at you funny because you are drooling a little..and you moan a tad between flavour descriptions...so they look at you funny!...until they try it because then they know! Yes darling, sometimes when we make love I fantasize about chocolate billy.
