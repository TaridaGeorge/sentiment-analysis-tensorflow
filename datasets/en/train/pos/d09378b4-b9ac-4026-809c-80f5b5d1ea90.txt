You've got to love this place.  Great, often locally grown (and sometimes organic) produce, awesome roasted peppers, wide selection of salsas, fun food items, some dairy, meats, chips, and tortillas.  Most of all the family that runs this business, TJ, Julie, kids, and grandparents are really special--friendly, helpful, and kind.  The prices are very fair, too!
