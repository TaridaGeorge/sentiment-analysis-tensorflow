First time back in a couple years...

This place serves the best Chicken Fried Steak in Phoenix! The staff are friendly, fast, and knowledgeable. Menu is simple and to the point. The memorabilia from Texas and Arizona should be in a museum. The prices are very reasonable! In fact, next time we are going to split one order. The "bigger than the plate" (and the plate was huge) CFS is only $12 and that includes a salad, bread, and fries...

Damn, I need to get here more often!
