Love the G-Spot. I like gelato in general just cause I don't feel so bad when I start fiendin' for some chocolate. And The Gelato spot is as good as it gets. I like the variety of flavors they offer. And if you're wondering what it'll taste like, you can always get a sample. You can mix and match all the flavors as much as you want. I really like the snickers gelato flavor with some mint chocolate chip. Just writing this review makes me want to get some lol. I love this location; being on the corner and on Scottsdale Rd, it makes it perfect to sit and people watch. It's really great for grabbing dessert after dinner or if you just want some sweet yummy goodness.
