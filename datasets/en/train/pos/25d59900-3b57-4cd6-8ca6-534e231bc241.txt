A Nice Change. Unique Experience. Food & Movie Experience Simultaneously. I sat in Fork & Screen for the matinee (only $6 per person). Other people said they had bad customer service in fork & screen, but I received awesome customer service. I got there before the movie started and placed my order during the previews. My food came out quick and Diner quality (tasty, but probably not awesome quality). 

Quick Note Regarding Parking: Park behind the movie theatre, by where it says AMC & Shops. The movie theatre will validate your parking for 4 hours of FREE parking. 

If you are a shopper....You can walk the underground path to the Biltmore mall afterwards for some quick shopping.
