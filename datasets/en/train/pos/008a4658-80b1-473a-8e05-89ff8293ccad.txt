If you like food that is truly authentic and exceeds your expectations, that this is a great place to sit right down and dig in. The owners are first generation immigrants from Poland you might think you are sitting in Poland if you while you dine. We ordered the kielbasa platter and the combo plate. The brown mustard really complements the kielbasa. The combo includes potato cheese pierogi which I really enjoyed. With the owners doing all of the food preparation and service, you feel like you are sitting around their kitchen table. We really enjoyed the food, atmosphere and service.
