I used Windy City Dj's for my wedding in November. I researched a lot of companies and I really think I got a great deal with them. The office staff was great and very flexible. Curt was my dj and he was awesome. He also did my sister's wedding. If you don't want a cheezy wedding dj, then go with Windy City Dj's. Very professional and great to work with and we had a great group out on the dance floor!
