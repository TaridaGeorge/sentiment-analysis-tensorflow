I know there's not a Quiktrip on every corner like some other places, but do yourself a favor and drive a little further sometimes. They're huge, super clean, with large selections, actually some fresh food, and employees who don't appear bused in from the nearest plasma and/or meth clinic. There are usually two people behind the counter, but if there's one s/he rotates back and forth between the two check-out registers to keep the line moving as quickly as possible. Plus a great gas rewards program...

Little things in life can affect the entire trajectory of your day - so I prefer to get gas and sundries from a place that doesn't force me to fight my way through panhandlers to get inside, nor make me run to the shower the moment I get home. I'm looking at you every last Circle K and AM/PM I've ever patronized...
