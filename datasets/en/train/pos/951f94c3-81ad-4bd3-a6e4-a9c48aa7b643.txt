Went for brunch on Sunday with 5 people.   WOW!.  The butternut squash corn enchiladas with tomatillo sauce was one of the best Mexican dishes I have ever had... and I live in Mexico for most of the year!  This dish is also available for dinner and would be plenty of food (three enchildas plus a substantial salad.) Everyone else at our table ordered chilaquiles with pulled pork and all of them said their dishes were wonderful too.   Service was great... waiters often came by for coffee refills.  

Street parking only.

I can't wait to return.
