My whole outlook on the horrible experience at the Gelato Spot changed by the immediate response by the owner. Not only did he apologize for the incident, but he offered me a gift certificate to use at his business.  This is the first time any business owner acted as professional as he did. I appreciated the amazing customer service that he offered and really made me feel like he really does care about his patrons. I will definitely return!
