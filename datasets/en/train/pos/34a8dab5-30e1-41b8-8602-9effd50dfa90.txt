Haven't tried a bad thing here yet!  This is a great place for nonvegetarians and vegetarians alike. The "mock" meat tastes just like the real thing.  Everyone I take there loves this place.  

The atmosphere is super casual with couches to sit on as we'll as tables and booths. The service is always super quick and friendly.
