I love this place and it really is the only good Chinese restaurant in the area that's not super, super casual. (Asian Island is good but it is really casual). 

Their won ton soup is so amazing and delicious. It is huge for $5. LOVE this soup. 

I had the sweet and sour chicken and my boyfriend had the chicken katsu. The sweet and sour chicken was really good and "typical" flavors. The katsu was soo yummy I ate more of his than mine. I keep sneaking my fork onto the plate for some of that delicious rice. Katsu it is for me on our next trip to Flos.

It would be nice if the restaurant wasn't so modern looking, I love the traditional Chinese food places. The atmosphere is still really nice though so I can't fault them too much.
