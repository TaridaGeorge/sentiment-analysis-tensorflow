Had what THEY call "minor" knee surgery, torn meniscus in three places, and went to therapy here for 6 weeks. Very pleasant, clean atmosphere, and the therapists I have been working with, Nick and Jerrod, have both been helpful, encouraging, and supportive. Its somewhat somber in there, I'd prefer some motivating rock and roll music over the sound system, but that's just me!
