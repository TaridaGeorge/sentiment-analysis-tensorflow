Last night was my 4th visit here. It always delicious. Last night i tried the mongolian beef and chicken combo(not on the menu but they did it for me) on a sizzling skillet.WOW!Wow! Was that good!!! Kind of fajita gone asian. It was very yummy and i definately recommend it. Their hot sour soup was delicious too(canned mushrooms in their soups is the only con) my buddy had the sweet and sour chicken was good too. 

Get their groupon and u pay less. ;-)
