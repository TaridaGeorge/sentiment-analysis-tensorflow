Not as fancy as the newer stadiums that have been built, but I come here to watch baseball not to be seen.

The Angels play here, so I'm a little biased and would love this place no matter what. I just love chillin out on the lawn with a pint of Mirror Pond and watching the minor league players try to prove themselves with a few All-Stars sprinkled in.

The atmosphere is great as Angels fans are awesome and show much love and class for the team.

Note...park in the industrial lot across the way if you don't want to wait for hours to pay $5 and park a block closer.
