This mesa pest control company is seriously good.  I had an ant problem in my front yard and thought they would schedule it for the following week, but they showed up same day and took care of it.  Unbelieveable!  It wasn't that big of a deal to me, but it was to them.  These guys are as good as it gets.  Thanks Legacy Pest Control.
