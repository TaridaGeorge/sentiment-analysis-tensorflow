As a former New Jersey girl who was raised on pizza made the right way, I've found my home away from home.  I might have shed a tear when I bit into my first slice.

The crust has that perfect amount of crust, not too thin and the cheese is heaven.  We've been going once a week since we found the place and I'll never eat pizza anywhere else.

Staff is friendly (yes, even Jersey lady if you talk to her for more than a minute) and service is quick.

Mmmm...I think it's time for my weekly fix!
