If you have young kids, the Arizona Science Center is a must visit when in Phoenix. We visited over the weekend, dropped in twice, and never lacked for new things to do. There is wonderful, FUN, learning for kids of all ages about the human anatomy, the universe, motion and energy. A newly opened math exhibit also provides interactive games and activities that teaches your child about numbers and their relationship to everyday things (without their knowing it!). Definitely one of the best science centers we have been to. Our six year old had a blast! P.S. The adults had a great time too!
