My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last night and absolutely loved it.  The food is extremely fresh, tasty, and the options are various and interesting.  Our server recommended that we try their fresh squeezed juices and we each ordered them, one being called the hangover.  Very yummy and if you want, you can add alcohol to them.  Our server was great, explaining the menu and the vision behind True Food and everything they make.  Its for the most part local and organic food and you feel good eating it! There's an italian side to it and an asian side to it, we did both and were very satisfied! I highly recommend the turkey bolognese and mediterranean salad.
