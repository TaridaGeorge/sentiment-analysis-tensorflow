Been here a handful of times now, and it's always an all around great experience. I love the decor, the fabulous chandeliers, the oversized chairs that make me feel like Alice in Wonderland in the tea party scene. But what I love the most is the food. Oh the glorious, tasty, want it in mah' belly-right-now food! Doesn't matter what you order, it's gonna be good.
So far, my favorite place for dinner in the area.
Tip- try the caramel custard desert
Tip- pretzel bun turkey pastrami
Tip- fried chicken n biscuits
Tip- Acai mojito

That is all
