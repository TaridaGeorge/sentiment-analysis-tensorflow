Our 2 daughters went to Montessori Educare ages 3 - 6 for a total of 6 years.  It is a real community with caring Staff, parents, and Teachers.  The class sizes are small and often times there are two teachers in the class.  We had our 2nd daughter attend Kindergarten there.  We were pleased with her education and wished we'd left the older one there too.

They expose the children to so much, they are sponges.  The teachers are well educated in the Montesorri style and the kids love working with each other.

I highly recommend the school!  They have been named best pre-school in the Ahwatukee News "Best of Ahwatukee," several years in a row.
