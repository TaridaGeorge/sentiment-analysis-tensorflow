This place is awesome. You just need to know what you want or go with someone that speaks Vietnamese to make sure you are getting what you want. 
I really like the beef noodle soup and the vegetable rolls. Sometimes for lunch if I am driving by, I just order their vegetable rolls to go and it is enough to fill me for lunch. Wide range of other food as well that has some very good authentic flavor like the chow fun.
