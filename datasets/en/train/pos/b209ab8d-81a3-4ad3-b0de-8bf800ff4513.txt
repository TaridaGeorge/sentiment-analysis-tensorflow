I seriously feel guilty that I like Yogurtini so much.... I decided at the beginning of the summer to make it my mission to try as many froyo places as possible because I wanted to prove my never ending love for Yogurtology... then I discovered Yogurtini.  Now I kinda just feel like I'm cheating.

Not only is Yogurtini's froyo super smooth and perfectly flavored, they have angel food cake flavor!  The topping bar at Yogurtini is outrageous and the atmosphere is great.  Yogutini has enough seating to host large groups and they advertise free wifi which makes makes me feel like I should grab my laptop and make myself at home.

Yogurtini is a must try!
