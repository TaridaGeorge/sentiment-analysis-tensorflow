I used to go to this True Food at Biltmore before a second restuarant was opened at Scottsdale Quarter. Both are excellent in terms of food and service. I prefer the ambiance in Scottsdale, but I would not hesitate to eat at this one regularly if it was a more convenient location. You just cant go back to chemical foods after eating here. My wish is that the chefs will extend their range of greens here beyond brussel sprouts. There are so many great Asian greens, chards, etc.in the world.  Bring it on. Maybe go wild with Vietnamese Pho!
