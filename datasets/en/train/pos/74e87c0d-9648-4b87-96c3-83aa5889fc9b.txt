If you are looking for REAL NY style pizza...this is as close as you can get..Forget about all the places that have NY in their name...they all stink...This place is pretty much a dive in a crappy shopping center, but you get the real deal..being from the NY area myself I have searched around the valley and this is as good as it gets...I see a sign in the Bashas shopping center @ Dobson & Queen Creek in chandler saying they are opening there..I can't wait..I'm not sure if it is a 2nd location or just moving, but it will be nice to have the place just 2 miles away now
