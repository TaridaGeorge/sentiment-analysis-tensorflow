I hadn't been here in 2 years and they dont have them in San Antonio. Booo. I was craving their Garlic Fries.. what can i say? You know when you build something up in your head and it just let's you down? Well that just didn't happen! LOVE their garlic fries. Also tried their Cajun Fish tacos and they were overstuffed deliciousness. Not at all spicy so the "cajun" in the title isn't really necessary but tasty all the same.
