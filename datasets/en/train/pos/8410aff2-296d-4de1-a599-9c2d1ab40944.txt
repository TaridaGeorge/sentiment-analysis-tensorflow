HAPPY HOUR!  I've been to Modern Steak 3 or 4 times for Happy Hour and have NEVER, EVER been disappointed. 

The Happy Hour menu and drinks are well selected. I've tried everything on their HH menu and loved each and every one. My favorites are definitely the Chinese Chicken Salad with 3 of the most wonderful, huge shrimp as a side dish. 

The service is superb and the staff friendly in a relaxing atmosphere. Happy Hour can turn into an evening of conversation and delight in finding such a treasure in the middle of business chaos and shopping. Well worth slipping out of the outside world into a little Modern Steak.
