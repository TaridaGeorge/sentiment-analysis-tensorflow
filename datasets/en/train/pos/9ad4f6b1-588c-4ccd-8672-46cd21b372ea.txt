As compared to Camelback, this trek offers easy parking, and significantly lower chances of snapping your ankles.  One notable perk is the greater chance of falling down the mountain though.  

This trek is by far a much friendlier, a more pure stair master as compared to the creative rock climbing at Camelback.  For the family visit, date, Piestewa Peak is a better choice than Camelback.  Expect a decent workout with less peeps and much more accessible for the less fit.
