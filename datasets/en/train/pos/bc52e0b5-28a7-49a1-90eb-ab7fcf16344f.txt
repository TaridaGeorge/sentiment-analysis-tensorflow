I love their cupcakes!  They are just the right size and have just the right amount of frosting.  The cake is awesome too!  Tastes homemade.  Love, love, love them!  This is my go-to place when I want to pick up something wonderful for dessert.  I ordered a dozen chocolate for Christmas and everyone was impressed.  Those cupcakes were so fresh (just one smell of the box and you were in heaven).  If you go there, you might miss this place because it is hard to spot when driving by.  I wish they would put a huge cupcake right out front.  I am so glad I found this place.  Go . . . take friends or bring some home.  And go often.
