This place is part of an Asian mini-mall.  It's awesome.   This was a very clean, modern-looking place.  It wasn't very crowded on a Wednesday afternoon.  Parking was easy.

The staff greeted me as soon as I walked in.  I had a seat and got to ordering...a #9 (rare steak and brisket pho).  It was about $7.50.   I received my food about five minutes later.  Loved it.  Packed with flavor, unlike some of the previous reviews have mentioned.  The woman came over and told me to mix some of the hoisin sauce with some of the hot sauce and lime juice.  I tried her suggestion and dipped the meat into it - man, how awesome this stuff was...

She also mentioned they do not use MSG.  

I'd hit this place up again in a heartbeat for some of the best pho ever!
