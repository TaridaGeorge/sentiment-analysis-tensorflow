If your board game preferences have grown past Monopoly and Scrabble, you can find  your newest fix here. Likewise, if you or a friend like miniatures, role-playing, or wargames, there's probably something here for you too. The owner, Darren, is a great guy who is quick to recommend a game if you tell him what else you like. The tables in the store make this a great place to hang out and try a game or gather with friends. There are usually people in the store playing miniatures games, and there is a pretty active board game group on Thursday evenings.
