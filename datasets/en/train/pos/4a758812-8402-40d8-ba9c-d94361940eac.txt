We went here for me and my husbands 3 year anniversary. He had the salmon and I had the lobster, scallops, shrimp. The ambiance is so romantic and the service is amazing. The food was delicious and so fresh. We would definitely come back again for a special occasion. The live jazz music was awesome too! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves!
