Two words: Toffee Banofi

We got one and wished we actually got four. So, so good. Alton Brown is right on about this being one of the "best things I ever ate". Delicious almond brittle ice cream, toffee chunks, caramel, bananas, whipped cream, and a crispy waffle bowl...how can you even go wrong?

The other ice cream flavors were pretty delicious too, but in the end overshadowed by the sundaes. Our server was very patient with our excessive sampling, and took time to make our sundae into a work of art. Sweet Republic is in the same league as many other ice cream greats I've been to: Bi-Rite, Ici, Salt & Straw, Creole Creamery, etc. I will return if I'm ever in the area again!
