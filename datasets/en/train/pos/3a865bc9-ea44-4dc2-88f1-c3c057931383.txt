I had several mothers tell me about Eduprize and how great it was. I was a little nervous when I was told there is a waiting list and you have to agree to put time in the classroom. Now that I am in the classroom volunteering, I realize why it is so great. I can see first hand why my daughter struggles in some areas and does great in others. I can see how the others are struggling too and I can be apart of helping them, even if it is just for a day. This school's requirement to have parents volunteer is something ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD DO!
