Two words: Amazing crust. I went to Cibo tonight with a friend for dinner. Great service and great food! We shared the Salsiccia con Patate (sausage and potato) and the La Noce (red sauce, mozzarella, ricotta, arugula, and walnuts).... both were delicious! Wish we could have saved room for a nutella and banana crepe, but the pizza was just too good to stop. Can't wait to go back and try more!
