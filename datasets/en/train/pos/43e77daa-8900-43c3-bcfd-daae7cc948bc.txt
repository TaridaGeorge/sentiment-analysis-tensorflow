There's been more than once I've spotted some adorable toes and asked where they got them done and it was always here, so I thought I had to try to.  This isn't the nicest salon, many of the massage chairs are broken and everything is pretty worn out, they don't do a great job with the pumice or massaging, but the nail art is phenomenal!  The first time I got hot pink toes with argyle and the second time zebra stripes with silver accents.  I've never received so many compliments and they lasted nearly a month.  This is my new go to place for fancy toes.
