I've been to My Florist twice since the redesign (Feb?) and can't find one bad thing to say about it. No more overwhelming loud piano music. I had huge, meal size, delicious salads that made me want to come back for more. The Asparagus and the Tuna Nicoise are excellent. Expecially The Asparagus. I love that salad and I really do hate salad. Both times, we sat there for almost two hours and no one pushed us to leave, even with a line forming, and a bill of about $30.
