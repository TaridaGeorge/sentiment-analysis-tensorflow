Tired of paying dealer service prices for possibly shabby service?  Then it's time to call EuroTechs.

Specializing in MINI Cooper and Jaguar repairs, I had my MINI in for an alternator replacement.  Not only was the repair finished quickly, it was also cheaper than the dealer charged for the same service!

Not only did my repair get taken care of, Jerry also gave me a list of items that should be repaired fairly soon.  His list made sense, included the installation price and was reasonably priced.  

Helpful, clean and affordable.  If you own a MINI in or around Phoenix, EuroTechs should be your shop of choice!
