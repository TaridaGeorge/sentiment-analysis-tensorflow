Spent a week directly across the street from this treasure and didn't go in until 2 days before I was about to leave. SHAME ON ME!!!

The moment I walked in I was BLOWN AWAY by the sweet treats and the amazing cakes. It wasn't the heat that was making me lightheaded, it was the awesomeness within.

I got a breakfast sandwich of bacon, american cheese, and egg white on brioche. BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICH I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE!!! I ended up sharing that day and now 4 days later I wish I hadn't. I also got my girlfriend a red velvet brownie. I put it in my checked luggage and it made it all the way to Charlotte, NC in one piece. My girlfriend ate all of it except a bite or two which she immediately put back in the fridge for another sweet-tooth moment.
