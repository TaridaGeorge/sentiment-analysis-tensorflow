We took a short hike here for Christmas morning. We were surprised that it was open on a holiday. This park was a great walk to get away from the city and to get a view of the area and to investigate some of the local flora and fauna. We also saw a few wild pigs!! Remember to pay your parking fee. Despite it being a holiday, we got a nasty reminder from the local Sheriff office to pay and made sure that we did on our way out.
