Yoga-smic!!!!! 

(ok -- that was a little cheesy) If you haven't discovered At One Yoga you are missing perhaps my favorite community in the valley.  I say community because it is a family.  Amazing, inspirational teachers.  I learn something every time I go.  The power classes by Matt, Ian and Max are my favorite for an awesome workout.  Think hip hop music, sweating and push ups besides your usual stretching, lengthening, and breathing with a spiritual component. But there are some amazing goddesses their also who always find a way to touch my heart...don't miss Lisa and Cintra (for hot yoga).

If this place doesn't change your life...change your view in some way...I would be surprised.  Enjoy this amazing valley gift.
Namaste  -
