Love love LOVE!!  I went on Friday for a 90 minute aromatherapy massage- which was the best massage I've ever gotten.  I cannot remember the name of the girl but she was blonde and I believe her name started with a B.  It was absolute heaven.  I then proceeded to get a facial by Heather, I believe her name was.  She completely cleared up my skin and suggested some great products.  I would suggest arriving an hour early to enjoy the facility prior to your treatments.  I did the steam room, relaxed in this amazing jacuzzi w/ waterfalls, and sat in the aromatherapy room.  Highly recommend!!!
