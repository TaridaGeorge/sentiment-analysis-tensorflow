All the food here is amazing. Fun environment, great set-up. Really as good as it gets. It looks like they have great lunch specials too. I met my Dad and his flight crew here after they flew in from Chicago. They loved it! They met some friendly Aussies before I got there so it turned into a party.
I didn't try the big unit, but it was fun to hear the bell ring every time the waiter brought one out. Maybe next time. Great service- very fast.
