In a day of cookie cutter restaurants and bars, San Tan Brewery is so refreshing.  First of all, it's a great place with great food and great BEER! Second, It's in a great location-downtown Chandler. I personally believe San Tan Brewery played a significant role in the come back of downtown, I know I wouldn't have been venturing down that way if they were not there.  Third, Great service.  In a world of OK service coming off as stellar, San Tan has legitimately great service.

So, its great, great , and great.  Highly recommended. (and I love Beer!)
