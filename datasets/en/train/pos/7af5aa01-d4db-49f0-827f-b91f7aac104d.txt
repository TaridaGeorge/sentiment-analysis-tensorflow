Some times you go to a place and it is so awesome you have to find your computer and yelp about it right away. Well..  this is one of those times.

Went there today and had a pizza with sausage and onion.  the Mozarella is dynamic. The sauce is amazing and the crust (thin) was incindiary.  This may have been the the best pizza I have ever had.  I called my friend in jersey right after and told her.  I explained it may be blasphmeny but I think this may be better than any pizza I have had even in NJ.  She hung up on me.  Oh well.  She will be out to visit soon and I will get a chance to show her!
