This is a fabulous studio.  Great location, very clean, warm atmosphere, and most of all, great instructors.  They are tough and kind; it's a great combination that encourages us to evolve technically and genuinely enjoy the practice no matter what level you're at or type of day you're having.  Bonus, they also make it more affordable than other studios!
