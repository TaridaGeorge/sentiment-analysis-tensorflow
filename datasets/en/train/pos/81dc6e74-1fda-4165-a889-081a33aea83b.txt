I requested that they move closer to my apartment. This place is AMAZING. I used to work at an Italian restaurant so I know how gelato is supposed to taste and this place doesn't miss the mark. They have a ton of different flavors. I tried the bubble gum, lemon, and pumpkin pie flavors which were all very tasty but I went with my favorite: mango. I was not disappointed. The fellow behind the counter was actually from Italy and he was a total sweetheart. They make their own waffle cones there too and they were fabulous. They also gave us cups of water because we all know how thirsty ice cream can make you. I am in love and can't wait until I venture out to Scottsdale again so I can return here.
