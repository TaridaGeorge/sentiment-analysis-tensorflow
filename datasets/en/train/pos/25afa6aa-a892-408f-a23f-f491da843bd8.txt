Fascinating Place!  The love story that this castle centers around is pure Shakespearian Tragedy.  It will make you cry.  On the flip side this is a pretty ingenious use of waste materials cast aside and re-purposed.  Environmentally friendly all the way back to 1930's.  The price of admission $5 can't be beat.  Definitely worth the trip!
