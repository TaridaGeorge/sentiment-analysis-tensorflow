I just looked Menchies up online.  It's 30 minutes away.  What to do, but consult Yelp?!  So the recommendations for Aloha were top-notch, but I figured I'd be the judge of that!  And...5 stars, indeed.  The flavours were great, the toppings were plentiful and fresh.  The only improvement I'd make is offering whipped cream (CREAM, not TOPPING...in case the owner is reading this..)

With four kids, though, I think we'll be going on 2-for-1 Thursday next time! :)
