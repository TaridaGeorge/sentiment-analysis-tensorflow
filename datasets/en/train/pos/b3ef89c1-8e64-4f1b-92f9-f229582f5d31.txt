Six months after Halloween, I was still sporting my ghost costume... time for a fake and bake! I used to live behind Darque Tan in college, so I hopped on over to see what the rates were. 
Kaylene the sales rep was AMAZING. She is bubbly, well spoken and makes you feel like  your business truly is valued. There was NO pressure to buy a large expensive package or $60 bottle of lotion - In fact, she told me your first week is FREE. Honestly, this isn't the nicest tanning salon I could go to, however Kaylene's service will keep me coming back! GREAT JOB GIRL!
