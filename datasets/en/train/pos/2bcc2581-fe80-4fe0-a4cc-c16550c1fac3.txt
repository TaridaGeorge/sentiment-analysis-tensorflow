The Blue Fin is my favorite Teriyaki stop in the valley.  

To begin, the service here is awesome!  For such a casual restaurant, they really know how to make you feel welcome.

I absolutely love the food here too.  Great appetizers, spring rolls, inari, sunomono, etc.  Being vegetarian, I always order the same...Steamed Vegetable Bowl.  For the money, you get a TON of food here.  The teriyaki sauce is perfect, not too sweet like some of those chain places.

Did I mention that the service here is the best?

The only thing wrong with The Blue FIn; they are not opened on the weekends, Monday through Friday only.
