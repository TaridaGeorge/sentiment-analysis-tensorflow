OMG   I really thought they only served ice cream that tastes this good in heaven.   

'Who'd a thunk' of putting REAL mint in Mint Chocolate Chip Ice Cream.

Ben and Jerry....you've been replaced by Jan and Helen!  Give them a couple more years and these former New York Stock Brokers will be ringing the bell on WALL STREET when Sweet Republic goes public!

My only complaint is that I just wish they were located across the street so I could walk for ice cream....every day!
