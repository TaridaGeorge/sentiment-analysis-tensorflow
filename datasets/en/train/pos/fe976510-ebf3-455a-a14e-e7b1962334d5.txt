I like dive bars.  And the Vine is the perfect antidote to the Mill Ave scene.  No one cares who you are, what you're wearing, or who you're with.   

This is a bar to shoot the breeze with friends, relax and binge drink.  Pretty much, if I want to get hammered in the middle of the day The vine is my first choice.
