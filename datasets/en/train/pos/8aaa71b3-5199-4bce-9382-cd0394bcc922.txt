Family owned an operated, in business for over a dozen years, honest estimates and fair pricing.

Even though they came highly recommended, I was expecting the worst when I first visited (always assuming the mechanic is out to get me), and boy was I wrong - these guys are automotive professionals and dedicated to customer service.

Took a couple days to get the part I required, but that seems to be the norm anywhere but the dealer.
