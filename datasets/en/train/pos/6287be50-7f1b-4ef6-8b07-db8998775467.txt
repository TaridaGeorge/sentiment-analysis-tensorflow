Don't be fooled by the name of this store as it should be giant LIQUOR store and more. It does have a huge selection of wines, but it also features everything from 30+vodkas, whiskeys, bourbons, microbrews, cheap brews, pbr (gets its own category), and even kegs! We've gotten kegs here before for parties and they will hook you up with the tap, bucket, ice, etc. 

Anyways, another reason why I love this place. It was thirsty Thursdays and my friends and I were trying to figure out how to concoct this delicious newly discovered drink called Moscow Mule and this was the only place that would sell ginger beer and bitters. So we head over and get 1.75l of stoli for 19 bucks! and the rest of the night just became hazy.
