Oh Mabel's,where have you been all my Phx life?

I don't miss much about LA, but I do miss dressing up and going to a nice bar. I don't want to have to go to a club to throw a dress and heels on. Mabel's has a good vibe, cool crowd, and room to shake shake it. This is a good hang, definitely taking any visitors to this spot.
