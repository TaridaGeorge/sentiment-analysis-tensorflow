I'm from New York, which I mention only because it has somewhat of a reputation for good pizza, and this place totally rocks.  I loved all the hype from my friend who recommended it to me, and was happy to wait an hour or so at the bar next door, getting hungrier and hungrier...  and then the pizza absolutely delivered.  I was with a group of 8 people and we got lots of different pies and tried everything, and we were swooning and fawning over this and that... the crust, the cheese, the sauce, the toppings.

I'm glad a place like this exists, and next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm totally there.
