I'm a loyal customer - I purchase an average of 4 frames from Sassy every year (have been a customer since they opened the 16th location).  
I sport two looks - a casual look and a professional look.  Sassy provides both.  Great range of frames, top quality lenses and superior service.
There is nothing to not like about Sassy Glasses.  Dan and Quida are wonderful to work with and most helpful.
