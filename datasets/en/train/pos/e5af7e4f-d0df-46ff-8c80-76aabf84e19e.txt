This quaint little gem is located inside the Galleria downstairs from where I attended classes.  I always got a fruit salad (had lots of red grapes, strawberries, pineapples, no cantaloupe or honeydew YAY!) and either a latte or mocha.  They we nice and worked quickly and they even remembered my name after a few visits, which I think is rather rad, considering how many people come by everyday.  They offer breakfast and lunch items, they have coffees/espresso/teas, power bars, pastries, and the like.  I wish I could say that I will be back, but I'm done with school and it's quite out of the way.  It was great while it lasted, thanks for the great service peeps!
