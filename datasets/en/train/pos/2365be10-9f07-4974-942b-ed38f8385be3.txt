Every time we visit Mesa, The Blue Adobe Grill is top on our list of places to eat!  Everything on the menu is OUTSTANDING!  Service starts with tri-colored chips served with one of the tastiest salsa that I have ever had.  Order the Cruz Caddy Margarita - served by the glass, 1/2 carafe, or my favorite - the full carafe!  As for the menu, it is extensive and so hard just to choose ONE item!  My usual choice is the green chili adovada triple stacked enchilada smothered with green chili sauce and of course, topped with a fried egg!  OMG!  Really, you must try this place - you will not be disappointed!
