Signs of a great restaurant have never included the words "Fry's plaza and Great clips two doors down". Tutti Santi is a fantastic place for outstanding service and homemade pasta. We had the lasagna and linguine and clams. Happy hour beers were 3 bucks which is likely to change in the winter, but no big whoop. This visit will be the first of many.
