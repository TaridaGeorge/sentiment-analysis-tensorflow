Stopped in Scottsdale for a couple of nights on the way across the country and, thanks to you beautiful Yelpers, were guided to this trendy little spot.  Hands down the best restaurant of the trip, and we visited many fine establishments on our journey.  The cocktails were brilliant, and the food was not only cleverly prepared, but delicious, to boot.  I've noticed a few reviews lamenting their service.  We went mid-week so didn't have a problem with over-crowding or frazzled wait-staff.  The service was very friendly and attentive.  I look forward to visiting again on my next swing through AZ.
