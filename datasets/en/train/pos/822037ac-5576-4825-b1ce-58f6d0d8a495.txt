Love it!

The people are snarky in a cool way, they jab at you and if you play back you only get deeper into it! 
I always go for the Global Scent Company, but the turkey legs as bowling ball are also AWESOME! Tried the sheppard's pie and had a beer with it, really good too!
It can be pricey, but it is really worth it. I had my hair done at twisted sister, in like 7 minutes they had this elaborate braid in my head.
The jousts is great, the shows I prefer, but are PG-13 to R rated: Don Juan & Miguel, Ded Bob, Dexter Trip (some of his are G).
