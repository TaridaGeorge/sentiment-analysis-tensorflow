The breakfast they served us hit the spot like we hadn't expected. It is possible that their biscuits are the best I've ever had or can ever hope to have. My friend had blueberry pancakes that were so fresh the berries were falling out. I had an omelette made with country sausage. The omelette was very big and fluffy and yellow-- just the way eggs should be. I was afraid of having to wait long because of the other Yelp reviews, but we were eating less than 15 minutes after we arrived. If you're in South Mountain and want to eat breakfast for around $10/person in a place which feels like it could be on a beautiful little farm in the mid-west, come here. It's very lovely and a great way to start the morning on your weekends off from work with those you love.
