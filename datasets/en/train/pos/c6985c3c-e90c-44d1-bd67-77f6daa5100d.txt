A little hard to find and the exterior may throw you off but you would be making a HUGE mistake to not enter one of the best soul food gems in AZ. The staff is more amazing than the food and that is not an insult to the food but as a restaurant mangers view just as important. Friendly- funny- upbeat. Go early or you may have to wait outside. The word is out and its a 4 star place I will go back to.
