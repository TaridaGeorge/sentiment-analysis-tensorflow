Kim and I were at the trailhead just after sunrise. The Cactus Wrens and woodpeckers just sang to us. Real quiet is really quiet. We saw no one for 3 hours. As you move down into the canyon it becomes more 'red & gold'. If you take the trail until the intersection of the second water trail and come back its 7.6 miles roundtrip.   After the hike, we went to the Superstition Saloon for lunch. That is some hot chili.
