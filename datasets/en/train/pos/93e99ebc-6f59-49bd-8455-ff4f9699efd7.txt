I won't normally give 5 stars, I promise.

The Vig was the ideal way to end our night and final layer of the vodka sweater.

Our bartender, Logan was a delight!  Did we have a sign on our foreheads: serve these gals lots of vodka.  The grape invader or perpetrator was ridiculous.

The barkeep recommended we add tomato and basil to our order of grilled cheese: now that's love.

Vig never disappoints.  Although, where was George last night????
