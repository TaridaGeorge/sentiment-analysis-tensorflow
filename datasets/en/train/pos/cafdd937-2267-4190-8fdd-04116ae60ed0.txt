Yes, the place is busy every time I go there, and it takes 20 minutes or so to get your order
Yes, the inside is cheesy and cheap with folding tables and could definitely use a makeover
Yes, the location is...ummm...well lets just say its a "working class neighborhood"

BUT they've got the best fish tacos I've ever had, and everything on their Mexico City street food style menu is outstanding. The $1 tacos are "mini-tacos" so get 3 or 4 of them, a couple of fish tacos, maybe a side of rice and/or beans and you will be all set.

Go there. Just leave yourself plenty of time, it's well worth the wait.
