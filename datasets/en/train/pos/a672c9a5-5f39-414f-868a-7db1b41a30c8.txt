So glad to have found this little gem.  Best quiche I have ever had.  The texture and flavor were incredible.  They use only egg yolks and the eggs are fresh from local chickens, not the store bought variety.  

The fries and all of the sauces are sinfully good (amazing really) and the service was friendly and efficient.  I am definitely going back and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys superior food and service in a casual atmosphere.
