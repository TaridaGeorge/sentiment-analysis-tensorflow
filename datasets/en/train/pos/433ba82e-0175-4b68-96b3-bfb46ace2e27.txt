I have worked with several employment agencies in the past, but Renaissance Personnel Group is the best I have ever seen on so many levels!

I met with my Recruiter but also was introduced to several other members of the staff, including the Founder/President! The best thing is that they use a team approach to helping you find a job -- they are committed to working together to find the best job for you. Everyone I met was wonderful, professional and truly engaged in the process. I left my interview feeling so optimistic about the future.

I am truly looking forward to working with this amazing group!
