This was a great dining experience. Was in Phoenix for a conference and heard great things about NOCA. The menu changes daily. I had the skate which outstanding. The apps were also wonderful. I had the salmon and tried a bite of the soft shell crab salad. For dessert the sticky toffee pudding was amazing and the gelato trio was excellent. We tried the salted butter gelato which I thought was going to be gross but actually was pretty good, tasted like vanilla. The best part of the meal was the COTTON CANDY they brought before dessert. Amazing. The service was awesome and the experience was wonderful. Will come again next time I am in AZ....
