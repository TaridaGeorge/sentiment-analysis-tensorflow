If your in the mood to be around people in a nice atmosphere, and share great food this is the place, even though it could be a bit crowded at times, the place has a great "ambiance" i'm not into their sushi but their other dishes on the menu are great!  

I also find it a great spot to take a first date, i don't know why, but its my numero uno spot for dates! lol
