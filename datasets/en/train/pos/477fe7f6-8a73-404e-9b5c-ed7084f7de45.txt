We went during brunch/lunch time.  My husband had the breakfast kisra, and I had a honeydew martini and the strawberry and blueberry salad.  I *loved* my meal.  The drink was sweet and booze-y enough to get me slightly drunk, and the salad was perfect.  The dressing had just the right tanginess to it, and the lettuce and fruits were wonderfully flavorful.  I am so glad that we checked Yelp for places to eat in Phoenix - this was on the top of our list.  Usually I think we'd eat at some museum restaurant, so the way I see it is we paid about the same price (since museum restaurants are overpriced), but had a far better meal, and a drink!
