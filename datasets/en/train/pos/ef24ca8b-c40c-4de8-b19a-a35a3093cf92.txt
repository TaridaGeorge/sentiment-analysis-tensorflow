My family and I parked our asses at the breakfast bar after a 45 minute wait.  And had a perfect breakfast.

Ernie was delightful to chat with, but more importantly, the breakfasts were spot on.  Great cakes, great scramble, amazing chunky breakfast potatoes, and am I imagining it or did I get served a bloody mary?  Hey, a guy can dream.  :)
