LOVE this place! GREAT lunch specials! You get A LOT of food for less than 6 bucks, and it's DELICIOUS! Granted, they do give you small plate of lettuce with ranch dressing and call it a salad. BUT for less than 6 bucks you get delicious Chinese food, soup, and "salad." You STILL can't beat a lunch like that anywhere else.

As for dinner, it is a little pricy for their dinner plates. But I would say it's definitely worth it. You get enough food to last for two or three meals, and it's delicious!

I highly recommend this Gold Canyon restaurant!
