This spot has threads you can't find anywhere else in the valley.  The owners Kyle and Jeff are awesome;  they are very knowledgeable about fashion, art, music and culture, and have great taste.   Its not only a gallery of quality and tasteful clothing, but an art gallery as well.   They host many notable and prevalent artists work from around the world as well as the valley.  I highly recommend paying the place a visit.
