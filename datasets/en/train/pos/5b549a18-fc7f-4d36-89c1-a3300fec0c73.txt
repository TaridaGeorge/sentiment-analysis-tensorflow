The Library is Hooters better looking sister and the Tilted Kilt is their slutty cousin! It's a great place to watch any game. They have many HD's throughout and LCD's in their booths. It's a younger ASU crowd, but what would you expect. It's good to hang with the kids during school or visit during Spring Training. The staff is qualified enough to help with all your food and drink fantasies. If you get impatient, strike up a conversation or watch the tv, but don't take it out on the blonde bartender!
