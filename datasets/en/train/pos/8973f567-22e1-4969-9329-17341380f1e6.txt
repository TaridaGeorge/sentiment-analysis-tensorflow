My first trip to Chino's was the night of my Bachelorette party. The Jade Red Chicken changed my life. I believe there were a few police officers eating in the dining room with us - but I could be mistaken. It was a party dedicated to getting me drunk, so who knows. I do know that I have been back many times since and also LOVE the Emerald Chicken in a quesedilla.
