two words... " Rediculous son !! " ... finally a real BBQ spot thats warm and welcoming like back home.  I travel a lot and being from TX this is rare to find. They smoke their meats with a home made rub and its damn good.  To top it off, every one that works there is so helpful and energetic as hell.  I work in the west valley and we need these over here for real.  Great find and a must try, thanks gang
