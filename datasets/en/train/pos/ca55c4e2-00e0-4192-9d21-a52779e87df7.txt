This place is AMAZING. Better than Bellagio for half the price and in Phoenix.

Crab claws, prosciutto, wild boar bacon, the best gelato ever with many non-dairy options including prickly pear gelato.

The only minuses were new potatoes weren't done quite right. It seems like they fry them without pre-boiling them and the eclair was ok but the filling wasn't very good compared to Eclair in Europe. Still better than the Awful monster Eclairs at AJs though.
