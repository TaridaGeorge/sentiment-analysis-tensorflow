Named after the district in Kyoto that the owners are from, Shimogamo was our *best* Japanese meal in Phoenix during our one week there. It's a close call, with Nobuo and Yasu being quite comparable, but in the end, the umami palette was most refined at Shimogamo. The husband and wife team who own and run this place personally work everyday, ensure high standards for the overall dining experience; he works the dining area, and she is head chef in the kitchen. The highlight dishes were the Spanish Mackerel sashimi with the bones deep fried, the fine kelp soup with taroro, an outstanding delicate citrus miso dressing on the daikon radish & cucumber salad, the emaebi with spectacular deep fried heads, wild alaskan salmon and impressively fresh uni. Zach, the sushi chef, prepared everything very skillfully and was great to talk to.
