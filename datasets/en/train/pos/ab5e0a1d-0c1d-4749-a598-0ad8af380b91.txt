As far as indie record stores, this is truly as good as it gets in the valley.
It is a breath of fresh air because it is a REAL record store, and you can sample CD's along the wall to get your music fix.
I love how they have a list of recommended new releases. I definitely refer to them if my music is getting stale.
Recently, my husband and I have bought albums from Beirut, Andrew Bird and Iron & Wine. They have everything your heart desires- so go and get you some!

OH- and I just found out you can buy concert tickets there, and they usually give out a free "Magnet" magazine with each purchase. Woohoo!
