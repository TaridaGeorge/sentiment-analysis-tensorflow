I know that I love to write about resturants that I love. I love them, because I'm a regular and continue to go back to them. Basically, I'm a sucker for great food. 

I don't have the patience to wait for pizza at Pizzeria Bianco. I've been twice, and it was great, but the 4 hour wait was a bit much. And the pizza is fantastic...and worth it. But I don't have the time. 

I love the baked focaccia. I try and get to Pane early, as it goes quick! My favorite is their tuna. I found out that Chris Bianco purchases his tuna from a vendor that frequents the Phoenix Farmer's markets. But the vendor said that despite his supply, even he couldn't get his hands on the recipe for the fabulous Bianco tuna mixture that he prepares for his sandwiches and salads.

Enjoy!
