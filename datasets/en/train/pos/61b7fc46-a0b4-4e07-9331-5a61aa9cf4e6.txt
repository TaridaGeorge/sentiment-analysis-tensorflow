Breakfast doesn't get much better than this! My husband and I recently moved to Arizona and I was feeling a little homesick. A few friends of mine suggested we try eating at Butters Pancakes & Cafe, and I have to say I would stay here in AZ  just for the food alone! I tried the Scrambler with the Berry Bliss Pankcakes, which are both amazing! Every time we have family visit we bring them to Butters Pancakes & Cafe, and everyone is always very pleased. I have since gone back several times and am always happy with my food order. I have also tried the skillets (the chorizo one is a bit spicy), the breakfast burrito, and omelet. The portions are huge and prices are very reasonable. I usually end up taking food home. This will be your all time favorite for anyone who is a breakfast lover!
