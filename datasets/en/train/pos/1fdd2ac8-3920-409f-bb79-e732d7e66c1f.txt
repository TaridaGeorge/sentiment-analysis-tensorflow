I cannot get enough of Paris Envy!  It's the cutest little shop along 7th Avenue.
Laurie, the owner, is the sweetest gal and you can tell she loves what she does.  This boutique is the perfect place to find a unique gift, something pretty for your home or handmade jewelry.

Over the years I've purchased: silk throw pillows, earrings, a beautiful custom angel wing wall hanging (Laurie's business partner makes most of the furniture and other home decor), candles, multiple gifts, and on and on.

Stop by when you're in the area...you won't regret it!
