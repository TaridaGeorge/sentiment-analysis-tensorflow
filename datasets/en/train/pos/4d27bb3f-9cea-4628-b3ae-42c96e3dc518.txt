I am a huge fan of the original Tempe location of the CPC so was very happy to hear a while back that they were opening closer to Chandler in Mesa.

We arrived 2 hours after they opened and although some work was clearly still being done the service was as friendly and quick as ever.

The pasties were the same delicious taste of home that i have become addicted to and like the Tempe restaurant they have a great selection of beers.

The CPC is a breath of fresh air in an area full of chain restaurants and so I will be back for more pasties and beer for sure!

P.S This location has great outdoor seating for lazing the day away over a few beers with mates.
