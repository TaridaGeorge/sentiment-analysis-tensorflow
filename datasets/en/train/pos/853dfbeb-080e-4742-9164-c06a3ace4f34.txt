Wait times are reasonable. If you arrive and there is a line, they'll take your name and you can go run some errands and return without loosing your place. 

While they do attempt to up-sell you on product (come'on fellas, some of you need some help in this area), they are not pushy at all. 

Ask for either Aja or Tina, both are very friendly and professional and know how to give a haircut! Thanks.
