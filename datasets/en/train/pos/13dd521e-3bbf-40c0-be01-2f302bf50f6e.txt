We had a great time here and yes we dropped some coin. Its a fun casino, many interactive fun machines and also noticed they have additional events Lunar Black Light Bingo and other crazy stuff. I doubt I will return since  yes, we did drop coin! I had to drag my friends out of there which onlookers thought was hilarious, we were there for about 8 hours! Be careful, its a really fun place.
