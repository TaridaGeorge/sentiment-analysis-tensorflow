It only took 10 minutes at lunch and already we had the sneaking suspicion that this was a great place. Clean, neat, friendly and oh, the food! Like so many places in Phoenix Samarkand is not a treat from the outside, but the food is out of this world. The 4 of us had the lunch special at the recommendation of the one of us who had been there before (Oksana) - and that was a great decision. The main entree was lamb chops cooked in a unique and special way with wonderful spicing, on a bed of precious sweet rice and vegetables, plus dumplings and Russian beer - we were in heaven. We'll be back and report more, but this is a keeper - highly recommended and worth the drive, near 19th Ave and Dunlap.
