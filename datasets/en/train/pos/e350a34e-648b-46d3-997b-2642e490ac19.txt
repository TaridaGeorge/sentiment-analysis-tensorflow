I was really surprised to see that Crackers only has a 3.5 star rating here. I've only been twice, so take it for what it's worth, but both times I had really positive experiences. 

Crackers uses good portions of great ingredients. I had a steak sandwhich, which had tons of steak, delicious onions and peppers, plenty of cheese, and probably half an avacado. I definitely recommend this plate, but more importantly I think it's indicative of how they prepare food. My girlfriend had some variation of a French Dip- same story.

Service was consistent and food was timely. Prices are reasonable, you're going to be out around $10 for a plate of food, drink, and left overs.

Unfortunately no booze here.
