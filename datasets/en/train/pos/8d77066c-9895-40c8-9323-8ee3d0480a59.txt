Best Japanese restaurant in Phoenix. Tip: don't get their sushi rolls there, that's kid's stuff. Order from within the menu, or from the tapas menu ($5 items). I recommend the agedashi tofu and kurobuta sausage skewers!

Food comes in somewhat small portions so I wouldn't recommend coming here with more than 4 people if you plan on stuffing yourself. 
I visited here last weekend for my birthday and got the saikyo beef tongue, garlic manila clams, kurobuta sausage, grilled bronzino (Mediterranean sea bass), grilled squid, and a few other things I honestly can't quite remember. Food came out really quick--maybe in under 10 minutes? They also spaced out the time between platters of food to ensure that we'd all enjoy each plate one by one. 

I appreciate their take on Japanese cuisine, as most places only offer bentos and maki rolls, which gets boring after a while.
