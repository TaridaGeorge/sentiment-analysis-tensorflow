After being on the phone with Verizon Wireless trying to figure out why my phone wasn't working for 4.5 hours, I was put in touch with Sharpie Tech. Well, after 10 seconds they fixed the problem. As the owner of a company that does our best numbers over the holiday season, having my phone out of order for 4.5 hours was horrible. Sharpie Tech fixed the problem in record time, even Verizon was shocked. I highly recommend working with this company and I look forward to working with them more.
