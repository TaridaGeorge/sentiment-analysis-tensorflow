These guys really know what they are doing, I've had bad experiences in the past from the "geek squad" people. The people at Redseven  know what's up. They are very knowledgeable and each time I go in there, they are looking to help me out rather then get me to buy something I don't need.

I recommend them to all my friends and family, you should do the same.
