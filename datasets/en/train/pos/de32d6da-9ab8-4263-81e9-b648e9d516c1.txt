This place is really our favorite Thai restaurant in Phoenix area by far. The corn fritter appetizer is so yummy and I love their pad thai, which I usually get vegetarian with tofu. I have not had any veggie pad thai that is better anywhere else!  Wish it were closer to us, we'd go a lot more often if it was.
