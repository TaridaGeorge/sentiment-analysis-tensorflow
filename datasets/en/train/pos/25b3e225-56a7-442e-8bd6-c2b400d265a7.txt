I have eaten at Big Wa twice now & love it! I don't normally eat a lot of Chinese food but, from now on I will be eating it at Big Wa. The portions are a great size for the price & the price is right. My kids were even happy with their food. They did a great job accommodating our large party as well! Great job Big Wa!
