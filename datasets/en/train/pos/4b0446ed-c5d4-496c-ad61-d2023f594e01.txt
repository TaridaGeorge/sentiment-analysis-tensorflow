This review is long overdue...

I brought a friend into Petit Fromage last month on a national holiday of sorts - 4/20.  Lara took the time to put together a hand selected range of fromage to appease our palates.  There were lavendar hinted, coffee rubbed, and black pepper infused delicacies.  I knew that I should have taken notes, dammit, I don't know the names of the small farms that she directly sources from or the names of the cheese.  We took the selections to my home, with presecco and bread from La Grande Orange (in the 'hood).  Perfect for a late afternoon lunch!  We even had some left over for the next days lunch.  

While perusing the shop, we noticed many cheeses priced accordingly - $4.20.  It is the little things....
