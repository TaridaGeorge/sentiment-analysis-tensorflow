My wife and I heard about this new cinemasuites thing at a christmas party. So we decided to go check it out. It was totally worth the drive to get there. All guests at the cinemasuites have to be over 21yrs old. The seats are all leather lazy boys with electronic recliners. You have a button to push for service, and there are drink menus and food. Its like being first class on an airplane only better! Movies before Noon are 9$ and movies after noon are 12$. Not too bad for such an experience!!
