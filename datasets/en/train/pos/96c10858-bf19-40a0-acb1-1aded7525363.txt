Gay cowboys, rambunctious line dancing, and $5 pitchers of beer. I really don't know what else I could ask for! It's a good place to drink copious amounts and channel your inner dancing queen without judgement. (Trust me, regardless of what you're doing/wearing, you CANNOT compete with that 6'2" drag queen grinding against the mirror.) 

As a woman, I like going to a bar where I don't have to worry about drunk losers trying to hit on me. If you like country music, get here before midnight. Otherwise, club music starts at 12 and that's when the top 40s playlist will start going...think Lady Gaga, Beyonce, etc. 

Just be prepared. It's a loud, big, gay bar, and the men here are brave. People rip off their shirts and start getting pretty wild on the dance floor. If you can handle that, you'll have a good time.
