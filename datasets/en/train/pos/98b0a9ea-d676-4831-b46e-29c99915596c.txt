This is tucked away behind a bank and a Red Robin restaurant.  But this is a great hidden treasure.  The Pineapple Pork Fried Rice and the Yellow Curry was out of this world.  I have wanted to go back to this restaurant now every day afterward for more.  

Great service, great atmosphere, great prices, great food.  

This is now on my rotation for restaurants to go to when I want quality, large proporations, and close to home.
