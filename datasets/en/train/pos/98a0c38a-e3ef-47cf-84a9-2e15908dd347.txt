This is by far my  most favorite Turkish place. I have been to this place countless number of times and was never disappointed. In fact, now that I don't stay in Tempe anymore, I always make it a point to visit this place whenever I go to Tempe. 

I  love their chicken kabob platter. Chicken skewers are always perfectly marinated and moist. I also love their rice, pita, garlic dip and salad served on the side. I have tried falafel and chicken gyro sandwiches as well and those were pretty good, too. I would highly recommend this place if you happen to be in Tempe downtown.
