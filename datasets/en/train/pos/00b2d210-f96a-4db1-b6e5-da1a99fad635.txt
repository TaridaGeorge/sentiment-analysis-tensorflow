I was in old town Scottsdale today so I decided to find a place to park around 5th Ave and make my way over to Cowboy Ciao for lunch. I ordered the exotic mushroom pan fry one of the signature lunch dishes.

This dish has allot of mushrooms so you need to be a mushroom lover it has cremini, shiitake and grilled portabellini mushrooms the only mushrooms missing in this dish are the psychedelic and hallucinogenic ones. It also has avocado, tomato, cotija cheese with ancho chile cream sauce over double-cooked polenta, I was very impressed this dish was amazing. 

The hostess and waitress where very friendly and attentive throughout the meal so I give this place a 5 star rating for excellent food and attention to detail.
