we popped in today while in the area, and copped some cookies and cupcakes. Now I don't really eat sweets much, but wifey wanted to go and how can I say no to that face....

I ended up getting this chocolate chip cookie that looks like it's mixed with oatmeal and some other stuff, can't wait to eat it. I also got a Carrot cupcake that's suuuuper good. I also got a chery cookie that my son and I absolutely loved, it tasted like a great cherry scone.  If you need some good cookies in this part of town, you've found your spot....now I just needs me some milk
