I had Harvest Design Group completely renovate my back yard.  Actually, renovation isn't the word.  They totally TRANSFORMED my back yard from a weedy, dirt lot to a beautiful oasis!  As usual, Todd was responsible, and professional.  When an unforeseen 'glitch' arose with an electrical line that was not to code, the crew took extra time to ensure the new line was done properly.  He met with me several times so I knew how the project was progressing, kept his timeline, and there were no surprises with the budget.  My yard is absolutely beautiful!!
