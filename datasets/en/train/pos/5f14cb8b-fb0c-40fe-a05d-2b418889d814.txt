-$3.99 basic drive-thru car wash (they have upgrades available).

-Today was a FREE car air freshener with upgraded car wash.

-FREE use of the car vacuum and FREE use of the floor mat cleaning machine. 

-A good place to clean out all of the burger wrappers and dried up fries under the car seats.

-Entrance/Exit is on 35th Ave (quick right turn if heading south).

-Cash or credit card accepted at self-paying machine.

-Friendly employee (there is usually someone spraying soapy suds on your car as they direct you onto guided car wash track).

-I like that this place is self-service, offers complimentary car cleaning amenities, and is clean.
