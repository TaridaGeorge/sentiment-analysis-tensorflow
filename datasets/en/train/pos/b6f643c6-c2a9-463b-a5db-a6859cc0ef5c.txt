I only have time for a short review...YUM-2-THE-EEE!!!!! Seriously I am a mussel fanatic and Eric delivers! I need to do a separate review just for the mussels. The white truffle pizza with wilt your socks off as you become Butta on the floor. However, the cheese sauce for his stuffed mushrooms wrapped in prosciutto was orgasmic. I started eating it with a spoon like soup, then grabbed the damn little serving bowl and drank it, like it was the last drop of water on earth, then I think I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand all while moaning, "Make this into a soup, paaaleeeaazzzzzzzze!" Thank God my daughter wasn't with, embarrassing. However, she got lamb chops delivered and after devouring them says, "Those will change your life." Love this little spot so much! Thanks Eric and staff. It was like meeting old cozy friends again.
