Mark came to our house to give us a quote on sunscreens, insect screens and a screen for the sliding glass doors. I was so pleased to get an email the day before the appointment reminding me of it. Mark was extremely knowledgeable and took the time to educate us. He gave us plenty of options and was straightforward with pricing. 

We took a couple days to think about it and do price comparison. Amerizona had competitive pricing and we liked their service the best. So we completed our order over the phone. A few days later, someone came out to do measurements. Then a few weeks after that someone else came out to install our screens. All the workers were professional and quick.

The product is high quality. We're very pleased! I would definitely used Amerizona again.
