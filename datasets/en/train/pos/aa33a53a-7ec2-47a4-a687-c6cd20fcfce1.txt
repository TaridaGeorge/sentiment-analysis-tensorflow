I don't drink but my friends do however I really dig this place. I went last night for the second time and enjoyed my visit. I sat outside with some friends as they drank wine from a very large menu to choose from. There is a variety of food to choose from to compliment the wine or for those who feel like eat a good meal. Our table started off with some cheeses and salmon. Along with some fresh burchetta that is by far the best I have tasted in a long time. This is a great place to hang out for hours and chat with friends while drinking a glass of wine.
