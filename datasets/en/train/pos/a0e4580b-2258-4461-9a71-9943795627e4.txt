This place is like the happiest place on earth for me and Sandee.
I luv coming here.  So does Oprah so it has to be good, right?
Even the smallest casita is 550 sq. feet.
It has a great bed, a fabulous bathroom and an equally fabulous
living area with a fireplace.
If i could afford to, i'd be here every weekend.
The only time i can afford it is off season.
Once i stayed here and it was so hot we had to wait to go walking until well after 9 p.m.  the grounds are gorgeous and perfect for a midnite stroll through the property.  
But if you wanna make sherri happy, take her here :):)
