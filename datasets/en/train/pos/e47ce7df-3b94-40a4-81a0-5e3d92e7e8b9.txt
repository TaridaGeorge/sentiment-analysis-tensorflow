This is the oldest bar is scottsdale.  Its great fun, however it gets a little douchey on the weekends and holidays.  i actually saw a fight on xmas. (who gets into a fight on christmas?)  anyways absolute best place to go after a spring training game, they have an outdoor grill and cook up some nasty frozen burger pattys, but after sitting in the sun all day with a beer in your hand they are perfect.  hurry up march i need some baseball and coach house !!!  oh and the bathrooms are....... pungent.  DO NOT WEAR SANDALS
