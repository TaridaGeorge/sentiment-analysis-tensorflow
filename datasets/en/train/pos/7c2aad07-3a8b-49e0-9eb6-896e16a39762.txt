Overeasy is Fabulous! My partner and I both had the wolfpack and split an order of sourdough toast. The hash browns were PERFECT!!! Soft and crunch, not burnt! The eggs were cooked well and there was cheese a plenty! The toast had a great flavor and was hand sliced! The fresh squeezed OJ was great not too tart not too sweet!
