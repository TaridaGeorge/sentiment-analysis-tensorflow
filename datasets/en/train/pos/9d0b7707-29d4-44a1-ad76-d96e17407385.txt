Was looking for a good hamburger so reviewed Yelp and saw Rocket Burger. Went in on Saturday and I see why they get the great reviews. Great fresh burger and good bun. Service was great as I was asked twice by whom I assume was owner or manager how food was and if I needed anything else. My wife and I loved this place and will be back next weekend.
