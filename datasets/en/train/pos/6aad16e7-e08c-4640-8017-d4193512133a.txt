I can't say enough great things about this place. 

First of all they had me at FRIED PICKLES! I mean c'mon, they nailed it! The burgers are made just the way YOU want it, with toppings, and sauces galore to choose from. Plain and simple, one of the best burger spots in Scottsdale, and I have absolutely nothing but great things to say about it. 

A MUST TRY, if you're in the neighborhood!
