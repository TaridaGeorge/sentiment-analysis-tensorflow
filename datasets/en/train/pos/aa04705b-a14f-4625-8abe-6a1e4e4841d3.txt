This was a great steak.  I got their signature bone-in filet and it was fabulous.  Cooked perfectly, monstrously thick cut.  Excellent.  We had a nice bottle of wine and split salads and sides between the group.  It was pricey, about $100 per person, I think.  We also had several beers, as this was a bachelor party dinner, just to give you an idea of what we got for the money.  We were all full and satisfied at the end.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a top end steakhouse.  

They have a nice bar area too with tons of beautiful women.  Not a bad place to hang out while you're waiting for your table.
