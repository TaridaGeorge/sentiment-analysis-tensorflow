This review is specifically about telegraph pass, on the ahwatukee side of the mountain... One of my favorite hikes. It is short enough to where it doesn't take much time to get to the end, but steep enough closer up top to where you feel like you got a bit of a workout. You can also continue up the road to another trail and get even higher and sit in the gazebo up top for an even better view. 

The people here are also very nice. They all respect the land and most have very good hiking manners, unlike many other trails in the greater Phoenix area.
