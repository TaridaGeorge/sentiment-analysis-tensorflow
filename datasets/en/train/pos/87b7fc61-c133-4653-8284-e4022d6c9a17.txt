Love their marinated shrimp that you grill on your table.  Then take it, along with fresh Vietnamese veggies and wrap up to make your own rice paper roll (or summer roll).  Delicious!!!

Good pho too.  When I still ate meat, their grilled pork chops over rice was sooo good.

Go there with a group so you can order lots of dishes to try.

Service can sometimes be slow---not the place to go for lunch if you're in a hurry.  The wait staff mean well & are good people.
