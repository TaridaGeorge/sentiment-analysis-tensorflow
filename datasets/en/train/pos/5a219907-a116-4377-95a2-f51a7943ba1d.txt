Joe's is about as pretty as a picnic basket in the grass! They have a wonderful pastoral outdoor seating area. The inside is redneck delux. Big Long Booths, soft lighting and a John Deer Tractor. 

I always get the Pulled Pork Sandwich or the pecan smoked turkey when I come here. They make really good Beans and the cheese potato thing they have is good as well.

They sell old-fashioned sodas in glass bottles, which I love. 

The dining room is HUGE and this place could easily accomodate a LARGE party

The food is served cafeteria style, but the quality of the food is way beyond.
