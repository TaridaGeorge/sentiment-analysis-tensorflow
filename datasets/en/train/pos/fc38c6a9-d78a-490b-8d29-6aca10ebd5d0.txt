Wow!! I Just Got My Nails Done Here And Let Me Tell You It's Amazing. Before They Didn't Do Shellacs But Now They Do!!! For Shellac Plus Manicure It's $30 But Just A Gel Polish Change It's $20. For Their Gelish It's $25 With Manicure Or $15 For Gel Polish Change. Removal Of Gel Only Is $5 
Other Places I Go To Charge $35 For Shellac And $5 Removal. So In A Way You'd be Saving More Money Coming To Top Design. 
As For Their Service, They Are Really Nice! Give Great Messages, And Just Really Excellent Overall. They Are Friendly And Act Like You're Part Of The Family. They Also Do Waxing And Alterations Here! 
I Love It Soo Much Here I'll Probably Always Come Back Here. By Far The Best Nail Salon I've Been Too :)
