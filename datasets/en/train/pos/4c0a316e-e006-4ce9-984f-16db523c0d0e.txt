It's a great mall with a lot of variety, but save your sanity and either park underground (after 5 on weekdays or anytime on weekends) or around back. This place is always busy!! I've seen many stores come and go but they have all the basics plus some high end stuff if that's your thing. 
Harkins theater is also inside and their food court actually has a couple healthy options.
