This sandwich place makes for an excellent lunch.  The Valley has more than one location, but this is the one I frequented the most. Fantastic sandwiches!  My favorite is the Improv, which is a turkey sandwich filled with cranberry sauce and herbed stuffing, but I have also enjoyed their Reuben, their roast beef sandwich (called the Van Gogh), and have ordered on numerous occasions a grilled cheese made to my specifications.  The food is always consistently good, and meals come with a cookie.  They have a great selection of iced teas.  My favorite is their Market Spice, which is cinnamon flavored.  This location is close to ASU's Tempe campus, so if coming for lunch try to get there a little before noon, in order to avoid the crowds.
