As someone who used to play the violin I really appreciate this place. I was most recently here at Christmas seeing The Nutcracker Ballet with my boyfriend. Thanks for coming with me baby! :) They usually feature a mixture of orchestra concerts, ballets, operas, and musical performances. Coming here is a great way to support the Arts in Arizona, and I have never been less than amazed by the performances they put on here. Located in the heart of downtown Phoenix, The Symphony would make a great cultured date or place to bring an out of towner. 

P.S The new Nutcracker was brilliant, check it out next Xmas you won't be disappointed!
