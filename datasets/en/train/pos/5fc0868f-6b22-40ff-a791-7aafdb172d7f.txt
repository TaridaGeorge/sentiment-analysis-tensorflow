Seriously... every city in America should be equipped with at least 5 QT's. I have caught myself on more than one occasion raving to friends in other cities about them, and while realizing I must sound completely ridiculous, I'm also realizing they haven't gotten to experience a QuickTrip!
I love that they offer fresh brewed iced tea, huge cup sizes, 3 different kinds of ice, a million types of sodas, amazing coffee drinks, yummy individual iced cakes, and cheap gas. Their milkshakes and smoothies are my favorite though.
