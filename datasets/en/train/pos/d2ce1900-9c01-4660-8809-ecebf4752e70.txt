Awesome. Being from So Cal, I have high standards when it comes to Chicken and Waffles (Yay Roscoes!) Lo-Lo's delivered. Great chicken, yummy waffles and kool-aid served in a Mason Jar. The staff was very friendly and a lot of fun.  You really can't go wrong. 

Oh and according to a flyer they have a $399 Bereavement Special Package. This seriously made my trip.
