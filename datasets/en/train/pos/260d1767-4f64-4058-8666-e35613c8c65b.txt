Coffee smells great and tasted even better!!! LOVED the challah bread french toast.  My friend and I shared the apple with brandy and it was simply the best EVER!!!!  It's HUGE and so tasty with coffee that it made our day!  The bacon was cooked perfectly (crispy, not greasy, smoky, hickory, sweet/tangy) and liked the eggs too.  

Great place for breakfast!!!!  They also have a firepit with great seating outside.  Too bad it was a bit chilly but we enjoyed eating inside and looking out the windows.  Lots of natural light and friendly staff.
