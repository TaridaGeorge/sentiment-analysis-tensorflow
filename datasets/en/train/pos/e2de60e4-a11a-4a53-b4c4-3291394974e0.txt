The BBQ pork is fantastic but here's their best kept secret .... 

CATFISH YUM! 

This location serves Catfish fillets on Thursday and Friday. I wish it was everyday! They use a deliciously seasoned cornmeal NO flour! It is light and crisp and my fav! It is served with a great hot sauce and sweet moist dinner rolls. Fries and Cow-bro beans go great but you have your choice of sides. If you love a good catfish in cornmeal, I dare you to find any better in this town without making it yourself. I give Honey Bears 10 stars for their catfish **********. I grew up in the Midwest and we had catfish almost every Friday and this tastes just like home. 

Trust you will not regret this fish!
