If you are interested in having the best sushi in valley.  This Japanese owned and operated restaurant is for you.    

My mother in law lives in Japan comes back to visit once a year and she always insists on coming to Hiro, because she remembers it as being most similar to sushi in Japan.   

In Japan, my inlaws don't actually order food.  They simply let the Sushi chef choose what he feels like feeding us.  If you operate under this principle at Hiro Sushi, prices will augment.
