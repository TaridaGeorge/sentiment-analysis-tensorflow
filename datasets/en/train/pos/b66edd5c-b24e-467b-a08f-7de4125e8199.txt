Visited the restaurant on a Thursday for a nice quite time in a small quaint restaurant. Being vegetarians we were initially concerned about having vegetarian options. However we were pleasantly surprised with various available veggie options - the vegetarian platter is definite must have! The fried banana/plaintain and guava juice were very good. Service was very good. The complimentary chips and salsa were also very fresh. Visit this place not for an upscale experience - but more for a warm cozy time in a small family owned restaurant with good fresh tasty spicy food, reasonable prices and friendly patient service. It was our first experience with Peruvian food and we were very happy with the suggestions that the owner/manager gave us. The best tip - feel free to experiment you won't regret it!
