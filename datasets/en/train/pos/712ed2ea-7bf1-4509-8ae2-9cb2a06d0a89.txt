A separate gluten-free menu always wins me over. What's more, the food (spicy chicken) was really delicious, which is somewhat unexpected for GF. The sauce was based on sweet and sour and was just the right amount of spicy.

More choices involving the use of GF soy sauce (it's out there) would have me eating there more often. The dishes on the GF menu are limited, but at least they have some, I guess, so I'm thankful; it's a start.
