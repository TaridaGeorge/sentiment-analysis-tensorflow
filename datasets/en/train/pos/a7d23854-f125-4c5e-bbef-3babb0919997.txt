Diana (one of the owners) is FANTASTIC.  This is one of those best kept secret places.  Really GREAT place.  Smaller - which is a nice change - clean, modern, inviting but yet with a fun retro feel.  All ages feel welcome and comfortable here.  Arcade games and those great grabber stuffed animal machines too!  Only suggestion would be to offer some grilled chicken tenders or something for those needing to be more health conscious (Snacks are typical deep fried or candy bars/chips type).  Diana cares about the business and customers and it shows... and it makes for a great customer experience that is worthy of repeating again and again!
