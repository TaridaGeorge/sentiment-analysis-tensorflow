Visiting Scottsdale for the first time and were taken here to dinner by cousins.  Found the atmosphere impressive - trendy, yet casual.  I had a fabulous dinner salad with chicken, whose name escapes me (their website doesn't list the menu and is useless, so no help there).  

The service was top-notch, though the waiter was really pushing the carrot cake.  I would've loved to try it, but I wasn't paying and our hosts weren't offering.

All in all, it was a terrific experience.  If I lived in Scottsdale, I'd be a regular.  Now how about opening one in Vegas?
