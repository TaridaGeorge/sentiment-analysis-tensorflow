Have been to this downtown gem twice now.  Once for a late lunch visit and another time for an evening rendezvous.  What a pleasure!  First, the place is magnificent inside.  Has a very classy and almost sensual feel to it.  The huge purple "tongue"couch that looks out the main window begs for you to sit in it!  The bathrooms are super cool!  

The food and service were equally incredible.  The bar plate is excellent and the house salad was the best we have ever had.  Try the onion strings!  The Mrs. LOVES the Peach Porch Tea.

During the day the music was great in setting an enjoyable atmosphere...jazzy and classical stuff.  The DJ was playing some funky cool stuff the night we stopped in for drinks and a snack.

We are due for a third visit.  Need to try some of the sandwiches next
