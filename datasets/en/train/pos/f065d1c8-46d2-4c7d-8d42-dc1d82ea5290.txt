Wildfish is fantastic...the service was excellent only surpassed by the quality of food. My wife and I love the scallops and their shrimp cocktail is a classic but fantastic! We made a reservation and they take the time to pass your name to team so you always addressed as "Mr and Mrs XYZ"...makes you feel special like a visiting political VIP or something! The place is beautiful and I highly recommend it! SO TASTY!
