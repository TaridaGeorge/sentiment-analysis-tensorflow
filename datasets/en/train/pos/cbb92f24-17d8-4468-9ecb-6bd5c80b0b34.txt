Loved, Loved, Loved this place!  Hubs and I went here for date night yesterday and have nothing but great things to say about this restaurant.

We shared everything and had the duck fajitas, catfish, green chili mac and cheese, and the "mushroom" bread pudding.  All of it tasted so good, and it was nice to have something different, but also just pure comfort food at it's finest.  We were especially impressed with the bread pudding, which actually has mushrooms in it!  Our waiter was nice enough to bring some of them out for us to smell, and they smelled just like the wonderfully sweet dessert we had just eaten.

Renegade was a great dining experience.  A tad expensive, but well worth it!!!  Go and enjoy some inventive, tasty cuisine!
