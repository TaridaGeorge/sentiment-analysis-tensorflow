This is the best pan-Asian supermarket I've ever been to. It's a massive labyrinth of goods from Korea, Japan, Indonesia, and other countries that will overwhelm the senses in such a good way.

Lee Lee is an adult Toys R' Us for us Asian food aficionados. Do check out their huge fruit and vegetable selection, a massive frozen foods aisle with yummy exotic ice creams and frozen breads, spices a go go, and more types of noodles and rice than you can shake a chopstick at.

One of my favorite sections in Lee Lee is the cooking gear aisle. Here you can find Vietnamese coffee makers, ladles, pots, pans, woks, bowls, plates, and every kitchen implement imaginable. All very affordable.

My secret fantasy is to rent out the attic of Lee Lee's and move in permanently. Lee Lee's rocks!
