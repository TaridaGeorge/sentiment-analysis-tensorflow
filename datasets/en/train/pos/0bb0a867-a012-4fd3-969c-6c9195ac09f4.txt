My wife and I saw a musical here and loved the theatre. Loved the atmosphere. The grounds outside are beautiful. My wife is a photographer and uses the grounds for family pictures and other shoots. We actually had our engagement pictures taken here when it first opened. Defiantly worth a stop by to walk around the grounds, especially at night, it looks so cool at night. Because of this place, Mesa gets an extra star, its now up to 3 stars (how i wish we could review cities :)
