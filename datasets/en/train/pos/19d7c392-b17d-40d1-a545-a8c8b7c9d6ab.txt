A nice ambiance, tucked away downtown.  Like another person said, great outdoor seating and not too crowded.  The food was great, too.  I ordered the Turkey Club and it was delicious.  I also got a chocolate chip cookie which was also awesome.  I'd like to go back and try the specialty sodas and some more deserts.
