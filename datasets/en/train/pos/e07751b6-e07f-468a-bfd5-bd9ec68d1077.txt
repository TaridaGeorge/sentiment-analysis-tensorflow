I usually whine and complain about places, but I can't with this place.. Great service the ten or so times I've been there. Portions are huge, my two girls and I can share two orders and still have left overs. I love the fresh hand pull noodles.. The prices and varieties are great, for those who rated one or two stars I really think you need to give this place another shot.. 

I usually have the beef with fried noodles, dumplings. It is all good at a great price.
