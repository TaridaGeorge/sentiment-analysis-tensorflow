Never heard of firehouse subs before they got here to Queen Creek, but I am now a raving fan.  I have to be honest, I can't get myself to try anything other than the smoked brisket and cheddar sub ... it's just too damn good to stray.  I like how they give the kids lots of options and give them free fireman hats - kids love that and it makes for a good time, but I digress ... back to the business at hand.  The brisket is melt in your mouth good and the BBQ sauce is perfect combo of sweet and tangy.  I absolutely put this sandwich on my top 5 of all time.  TRY IT!!
