Wonderful food here -- definitely one of my favorite places in the valley.  I really dig the decor.  There's a very large framed mirror hanging on one of the walls, and the other walls are decorated with art by local artists (for sale).

In nicer weather it's nice to chill outside on the patio next to the "lake."

My favorites are the cilantro-jalepeno hummus, garlic potatoes, lentil fattoush salad (the best dang dish on the menu!), and one thousand beans.  The veggie wraps and falafels are also good choices.
