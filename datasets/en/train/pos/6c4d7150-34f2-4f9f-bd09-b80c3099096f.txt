Yes it is expensive. Period. 

However, the food is on point. All my meals; appetizers, wine,  salad, soup, steak was more than solid. The only reason I give them 4 stars is because you enter through the kitchen when you valet. Nothing really bad, just that it could be adjusted to route customers another direction. 

I will be going back over and over and over...
