Yes, Maggiano's is a chain, and yes it's a big-box Italian restaurant in a town with quite a few mom-and-pop Italian joints--but my-oh-my can they cook some great Italian food!  Being based out of Chicago certainly doesn't hurt.

Little lady and I had a great family style dinner here when my folks were in town, and absolutely everything was fantastic.  I'm pretty sure I came within a couple bites eating myself to death (think Monty Python's The Meaning of Life).

For weekend dining, I highly recommend reservations and request a booth which will put you above and away from the main floor (I do feel they pack a few too many tables in the available space).  This made the meal all the more enjoyable.

Make sure to leave a day open for digestion!
