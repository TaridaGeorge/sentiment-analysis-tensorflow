Amazing ..... picture this- moving from KY, 3rd floor apt, husband had sprained his ankle, a 6 by 12 Uhaul trailor filled& we knew no one! I found this company on the internet & they were available last minute(literally). Very professional, hard working, fun, fast, careful and safe! We were very pleased with how fast they got all those rubbermaids & furniture up those 40 steps! We will use them again & we recommend them highly! Give yourself a break& hire these guys!!!!!:-)
