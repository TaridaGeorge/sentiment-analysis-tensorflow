We ended up going here on a whim, we live less than a mile from it and drive by it daily. The menu was huge, the service was great, and the food was WONFERFUL! They put a twist on the usual everyday bar food and make things new and delicious. When we first walked in I was worried if the place was kid friendly, but it totally was, the kids choices were perfectly priced and portioned. We also came here with some beer savvy friends who were blown away by the beer selection. so all in all, we love this place!!
