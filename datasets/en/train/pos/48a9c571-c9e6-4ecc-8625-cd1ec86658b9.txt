If you haven't been here, you're really missing on something special.  Many friends who have left town make sure to go here on return visits.

For those that don't know, a pasty is essentially a gourmet hot pocket.  They've got everything from standard meat and potatoes to a thanksgiving pasty with all the fixings, and plenty more.  The only pasty I didn't like was one with an ingredient I don't like, so I can't blame them.  I'm not even sure if they have other food, because I always get a pasty or two.

The beer selection is good, and the staff are great and very friendly.  The only downside is that this place is cramped and it can be hard to find a seat at times; there's only one table that can accommodate a crowd (+ the bar).  I hear the new location is better in this regard.
