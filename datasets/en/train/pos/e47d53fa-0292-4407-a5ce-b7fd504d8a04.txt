Koltton Fox is a great technician.  I've been going to him for waxing for years. He is maticulous and is a true expert - he's also a really nice guy. His website makes it easy to schedule an appointment and he's always on time. I've referred family and friends to him and no one has ever been disappointed.  I've also had a facial and it was well worth the price.  I highly recommend Koltton.
