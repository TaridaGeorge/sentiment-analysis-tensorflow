I live for riding bikes !!! This is my top shop for nearly 15 years! These guys are on point all day everyday. Well, Eh ya know a few times ive been in when the guys were on their periods, but all in all they are pretty much the best. Gawd can I tell you about the time I waited an eon for my parts? Eh no, never...maybe a little extra patience once or twice but nothing the main man Peter didnt take care of asap, nbd. Thanks guys you pretty much rock my bike world! These leggs will love you for life even though I make em get in the car & drive to you all the way from dt Phoenix. See you soon in real life off the inter-webbs :)
