I love this place.  This restaurant has been in a strip mall where things have come and gone for a loooong time, and its because they are doing everything right.  It's a quiet, laid back little place.  The service is good, even when they are very busy.  The food is amazing, especially if you are a vegetarian (although I hear the meat combinations are very good too).  I definitely recommend going with a few people and getting one of the combinations so you can try different things, the portions are very generous.  I've been to other restaurants where I didn't like the injera, had a wierd spongey texture, but here it is wonderful.
