Never have I ever had a craving as much
as the soy coconut latte's they make in a clutch
the donuts are vegan
but I cannot eat them
because my stomach hates gluten a touch.

They carry cool clothes
and crowds come in droves
on First Friday where their location is key.

This poem doesn't really rhyme
I hope you don't mind,
a true poet I never will be

But I do like to bake
so watch out for my vegan cakes
Conspire, please buy them from me

Sure the baristas are hippies
and its not always quickie
but the taste is delicious
perhaps even nutritious
Conspire you've sure got MY vote
