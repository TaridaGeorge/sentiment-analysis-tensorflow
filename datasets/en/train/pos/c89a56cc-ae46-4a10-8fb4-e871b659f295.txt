This is a great destination for lunch and for taking your out of town guests.  Take the $5 30 minute tour and learn a ton about the olive oil industry and process.  The food is fantastic and in the fall and spring sitting in the gardens is very relaxing.  They have the best olive oil and you'll find yourself debating on how many to buy - I highly recommend the garlic olive oil and use the chili olive oil for your eggs!  I've been at least 5 times and always find something new.
