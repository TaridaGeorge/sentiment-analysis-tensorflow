We love love love Cajun style seafood. Not too many Cajun places around in Phoenix. The food was simple, yet delicious. We had the shrimp boil and the seafood creole. I ordered mine 10/10 spiciness and it was perfect. It's so awesome to finally find a restaurant that will make food very spicy when you ask them to. The chef was pleasant and very educational. He even shared some recipes with us. Not too much seating though, since it's in the corner of the casino. What a great find! Definitely going back.
