I would love to keep this short and to the point. Press is amazing! Such a unique concept of Coffee meets Wine with a friendly, relaxed atmosphere! I tend to go every Sunday morning to read the paper, a drink and some good. Try the  Iced Toddy, which is their version of Iced Coffee and is specially brewed to not be watered down. This drink makes Starbucks taste like water, and ever since, I can not bring myself to go back to Starbucks (not that their coffee was good anyway). 

The staff is so friendly- after going just a few short times, they know your name and what you like to eat and drink. 

Try the Steal-cut Oatmeal or Breakfast Burritos! 

You will absolutely fall in love with Press... and it's dog friendly too! Woof!
