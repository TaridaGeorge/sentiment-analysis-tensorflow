My friend first took me here soon after it opened. Since then I've been hooked. I looooooove the food. My husband and I frequented often during the cooler months (Pasties are definitely a winter meal!). 

I'm a big fan of "The Pilgrim" and "Shepard's Pie". The crowd is low-key and casual and the staff are friendly and accommodating. The only gripe I have is that sometimes the wait can be extremely long. I'm sure a part of it is prep and cook time, but sometimes I feel as though I've been forgotten about. Ordering out takes care of this and it also keeps you from having to wait for a seat during the lunch rush.

So glad to see local businesses like this introduce new food and culture to the mix.
