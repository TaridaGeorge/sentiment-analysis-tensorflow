Oh Changing Hands...we go way back. I remember climbing the ladder in your store on Mill Ave. when I was a child. 

I'm an avid book-worm and I always go to Changing Hands when I need something to read. Although the store is noticeably smaller than Barnes & Noble and Borders, they've always carried what I was looking for. Sometimes I give them a call before I head over just to make sure they have what I need, but that usually isn't an issue. Why choose them over a chain bookstore? The environment is quiet and warm, which makes people want to explore the shelves forever. Also,the staff is knowledgeable and can always recommend a good book.  

Side note: The store is connected to Wildflower Bread Co., which has the best chicken salad sandwich, bread salad and passion fruit iced tea. Hint hint.
