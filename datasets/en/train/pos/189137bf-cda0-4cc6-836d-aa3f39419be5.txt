I could eat here everyday. The variety of different pastys are awesome!  Chicken tiki masala is definitely #1. The music gets a little weird but the atmosphere and awesome and the beer selection rocks. Not only that but they do have some of their pasty's in vegetarian form - so when you aren't feelin' meat you still get an freakin' awesome tasting pasty.
