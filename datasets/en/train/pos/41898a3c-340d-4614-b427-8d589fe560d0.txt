I can't say enough great things about the Tuck Shop!  I have been there a handful of times and every time they are gracious and inviting.  A few of those occasions I have been with a group of people and we always get loud and rowdy.  But I never feel like we need to calm down.  The owner and servers always remember me which make me feel oh so special!  The menu changes quite frequently but my absolute favorites, cheese curds and the skirt steak are staples that never change.  I am actually heating up my left over tomato casserole right now!  If you go on the night where the special is fish and chips, do not hesitate, order them.  The best fish and chips I have ever had.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them...
