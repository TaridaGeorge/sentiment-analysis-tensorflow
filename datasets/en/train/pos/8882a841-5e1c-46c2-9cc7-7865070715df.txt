My first visit and my eyes were gleaming about how a franchise in California could do so well. The place was clean and well lit. The burger I ordered was truly buttery, as they advertised and no weird fillers to pick out. The burger tasted so good I didn't feel the need to add mustard or extra mayo. My rootbeer was crisp and light and that frozen custard was just divine!  I will most certainly be back before I leave Phoenix.
