I love the original Paletas Betty in Chandler, and was excited to see they had opened up another shop on Mill.  They are open late at this location (until midnight) which is very nice if you are craving late night dessert!  On some days this location is on Groupon Now which allows you to get $10 of paletas for $5 if you redeem the Groupon the same day you buy it.  This will get you ~4 paletas with an extra dollar or so to add to your total bill.
