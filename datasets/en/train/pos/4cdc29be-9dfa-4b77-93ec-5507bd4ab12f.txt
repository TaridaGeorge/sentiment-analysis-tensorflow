Great big/little unique toy store.  Most, if not all, of their toys are very educational, unique, and/or classic toys, as well as numerous items which have "Best Toy Awards". 

 I think I spent over 1.5 hours looking at the displays, playing with them, or looking through the books.  (Not sure who had more fun, me or kids ?).
