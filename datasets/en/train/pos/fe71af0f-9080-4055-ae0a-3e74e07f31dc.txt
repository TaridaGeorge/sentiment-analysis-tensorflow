I stopped by the shopping center the other day and I almost didn't go in because the business is somewhat nondescript.  I'm so glad that I did, I couldn't believe what I was eating.  I've just come back from NYC and I thought I wouldn't find that taste again until my next trip back.  I absolutely love his bagels.  Crusty on the outside and so soft and perfect on the inside.  

I've been back three times in the last week and I am in love!  Kal is such a friendly guy and he is unguarded and warm, a real pleasure to talk with.  I've just moved to the valley and I am so glad there is an amazing bagel shop here.  Phoenix just got great!
