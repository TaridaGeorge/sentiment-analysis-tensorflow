I'm writing this review while I'm on my lunch break and fantasizing in DETAIL about the Red Goat Salad mixed with pistachios, strawberries and field greens and topped with a seriously generous helping of goat cheese.  In the words of the Grand Funk Railroad, it's some kind of wonderful.  What kind?

Basically, this is the best way I can sum up The Main Ingredient.
I love A) my friends.
I love B) TMI.

A loves B, and A and B are great together.  The hardwoood flooring, low lighting and tea lights make it a cozy spot for enjoying exceptional company with exceptional food.
