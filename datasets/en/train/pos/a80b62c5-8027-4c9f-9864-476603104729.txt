A quaint, little restaurant serving primarily Polish cuisine.  I tried their "chlodnik" soup (cold beet soup, similar to gazpacho), and stuffed cabbage ("golabki"), both of which were very tasty.  I was also offered a free sample of their 'cream of peanut' soup, also delicious, and shows you that these restaurateurs can get quite creative and beyond traditional Polish cooking.  They have quite the selection of entrees, sandwiches, desserts and beverages, including the Polish black currant juice, a definite must-try!

They are only open for dinner on Thursdays and Fridays, and on other days it's just lunch, so be aware.  also, it's BYOB (beer/wine only).  There is plenty of free street parking right outside.  And the staff is very friendly and welcoming.  Will definitely visit again next time I am in the Phoenix area.
