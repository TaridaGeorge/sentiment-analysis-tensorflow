The name has changed but I still say that the food is great. My boyfriend whose originally from Thailand said that he was surprised just how authentic the food was. The waitress was sweet and the food came rather quickly. I had the Panang Curry while he had the spicy catfish. Quite possibly  the best thing about it is the price, very cheap.
