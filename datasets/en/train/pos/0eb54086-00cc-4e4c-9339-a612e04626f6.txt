Ok, so 2nd visit was much more enjoyable. WCG knows red meat and knows what med. rare is. THX WCG, most establishments are scared to prepare beef that way. 

I had the blue cheese crusted center filet, my Husband had the balsamic infused rib-eye. Both were terrific and the only item finished on the plate! I love the honey roated carrots, and the Israeli couscous has a nice, refreshing tang that I like.
Thx WCG
we will be back.
