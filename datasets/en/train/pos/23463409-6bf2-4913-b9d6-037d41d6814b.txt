The stuffed French toast is without a doubt the best French toast I've ever had, trumping even my own home made version. Thick fresh baked cinnamon bread french toasted to perfection, topped with brown butter carmalized bananas, stuffed with vanilla cream cheese and served with warm maple syrup. Perfection! 

The locally roasted coffee was also superb and our friend said her veggie tofu sandwich was extremely tasty. The service was absolutely wonderful and the restaurant is clean and family friendly (also dog friendly on patio). 

I look forward to going back again soon and bringing my Vegan mother since there are many vegan and vegetarian menu options.
