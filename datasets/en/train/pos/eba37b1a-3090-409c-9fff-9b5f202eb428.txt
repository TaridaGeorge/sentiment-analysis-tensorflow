Consistent, delicious and fresh. My all-time favorite pizza place as of now and lucky it's so close to my house. Found this place on accident from google and decided to try it, but an unforgettable experience.. I just keep coming back, trying the Numero Uno, Deluxe Combo, Murphy, Spinach Pie, and Buffalo Wing pizza. Pizza is usually cut crooked, some pieces way bigger than others, but I think it gives it some character. All ingredients are customizable, flavorful and not greasy. Nello's kicks ass.
