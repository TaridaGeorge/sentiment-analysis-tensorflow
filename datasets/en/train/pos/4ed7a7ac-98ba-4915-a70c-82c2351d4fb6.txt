If there is a breakfast to be eaten, it better involve French Toast. While I do not discriminate as I gladly welcome any French Toast meal, I prefer T.C. Eggington's just a tad over U.S. Egg, The Good Egg and Jim's Coney Island Cafe. T.C. uses a cinnamon bread for their French Toast that is nearly 2" thick! 

REVISED: I just went this past Saturday and they now serve fresh peanut-butter on the side. 5 stars! Fresh peanut butter is essential to a good French Toasting!

My girlfriend proclaims T.C. to be the best for an omelet as well. They have a nice patio for some fresh air.

As with most breakfast places this can get busy on the weekends.
