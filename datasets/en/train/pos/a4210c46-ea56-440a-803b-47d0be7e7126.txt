I take Salsa, Bachata and Tango classes here ever Sunday night. I love this place. All classes are $5 dollars and we have a blast. They have a schedule on their website. They offer so many classes that everyone can find something they like here. Terry is the owner and he teaches some classes. Our instructor Miguel teaches the Salsa and Bachata.  Get your dancing shoes on. It's addicting.
