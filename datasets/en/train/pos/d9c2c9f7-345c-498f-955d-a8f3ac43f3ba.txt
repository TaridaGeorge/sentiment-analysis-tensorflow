This place is the NUMBER 1 thing to do in the off season, period.   Bring a camera, don't wear shorts (if you slip, you bleed) bring a quart of water, bring a CAMERA, bring something to snack on up top. You get a 360 degree view - (the pheonician is cool looking down on it).  Allow 2 and half hours and yes it is harder coming down.
