I adopted my cat from RESCUE a year and half ago. The process was simple and easy. After filling out the lengthy app I got a call the next day from a very knowledgable person to discuss the cat I wanted, my home life, my experience with cats, etc. I felt that she truly had the best interest of the cat in mind. There are a lot of quacks out there who adopt animals then decide they don't want them after all, I think it's wonderful that all applicants are screened before they are approved to adopt.  It's a wonderful organization and I highly recommend checking out their website www.azrescue.org.
