My feet have not been this soft in years!

I echo all of my previews accolades, but I have to add: Get the callous remover. You will not be sorry!! 

I have had callous remover at other places, but the nail tech at Pretty Nails & Spa filed my heels after the remover and (brace yourself) the dead skin fell off like eraser dust. It was totally disgusting and yet fabulous at the same time.

I'm done trying out new pedi places ... this one's a keeper!!
