I don't care for this airport. It's ugly (it's no YVR) and the food choices aren't great (it's no Narita - I'm partial to that Japanese food there), BUT it has FREE wi-fi, and for that I am always glad to connect through Phoenix. 

Plus it never seems to be crowded when I'm laying over there. I can roam around and find a seat with an outlet by it fairly easily. 

I don't know about the other parts of the airport, and again I don't care. The free wi-fi gets it a full five.
