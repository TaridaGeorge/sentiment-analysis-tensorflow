I should have reviewed CK's months ago! It is one of our favorite places! The happy hours are fantastic, and on top of that they also have daily specials! Our favorite day is Thursday, BOGO half off chicken sandwiches! And not just a plain old chicken sandwich... the possibilities are endless such as BBQ, Hawaiian, Avocado, and more. With beer battered fries, sweet potatoes fries, buffalo chips, tator tots, again too many options to even remember! 

Everything I have tried there is delicious and a big portion. They always have great drink specials too! And on top of all of this... their servers are the best, especially Tommy. I love CK''s for watching a game, dinner, or just hanging out!
