Filet Mingnon is to die for with the bacon wrapped filet and smothered with Blue cheese and surrounded by marinated whole mushrooms. Next time I need to try the baby back ribs because I asked to try the BBQ sauce that they make in house and loved it. 
   Also if you want a great $10 burger this place is one of the best!! I had one the night before and it made me come back to try the Filet.
