Cool as the other side of the pillow, that's what Bunky Boutique is. This awesome little local Central PHX gem is adjacent to Giant Coffee. Two of my favorites under one roof? Almost too good to be true! 

At Bunky you will find unique clothing, fun locally made gifts, special jewelry that any girl (with style) will love, and the best candles ever. It's a small shop so there isn't a ton of selection, but in my opinion you don't need a lot of crap to wade through when everything they have is quality. 

C'mon in here after a coffee at a Giant and get yourself something snazzy!
