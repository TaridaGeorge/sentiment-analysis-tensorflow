Fresh.  Tasty.  Interesting.  Good "People Watching."

Love everything I have tried here.  The Happy Hour "tapas" are excellent.  My daughter could not get enough of the garlic chicken one.

The 3-bean plate is delish - kinda like "meatless chili" but you don't miss the meat.   

The fruit salad is massive and the fruit served with it is completely top-notch.

Wait staff is mostly cute college girls, which is hardly ever a completely bad thing.  Never had a problem with good, attentive service, which CAN be a problem sometimes.

I go eat there as often as is reasonable.  Highly Recommended.
