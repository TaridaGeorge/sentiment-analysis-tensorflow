Want to know where to get a 29" tube for your mountain bike? This place. Know what kind? Ask them, they know. Did you know Arizona has thorns that puncture your average bike tire tube? I didn't either but I do now! (And I thought it was someone at the park that flattened both of my tires). The people there are very friendly and the prices are really good too! Best bike place I've been to outside of Seattle. If you are lucky enough to have to wait for something it's right next to Pane Bianco which is another wonderful place Phoenix offers to those that have intellect. Highly recommend! Bikes seemed priced decent but I'm not a Cannondale rider so I wouldn't know.
