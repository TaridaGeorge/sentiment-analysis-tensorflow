I've been coming here for a few years now and I have always had EXCELLENT pedicures here.  I always get the upgraded pedi and they do  such a great massage I almost feel bad because it's so long!  And you also get a mini neck rub afterwards with you get your manicure. My french pedis from here always last at least 3 weeks!

I also get acrylic overlay and both the owner and Kimberly do such a great job! No bubbles here!  The best part is I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes even as a walk in.  Check them out!
