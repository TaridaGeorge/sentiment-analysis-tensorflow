In-Home Appliance has helped me out several times. Shortly after purchasing my home, my water heater broke. They sent someone the next day. They let me know how much it was going to be (I had a second opinion and the other company wanted to charge double). In-Home came back out and fixed it and it ended being cheaper than he quoted! I have also had a disposal installed along with fixing my fridge fixed with the same great service.

In-Home employees were great! The employees respected that I don't allow shoes in my house and cleaned up after they were done. You would never known they had been there except everything was back working! 

I would recommend them and I have to my friends.
