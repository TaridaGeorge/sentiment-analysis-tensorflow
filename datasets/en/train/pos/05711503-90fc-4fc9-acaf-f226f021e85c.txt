A beautiful sunset it was.  A visit to the outdoor patio for drinks left a memorable image of a wedding going on in the background while sitting on huge comfortable lounge chairs.  Sitting in these comfortable chairs, you could veg out after a stiff drink.  You'll really feel relaxed in this Frank Lloyd Wright architectural environment and the Arizona heat.  There is a serenest about this place.
