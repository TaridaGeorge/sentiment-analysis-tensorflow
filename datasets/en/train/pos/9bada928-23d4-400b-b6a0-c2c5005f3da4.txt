This is where my love for thai food started! They have such amazing curry and pad thai, I always have the hardest time deciding between the two! Those are both part of their lunch special which is an awesome deal - soup or salad, entree and rice for $7. If your looking for lighter options, the seafood soup is also delicious.
The dinner portions are massive and you can probably feed 3 people with one entree which usually run around $10. It's a really good value and the food does not disappoint! Since I started going to this restaurant, thai food has become one of my favorite cuisines and this place is definitely my favorite place to eat it
