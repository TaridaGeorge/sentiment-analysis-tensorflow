Awesome sandwich shop! I usually go once a week. Their menu is quite extensive and they are always friendly with their customers. Their sandwich prices are very affordable considering the amount of food you get. We aren't talking that terrible crap Subway serves either, this is quality meat and produce. They're also open for breakfast. My breakfast burrito the other day was to die for. When you don't feel like grabbing a bag of chips, grab some of their amazing potato salad or pasta salad. Mmmmmmmmm... It's lunch time. I'm on the way!
