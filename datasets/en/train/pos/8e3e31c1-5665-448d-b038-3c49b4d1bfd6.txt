This place is truly one of a kind. After seeing positive reviews on yelp, I took my classic mustang here to have a small area repainted. They not only quoted me a reasonable rate, but found a way to save me money by using a method requiring no new additional paint to be added.

After less than one day, Bob the paint guy had the car done with amazing results, Chase had the car washed down and looking great and all for half of my original quote. Exclusive will be the only shop I ever use in the future for paint or body work.
