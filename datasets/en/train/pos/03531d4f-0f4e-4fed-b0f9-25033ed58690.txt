This place if full of win!
A great place to connect with some amazing people who have a huge passion for the web and technology community in phoenix. You can drop by any weekday to get work done on some well put together Swedish desks with plenty of power strips for all your electronic need and of course free wifi. There is also sweet tunes always playing on the gangplank speaker system! Next time you think you need to go to Starbucks to get work done, why not try coming to gangplank instead.

Make sure and show up on Wednesdays during lunch to see some awesome speakers talk about pretty much anything related to the web community in phoenix. Or show up on Wednesday nights to hang and eat pizza with some great techy peeps from all over Phoenix!
