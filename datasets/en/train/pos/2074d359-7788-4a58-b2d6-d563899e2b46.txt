Literally..."As good as it gets!"

Had a fabulous dinner complete with wonderful company, phenomenal food, enchanting atmosphere and warm, knowledgeable staff!

We shared a bottle of the Colome, kale salad and street corn and then i indulged in the creamiest, perfectly cooked scallops! Tried to say no to dessert but once our server got through describing the pumpkin bread pudding i had to have some...which was the only way to end such a perfect night. Thank you Mission for reminding me that there are still quality restaurants in the area. Looking forward to many more romantic nights there!
