District American Kitchen and Wine Bar, I had great time this pass Sat., nice new venue with every thing you could ask for ,the food was off the hook , and it was happy hour, that started  at 10pm, the staff was friendly, great service , and you got the best of both worlds, they had Live Entertainment , and this band was hott!! had people dancing down the street , this venue is a diamond in the ruff....
