They have finished the renovation of the driving range and it's fantastic! On one side they have the normal hitting stations where you can get balls from a dispenser. On the other side is a double decker range which is all automated. You pay and get a ticket inside, input the number into the computer at your station, and it automatically tees up each ball for you. You can put the ball on the mat if you don't want it teed up and you can also adjust the tee height to match the club you are using. It will bring the next ball at the same height until you change it. The best turf driving range around!! Check it out!
