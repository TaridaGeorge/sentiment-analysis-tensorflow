Great place, great service.  We are so pleased to have the gem come into the community as it is always a struggle to find a decent place for lunch that is not a chain or fast food.  We are now hooked and have had lunch here at least once a week the past 3 weeks and never dissapoints.  Portions are great. Pricing is great.  I don't know what else to say but you have to try it out.
