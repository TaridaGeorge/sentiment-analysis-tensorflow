Great *locally owned* coffee shop!

Ed Phillips, the weather forecaster -- you've seen him on TV & heard him on the radio -- owns AND operates this delightful place to take a break -- or jump on the FREE Wi-Fi and keep workin'.

While you're there, you can check out the weather back where aunt Martha lives, or you can plan your next trip - around - the weather instead of driving thru the weather!

Nice people.  Nice service.  Good stuff to eat & drink.

I just love supporting local businesses -- especially when they are as good as Weather & Coffee!
