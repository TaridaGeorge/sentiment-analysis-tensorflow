This place is awesome.  You can tell their horses are well trained, fed and taken care of.  Wranglers are top notch as well.  I'm been on trail rides before but this was the best.  It was our 7 year-olds first time and I never worried one second about her, her horse, or the trail.  They almost forced water down our little one's throat (on an 8am ride) to keep her from getting heat stroke.  Safe and VERY scenic ride.
