Enchiladas = AMAZING. Red  Burro = AMAZING. Cannot speak any more highly of this place. It is a little hole in the wall. Or maybe I should say a house converted into a to-go counter. But that is just the appeal of this place. You get some down home cooked mexican food. This place comes highly recommended.
