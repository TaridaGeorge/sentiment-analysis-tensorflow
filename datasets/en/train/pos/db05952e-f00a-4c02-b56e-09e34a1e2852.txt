I was in a bind. I needed paint markers for a sign I was producing and couldn't find them anywhere in the area. I was driving around frantically looking for office supply stores and happened to see this Michaels. I went in and the manager and the staff were very busy helping customers but they found time to help me find exactly what I needed. They knew just what I would need to get the task done. I paid and left and procedeed to go paint my sign. Half way through I realized I needed another kind of paint to finish it up and frantically rushed back to Michaels. The manager called over the PA and got a painter to come help me find exactly what I needed. Thanks a bunch!
