Very, very good food here.  Get the short ribs if they have them. 

Desserts are unbelievable as well...would be a good place to go just for that!

The short-ribs are served with a cherry BBQ sauce that is unbelievable.  I was so full, but couldn't stop eating.  I've also catered an event here before for a large group and it was awesome.  The menu can change often though based on the chef's desires/etc.

I've been here twice and never left disappointed at all.  It would be a more frequented place if I lived closer to Scottsdale.
