I saw Dr. Kendra when I was pregnant with my twin daughters. I was very hesitant when I went to see her as I have never seen a Chiropractor before. I was experiencing extreme hip and low back pain, and was just plain uncomfortable. My OB suggested her and with no relief elsewhere I went into the office. I had the BEST experience! She was thorough, patient, and caring. I left the office with 50% of my pain gone, and the following week at my next appt. 75% was gone. I have continued to see her for different aches and pains since delivering my twins off and on and will never go anywhere else!
