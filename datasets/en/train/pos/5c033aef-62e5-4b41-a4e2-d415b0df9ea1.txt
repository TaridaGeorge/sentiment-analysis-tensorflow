I found this little restaurant through a voucher on dealchicken.com. I've lived minutes away from this place for 4 years and never knew about it. The food was just fabulous! We went for an early dinner and the place was very quiet when we arrived (which was fine with us) and the service was really top notch. Forget about all those overly trendy Scottsdale sushi places, this place is the real thing!
