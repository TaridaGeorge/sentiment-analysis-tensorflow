One of my favorite places to stay in Scottsdale.Great hotel, and they have good restaurants on site. The willow spa is very nice also.  The Gold section is nice since you get free breaksfast, Larger rooms, and all day access to the willow spa.  The only thing i don't like about the Fairmont is that  it can be a long walk to the front desk. They will give you rides in golf carts, but i would recommend if you are there for a convention, request to be close.  Unless you mind a long walk all the time.
