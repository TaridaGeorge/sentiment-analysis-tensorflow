This is a great place to go without having to drive too far!  I go to the one on Rittenhouse.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff.  The outdoor patio is nice with the great weather we have been getting.  Pretty happening on a late Friday or Saturday, actually this place always seems busy.  I haven't personally tried the food yet, but menu offers a diverse selection and it all looks pretty good.  Definitely worth checking out.
