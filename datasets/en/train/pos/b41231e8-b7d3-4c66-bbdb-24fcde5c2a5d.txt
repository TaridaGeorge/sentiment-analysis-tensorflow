Their food is consistently good and the organic wine selections are really awesome.   I was excited to see that Restaurant.com has them now and you can get a $25 gift certificate for like $2 during their sales!

This is a great place for vegetarians to have lots of options for people who eat gluten-free too.  We will be loyal patrons!
