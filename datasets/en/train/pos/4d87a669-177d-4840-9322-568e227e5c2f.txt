The best donuts ever!  My only regret is every time I go they don't have much left and we drive about 45 minutes just for the donuts.  They are open til 2 pm but every time I've gone it's been round noon and they have a very limited selection.  Today I was forced to get a blueberry caked donut for that's all that was left and it was so moist inside, nothing like any other cake donut ever but it just verified to me they are the best donuts around.  Tasty and moist and even day old(for the weekend) they are delish.  Worth the drive!
