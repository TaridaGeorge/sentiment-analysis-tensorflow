Fairly new place. It has been opened for couple of months now. The place looks pretty clean. Food is very affordable. Sizes a reasonable and filling. I have only been there two times and so far every item we have selected from the menu has been an A+. 

I recommend the Curry chicken, Spicy Thai Basil Noodles, Pad Thai and Orange Chicken with Brown rice (soft, tangy and flavorful). They also have Thai Iced Tea (refreshing earthy-herbal flavor tea with milk). 

Today I had the Crab Angels as an appetizer...probably not worth the price. 

Go and try this restaurant and let me know what you think!!!
