I LOVE Camelview for the fact that it attracts much more of the NPR-loving, Fanny-pack toting, middle-age set than the teenagers. It's nice to go to a cinema and not be interrupted by the bright blue lights of a text messaging phone... 
That being said, the place could circulate its movies a bit more. Sometimes I feel like they keep the same boring French film on rotation for a few weeks more than necessary. But if you're looking for a place to find a unique movie, this is definitely it.
Also, they host a few film festivals throughout the year. About a month ago, my husband and I saw an Iranian film , a French film and a British film as part of the Scottsdale Film Fest and they were all great. 
Really, I don't know what we would do without this place! Go! Support decent local cinemas!!!!
