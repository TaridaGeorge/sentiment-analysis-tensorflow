You'll see me at Lola at least a couple mornings a week, sometimes practically every day of the week.

I only order the Cafe Latte, but given how good it is, everything else must be good too!  The scones are unbelievably good.  There must be some voodoo in them to make them taste that way - flaky and moist at the same time, just the right amount of raspberry, cranberry, pecans, or whatever the flavor of the day is.

Daniel, the owner, is good people.  His staff provides excellent service, and you'll think you are family when you visit.  Smiles all around.
