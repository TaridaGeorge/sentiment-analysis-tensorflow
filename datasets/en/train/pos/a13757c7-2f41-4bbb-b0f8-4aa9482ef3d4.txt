I have nothing but good things to say about this place..so let me start with the only thing I don't care for..the fries..theyure the only thing that rates a "meh". They're skinny like McDonalds fries but not golden or crispy...does that help? Anyway other than that SCORE! The shake choices are extensive and freakin delicious. Yesterday i had the Blackberry Cobbler one and it was excellent. I managed to suck down the whole thing before my "My Bleu Chicken" showed up. There's nothing wrong with dessert first right? The chicken was sooo tender. That is the 3rd time Ive been and before I had a build your own burger and a build your own grilled cheese. You just can't go wrong here! There is something for everyone! Service is great and fast and food is delicious.. what more do you need?
