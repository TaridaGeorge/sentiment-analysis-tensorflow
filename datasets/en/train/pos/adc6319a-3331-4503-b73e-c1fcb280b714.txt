My favorite place to eat in Tempe!

The atmosphere is always perfect; not too loud, but still noisy enough with the good music to be enjoyable. I love the rotating art collection, because it gives me something new to look at every time I come.

The food is so good. I've only ever had one thing that I didn't like (the chicken pasta salad), but It's been a 10 for me every other time. The Glazed Chicken Lavosh Pizza is my favorite dish with the Fruit Fantasia at a close second.
