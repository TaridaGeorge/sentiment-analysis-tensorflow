If you are looking for a fancy place... you better go somewhere else. 
If you want great food and great service, come on in.

I was not a big fan of Thai food until I met Touch of Thai. It is a big favorite of people in my office. We usually order the same stuff (soup, catfish and red or yellow curry chicken).

Their lunch portions are reasonable size and price.

They are very friendly and don't make faces if you ask them to split the check, even for big parties.

Once I ordered lunch to go and I forgot it at the table : (
they took it off my bill the next time I was there : )
