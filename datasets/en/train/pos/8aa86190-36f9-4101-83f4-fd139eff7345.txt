A body of water in the middle of the desert metropolis?
Nice park areas on both sides?
Pedestrian-friendly bridges?
Light-rail accessibility?
Well-maintained paths without cracked pavement, graffiti, or trash?
A cool view of Sun Devil Stadium? (boo to that one - Cal fan here)
Complete peace and solitude on a 70-degree Sunday morning in February?

Nice job, Tempe!
