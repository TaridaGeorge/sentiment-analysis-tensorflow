I love this place! I don't even want to know how or why it is so inexpensive or how they can give away $5 off coupons each week (you can use 1 for every $20, and you can often print more coupons from their website, too). 

It is smaller than most grocery stores, but they have a great selection. I like their generic brand and the prices are great. They have $2.99 wines that could rival two buck chuck, prepared foods are very tasty and they have huge price cuts on things about to expires (produce, meats, dairy, prepared foods) which is perfect if you're stopping in for dinner that night. 

The only drawback is the people- they could be a little friendlier, but I can't complain when its clean, fresh, inexpensive and offers a great variety!
