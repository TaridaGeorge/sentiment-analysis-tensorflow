You gotta love Justina, the owner...I just don't know why she keeps chopping her hair off. But she is like a walking fashion show. 

Anyway, we have been going to Cyclo since its early days. Coming from the Bay Area, we were a bit disappointed that there were no decent Asian restaurants in the area, until we stumbled upon this restaurant. The flavors of the foods are amazing, really rich and sometimes a bit complex. Try the Hanoi and the shrimp appetizer...yum! And I truly enjoy the refreshing lemonade...a bit on the sweet side, but strangely refreshing! You have to go! Oh, and you can bring your own wine...just make sure it's a good bottle. Justina's going to make a note of it if you bring a cheap one.
