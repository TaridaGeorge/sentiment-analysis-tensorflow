My favorite Vietnamese place in Tempe. I've been going here for four years and have introduced it to many of my friends, which they all enjoy! The food has always been consistent, meaning that the soup taste fabulous everytime you dine in. I would highly recommend the pho, summer rolls, and eggrolls.
