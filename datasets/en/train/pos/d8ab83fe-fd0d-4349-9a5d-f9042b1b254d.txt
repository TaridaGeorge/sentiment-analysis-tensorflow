Well you can say that I'm a little biased but this is one of the best spring training facilities around. The tickets were decent price for great seats. There were many concession stands, bathrooms and services in the stadium were amazing. the make up of the complex was well thought out and having fields that are exact replicas of Dodger Stadium and US Cellular Field will help out the Dodgers and White Sox in there development. Just a great place to spend a spring at! Go Blue!
