Everytime I move into a new area I go on the hunt for home cookin. Especially breakfast, my fav meal. Me & a buddy driving Baseline looking for such a restaturant pulled into BBD last week & I've already been back.

Not only huge portions but tasty. Where can you get Steak & Eggs, taters & huge biscuit for 6.99 w/ an actual steak on the plate full of flavor?  Those in my party loved the eggs benedict, scrambles and the huge pancakes.

Bob the GM is a good guy w/ loads of customer svc. Ricki our server was a hoot after picking up on my oneriness.
