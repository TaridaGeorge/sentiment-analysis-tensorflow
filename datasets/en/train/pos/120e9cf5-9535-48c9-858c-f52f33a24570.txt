Well not much to update here it's still damn good and it's only been 5 days since last visit.  

Today I had:
Pulled Pork Sandwich with Southwest Slaw and mustard bbq sauce.  It was amazing the slaw alone was outstanding but then pile it on top of a mound of smoked pork goodness and top it all off with tangy sweet sauce and you got yourself a winner.  

I also had a side of bacon mac and cheese obviously it is a must and it was just as amazing as last week.  

Best thing is he is going to be by my job in two days with fresh brisket : ) I can't wait.
