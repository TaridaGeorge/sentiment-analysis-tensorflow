We are from a land barren of I&O. 
The LOML almost lost his mind when we discovered I&O across from the hotel we stayed out while visiting family. He has spent lots of time on the west coast and lived on these burgers, apparently.
He ate there about 5 times over 3 days. 
I hate burgers and I even ate there once and liked it very much.
It was cool, burgers were great, we were happy.
 That is all.
