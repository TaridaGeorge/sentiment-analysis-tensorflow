I think this may be a one-man show.  He drives a limo through Old Town Scottsdale but he sells himself as a "transportation/concierge service".

There are many cabbies in Old Town who will try to rip you off but this guy is the exact opposite.

He knows a lot about the nightlife in the area and is a helpful good-natured high-energy guy.  He's a young American guy maybe 27.  Recommended for Yelpers.
