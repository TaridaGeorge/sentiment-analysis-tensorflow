Yeah  Mamma Like....What's not to love? ....yummy "special" treat , check, 
find it at a Farmers Market ...check,  reasonable price ...check... it 's nearly perfect!    Now if he had only complimented my adorable skirt it would have  been divine. 

I really love the concept and execution of this  delightful  specialty food truck..  the brulee is made in many different flavors such as lavender, chocolate, coconut ( yummy) , banana  and others..he torches it right in front of you or packs them up to go.  I also noticed he will deliver a minimum of 4 at places through out the valley. think I can convince my co workers that we all NEED brulee?
