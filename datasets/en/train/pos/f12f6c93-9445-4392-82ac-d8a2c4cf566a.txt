I get the Italian beef sandwich with aus jus. This is a serious sandwich and very filling. It doesn't come with chips or slaw or fries. It doesn't need anything on the side. Other than a couple of locally made cheese-steak sandwiches, this is the finest hot sandwich in town in my opinion. 

BONUS: Sometimes, if your'e lucky, they will cook up some fresh zeppoles and walk around the dining room passing them out to each customer.
