My ideal heaven would be eating pizza all day and drinking Jones' Cream Soda.  I love pizza so much I can eat an entire large pizza by myself.  So in short I'm a HUGE pizza fanatic, I always try new pizza places.  I can honestly say Grimaldi's is by far, hands down my favorite.  Now I have tried Pizzaria Bianco, which I've heard is suppose to be the best pizza in the world, so it may change.
