What a bunch of stuck up snooty hags!!! (2 star people) This place is a buffet!  A great one! The food was ALL hot, price was reasonable for the variety and quality.   There was NO lines and the service was perfect.  I almost couldn't get the food off my plate before they would try and come get it.  10 bucks! If you don't like buffets don't come then bitch about it and pretend your someone you're not.
