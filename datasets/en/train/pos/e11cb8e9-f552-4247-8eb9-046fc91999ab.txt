Attended Kiwanis of Carefree Western Night - Dolan Ellis performing his musical history of AZ for the folks of Carefree. We enjoyed the wonderful ribs 'n chicken, fried cactus (yummy!) and the live buffalo outside (no joke!) for picture taking delight of all the guests. The resort is the epitome of desert laid-back elegance and the sunset  views are spectacular - as is the food and resort staff who greet you with a smile as you pass by on the pathways around the resort. What a fantastic place to hold an event!! I am looking forward to coming back again soon.
