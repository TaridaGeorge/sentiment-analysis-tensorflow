This place is A-MAZ-ING! Our waiter was a little awkward, but that didn't matter once the food showed up. We got two sandwiches (one turkey one pork) and a salad that was a special (with fresh ahi tuna on the top). All three meals were perfect. Would recommend to anyone who's will spend a pretty penny on a great mean.
