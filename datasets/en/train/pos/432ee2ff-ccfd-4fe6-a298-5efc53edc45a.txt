This place is fantastic.  The drink were made with real fruit and squeezed when we made them.

Dinner at 10:45 on a Saturday night, not at all crowded.

The pizza was burned but it tasted great.

Had a spicy cocktail with Serrano chili pepper infused tequila!  Wow.  The price was $30 for two drinks and a pizza for two
