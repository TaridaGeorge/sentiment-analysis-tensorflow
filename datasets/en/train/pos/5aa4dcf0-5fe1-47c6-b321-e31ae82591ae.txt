When people say let's get Krazy sub, they usually mean Ned's but quite honestly, I love Steve's way more! The subs may look the same- but Steve's has better bread. Everytime I go there I am not disappointed. They always have the food ready by the time you finish paying! I love me some STEVES Krazy subs!
