Friday night Happy Hour is by far one of the best happy hours in Phoenix.  It's 3-7pm and the prices for suhi, tempura and cocktails are AWESOME.  It's definitely a people-watching place....as the crowd seems to change from week to week.  The deographics varies WIDELY which makes it totally fun.....there's people in suits, 20, 30 40 somethings, gay/straight, cougars, shoppers, out of towners...the list goes on and on.  Always a great vibe and friendly service.  Not to mention some of the best looking bartenders in Phoenix.  By 5pm the place starts to get crowded....and by 5:30pm its packed.  I would highly recommend this place for happy hour.
