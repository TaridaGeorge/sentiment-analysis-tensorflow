Downtown rooftop bar with one hell of a view from CityScape!  The temperature dropped enough to really enjoy sitting out and having drinks under the stars.  They do focus on specialty cocktails and you can kick it next to the rooftop pool as well.

Definitely a place to be seen.  The Kimpton has hit the spot with this location.  A must for anyone hitting up downtown.

Dive in with a Absinthe Fizz, You Call It, or a Swizzle.

Can't wait to go back.
