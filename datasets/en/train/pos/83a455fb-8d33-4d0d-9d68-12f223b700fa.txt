I can't believe I haven't written a review for the Phoenix Symphony since I've been a regular here for the last 3 years!
I've brought my son here to see the Nutcracker performed by the AZ Ballet since he was two. And we're season subscribers to the Phoenix Symphony Family Series for the last two years. 
We have tickets in the Orchestra section so my son who is 5 can see all the musicians up close and personal to keep his attention.  I love how they add a little kid friendly entertainment and/or performance to each concert to make it fun for the little ones. Also love the family activities an hour prior to start of concert. 
While there is no dress code, it's always nice to use this occasion to dress up my son a little so he knows we are going to some place special.
