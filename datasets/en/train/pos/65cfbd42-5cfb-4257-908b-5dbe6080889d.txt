This is one of the best burgers I have ever had!  The Kobe burger is worth the extra $4 in my mind, and the truffle fries are legit.  Sure you're paying $20 for a burger and fries, but this is no normal burger.  Add a cold beer or a glass of wine, and you'll be wanting to come back right after you finish the last bite.  Why this place rates only 3.5 stars is ridiculous.  Every time I've gone on a non happy hour Sunday afternoon it's packed.  There's a reason for that;  its called 5 stars.
