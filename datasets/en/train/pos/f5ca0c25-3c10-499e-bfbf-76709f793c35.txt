Pita Jungle has the best hummus I have ever tried!  My favorite thing to get is the hummus and tabouli, its a meal itself!  Also, Gambas con ajo is delicious and savory, with carrot chips! Luckily there are more than 1 around now, I've been to 4 locations, same quality and service is apparent at all.
