This resale shop has terrific retro clothing, a peaceful art gallery, unique jewelry and interesting kitchen items in a beautiful mid century building. The owners are fun to talk with and the prices are INCREDIBLE. I bought several shirts for my son at $5 each, a hand tooled leather purse for $11 and some hammered metal necklaces for drastically less than similar necklaces in the Sundance Catalog. They even have building blocks in the open courtyard that kept the kids busy while I enjoyed the art gallery. Park on Cyprus along the north side the building and prepare for wonderful experience.  I was a little worried by the appearance of the outside of the building but was delighted by the surprises inside. I could have stayed for hours and I can't wait to go back and discover more treasures!
