I needed a new home computer & decided to call RedSeven to see if they could get me what I needed at an affordable price... and boy did they deliver!  A PC at the price I wanted to spend...and even better specs than I asked for!!  The transaction was seemless.  They walked me through a demo of my new machine and offered to set it up at home for me.  I declined because I was off to work- but when I went to set it up and I couldn't figure everything out, RedSeven came to the rescue and responded immediately.  Great product & incredible customer service- Thanks!!
