My honey and I have been frequenting 5th and wine for the past couple months and love it. We have yet to actually sit at a table because we are scared to leave our great bartender. If you ever have the chance go, go just to meet Steve. He is awesome. Very friendly and informative about wines and the menu. He is also pretty good to look at :) I'm just getting into wine and he has been a fabulous guide and always gives great suggestions. I also have to eat gluten free now and he was extremely helpful! The steak was amazing and my honey loves all the bruschetta including the hummus one. I do not like the hummus one though. We enjoy this place and plan to keep coming back!
