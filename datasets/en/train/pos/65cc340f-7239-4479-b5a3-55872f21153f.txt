Zarrin is amazing!  She is the only person I have received a facial or peel from there, but she is exceptional.  My skin looks amazing when she is done.  She does extractions (which people seem to avoid now), her peels have almost completely gotten rid of my hyperpigmentation from adult acne, and I always feel relaxed when I leave.  I have had my hair cut there as well.  It looked great after, although my hair is much more straight forward than my skin.  Their prices are very reasonable ($60 or so for an hour facial, $55 for a haircut, $25 for dermaplaning, $30 to $60 for a peel depending on the strength and layers).  I strongly recommend this spa.
