These people do amazing work!! Unlike the vast majority of barbers out there, these people cut hair like REAL professionals. These are schooled and careered barbers. Very reasonably priced for the kind of work they do.  Right around $21 for a cut you can walk out and be very proud of (kids cost about $15). I highly recommend these folks. You might want to make an appointment if you go later in the day; they fill up.
