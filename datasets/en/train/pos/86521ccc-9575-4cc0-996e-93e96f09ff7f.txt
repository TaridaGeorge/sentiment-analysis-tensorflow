Amazing coffee! The first time the wife and i walked into this coffee shop we were impressed and how beautifully decorated this joint was. The staff is very nice and helpful, the ladies behind the counter were pretty hot. 

we were served quickly and their coffee is outstanding, and its awesome when you're hungover!
