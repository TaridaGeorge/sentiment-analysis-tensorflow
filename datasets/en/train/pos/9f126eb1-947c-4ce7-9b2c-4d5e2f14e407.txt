Arguably, the best burger place in the world.  The only other burger place that enters the argument is Five Guys.  When I stayed in Tempe, In and Out was my best friend.  Definitely, the best fries out there.  The custom orders take on a life of their own.  The service is uniquely friendly for a fast food place.  And, yeah, they stick to the main criteria of a fast food restaurant...FAST!
