We stayed at this gorgeous hotel on New Year's Eve and had a great time.  The room was very large and nice - we booked a corner king room to ensure we had the large bathtub.  The bathroom was my favorite part of the hotel room.  A really cool rain shower, amazing views of the city and that bathtub was epic.  

Overall a very chic feel.  So clean!  And on top of it, the staff was great, quick and very accommodating.
