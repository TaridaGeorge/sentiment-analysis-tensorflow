Part three date with Morgan...

After getting lost leaving Castles and Coasters (I didn't say that), it was probably after 11?  

The staff was still very friendly, we had probably the best waiter I've ever had, so easy going and helpful.  I was impressed.

We had a few margaritas, they were ok.  2 for one for happy hour (10pm to midnight).

We decided, after much debate to share the special (5 bucks, what a frickin deal right!?), grilled chicken, with veggies and pesto, so good!  We also shared the sweet potato fries, which Morgan loved and I wasn't a big fan of.  I didn't care for the cinnamon, I'm more of a salty, savory fan.  But for neone who likes sweet stuff they're "fucking awesome".

So yeah, go here, its great, Lovely ambiance, great food, okay drinks.  Frickin great staff.
