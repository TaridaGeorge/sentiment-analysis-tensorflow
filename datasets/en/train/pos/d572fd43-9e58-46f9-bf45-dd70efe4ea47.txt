**DISCLAIMER**
I rate only on the quality and consistency of the Coconut Shrimp

Chain Schmain! If you know what to order you'll be fine.

They have a pretty extensive Polynesian inspired menu.
Stay away from all that and go for the good stuff~ 

COCONUT SHRIMP ~Quite Possibly the best (see pics)

Their Tempura Salmon roll is pretty good too but can vary, this time it was a little over riced and the rice was on the sticky side, but it was still tasty.

I Only go here to eat those two items and occasionally their mini sundae which is super fab! 

A scoop of vanilla ice cream set inside a crispy cinnamon sugar wonton bowl with chocolate sauce and whip cream! Perfection!
