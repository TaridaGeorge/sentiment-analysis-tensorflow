I could eat at this place daily. I love love love their greek salad and the turkey pesto lavosh. The hummus is really good too. I find that the service is always pretty good, although when its super busy it can be spotty (understandably). I really enjoy the art that they feature in the restaurant and the overall laid back feel of the restaurant.
