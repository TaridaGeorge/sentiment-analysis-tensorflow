Seeing as how I live within walking distance, Postino is absolutely one of my local staples. The service is always great, the food is excellent and the wine list is constantly rotating. The overall atmosphere is always inviting and honestly, I can't say enough great things about this place. Whenever I have someone visiting, this is always on my list of places to go. 

It's hard to provide a review of a specific time there since I go often but that should speak volumes since nobody would go back to a place over and over again if it weren't great!
