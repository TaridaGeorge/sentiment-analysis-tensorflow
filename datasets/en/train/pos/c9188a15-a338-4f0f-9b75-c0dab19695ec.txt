I'm a big fan of this place. Hey, it's not much to look at, but the owner is super cool, and the pressing by her staff is very good. Who wants to get their clothes back (and men's suiting) with wrinkles pressed in?? I have gotten that from other supposedly high-end places. 

Unless you request it faster, dry cleaning usually is done by tomorrow after 2pm and laundry the day after.

This is not an inexpensive dry cleaning place, but it's probably middle of the road, and they have never messed up my clothes once...
