I have never eaten in, but gotten to go many times.. I live downtown and this has become one of my favorite spots to get food at! Their lunch specials are a great deal! i have been to Thailand, and this is as close to the real thing as you can get! make sure to get it spicy!! (or if you are daring, the "Thai Spicy", it's much better!)
