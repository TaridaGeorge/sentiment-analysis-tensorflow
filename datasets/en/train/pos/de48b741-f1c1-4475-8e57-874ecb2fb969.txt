This was also my first play, sad I know! Although I missed the first half of "The Clean House" I was lucky enough to find someone that caught me up to speed! We got seated on the lower level left balcony very close as soon as I sat down I pretty much laughed thru the rest of the play, it was a great story! I had no idea there was cussing in the theatre! The cast was excellent, I am also a fan of Felicity La Fortune (Lani) she appeared in a soap I used to watch I thought she was fantastic!! I missed the Wicked Bakery & Gelato spot stuff afterward's no worry's Wicked is near by and I am planning a visit soon, like tomorrow lol! Seeing the play was a treat all by itself a good time was had! Thank you Yelp and Gabi!!
