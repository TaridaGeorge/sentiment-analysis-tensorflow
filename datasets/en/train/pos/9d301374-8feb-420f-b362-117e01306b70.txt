Best gelato I've had outside of Europe. Flavors are true to life and the texture is perfect. Pistachio tastes like pistachio. Panna cotta is dreamy. Zuppa inglese, creamy caramel, chocolate, it's all good. You don't have to eat as much because it's so densely flavorful and satisfying.  

Forget the artificial self serve yogurt fad or the trendy "gelato" shops. This is the real deal.
