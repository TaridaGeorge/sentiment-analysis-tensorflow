I really enjoy the dining experience at Christopher's. Overall, it was a really nice place (fine-dining, as many may call it). Ambiance was impecable! The food was surely delicious and prompt you to comeback for more. Most of all, we had a really good bottle of wine, which made the experience a lot more lovely. 

Of course, the price is the only drawback, but you will get what you paid for...again, it's a fine dining. For certain, I don't mind to have a dinner-date here. It is a fine attribute for the modern-romance ambiance. 

I heart this place.
