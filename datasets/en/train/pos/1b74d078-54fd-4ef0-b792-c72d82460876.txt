A group of friends and I tried this place out last weekend and I was so glad we found it! There is a great happy hour that lasts until 9 pm and it covers entrees, appetizers and drinks. I was able to eat and drink for about $14 and I even took home leftovers. The atmosphere is fun and the waitstaff was friendly and very capable. I plan to go back again, loved it!
