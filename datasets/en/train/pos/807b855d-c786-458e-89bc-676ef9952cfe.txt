The office has moved to Southern Ave and Higley in Mesa. Same phone number. Dr. Benson is an awesome urologist and Dr. Webster is a great renal oncologist. The office staff is friendly and efficient. They care for patients at St. Joseph's, John C. Lincoln and Banner Gateway hospitals. 
Parking is easy. The facility on Southern Ave is new and much roomier than where they were on 10th Place. 
I highly recommend this office.
