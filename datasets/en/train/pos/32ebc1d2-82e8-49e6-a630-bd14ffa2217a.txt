This shop makes this tomboy feel so girly. 

I am not a big fan of shopping or accessorizing. Other boutiques and department stores are out of my budget and the cheaply made junior clothes found in the malls don't fit my chest or my hips. 

Francesca's is my dream come true. A relaxed and unpretentious boutique with clothes of fairly good quality. Tons of cute dresses under $50. Clothes that fit my curves. Lots of accessories. A fun and unique gift section. The salespeople are perfect. Helpful and kind but not pushy. 

Woohoo! As good as it gets!
