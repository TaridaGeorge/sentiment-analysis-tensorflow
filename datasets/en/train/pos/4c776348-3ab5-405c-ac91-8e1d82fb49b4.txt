If you like sliders, then this is the place for you! It's certainly not a flashy place. The interior could certainly do with some improvements, but that's not why people come here. People come here for the food. If you're a health conscious type, this place won't be your cup of tea, but if you want delicious sliders at a bargain price, go to the Chicago Hamburger Company. You won't be disappointed.
