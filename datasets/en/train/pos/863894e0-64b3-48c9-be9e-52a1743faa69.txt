Non corporate coffee

Solo cafe has become my new favorite place to have my cup of joe and work.
 
Ty makes a rockin americano or cappucino and they have a great variety of teas and some awesome pastries. 

The vibe in the place is very cool with awesome artwork and cool tunes in the background - no muzak.

It is also not too loud and has free and easy wifi and outlets everywhere. Might just trade in my gold starbucks card.
