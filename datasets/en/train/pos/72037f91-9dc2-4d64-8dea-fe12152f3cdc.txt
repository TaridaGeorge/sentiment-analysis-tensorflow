The restaurant was recommended to me by the chef at Digestif. He told me to come here and get the corned beef hash. So I did, and it was excellent. I had never had corned beef hash before and I was glad I tried it. It is definitely not the healthiest meal you can have, but it was a nice change. 

The person I went with got the garlic and mushroom omelet. It had a thick sherry sauce covering the eggs. The sauce looked similar to gravy, which might sound weird for breakfast, but it was amazing! I have never had anything like it at all for breakfast. This sauce would be great for dinner too, with chicken or some other type of meat. 

It was definitely a very filling meal, but both dishes were very good and I would suggest giving this place a try.
