I haven't been to a TGIF's in years until recently and boy was I shocked!!  So was my husband.  The food is amazing!!.  Seriously they have Chefs back there and they definately know how to cook.  My husband hates salmon but at this TGIF's it comes out perfect everytime.  Even better then the salmon we have received at resaraunts in CAlifornia.  We are sooo happy to be loyal customers of TGIF's of Superstition Springs.  The Bartenders are amazing too.  Drink specials are the bomb
