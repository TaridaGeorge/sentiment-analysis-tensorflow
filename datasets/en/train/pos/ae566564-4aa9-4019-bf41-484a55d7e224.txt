There are so few places worth the hype.. Cornish Pasty.. THE EXCEPTION.  The Pilgram is the Third Thursday of November in one bite.. Truly unique, and one of the most take you to a place, and time bites.. The decor, music, and the staff, really make this place work, The prices are right in line, and they have a real kick ass beer selection, I have read about spotty service, and I could see that being the case, but man... the food.. Probably the best meal under 10 bucks in the Copa.. Thanks CP!
