Yes my favorite place.  I first went there when it opened 20 years ago.  Still it's always consistent, always just great!  The thai tea is a gotta have.  I like the Tom ka gai soup.   THe clear noodles are my favorite.  I can never pronounce it, and just go with the waiters recommendation if you don't understand.  I like a little spicy, so just let them know how you want it.  I highly recommend this place.  Give it try....
