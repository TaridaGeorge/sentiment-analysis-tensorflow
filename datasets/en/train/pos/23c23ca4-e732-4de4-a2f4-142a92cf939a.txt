Had to write them another quick review since my first review of Tutti's.  Tutti Santi has become my only Italian restaurant that I'll go to in Phoenix....folks it simply is the best in town.  I've become a regular here, and the entire restaurant treats you like family...its always a joy coming in here.  If I could rate them 10 stars, I would.  Everything I've tried on the menu is outstanding...their pasta's are some of the best I've ever tried.  I could go on and on about this place, but I'll just keep it simple.....GO HERE!  And sit at the bar with Deb....she will take wonderful care of you.
