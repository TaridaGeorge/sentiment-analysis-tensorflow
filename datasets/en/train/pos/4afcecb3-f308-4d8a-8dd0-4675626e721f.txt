Great Place for casual dining!

Choose your own everything (Meat, Cheese, Bun, Toppings, ETC).  Food and Service is always great!  Ive been here about 10 times in the year ive lived in chandler and its always good.  Have nothing bad to say!  Not sure how the lady below (sara) has that opinion about the place.  I could only imagine being married to that!!  They serve burgers and beer....how is it possible to mess that up?

Highly recommended for casual dining if your in the mood for Burgers!!!
