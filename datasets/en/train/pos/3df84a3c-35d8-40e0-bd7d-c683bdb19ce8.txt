It's awesome how this place combines korean dishes with japanese food choices.  I was able to get a korean dish named 'daji balkogi' (I believe that's how it was spelled) at the same time as my favorite sushi rolls.  The miso soup they bring to you as part of your meal is always great as well.  They do not serve alcoholic beverages (saki is not a choice), so keep that in mind.  It's small but worth the visit.  They are good people, I love them.
