My boyfriend and I went to Hunan after trying a few chinese places in Chandler. When we called the lady didnt speak very good english so we knew this place would be authentic. It definately was authentic!!! We are very very satisfied with everything! Ive uploaded some pictures we ordered 3 combos and 2 sides. Cheap , Huge amounts (as shown in pictures) and service was kind and satifactory.
