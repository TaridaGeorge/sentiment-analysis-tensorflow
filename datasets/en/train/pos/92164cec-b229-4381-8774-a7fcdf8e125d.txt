This place is great.

The decor and atmosphere is cozy and hip. 

We had a couple of their house drinks. Me: the blueberry cosmo, my hubby the dark and stormy. Delish. We also shared a basket of wedges which I HIGHLY recommend. My hubby had the mac and cheese w/ classic (yes classic) bacon. He loved it, even the next day. He said his fave thing about it is that the cheese stayed creamy throughout the entire meal, it never got hard. I had the lobster and seafood crepes. Um, yeah. So incredibly delicious. 

The desserts were great too. red velvet cake and fruit crepes. Mmmmmmmm......
