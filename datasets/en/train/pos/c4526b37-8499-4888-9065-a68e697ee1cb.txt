Yesterday was my first time at this restaurant.  I had never had lo mein before ( I thought it was similar to chow mein) and I was unpleasantly surprised.  Not the restaurants fault- I just really didn't like it.  When the manager noticed that I was picking at my food, he asked me if everything was ok.  I told him that I didn't like the noodles so he offered to change it out for me.  All of the people who worked there were very friendly and pleasant, but the manager was really on top of it and I have to give him credit for being observant!!  I wouldn't have went up to complain because I ordered it.  But I wasn't going to eat it and I was kind of surprised at that kind of service! 
Way to go Pei Wei!!
