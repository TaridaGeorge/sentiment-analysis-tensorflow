This place is awesome!!!  I am a die-hard fan of Robert's in Tucson but this is the first place that gives them a run for their money.  Homemade thick slabs of bread served with fresh strawberry jam and an egg scramble with spinach and havarti = breakfast heaven.  This place is tiny and I'm sure gets packed as we went on a Tuesday morning and there was a small wait but it's so worth it!
