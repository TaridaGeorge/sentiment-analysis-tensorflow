First, superb service.  Not just polite - but really friendly.  I recommend the barramundi in panko crust.  I think it was better than the barramundi I had in Australia, which generally just tasted like cod.  I'm not a big steak person, and 'roo just tastes like steak.  But still, the kangaroo medallions my husband had were nice.  Great atmosphere.  Nice beers (Firestone Walker IPA); they also have some O'Dells.
