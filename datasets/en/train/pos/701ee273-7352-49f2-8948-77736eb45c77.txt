I've only been here once, but I have to give it a 5--this was easily the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten.  Every aspect of it was perfect, from the freshly made bread that was crisp on the outer layer and chewy inside, to the wonderfully sauteed peppers and onions, it was mouth-watering just to gaze upon.  They use white American, which is a requirement to me for a good cheesesteak (don't come at me with this provolone stuff, not on a cheesesteak).  All this goodness for $5.  How can you beat that??

I also picked up some great quality ingredients for my next homemade pizza while I was there--San Marzano tomatoes, imported pepperoni from Chicago, and some cherry peppers.
