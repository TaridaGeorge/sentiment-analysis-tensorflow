Love this place!  Their slices are delicious (and HUGE) and a great deal.  Service is always fast and good.  Their loyalty programs (frequent visits and VIP card) are also great.   The fact that they're locally owned and support the local community doesn't hurt either.  :)

It's basically the only place I go to for pizza nowadays.  1 slice is more than enough, and I love that I can get it just the way that I want.  If you're a member of their VIP program (free to join) you can also get the slices for dinner too.
