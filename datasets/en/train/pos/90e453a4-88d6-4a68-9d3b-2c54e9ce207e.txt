man what an amazing PHX bar ,.,. I wish every out of towner went here....been her 4 times but only drank twice....last time 10/13/07

Decor: Imagine your next door neighbors old historic house converted to a bar oh and your house is an Art gallery....and so is the bar........the bar has rotating art really difrrent stuff that yet sets the feeling of the Lost leaf...Music on some nights...

People! great during First fridays...packed great mix of good creative people with so crazy, Stilt walkers, Fire breathers, Sword swallowers one night,... laid back old reguars and musicans another night.... the first friday they where packed....but the other friday was good too...

Drinks....well priced but they mainly have beer and wine...they didn't have some hard liquer I was looking for...

can't find something wrong to give - stars too....must go back and investigate....
