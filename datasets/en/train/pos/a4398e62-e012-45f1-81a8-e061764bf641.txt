We went to Roka Akor for happy hour this past weekend and had THE BEST JAPANESE FOOD EVER! 

What we ordered:
-"Chibi" Burger (3oz) with Homemade Sesame Bun   [MUST TRY]          
-Cremini Mushroom Burger with Wasabi Aioli   
-Robata Grilled Zucchini with Miso Mustard     
-Cremini Mushrooms with Soy garlic Butter     
-Sweet Corn Tempura                                              
-Seasonal Vegetables, Prawn, and Butterfish Tempura     
-Roast Duck with Kimchi Udon  [MUST TRY]
-Butterfish Tataki with White Asparagus and Yuzu  [MUST TRY]
-Hamachi Serrano Chili Roll  [MUST TRY]

What we loved:  Everything. Seriously, EVERYTHING!

Victoria did a great job describing  and giving suggestions (since it was our first time). Food was delicious and drinks (mojitos + maritinis)  were great.
Yes, it is expensive but definitely worth it!
