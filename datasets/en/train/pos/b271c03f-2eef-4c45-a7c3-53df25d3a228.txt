This place is great!  I went a few months ago for the grand opening and decided to venture back to see if my first impression was still validated.... Absolutely!!! I love this place. Especially the fact that everything is under 475 calories. IMO, I don't think that anything tastes like it has been trimmed back for calorie content. I got a greek salad to start, my main course was the Fliet Mingion with mashed potatoes and rosted veggies. and the Rocky Road mini dessert. Delicious!!  For a Tuesday night the place was packed! We grabbed the last two bar stools and waited for 30 mins until a booth in the bar opened up. Next time I will definitely make reservations.
