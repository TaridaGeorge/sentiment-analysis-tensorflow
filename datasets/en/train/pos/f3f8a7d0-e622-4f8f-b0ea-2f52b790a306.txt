Love at first taste! My buddy at work asked me if I have had lunch already cuz she's getting a Vietnamese food - I thought it was a good idea so I'm like, forget my brown bag and go for the Chow Mein! And boy was it so damn good - I always love it when the portion is enormous that I couldn't eat it all at one meal! :D The Chow Mein is packed with veggies and lotsa seafoods! For $6, what a deal! Looking forward to another Phu Thanh lunch soon, and looking forward to eat in their restaurant so I can try other menu they have.
