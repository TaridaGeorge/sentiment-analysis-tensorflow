I have to say that of course the view is spectacular, but that is not the only reason we try and frequent Different Pointe of View! It is the service, and attention paid to guests! The knowledge and talent of the chef and every staff member - the daily risotto i had on Saturday was a Parmesan and garlic risotto with duck mousse folded in, and slices of duck all around with a raspberry citrus sauce that was absolutely incredible - i ordered it on recommendation of our favorite server - Ian- i was a bit nervous because i don't like duck...BUT, i finished every bite! Chef Anthony, Ian, and really everyone, make it a fantastic, personal experience every time, and they keep us craving more of their excellent food, amazing personalities, and unmatched talent.
