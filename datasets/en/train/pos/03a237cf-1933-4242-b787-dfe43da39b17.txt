Schnitzel, Spatzle, and Pretzel oh my! Did I mention beer too? 
These are just a few of the reasons I love (and you will too) Haus Murphy's. Set in Old Town Glendale one may not think to look for this gem. 
I recommend the Jager Schnitzel: Mushrooms in brown gravy with a delightful piece of fried pork....hungry yet? 
My husband swears by the sausages, and beer served here. I agree with him on the beer...You are allotted a GIANT beer (if so desired, and frankly who wouldn't desire this?) with lovely flavor. 
The staff is friendly and helpful. Check this one out! Zer Goot!
