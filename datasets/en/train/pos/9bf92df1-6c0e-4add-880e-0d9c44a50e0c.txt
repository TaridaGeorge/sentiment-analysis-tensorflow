What a great place for pizza. Everything about the food was perfect. The dough, the sauce (amount of and flavor) the cheese, the amount of grease even! I had the pepperoni and kalamata olive pizza, the olives were fresh and delicious as well. 

I have also visited the Grimaldi's in Texas (Allen) - they really keep all their restaurants in great condition all with really fresh ingredients.

It seemed like it was a date place too, lots of dates going on when I was there, that always makes for good people watchin'
