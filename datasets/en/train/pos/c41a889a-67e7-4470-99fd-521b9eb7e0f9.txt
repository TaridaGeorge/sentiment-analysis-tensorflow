Echo Coffee is rockin'!  I am in love with their coffee and espresso drinks.  

I have gone in several times a week since they opened and I see that Echo is getting more popular.  I usually run in for a to-go cup, but last weekend I met a girlfriend there and we visited for 2 hours.  They offer sofas and table with chairs, so it's quite comfortable to sit and talk or get some work done (with their FREE Wi-Fi).

The staff is always friendly and helpful.  I haven't tried any pastries yet - not because I haven't wanted to because they look delicious.  I had a small cookie on my latte saucer last weekend and it was delicious. 

Echo Coffee is proving to be a great little independent coffee shop.  Their beans are roasted on site and I can tell it's a labor of love for the owner.
