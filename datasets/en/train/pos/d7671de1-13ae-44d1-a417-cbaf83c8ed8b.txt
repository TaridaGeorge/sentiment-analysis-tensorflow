Love this place. I had the mint chocolate chip with a toasted marshmallow on top. It was the best chocolate chip mint I ever had. You can see the tiny flecks of real mint leaves in the ice cream. Oh! And the marshmallow was a fun touch. Homemade marshmallow that they toast with a blowtorch (I loves me a blowtorch). Also, the people working behind the counter are super nice.
