Sushi, you are such a cruel mistress! So delicate, so laboriously prepared, such a sweet and pleasant sensation to my taste buds; yet so pricey! Sakana is a great candidate when in the running next to Tokyo Lobby. 

Sakana carries fig vodka, the BEST stuff you will ever drink! I had my first drink of it here, and for that I will remain grateful. They are also open everyday of the week for dinner from 5:30 - 9:30 PM, where as TL is closed on Sunday. 

I must say I have never waited in a line here, but I would. Sit at the sushi bar and buy your "bar tender" a Kirin; you won't regret it!
