Fantastic dinner! Service was excellent and the food was great. I had the Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream Sauce...one of the most fantastic steaks I've had. The hubby had the porterhouse steak and it was equally as visually appealing and tasty. We shared the Asparagus with Hollandaise Sauce and Sam's Mashed Potatoes; both fantastic.
