this is my favorite store in the scottsdale fashion square.

make sure you hit their clearance sales after the holidays for 50 percent off of pre-wrapped gift boxed sets.

i do that and always have a stash of pre-wrapped gifts for showers, birthday parties, hostess gifts, etc.!

ask for a free sample from any soaps in their lines. i use my sample soaps on vacation instead of lugging a larger bar!

5 star service from the employees always!
