I've been here a bajillion times because I used to live up the street. I've tried every type of meat and all of the vegetable dishes.  

The falafel is a little bland, but if you cover it in their garlic dip it doesn't matter.  Other than that, everything is fabulous.  The first thing I ever ate was the baked lamb sandwich and it was divine.  I just had lunch there yesterday and I'm salivating writing this review and thinking about it.

The restaurant is very nicely decorated and the family that runs the place is super nice and friendly.  I can't believe how empty this place usually is, especially since Pita Jungle is across the street and parking is impossible over there.

They have a lunch buffet but I've never partaken.
