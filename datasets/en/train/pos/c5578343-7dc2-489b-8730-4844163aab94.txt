This place makes Yelpzilla miss home. I mean nothing makes me want to destroy Tokyo like spending an afternoon at Mekong in the Tea section. This place has great service and even though its in Mesa you don't feel like you are once you make it in the building. I have discovered so many new flavors here. I enjoy the butcher and the meat and fish selections. Everything is very fresh. One thing they could stop doing is wrapping all the veggies and fruit in plastic.
