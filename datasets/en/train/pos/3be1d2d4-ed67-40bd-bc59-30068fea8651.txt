Lifetime fitness is the bomb. How do I know this? Because I have worked out at probably 100 different gyms during my 8 years of traveling the country playing minor league baseball. 

At Lifetime you get what you pay for and Lifetime is not cheap. It's always meticulously clean, stocked with towels and has plenty of free and pay for classes if you like classes. If you wanted to, you could literally spend the whole day at Lifetime at have everything you need from the cafe, pool, child care (max 2 hours), hair and nail salon, free WiFi, lounging area in the locker room with couches and a flat screen TV, Jacuzzi, sauna, etc, etc, etc. 

If you don't mind the price, 40/mnth for a basic membership, you will love Lifetime and never want to work out anywhere else.
