I love the second location of Mamma Mia because it is closer to where I live, but this place has something the downtown location does not: Corn.

Yes, I love corn on my pizza.  Specifically with ricotta cheese.  I also love when I can spend so little on such quality.  If you haven't had the pizza here, then you are denying yourself of a Phoenix institution.  And definitely have some corn on it.
