If I could give this office ten stars, I'd do it gladly.  We discovered this office, accidentally, and feel so lucky we did.  Our pediatrician is Dr. Hartsook, who is AMAZING.  He's the perfect combination of professional and personal.  He treats my son so well and talks to us with kindness.  As first time parents with a lot of questions, he is so patient and encouraging.  He talks to us from two perspectives: as a doctor and as a father. The office is run very efficiently. We've only had to wait ten or fifteen minutes for our appointment, at most.  We've also had appointments with Dr. B and Marilyn, both who were great, too.  I highly, highly recommend Dr. Hartsook at WV Pediatrics.  He's the best!!
