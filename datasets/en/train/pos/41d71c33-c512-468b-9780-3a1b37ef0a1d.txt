We went there on a busy Saturday night and the service was excellent.
The staff even welcomed us back and it's been at least 9 years since I was there last.
The shrimp were fresh and good size. My wife loved the halibut and my lamb chops were cooked to perfection.
We had a wonderful time at Donovan's.
