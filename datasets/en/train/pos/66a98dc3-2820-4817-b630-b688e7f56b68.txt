While visiting the Chandler area, I decided to check out Grimaldi's off Ray Road. Holy Cow! I ordered the Pesto Pizza with chicken and garlic (recommended by our fabulous waitress, Jess), and the White Sangria. The ambiance, the food, and the friendly service is enough to make me a repeat customer. Just two weeks later, I strolled in again with my date, and Jess remembered us from the first time. I like Grimaldi's because it's genuine. You DO get what you pay for.
