I canceled my plan two years ago cause i was so fed up with Verizons B.S and my boss made me switch back and omg this location has improved soooo much they went above and beyond to help me out and i LOVE my droid razor maxx its amazing and the sales girl Krista was so helpful. And i asked her to not worry about switching my contacts over cause i had 1000+ contacts and all of them were mostly copies and she somehow fixed it when the Val vista one couldnt and i didnt get to say thanks so much. Alma school Verizon hooked me up today. Thanks so much!
