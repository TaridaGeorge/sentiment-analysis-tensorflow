It's been ages since I've been to a Bahama Bucks! I really love this place, they have the best shaved ice and just about a gazillion flavors (even pickle juice folks, seriously). And what can be better than a delicious shaved ice in the valley of the sun??? 

They also have great smoothies and other treats, and I just saw today that they do 1/2 price sodas from 2-5PM each afternoon. I wanna go back and try the Caribbean soda, it sounded lip smacking good.

My last tip: splurge for the cream on top of your shaved ice. It's 50 cents of pure heaven...
