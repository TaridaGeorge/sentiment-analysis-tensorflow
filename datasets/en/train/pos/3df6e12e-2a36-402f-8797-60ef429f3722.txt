Definitely for the ladies!! sorry guys...but on occassion you will see a poor bloke dragged along by his other half!!
I probably frequent Arcadia Farms once a quarter and I have never had a bad meal - while the service can be inconsistent - Im ok in building my anticipation for the meal!! ....and the reward  is a blessing.
The back patio (in fair weather) is my favorite spot with the sun playing peek-a-boo.
I think that I have tried every salad on their menu - my fav being the strawberry chicken salad...but you have got to try the Wild Mushroom, Spinach & Goat Cheese Tart (....salivating now)
 A great place to catch up with the girls =0)
