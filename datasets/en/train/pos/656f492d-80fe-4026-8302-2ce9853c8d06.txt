Two words: WORTH IT.

Unlike some other wood fire joints in town, this one lives up to the hype.

Every pie Ive had there has been delicious. Great, fresh ingredients, good sauces.

We always bring people from out of town here and they love it.

Good local beer and wine selection. Kitchy, cozy atmosphere. 

Oh and did I mention the dessert crepes? Wonderful. Any of them it doesnt matter: chocolate, strawberries, bananas, Nutella...... seriously theyre amazing.

*We* always seem to beat the rush, but its worth the wait.
