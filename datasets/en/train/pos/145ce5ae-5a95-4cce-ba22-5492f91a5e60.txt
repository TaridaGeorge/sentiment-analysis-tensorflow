Nello's is our favorite neighborhood pizza place, hands down.  It's a family owned restaurant, been open for 20+ years, and the quality is outstanding on every menu item.  Our favorite is the Garden Salad with the house dressing, and a pizza that is not on the menu -- we call it the Rich Ihle special -- BBQ chicken, pineapple and jalepenos.  Ask for the whole wheat crust; it's the best.  We also like the lasagna, the eggplant parmesan, the wings (ask for them to be double baked), and all the other pizzas on the menu.    You can't go wrong with Nello's.
