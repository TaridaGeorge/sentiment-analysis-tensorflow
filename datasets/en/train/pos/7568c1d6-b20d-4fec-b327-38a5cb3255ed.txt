Oh yeah... my ATF in Phoenix.

Had lunch here today with a customer. As usual, the restaurant is pretty cool, service good, and food ridiculously good. They even have a rather significant GF section of their menu - and suggestions throughout the menu on how to order stuff Gluten Free. Cool.

The Artichoke heart thingamabob appetizer is unreal. It's dipped in love, broiled until awesome, and served with a teaspoon or two of holy shit that's good....

I ordered the Strawberry Something or Other salad with blackened chicken. The chicken breast was sliced paper thin and spread throughout the salad - which is different than I am used to. Now I can't ever order chicken on a salad again because I'll want it "Claim Jumper style". DAMN YOU CLAIM JUMPER.....

Huge portions, good food, and good service. It's a fiver...
