Mikado is about 2 minutes away from our house which is the main reason why my boyfriend and I frequent it so much, but the sushi is also fabulous. The fish is very fresh (we are huge fans of the albacore onion sashimi) and the rolls are really good too. We tend to get more rolls than nigiri but both never disappoint. It's not the biggest restaurant inside but we've never had an issue getting a table- we usually sit at the same one :). We have never had bad sushi at this place which is why we keep coming back.
