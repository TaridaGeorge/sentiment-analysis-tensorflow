I am never babysitting again!!! It is harder than it looks. I was watching my uncles little kids and someone failed to mention that if I bought peanuts at the gas station I needed to wash my hands before making them lunch....

So here I am with a willywonka blueberry girl swelling up like a hot air balloon. So I went to the nearest place to their house. I was in a panic, couldn't find their insurance cards, and for a second told them my niece's name was jazz (my cats name) hahaha They literally saved her life and helped me to not have a stroke.
