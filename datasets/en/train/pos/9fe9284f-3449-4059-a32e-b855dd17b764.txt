Mojo, you know I love you, but I hope you're listening. 

This place has some non-fruit flavored non-dairy fro-yo. And it's delicious. Like, totally delicious. Darn good topping selection. 

Yogurt Builderz has a neighborhood feel contrasted with Mojo's art/deco-ness. Thank goodness, there's room for everyone in this fro-yo woah ho. 

And there it is, one of the things I believe, a little fro-yo life lesson, that there is enough of everything for everyone. The universe provides.
