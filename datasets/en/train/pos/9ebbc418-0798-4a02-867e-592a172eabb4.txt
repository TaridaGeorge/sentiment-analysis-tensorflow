I suggested to the man that we go out to WCG as I had been there once before.  Shane made a reservation for 9:00 pm which was convenient as we are late eaters from time to time.  We were greeted and seated very quickly.  The atmosphere is very dark and intimate, very nice for any couple or date.  Our waitress greeted us with a smile and was very knowledgeable of the menu.

I have to say that this place serves one of the BEST Pork Tenderloins I have ever eaten.  The meat is so tender you could cut it with a fork and it came with a very complimentary apricot glaze and mashed potatoes.  Shane had a stake and a few mohitos and I had a pomegranate martini both were equally fantastic.

In all we both had our entrees, an appetizer, desert, and 4 drinks for under $100.00.
