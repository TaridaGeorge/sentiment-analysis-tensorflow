I've been here for brunch 3 times now, and it only gets better. The unlimited champagne is a requirement for brunch, but it actually tastes good. Most unlimited champagne brunches end up making me sick because the bubbly is vile....not this one. The food is amazing, the service is fantastic. The patio is great, with a live band and everything. Last time i was there, we sat for hours enjoying the atmosphere (and drinking champange, of course).
