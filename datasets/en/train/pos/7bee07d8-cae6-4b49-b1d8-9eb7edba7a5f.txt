I love The Capital Grille! All of their steak options are great, you really cant go wrong. Whatever you do, you must order the Lobster Mac and cheese for your side!!!!! Its my favorite side dish in the world. Its so rich, creamy, delicious, and has large chunks of delicious lobster meat all throughout. You wont be dissapointed!
