No wonder the summit trail here is one of the most heavily used trails in the country. The climb gives you a fantastic workout and rewards you with ever-changing awesome views of the Phoenix mountains and pretty much the entire Valley as you make your ascent. Be sure to bring water, as you can easily get dehydrated during the ascent even during cool days, and bringing a camera wouldn't be such a bad idea either.
