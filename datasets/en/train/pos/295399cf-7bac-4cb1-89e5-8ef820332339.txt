I feel like a cheap whore giving a place like Barro's Pizza five stars. Shouldn't those be reserved for such esteemed places like Cibo or Pizzeria Bianco? Eh, whatev.  The pizza here is delicious, they are way inexpensive, and you get very full, very quickly. The interior of this location is kinda dingy, but clean, so I don't mind sitting on the same booth that has been there since 1986 (or whenever the place opened).  The pizza is what I'm looking for when I want a good, hearty, slice of pie.  Try the Kona, you won't be sorry.
