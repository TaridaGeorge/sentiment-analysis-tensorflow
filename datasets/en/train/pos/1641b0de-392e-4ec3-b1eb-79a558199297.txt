The absolutely most delicious restaurant I've been to in a while. It serves some blend of Swiss & French cuisine, and has cheese on pretty much EVERYTHING! I suppose it would have limited options for the lactose intolerant... but for everyone else it's a must!

The service was great, though a tiny bit on the slow side. Our waiter was beyond helpful and friendly. The atmosphere was very European and welcoming. We had a cheese fondue, savory crepe, and chocolate fondue. If I had more room in my stomach I would have kept going! Our waiter boxed up everything we couldn't finish--including the chocolate fondue. She even added a few extras to our takeout box!

There is a full bar in a separate area that apparently has live music on some nights. Can't wait to go back and check it out!
