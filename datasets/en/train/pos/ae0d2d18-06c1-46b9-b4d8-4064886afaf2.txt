I love this place!!!  We always get great service- whether we are in a hurry or we just want to sit back and enjoy.  My absolute favorite thing is their Baba Ganoosh the broiled eggplant puree with tahini sauce, yogurt, fresh garlic and lemon juice.-- it is the best I ever had.   I have even gone their to get it to go and took it back to Oklahoma for my family to try!!!  

I am glad they are expanding-
