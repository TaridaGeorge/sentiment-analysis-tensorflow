It's a favorite of mine, my family and many of my friends. In all the years I've been going here I've yet to have a bad experience. Service has always been great and the food, oh the food :) It's one of the few places where I have a hard time deciding what to eat, every dish I've ordered has been great so while I stick with the usual at other places, at Caffe Boa I'm always excited to try something else. If I had to choose a favorite dish or something to recommend to newcomers, it's the pasta dishes, now which one is up to you!
