I've run the gamut on onion rings... from two days ago experiencing the worst at Pete's, to today experiencing the best at Joe's.

These people were on their A-game tonight. The pulled pork & baby backs had such a flavorful smokey essence, while the chicken strips were an amazing taste combination between chicken parm and BBQ sauce.  Did I mention they have the best onion rings ever?

A great example of a restaurant that doesn't skimp, rather display an eye for detail. It takes more prep time, but it's worth it, and it shows.

The shrimp basket was very good, and the homemade cocktail sauce was the crowning jewel.

What's better than a surry with a fringe on top?  Howz about a hot dog with an egg on top.  Delectable!
