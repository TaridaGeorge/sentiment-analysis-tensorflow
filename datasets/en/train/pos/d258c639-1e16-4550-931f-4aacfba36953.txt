The Royale is my new favourite theater in the valley due to the movies they're screening. Lots of new kitschy stuff (but not too artsy or off the wall, those are left to FilmBar in Phoenix) and occasional old movies that deserve some big-screen love. Where else can you go to get your old-school grindhouse on one night and catch a flick about hunting mythical Norwegian trolls the next?
