I have just made a list of 9 more items I would like to try. If I really could convey how good this restaurant is I would never be able you get a table.  I have been called a foodie and a food snob which is all pretty true. This little family owned restaurant amazed me with the flavors. This is now my favorite place to eat. I have been looking for people to take there just so I can sample what they order. I belong to a lunch club and we have been trying new restaurants for three years now and Chou's Kitchen has been the jewel.  Trust me you will love Chou's Kitchen.
