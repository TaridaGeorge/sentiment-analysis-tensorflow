Sharp, fast and cheap! Sometimes you can have all three! 

He charges something like $0.58 per inch of steel. Let me tell you, if you've never had your knives done, this is DIRT CHEAP!

He even did my pocket knife back to sharper than it came from Benchmade. 

I was super impressed with the guy, then I took the knives home and started cooking for 30 of my best friends. I used every knife in the arsenal, and for the first time in a couple years they worked like they should. 

I would absolutely go back again.
