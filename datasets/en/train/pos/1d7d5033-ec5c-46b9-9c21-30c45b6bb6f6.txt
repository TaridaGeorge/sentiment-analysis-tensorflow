The BEST GUYS ever! And if I am ever unemployed, I hope they give me a job. Great service, very personable, and a good supply of merchandise. Check out their not-so-newly-acquired collection of vintage bikes. If you're ever having a bad day, go to Sun, test drive a bike, and crack some jokes with Joe. 
I recently purchased a $30 thrift store bike for my besty's b-day, and Joe really went out of his way to strip my bike, offer powder coating advice, and then re-assemble and pimp out the new bike. Totally exceeded my expectations!
