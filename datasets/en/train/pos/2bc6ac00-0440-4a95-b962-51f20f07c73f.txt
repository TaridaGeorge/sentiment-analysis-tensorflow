Was in Az, visiting from Cali last week. when I decided to check out yelp for some good eats. Thank you fellow yelpers. Cause this place is SO good, I ordered the avocado club burger and some fried pickles Delish! pickles were on the oily side but still good, my mom ordered the mushroom burger and sweet potato fries and my sister ordered a chicken sandwich with the smash fries, all were very good and next time I'm in town I will definately be back for a burger!
