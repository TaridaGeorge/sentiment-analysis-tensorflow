This is a classic Tempe institution. If you haven't been there, you need to go. Great diner food and some of the best breakfast foods around. The wait staff is great and the prices are very reasonable. A couple favorites are the chorizo and eggs and the tom mix. Great for a quick breakfast or lunch!
