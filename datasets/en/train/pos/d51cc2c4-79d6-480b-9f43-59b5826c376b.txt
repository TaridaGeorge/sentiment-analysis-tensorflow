Burlesque done well, in the true spirit of the art form!  I especially love their diverse pool of performers. This group seems to gather together the best of the best and clearly have a good time doing what they do best! As a performer I get to work with a wide array of performers from many different artistic backgrounds and I have to say...I have had the pleasure of working with them from time to time and they are always a joy to create art with! Be sure to check them out when they come to a venue near you!
