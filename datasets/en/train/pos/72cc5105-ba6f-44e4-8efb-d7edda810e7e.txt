I'm kinda stingy about giving up 5 stars but this place is the real deal.

I've been to the Biltmore True Food location and it was OK but I like this new place better.  The building has plenty of light and high ceilings.  The service is very friendly and efficient.  Lots of Scottsdale pretty people dining here to observe as entertainment.

I ordered the shrimp dumplings to start.  Not only did they taste great but the presentation was beautiful with the dumplings and broccoli.

I also ordered the shaved turkey pita.  This was enormous and every bite was delicious.  I had a nice combination of squash and kale on the side.

I like this place a lot and will be back soon.
