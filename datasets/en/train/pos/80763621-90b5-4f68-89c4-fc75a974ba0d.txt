Great place for a meal, beer, or coffee.  They really are able to make it all work, one of my favorite places in the valley, and I'm willing to make the drive from Tempe just to get their espresso which is one of the best I've had in Phoenix.  Staff is so much fun, food is fresh and the ingredients are top notch.
