We've ordered from House of Yang twice now (delivery both times) & we've been very pleased with he quality of the food, how quick the delivery arrives & the overall value.  We didn't have a Chinese food option prior to finding House of Yang & now that we've found them, they're our "go to".  We highly recommend!  Particularly their Beef & Broc & Chicken Fried Rice!
