Best chicken fried steak bar none in Phoenix.  I come here only for that but the fresh lemonade rocks here too.  The atmosphere is VERY casual and VERY country.  I cant stand country music but its worth it for this place.  It is also a pretty inexpensive place for a good steak if you are looking.  Service is always good, parking is what really sucks here but if you go when there is not a big rush you will be okay.
