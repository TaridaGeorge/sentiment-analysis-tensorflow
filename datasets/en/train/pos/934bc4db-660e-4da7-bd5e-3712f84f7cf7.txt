It can get confusing with one barista helping walk-in and drive-through customers simultaneously. Yet, they seem to do a great job overall. The line moves quickly, and 99% of the time, they get my order right. I'd say that's pretty good considering I go there about 4 times a week, so I've had a lot of drinks from there.
