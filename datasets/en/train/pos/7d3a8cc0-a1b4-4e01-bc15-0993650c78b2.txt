A couple coworkers took me here for a HH for the first time. Immediately, I was impressed with the patio. I'm not sure why the patio hasn't become one of the area's favorites -- it is awesome!

Once I walked into the place, I was even more impressed. Not fancy, but classy. The customers truly ran the spectrum -- students, businessmen, blue-collar, and more. Everyone was there, felt welcome, and were having a good and relaxed time.

The beer selection is good, and the drinks are not watered down. The food is really tasty, and the prices are not too bad.

And the atmosphere rocks!

This place could (and probably will) seriously become my hang-out!
