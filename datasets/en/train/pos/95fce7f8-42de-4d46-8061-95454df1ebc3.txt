I just love the Roaring Fork!!!  I have been here countless times and every time has been a wonderful experience!!!  They have a nice big restaurant with two large patios. Warm ambiance. The food is spectacular...I loved the fish tacos..oh and that mac and cheese with the green chilies..MMMMM!!!  Great drinks and great service too!!
