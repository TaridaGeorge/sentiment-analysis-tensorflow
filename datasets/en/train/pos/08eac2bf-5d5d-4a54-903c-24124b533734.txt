It's kinda silly to review a bank but like the other Yelper who reviewed this location, I just wanted to give props to their friendly staff.  Britney helped me the other day and she was friendly and efficient!  Also, I didn't really have to wait at all, but then I went on slightly off hours.

The location is a lil tucked off the main road so don't miss it!

See ya there!
