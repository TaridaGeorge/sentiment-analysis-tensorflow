I can't believe it took me so long to give this place a try! Located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale, Sola brews up delicious hot and iced coffee drinks that anyone would love. It's the perfect atmosphere to bring your laptop and work while listening to vinyl records that are constantly being rotated by the baristas. There are plenty of big and small tables to choose from, as well as two couches and some outdoor seating. The baristas are friendly and knowledgeable, there's free wi-fi, the prices are reasonable, and the decor is simple yet modern. I will definitely be back!
