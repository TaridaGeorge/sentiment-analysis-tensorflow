I can thoroughly recommend this "old-style European" tailor for your alterations.   

I purchased an expensive blue blazer at The Wizard of Aahs online store (http://www.thewizardofaahs.com/ - another great recommendation) knowing that it would need alterations.  I took it to Jose who did a very professional job of taking in the jacket for the reasonable price of $60, with a three-day turnaround.
