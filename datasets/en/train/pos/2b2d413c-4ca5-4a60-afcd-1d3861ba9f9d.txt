Ever since I met my significant other I have been hearing rave reviews about Babbo.  He absolutely loves the sandwiches and craves them often enough to peel himself away from the pool and drive across town for Saturday afternoon lunch take-out.  

I have only been once and had a really great experience.  We sat outside on a beautiful day enjoying delicious food and great conversation.  If I could change one thing, I would place Babbo in a location overlooking something better than a sea of compact cars.

Great place for outdoor lunch, great service, great food!
