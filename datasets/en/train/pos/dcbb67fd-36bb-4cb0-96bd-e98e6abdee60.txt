Frank S.'s honest, down-to-earth style, long history in the Phoenix community and great prices are what keeps me sending my colleagues and acquaintances his way.

You won't find him amidst the oneupping dealers on Camelback trying to outdo each other with blow-up signs and false advertising. No hidden tricks or lemon shenanigans, just straightforward, honest and no-pressure deals.

Check out his new covered parking lot. Those are (going to be) solar electric panels on top!
