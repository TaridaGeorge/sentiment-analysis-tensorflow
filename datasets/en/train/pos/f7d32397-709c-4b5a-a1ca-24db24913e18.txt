I've been meaning to put this review up for a while to thank Big O Tires and Rob for a job well done. My experiences here have been more like Hillary's and not Tanya's. Rob is the man! A complete professional, very friendly and personable and makes you feel like your car is in good hands (which it is!).  

Rob will make sure you are completely taken care of and make your car "right as rain". My girlfriend and I brought in our cars before a cross country road trip to get a good amount of work done. Big O was quick and we have no complaints about the quality of their work. I since have moved away from Arizona, but if and when I return in a couple years, I'll be sure to return to this Big O for my car maintenance needs.
