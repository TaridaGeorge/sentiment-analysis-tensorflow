St. Francis has been on my list of places to try for nearly a year and I finally went and wish I had been going sooner. YUM!
Let me just say that the baked goat cheese app sold me on this place in addition to the simple yet rustic ambiance. 
I also had the forbidden rice with veggies. I want to go back and try the pizza, salmon, seafood cioppino, and all of their hearty salads. 
This place is fun. Great for a date, families going out for a nosh or with friends - I would even go solo!
