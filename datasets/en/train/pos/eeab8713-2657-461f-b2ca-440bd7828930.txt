Bikini, I love you. Love you love you love you.

This is a REAL place, complete with all the things you would expect from a dive bar. It's what I think of when I think of a bar that has been around forever and has withstood the test the time. Plus you have Shane the Wonder DJ playing Thursday and Friday nights-he is THE MAN and has amazing music and knows how to make it all work. Shane is GOLD to me. Real people drink here, even though I would never come in on a First Friday because I don't do the hipster thing. Yeah, the bathrooms are grungy and it's not antiseptic. Go to Scottsdale if you need a McBar and for everything to be perfect and pretty. The Bikini ROCKS if you are a real, non-plastic person.
