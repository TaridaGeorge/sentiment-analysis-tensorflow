So when I read in the paper that the owners were real Italians, I rushed over to try the gelato. It's heaven!!! I've tried 7 flavors and they are all really good, especially the spicy chocolate and the mango. I combined 3 flavors in one cup the second time I went and it was like a miracle in my mouth; took me right back to my visit to Italy. The owners are so friendly and you feel like you're in a real neighborhood type place instead of a strip mall when you are inside trying to choose from the staggering amount of flavors. Unlike out-of-the-way favorites that people want to keep secret so that they don't get too crowded, I want everyone to come and enjoy the gelato here so that it has plenty of business and never closes down!
