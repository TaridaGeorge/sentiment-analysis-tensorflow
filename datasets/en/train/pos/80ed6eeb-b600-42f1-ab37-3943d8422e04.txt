One more five-star review for Postino Central. I have been to the original Postino and, of course, love it for its cute setting, interesting selection of beers and wines, and great prices!
The only real difference between the Central and Arcadia locations is the same as the difference between Central and Arcadia....both are yuppie, but Central slightly less so. Also, of course, Central has a slightly more 'urban' vibe. Bottom line, if you are a yelper, you will probably like both Postinos, but you will LOVE Postino Central!
