I had a proceedure "Ulthera" at Dr. Halmi's office. It is an amazing transformation. I look much younger. It was easy, no down time. I was nervous at first but his nurse Ann was very comforting. It's been three months and now when I see myself in pictures I am just amazed how much younger I look. I like to look in the mirror now. Thank you Dr. Halmi! You are a great Doctor.
