So I'm a big movie buff, and I absolutely love going to the movies! With that said, this is my favorite theater hands down! This place has good prices, comfy seats, and great popcorn (the caramel is incredible). It also features a little cafe with decent food if you're hungry. But I'll tell you, the thing that makes this place 5 stars is the people! They remember your face, always say hi, and just plain nice! It's amazing what difference a friendly smile makes!
