If you're looking for a great local coffee spot with plenty of tables, free wifi and local flare, then Xtreme Bean is your spot. They have a wide array of drinks and they're open later than most Phoenix area coffee shops. The place is cool especially since it's a retrofit from a bank. Great spot for creatives.
