I Love this place. I come here a couple times a week for lunch. Fast lunch time service. I get there when they open and I am able to get back to work in no time at all. I have had several things on the menu and everything is Great. They make mine Triple Thai Spicy for me and it is perfect. A couple of my all time favorites are Spicy eggplant with beef and Pad Kee Mow.
