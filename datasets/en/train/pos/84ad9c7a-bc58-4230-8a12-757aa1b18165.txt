This place has amazing ice cream, candies, desserts, and pastries. The ice cream itself has interesting and unique flavors. The store has little trinkets and toys that are somewhat useless, but interesting. The ambiance is a very classic, old-town feel. It makes me feel like I flashed back in time. This place is located by Windsor and Postinos. It is very easy to miss.

However, the parking situation is bad. There are few spots in the front and few in the back. More often than not, parking can be found in the neighborhoods around this place. It's just parking though. The ice cream and goodies are worth it.
