A great Safeway.  The staff is generally very attentive.  The place is neat and tidy.  The Starbucks in the front of the store usually has a line, but the staff is always peppy and fast.  There's a nice sitting area in the front of the store with big windows to watch the world go by and sip a latte or eat a deli sandwich in the air conditioning.  No complaints about this store from me!
