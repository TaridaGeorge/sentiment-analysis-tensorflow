I wont get long-winded.

I've been looking for an excuse to eat here for months.

Tuesday was here, my girl friend and my self were in the area.

If you drive to fast you'll miss this place and I'm not kidding. 
As described, inside is no thrills seating both inside and outside.

The big white guy at the counter is really nice (Think he owns the place).  Was friendly and spoke Spanish, double threat guy. :P

Anywho, we ordered 3 carne asada tacos and 4 fish tacos.  

The Taco's are very close to the Tacos you  get at the carts on the streets of Ensenada, Baja. 

$1 for the Carne Tacos and $1.50 for the fish tacos.  Holy hell great deal and tasted great!

All the hype is a true deal.  This place is epic and we'll be back weekly.
