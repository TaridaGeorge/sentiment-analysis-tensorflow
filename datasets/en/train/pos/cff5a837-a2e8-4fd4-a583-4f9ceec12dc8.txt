OTT is the definitive go-to, within walking distance, unassuming, right in the middle of everything, easygoing retreat within the heart of Old Town.  

The beer list has surprising range and offers great selections such as Lagunitas IPA, Great White Hef, Odell 90 Shilling, and Dogfish Head IPA.     

The primarily outdoor bar is welcoming and pet friendly.
