LOVE NICKS! I have been coming here for many years... and the food has always been really good... at really reasonable prices.

I tend to stick with the pasta dishes... as all the pasta is fresh and homemade. My favorite dish on the menu it the fresh pasta, homemade sausage, peppers and onions, in a marinara sauce... amazing! I have also had the chicken marsala... also very good. 

The tiramisu dessert is amazing... make sure you save room. Also they sever Illy coffee which is wonderful. Great way to cap of the meal. 

My one word of warning is: Do Not overdo it on the bread before your meals arrives on the table! 

A true testament to this place is that everytime I come in it is always BUSY! This is true on a Tuesday night as it is on Saturday.
