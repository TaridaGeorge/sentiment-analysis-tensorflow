THE BEST AUTHENTIC ITALIAN IN ARIZONA - do not accept substitutes. This is real authentic cuisine. Not NY family style. Not North Jersey/Sopranos style. Genuine old country Italian with ingredients flown in from the boot daily. I recommend the tuna nicoise salad with pine nuts for lunch and every pizza on the menu is better than the next for dinner. Dessert? Try and find a better alternative to the Nutella creeps. If you prefer eating at that "other" place that competes with Cibo, you probably think Del Taco makes really great  authentic Mexican food.
