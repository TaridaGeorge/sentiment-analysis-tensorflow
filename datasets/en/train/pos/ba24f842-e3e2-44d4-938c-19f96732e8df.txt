I visited Eden's Grill tonight with a friend after reading a few good reviews here on Yelp.  I've got to say you guys hit this one on the head.  I had such a good time and our food was great.  What's not to love about a place where mom is cooking and comes out to check on things and make sure you're not only happy, but thrilled.  The chicken kabobs were moist and flavorful.  I think the golden raisin and almond topped rice was amazing.  I'm not big on starches, but I ate much more than I would have elsewhere.  Speaking of eating more...wow, the portions are perfectly plentiful and satisfying.  You definitely get what you pay for at this restaurant.  To sum things up... the family running Eden's Grill clearly love what they do; and it shows.
