I heard about Bryan Hamby through a friend and we started the process of buying my first home right away.  
When I used to think of real estate agents, I always considered them the "lawyer" type but Bryan changed my mind.  He was on top of everything from the first phone conversation....to showing me homes....to connecting me to a lender....and even called me to make sure everything was okay when I had already closed and moved in.  Obviously he knows what he is doing.  
HIGHLY RECOMMEND!   Thanks Bryan.
