Danny's at this location always does a great job on my car - quick too!
Have you ever spent some time in the shop there - you WILL end up buying something...they have all kinds of trinkets. I would like to meet their buyer - that must be fun to stock that place,
They do a pretty good job on the detailing as well. They have filled chips in my windshield in a snap and they did an exceptional job on tinting. Coincidentally they do all of the window tinting for Schumacher European too.
If you fill up your tank at the adjoining service station there - you will get a further discount to Danny's (look on your receipt).
