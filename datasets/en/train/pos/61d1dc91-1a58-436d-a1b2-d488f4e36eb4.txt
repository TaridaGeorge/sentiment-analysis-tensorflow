Superior dining experience in a stunning Japanese-inspired interior.

Where to begin? Why not the bathrooms: the walls in the bathrooms are entirely swathed in tan, textured granite. The countertops have a rounded, raw Nakakima-style lip and the tops are unfinished in a nod to pure nature. Even the grout surrounding the goddamn urinal is flawless.

Step outside into the main restaurant and you'll find a very large robata style grill with European guys pushing out beautiful, flawless grilled dishes that smell like heaven. For fun, sit at the grill in mid-century, tan leather chairs and take it all in. Feel your mouth agape as you watch lobster-sized Madagascar shrimp being grilled, sliced, and sent out like pictures in a frame.

My food was excellent and service was attentive and professional. One of my all-time favorite dining experiences.
