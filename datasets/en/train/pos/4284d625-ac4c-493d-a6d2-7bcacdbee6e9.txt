Over the past couple years of my life, I have spent way, WAY too much time at fair trade. Reading books and drinking coffee is like my 3rd job, and I prefer to do it at my neighborhood cafe. 

If I want drip coffee (which is almost always) I will go out of my way to come here. It's simply delicious. If I want something else I might go elsewhere, but nothing else in central/uptown/downtown Phoenix can compare to a Fair Trade Iced coffee. 

The barista's are sweet, the live music on Saturday afternoons is a joy, the community computer has saved my ass at least a dozen times, it's "coffee with a conscience", and it's a 2 minute walk from my apartment. Of course it gets 5 stars!
