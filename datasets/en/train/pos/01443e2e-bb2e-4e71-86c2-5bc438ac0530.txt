I love this place! The food is delicious, the service is friendly, and the portions are pretty large. I love the spring rolls, the curry, and the Pad Thai. It's a shame though, there's almost never anyone else here. It feels like a relatively classy place, with curtains and nice decorations. One night, the chef even came out and greeted the people at the tables to see if everyone was enjoying their food. I wish this place would get more business! Go there, they even deliver!
