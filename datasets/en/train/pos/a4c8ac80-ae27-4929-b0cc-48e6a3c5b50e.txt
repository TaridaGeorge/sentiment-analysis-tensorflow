Our family has enjoyed Malee's food since the day the doors opened.  We've held family birthday parties there, and have treated sniffles at home with some of the amazing soups.  Service is lovely and the ownership sustains integrity in every aspect of fine dining and service.  My daughters bring their children to Malees now. Some of the staff who remain, remember us whenever we come by for a meal. Romantic for dates and child friendly as well.  The Thai pasta is the family staple!  Love!!
