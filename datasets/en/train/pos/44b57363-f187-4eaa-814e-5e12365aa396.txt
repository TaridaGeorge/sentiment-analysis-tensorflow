Randomly drove by this place one day and boy were we glad! Our food is always great, good portion size and great prices. I will say that we did try the spring rolls last time and beware if you don't like mint. They were stuffed with mint leaves and it overpowered everything else. I always get the Pad Thai and it's amazing!!
