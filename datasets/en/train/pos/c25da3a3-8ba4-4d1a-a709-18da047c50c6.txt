I Love this place. I eat here either take in or take out at least 2 times a week!

I also agree with some of the others. I love the fact that I can try something new without committing! I love the revolving sushi. I also do not like that there are a lot of spicy selections. Why not offer the spice on the side. I would love some of the sushi, but it has that spicy sauce on it.

Some of the best to offer that some people might not know about:

Haru sushi - Tuna stuffed with crab and topped with avocado!
Hand rolls - YUM!!! Some are only 2.50
Udon - Good!

The staff is great. The wait can be long on some days or eves.

Love the baked scallops. Great mussels too.
