I just had a great experience at the Arrogant Butcher. First, the waitstaff was friendly and attentive. We started with drinks and an order of the soft pretzels with cheese fondue. The pretzels are freshly made nuggets of perfection -- golden brown saltiness on the outside and tender on the inside. The cheese was the perfect match of savory creaminess. My coworkers ordered the steak, while I opted for the green chile pork stew. The stew is presented in a covered bowl with a side of homeade cornbread. Lift the lid and the beatiful stew, topped with a fried egg is revealed. My only regret is not having enough room for the warm peanut butter cup dessert. I'm only in town for a week, but I'm already planning a return visit.
