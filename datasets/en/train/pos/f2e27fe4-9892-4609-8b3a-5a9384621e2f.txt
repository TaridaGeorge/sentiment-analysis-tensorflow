COFFEE

I don't drink coffee so I have no idea if their coffee is any good, but the cinnamon orange tea I had was tasty.

SERVICE

The service was prompt and quite friendly in my single experience there.

ATMOSPHERE

The environment inside Gold Bar is relaxing and comfortable, not as trendy or artsy as Cartel, but nicer and more comfortable in my opinion.
