We had to stay here because of a missed flight, but it was such a great deal for such a great hotel. There was free food, drinks, and transportation. Every staff member there was so incredibly nice, especially Eugene who takes care of transportation. The rooms are very nice as well. 
I would stay here again if I were ever in Phoenix.
