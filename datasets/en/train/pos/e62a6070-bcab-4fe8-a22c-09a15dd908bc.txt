I must admit that my review may be colored by the fact that my mother is from Venezuela. That being said my wife and family, who have had ZERO exposure to Venezuelan cuisine LOVE this place.

The store itself is nothing to write home about, a simple dining room with Venezuelan posters and knickknacks on the wall.

The menu is great with something for everyone. My son loves the Shredded pork and the Cachappas, as does the wife. The breaded White cheese is great!  best of all the Arepas are excellent, filled with beef, pork or cheese they excel!

I can't recommend this place high enough!
