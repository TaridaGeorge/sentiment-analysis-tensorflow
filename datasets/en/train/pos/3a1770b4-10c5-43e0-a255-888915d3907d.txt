I love chinese food and I think this place is one of the best! Great food, great atmosphere, great service. Everything from the appetizers and soup, to the meals are wonderful! I don't think the place is too pricy either. Really, I think this place is amazing and if you're craving chinese food and are in the area, you should definitely eat here.
