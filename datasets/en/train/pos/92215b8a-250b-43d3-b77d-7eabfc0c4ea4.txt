So cold this time of the year!  We enjoy hiking North Mountain with my son and my nephew (5 and 4 yrs old).  

This is what usually happens...First, we bring some pumpkin seeds to feed the resident squirrels at the base of the mountain.  You just scatter the seeds on top of the retaining wall and out they come.  We hike up the rocky trail and halfway there the boys need to go pee.  Down we come and off to the restroom (thank goodness it's close) we go.  Hike up again but we don't go pass the paved driveway to the summit.  Great execise FOR KIDS.  They feel so empowered! when they reach the top.  Then they show me their muscles.
