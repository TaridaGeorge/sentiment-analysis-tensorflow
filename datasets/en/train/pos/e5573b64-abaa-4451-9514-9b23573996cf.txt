I am so stoked to have this place in Downtown my roommates needed to paint something last min on a Tues night and didn't feel like running to Home Depot and I had remembered seeing some at the Bodega so we ran there and it was so much easier than running to Home Depot. On a side note the Teeth painting are uber creepy me no likey!
