I've heard great things about this place and I'm so glad I finally tried it!  The patio is very nice and comfortable if you like to sit outside.  They have many choices of tequila, even a separate tequila menu.  The snapper ceviche was huge, fresh, and very yummy!!  I like that the tortilla soup was made with chicken broth, not creamy or tomato base.  I will definitely be back.
