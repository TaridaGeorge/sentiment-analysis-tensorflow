Oh Luci's, I am so in love with you. 

Your delicious soy coconut lattes, your delightful selection of vegan, gluten free items (in store and on menu), your cooking classes (I cannot wait to try one!), your friendly staff, and your beautiful, open, airy environment make you perfect.

Even better is that you are on my way to work and just a bike ride away from my house! This will be helpful because I need a way to even out all the calories I am drinking in these lattes!

I honestly have not a complaint... this really is true love!
