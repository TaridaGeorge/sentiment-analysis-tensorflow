Have been back a few times since this post and this restaurant is still one of my faves...I got to experience their brunch menu for the first time a couple of weeks ago...and...wow! My veggie omelette was delicious as was my boyfriend's meal-the breakfast enchiladas..we split a glass of wine because I believe brunch isn't brunch without a little alchohol and it was a generous pour/split...keep doin' yo thing Sierra Bonita!
