Love this place and I am not a breakfast person. The french toast (they call it english toast with a french flair) is the best I have ever had. They are always really busy so expect a short wait. The atmosphere is fun and I have always had really good service. Unique items on the menu including an eggs benedict with crab meat and artichokes which was soooo good!
