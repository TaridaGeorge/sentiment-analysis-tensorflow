Dr. Sam and his staff are the best in the biz! They have been my main vet for my dog Hurley since day one! With shots and a run in with a nasty sickness that almost took his life, they were concerned the whole way through.

When Hurley (my golden doodle) got sick they were there to help him and me get back to normal. Dr. Sam is always very helpful when it comes to be cost conscious, which is a huge plus. To help cut down on cost they instructed me on how I could give my dog fluids at home to save money on coming in every day that week.

Also when my pup got his leg cut they made time to see and sew him up even with a full schedule. 

Great clinic, Excellent staff, and all in all a great place!
