Not realizing there was a line to get into the bar (honestly, I didn't see one) six of us strolled into AZ88 for after dinner cocktails. We went straight to the bar and ordered our drinks pretty quick. Then without having to ask, we were quickly ushered into a table. It was probably because we were in the way of the servers - but who cares - Five stars for fantastic service!
