Just went to the box office to buy tickets for multiple nights to see the show Legally Blonde. The Ticket Concierge at the Herberger Box Office was so helpful and informative that I wanted to give him a Shout Out and Thank You for managing all the logistics for my tickets and my mom's ticket purchase. Can't waiting to see the show!
