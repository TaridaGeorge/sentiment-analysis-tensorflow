Mmmmm.... Love this place! Make it a point to go here every chance I can! The vegetarian combo is my fave. Staff is always nice and polite and right on it... even at their busiest! Had lunch there last weekend again with a good friend... and although he is not generally adventurous when it comes to something other than meat and potatoes this has become one of his favorite places too... Now if I can get him to try something other than the beef schwarma! : )  
The food is consistently good, service is always good and the market is fun to browse in after a great meal!
