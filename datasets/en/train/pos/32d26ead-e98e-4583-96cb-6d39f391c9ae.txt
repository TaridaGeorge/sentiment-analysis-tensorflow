I was inspired to write this review because I was in DIRE need of breakfast nachos and a hangover sandwich this morning, but alas, I live in Tucson now... and although I considered driving 2 hours to Daily Dose, I was starving.  I needed food and I needed it fast and there is NOTHING here that can even halfway compare to DD.

EVERYTHING I have tried at DD has been nothing short of delicious! I already mentioned the breakfast nachos and hangover sandwich (which should really come with a side of Advil), but hey, sometimes I try to eat healthy and their egg white wrap & roasted turkey sandwich are amaze.  Oh & did I mention they have a crab cake benedict and bacon bloody marys? Holla!
