I love this place. It fits my vibe perfectly. A cool space with a bar and high tops in the front, standard restaurant set up and then a patio with lights and a fireplace. Great ambiance, friendly service, amazing pizza and good beer selection. Even the music they play is good. I highly recommend the Parlor. It's one of the first places I went to eat in Phx.
