I haven't Yelped this place yet?

Well what the hell is wrong with me?!

I love malls. A good mall has a perfect combination of weird people to gawk at and stores I actually want to buy stuff from. SFS has that. We've got weird plastic people and funky old men intermixed with Banana Republic and Nordstroms. 

I can't say much more than what's already been said. They have great stores in here, it's clean, and well organized.
