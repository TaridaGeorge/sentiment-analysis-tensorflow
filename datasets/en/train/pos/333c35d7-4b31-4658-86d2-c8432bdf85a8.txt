This is a great breakfast stop!  Gotta love the homemade biscuits... are you kidding me!  Awesome! CB is a huge chain but they do some great things.  

The only thing is the way they have designed the space the servers are in the back a lot... too much.  They need to be on the floor more to make sure the cups stay filled up!
