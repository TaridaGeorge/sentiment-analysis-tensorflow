A long time since my last visit. Here is an update: MELT in my mouth gnocchi (and that was because I stole from my daughter's plate); hearty, umami stuffed mushrooms; perfectly seasoned risotto with osso bucco; dreamy, creamy, light as a feather tiramisu, all delivered with great service and the best of humor for a picky, demanding table of five. Many thanks to the staff for a great evening. This is an experience worth driving 20 miles. Truly.
