No country for old buffet. The banter over tapas will never end just as my love for Sens with their "infusion" of different Asian styles and ingredients. The tofu, the cold duck, sweet & sour soup and fried quail were amazing. Add to that their wide selection of sake and it is heaven on an ill bloated stomach.
