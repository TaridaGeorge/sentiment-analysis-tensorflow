Pita Jungle is easily one of my all time favorite restaurants. The dark, candle-lit atmosphere and the local artwork that is featured makes for a really chill place to have a delicious dinner.  I personally love the broiled chicken pita, a simple chicken pita with a little extra flavor. The hummus and chicken is also really tasty. They also have really good iced-tea. 

The place usually is pretty busy, but I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated and their service is always quick. This is the perfect place to go whether with a group of good friends or on a date.
