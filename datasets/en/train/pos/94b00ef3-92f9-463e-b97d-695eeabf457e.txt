OH EM GEE
this was my first Fox restaurant experience, and it was a good one.  BBQ pork tenderloin with mac and cheese was great comfort food.  the starter of tuna tartare tacos: AMAZING. dessert was great, as was the expresso.  i didn't have a problem with service.  this place is rather smallish so going in large groups would not be a good idea.
