Seriously gonna have to bump 'em up a star! 

Here's why:
1. STILL! $3 buck carafes! (bloodies and cape cods, we had and loved) 
2. AWeSOMe food (Salmon special bene was excellent!) 
3. Server backed off once we told him we were campin' out (but he was still pleasant)
4. Fairytale brownie sundae dessert was a FAIRYTALE!
5. Excellent atmosphere, temperature (I hate freezing!) and people watching.

SOLD! Go here.
