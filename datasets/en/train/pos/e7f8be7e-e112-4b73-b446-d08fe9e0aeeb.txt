If I was from Tempe, I would probably call this place "Cartel's sophisticated older sister."

But I'm not.

And my background in fact has me comparing this to a little shop in my old Sommerville neighborhood.  But that means nothing to you.

So...I think that Lux pretty closely approximates the coffee shop in my dream brain before I knew such a place really existed.  Smooth couches, DJ in the back, study-worthy space calmly mingled with socializing circles, and excellent coffee and baked goods.

Neither mass-produced nor high on its own individuality.  Just mellow.
