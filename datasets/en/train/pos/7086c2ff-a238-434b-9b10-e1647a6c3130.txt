Ok, so the paintings on the walls and ceiling are a bit hokey. but dang the food makes up for it. Went with three friends/colleagues during a dinner break and we had a blast. Our waiter was friendly and funny. We drank lots of wine and had a three course dinner. Dont remember what anyone else got since I had the special of ossobuco and could not see anything over my plate. It was HUGE! Think everyone at the restaurant was jealous of my heaping plate. Think that lasted for three more meals! Dont take me wrong, its not about quantity vs quality here (it aint no cheesecake factory thank god, yuck!) but they do not skimp on either. This place came recommended from our taxi driver and concierge.
