How could you not like this place? You know what you like so you make your dish EXACTLY how you want it. The staff gets an A+ for being friendly and helpful.

I'd recommend piling as much as you can onto your plate when picking through the buffett line.  They give wax paper out at the beginning of the line to help compress the food prior to cooking.
