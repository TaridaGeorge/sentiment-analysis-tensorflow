How did I miss this place for so long??

It's right next to Joe's Farm Grill, perhaps I was always so stuffed after having lunch or dinner there I payed it no mind.

However, next time I'll stop here FIRST for some amazing cupcakes.  They have a lot of unique flavors (a lot of them vegan) and all I have tried so far have been very yummy and light.

The coffee is very good too, they have some unique latte flavors.

Fruit loop cupcake?  I'm still waiting to try it!
