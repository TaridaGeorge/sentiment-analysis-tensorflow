This place blows away all the other corporate ice cream shops.  It definitely lives up to the hype. Some of the flavors are definitely different, but whether you are craving that, or just some traditional flavors, this is the place. The almond buttercrunch is so decadent, creamy and rich, with chunks of homemade almond brittle. I can't get enough! The salted caramel ice cream is also very good. The sweet cream flavor in it is amazing!  They didn't have the bacon brittle ice cream the day we went, but I can't wait to try it!  My new favorite ice cream spot! Ben and Jerry's and Haagen Daz WHO?
