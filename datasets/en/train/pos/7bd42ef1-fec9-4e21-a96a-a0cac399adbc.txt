I love Malee's....I was sad when the Desert Ridge location closed down.  I would drive an hour to have my favorite soup there.  You have to try the Tom Ka Gai.  I have had Tom Ka Gai at numerous Thai restaurants, but Malee's is by far the BEST I have ever had!  I go there just for a bowl of this soup.  The rest of their food is great too!
