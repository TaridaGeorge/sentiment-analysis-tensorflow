Everything from the rooms to the pool to the gym and the food/drinks were fantastic. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. Parking can be valet or free if you can walk 100 yards. When checking in, I was offered a margarita (not that good, but it was the thought that counts). Walked to my room past the indoor foyer/bar area where there's live music every night. The band was excellent. The pools and grounds are exceptional. Excellent fitness center over in the building by the spa. The golf course was very good and well maintained. The only issue was due to overseeding, you couldn't ride the golf carts on the fairway. All of the food was excellent and the managers really care about the service provided.
