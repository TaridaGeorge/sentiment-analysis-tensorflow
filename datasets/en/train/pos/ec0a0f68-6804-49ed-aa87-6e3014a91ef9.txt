If you can not give this place 5 stars you should not be dining at this establishment.  This place rocks and  my first experience here was excellent.  Arrived at 5pm on a friday night, got right in before the normal weekend crowd.  

The atmosphere was cool and retro like I would expect being on the edge of the Biltmore/Arcadia area.  Service was great with attentive trendy looking servers.  Prices were cheaper than I expected.   The pizza I ordered  coming out of a wood fired oven was amazing.  

I will be back ,but not on a friday night.  Not that this is a bad night to go out.  We all know that foodies don't dine on friday night's.  This was just the first friday I had to go out in 8 months.
