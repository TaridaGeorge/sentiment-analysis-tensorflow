I love this mini Starbucks! It's right near my pad and it has a drive through that moves fast -- thankfully. And the people who work at this location are characters. Sometimes the baristas will sing to you before they take your order or they'll tell you a joke. This is seriously the wackiest group of people I've ever encountered at a Stabucks, but I love it. And the store manager happens to be the talented singer and keyboardist from hot up-and-coming AZ pop-rock act The Loveblisters.

I highly recommend the White Chocolate Frappachino if you need a jump start in the mornings. The Orange Creme Frap is nice in the afternoons when you need something refreshing in this triple-digit summer heat. And if you're hungry, the lemon loaf is out of this world.
