This is currently my absolute favorite place to go for sushi in Arizona, and as an avid sushi connoisseur,  I have pretty much tried them all.  It consistently tastes extremely fresh and delicious.  The atmosphere is lively and fun, and the menu offers more than just sushi for people who aren't big on the eating of raw fish.  The service is also very friendly and welcoming.  It is a great place to go for a drink, a meal, or of course both.
