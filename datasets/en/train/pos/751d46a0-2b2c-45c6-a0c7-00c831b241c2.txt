It's what a hamburger's all about.

Ever smoke crack? I have. While eating a Double Double off the a$$ of a stripper.  Just like Doogie Howser in Harold & Kumar.  Except it was a Double Double with grilled onions , not a big fat line of coke.

I was able to kick the crack. Still working on the strippers.  I will never be able to quit In N Out. 

Remember to order a chocolate shake.
