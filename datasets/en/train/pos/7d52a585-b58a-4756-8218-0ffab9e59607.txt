Went here for lunch... used a coupon i had for a 1cent beer...not too shabby. tasted the newly unveiled pumpkin hefe...very good. tamales were pretty delish. main thing i wanna comment on is the one liter growlers... AWESOME!!!!!  i love the opportunity to take a beer home for later, and the fact i can take two well packaged growlers for the price of one normal growler...BTW 2  one liter growlers do equal 1 normal sized.  they do an awesome bottling job, first removing oxygen from the bottle, then filling the bottle with co2 to preserve the freshness... cant wait to get home and crack open my Red Rover....yummy
