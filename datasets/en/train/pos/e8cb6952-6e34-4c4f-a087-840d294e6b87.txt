My experience with Monkey Pants takes place on a Thursday. I am a stand up comic and I love comedy, and Monkey Pants has grown into a great little room for people to see some great comedy.

If you haven't liked Monkey Pants before, try going back during a comedy show, and they have 3 dollar captain and cokes, and cheese curds that are pretty tasty. (probably not that healthy though)

(thursday night - @ 830 pm)


P.S. I've also been on trivia night, which was also fun, but I suck at trivia... soooo. If you're into trivia, you should go that night instead.
