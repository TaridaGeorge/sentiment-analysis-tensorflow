Everything is great! Erik, the manager is exceptional! He goes out of his way to make customers feel like family. Ask for Kelly. She's very good at suggesting alternatives if you're looking for something a little different. 

I love the Macho Nacho Benedict with barbacoa beef and more black beans (less potatoes). Fantastic!
