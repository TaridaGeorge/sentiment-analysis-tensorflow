Mmmmmmmm chocolate martinis.
I can go on for days about the MonteLucia.  I don't know that I should because I want it all for myself.  I'm a local and enjoy coming here to cozy up with friends outside in the courtyard or inside on the couches while sipping on A-MAZING chocolate martinis.  
The staff is attentive and friendly.  Everytime I've been there live music has been playing that could be described as jazzy or loungey.
It's the perfect upscale location for a low key evening.
