A bunch of my favorite Sun Devils and I tried this yummy gelato immediately after opting out of dessert at Brio next door.  That turned out to be the best decision of the week!

The line-out-the-door is justified (there are about 37 favors to try before committing), but made palatable by the mini sample cups the delightful employees distribute while you wait.  We tried salted caramel and mint chocolate chip while waiting to approach the counter.  Both were magnificent!

Everything we sampled was delicious but we all found favorites:  Dark chocolate, coconut, crunchy peanut butter, marbled black cherry, Amaretto, and espresso.  All were rich, creamy, delicious and fresh.

Please support this Tucson family-owned and operated business.  The welcoming atmosphere and fabulous gelato make a winning combination--even if there really is "red and blue in every bite".  :)
