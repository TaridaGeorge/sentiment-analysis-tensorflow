While in Phoenix for work, I ate here more than anywhere else.  Brunch, lunch, happy hour, and dinner.  The food is incredible.  My absolute fav is the wingless buffalo dip - it is so tasty!  The grilled cheese with brie, granny smith apples, and bacon is a close runner-up.  Pretty good beer and wine lists too.  Excellent happy hour deals.  Very friendly staff too and service was always excellent.
