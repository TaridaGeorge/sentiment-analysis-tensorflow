This gnarly biker/hipster dive bar is ironically located in a quiet neighborhood in Scottsdale. It quickly became one of my favorite AZ hangouts for a couple reasons: Its a dive. They have a smoking patio (heated in the winter, but no misters for the summer). They actually have good beer on tap, or available in cans and bottles. And they make a bangin bloody mary!

Whenever I walk in this bar, I feel right at home, even when I don't know a single person there. The jukebox is constantly spewing old school punk rock and the TV plays skate videos or random South Park episodes. It's just got a good vibe to it. Like... who couldn't love it?
