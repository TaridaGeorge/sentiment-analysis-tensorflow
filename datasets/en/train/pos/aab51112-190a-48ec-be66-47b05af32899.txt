This pool is fun for all age groups.

There's a playground in the zero depth area for toddlers.  There are diving boards and a waterslide for kids.  There's also an area with a basketball hoop for the bigger kids.

The large pool has lap lanes right down the middle, so at least the teenagers and bigger kids usually play by the basketball hoop.  The other side of the pool is usually occupied by parents and kids.

This facility is always kept clean.

What really sets this pool apart from the other Chandler pools is that it has a pretty good sized lawn where people can lay their beach towels down and hang out.
