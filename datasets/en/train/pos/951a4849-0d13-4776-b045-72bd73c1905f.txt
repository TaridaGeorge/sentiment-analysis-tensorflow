When I eat pizza in non-east coast cities now, one of the first questions I ask myself is "would I eat this at home?" The answer with Patsy Grimaldi's is definitely an affirmative.

You: "But isn't their pizza just like the Grimaldi's 2 blocks from your house?"

Patsy Grimaldi's in Scottsdale doesn't have the fluffly, chewy crust of its brethren in the NYC area. Instead, the crust is crispier a la Frank Pepe's of New Haven. Of course, I loved Frank Pepe, so that's certainly not a criticism. Just don't go expecting fluffy, chewy crust!
