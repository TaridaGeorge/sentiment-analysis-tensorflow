sometimes i crave durian and my husband will not let me even BREATHE in his atmosphere if i've had it, let alone buy one from leelee's across the street. so, i LOVE when lee's has the ice cream and, if they don't, i'll get the shake.

i get all the strange fruit shakes.

after all, i am what nina simone would call a strange fruit. ;)
