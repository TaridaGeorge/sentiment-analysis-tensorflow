Love this place! I always call and place an order a day prior to needin them and to make sure they're open but the tamales are wonderful. Chicken and pork are my favorite!! I have never dined in so I'm not sure how the service is since I only pay and pick up but if you want some great tamales this is the place to go!!!!
