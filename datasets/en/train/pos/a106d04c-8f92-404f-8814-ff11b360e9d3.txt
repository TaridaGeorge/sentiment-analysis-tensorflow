Amazing little farm in the middle of a residential neighborhood in North Scottsdale. They have an honor's system market every day and a full-service market on Thursdays and Saturdays where you can drink fresh coffee, meet the owners, and enjoy delicious pastries while you browse their bounty. Well-worth a visit, if not for the homemade goat's milk caramels alone. Seriously, they're unreal.
