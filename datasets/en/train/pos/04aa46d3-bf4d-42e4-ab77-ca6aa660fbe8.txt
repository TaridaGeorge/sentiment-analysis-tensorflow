One of my favorite breakfast places in Scottsdale. They have a "Best Things in Life Card" that they punch so every 5th breakfast is free. They have double punch days for holiday weekends too. The omelets are awesome, the pancakes are super yummy and their portions are always big. If you leave hungry its your own fault! They also give you to go cups of whatever drink you order to take with you at the end of the meal. They are always super friendly here and the atmosphere is good for kids. This location has a nice patio and offers complimentary coffee while you wait to be seated. All around a wonderful breakfast joint. They have 15 different locations around the valley so you are bound to have one close to you.
