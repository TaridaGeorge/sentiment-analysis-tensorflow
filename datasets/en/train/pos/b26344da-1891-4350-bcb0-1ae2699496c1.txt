First time to Pita Jungle... we loved it! it was late, and it was packed! But where there is great food, you should always find a crowd. The portions were enormous, even the appetizers which makes it great to share with a small group...the atmosphere was a lot cooler than i expected being from out of town. The artwork on the walls really caught my eye and gave me a lot to look at-which made the time fly while waiting on our order, which was perfect timing.. didn't take long at all. The pricing was great, and the selections on the menu made it so hard to decide what to get, but everyone one was extremely satisfied with their meals. Wait staff was quick and friendly. Wish we had one of these at home - definitely leaves you full, and not guilty since you are eating pretty healthy here.
