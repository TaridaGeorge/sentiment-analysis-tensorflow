Formerly known as The Counter - this has always been a quick stop in for a great salad, soup or sandwich. Its a neighborhood Diner-style that looks like they would serve old-fashioned milk-shakes.....and guess what...they do!
I even bought a sandwich press of my very own because of this place!! Ever since I had one of their hot pressed sandwiches I was hooked. I usually stop in here to load up before shopping at Kierland - its quick, clean and cheap!!
