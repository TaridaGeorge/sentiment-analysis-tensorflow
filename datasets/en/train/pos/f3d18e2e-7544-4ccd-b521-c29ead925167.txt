There is something to be said about an old "stand-by" where you know you'll get a fabulous breakfast, probably have to wait to get seated, and feel like you're back in the "old days" while there. 
Such is breakfast at The Original Pancake House. 
The owner always says "Hello" like you're a old friend, and he's frequently seen sitting down and chatting with patrons. 
The breaksfasts here are always (think consistently) very good, and I can't think of a visit to this place where the food hasn't been wonderful.
One caution: they don't take plastic so bring your cash! And, be prepared to wait to get seated.
