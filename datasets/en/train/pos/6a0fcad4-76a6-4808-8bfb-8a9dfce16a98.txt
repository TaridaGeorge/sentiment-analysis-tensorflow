Awsome, Awsome, Awsome... I was ordering cupcakes for my boyfriends birthday. After a few e-mails I followed a great suggestion of a dutch chocolate cupcake with brown sugar frosting and a BACON toffee topper.  
I got mini cupcakes so that there would be enough to go around and they were perfect and so delishious.  I cant say more great cupcakes, great service.
