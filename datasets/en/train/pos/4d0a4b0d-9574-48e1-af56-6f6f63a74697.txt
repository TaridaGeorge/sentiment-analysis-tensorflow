I love this place! When it first opened it became an immediate favorite of mine. A friendly family owned gem. The best kind of restaurant. I would recommend anything on the menu with no hesitation. The only downside (for me) was when they won best of Phoenix. It became a bit harder to just walk in and get a table. But they are quick, good and always friendly.
