This is one of the better restaurants in the Phoenix valley.  Not only great food, service and decor, but also a great resort to walk around with mature landscaping that is worth the tour.  

The service was top notch, and the food was excellent.  This is a great venue for date night, or for a group gathering as a special event.  There was no rushing from the service and the food delivery was right on from appetizers through desert.

I would highly recommend this restaurant and hotel.
