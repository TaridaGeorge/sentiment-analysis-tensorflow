I can't believe I have never tried this place until now. It's the best Italian Restaurant I have found since I've left upstate NY. It's a small little mom and pop place that's family owned. The chicken parmigiana, baked ziti, lasagna, and antipasto were yummy. Very tasty tomato sause.

The restaurant is BYOB and cash only but it's a must DINE!!
