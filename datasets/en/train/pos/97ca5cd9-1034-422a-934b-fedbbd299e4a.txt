Love it here!  We got a puppy and were heartbroken to have to leave him while we traveled for a week - the trip was booked long before we got the puppy.  I was REALLY worried about leaving a puppy with other big dogs.  But they have 2 play areas; 1 for big dogs, and 1 for little dogs.  And he LOVED it there!  There was no need for me to worry at all!  The funny thing was, he wasn't even excited to see us when we came to pick him up.  At home if we are gone for 5 minutes he is soooo happy to see us....but after a week at Hillside he was disappointed we were taking him away from his new puppy friends.  5 Stars!
