Great atmosphere.

Clean cool place to hang where the drinks flow for a vervy reasonable price.  Well drinks are$2.75... thought I was in the 90's for minute there.  

Also they have several big tv screens for those who like sports.

Service is excellent... Heck no, I'm not hitting on her... 

Not certain if they have food... didn't ask...
