"No spice", "small lunch special", waaaah . . . ignore all the babies.  They've never even had real Thai food.  

Thai Basil is effing awesome.  And so is the family that owns the place. 

Now, before all you haters get your panties in a bunch over the 5 stars, read what I have to say-- Thai Basil is not the cleanest, most well decorated Thai restaurant.  And it's not even the best Thai I've ever had.  But it's great food and the best Thai I've had in AZ.  And for the cheap price, awesome, flavorful food, friendly staff and large dinner portions, I give them 5 stars.

Highly recommend the peanut curry, pad Thai and pretty much everything else!
