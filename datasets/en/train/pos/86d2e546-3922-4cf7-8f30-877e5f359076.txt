Great pizza and sauce.  My boyfriend says they have the best cannolis on the west coast.  Wings were huge and hot when we got them, but the sauce didn't stick too well so you have to dip them in the pool at the bottom of the container.  No problem, though, since I like my wings messy.  Only a 30-40 minute wait on a busy Friday night.  Great prices, too.  Definitely the best delivery place in southern Scottsdale.
