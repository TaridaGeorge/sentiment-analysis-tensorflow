Nirvana for the home chef...I LOVE THIS PLACE!

Like most retail establishments, you won't usually find eBay-esque prices, but I love the great selection of products, including high-end stuff that I don't see anywhere else.  And I have actually found some great deals on de Meyere and de Buyer cookware - even cheaper than eBay.

The friendly staff generally knows what they're talking about, and I appreciated being able to try out a Shun Ken Onion knife before buying.  The lady said, 'Hold on a second...' and disappeared to the back.  When she returned, she had a handful of carrots for me to dice.  Nice!

I still enjoy perusing W - S, too, but Sur la Table blows it away.

PS:  their book signings are great, too.  Met Steven Raichlen a few weeks back...
