This is my fav breakfast place in the Valley! I have always had amazing service and great food for a reasonible price. I go here when I have appts in Scottsdale and for some reason the # of appts. in Scottsdale seems to be rising! I love that they give you your drink in a to go cup when you leave. 
I think I've always purchased breakfast here- they are only open till 3pm-but a friend ordered a french dip sandwich today that looked amazing and huge! So I may be a non breakfast diner next visit. The OJ is fresh squeezed, the veggies in the eggs fresh and crisp, and the pancakes cooked to perfection.
The only minor issue I have is there is an upcharge for Vermont Maple Syrup vs. the standard high fructose corn syrup.
