Though I'm generally worn out on steakhouses, I have to give Capital Grille props for the best steak and steakhouse I've experienced. The Filet is melt-in-your-mouth tender and full of flavor. The atmosphere is upscale, corporate-feeling, but still manages to be fun and cozy with family-style sides and friendly waitstaff. 

If I'm going to splurge on a steak, I'll be seeking out a Captial Grille.
