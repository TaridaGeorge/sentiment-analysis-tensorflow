This is for the credit card department of Chase Bank.

Our ID has been compromised five times and each time Chase has caught it as it is happening. They call to make sure it is not we who are charging these item and close the account right then. We have never had to do anything beyond acknowledging their actions. 

One time in Paris France Gus dropped his wallet at a restaurant. When we went back they had the wallet but not the chase card. We called Chase, they stopped the card and sent another to a hotel in London for us the next day as we were traveling there in the morning. It was at the hotel when we arrived. 

I have nothing but good to say about Chase credit fraud department, they are on the ball.
