With a rich atmosphere, pleasant wait staff, and food to die for, this restaurant is truly something special

My wife and I ordered the Strawberry Lemonade, Stuffed Mushrooms, Chicken Bellagio, and Mahi Mahi Mediterranean. 

Every morsel of what we ate was divine.

I highly recommend the mushrooms, and trying the Bellagio put my mouth in food Heaven.

Tiana C was extremely pleasant waiting on us, and other than maybe prices being a "smidge" high, and I do mean just a smidge, there's nothing I would change about Cheesecake Factory
