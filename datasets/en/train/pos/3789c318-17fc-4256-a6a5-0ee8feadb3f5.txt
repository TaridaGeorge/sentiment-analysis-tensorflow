I used to go here frequently for family diners. They always easily accommodated our large groups. I have never seen the place packed but it is usually decently full.

I have so many dishes that I love that it is hard not to spend a fortune when going there so now that I live on my own I save this place for special occasions and good paychecks.

The duck is my favorite of any duck I have gotten before.

I also love the black bean chicken, garlic green beans, and salty pepper pork.

It's always been clean when I have gone. The bathrooms are very nice though the locks haven't worked on multiple occasions.
