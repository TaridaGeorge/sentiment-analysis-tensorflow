Awesome! One of my favorite places in the valley. I always bring out of town guests here and I live 30 minutes away from the restaurant.

Pork appetizer is good, fish is always delicious, and mac and cheese is also awesome.

Not much else to say except that if you haven't gone here yet, you need to.
