NOTE- 5 stars for fast food joint, not the Capital Grill.

This Subway experience was fast, accurate, and no fuss. (1/21/11)

This Subway is busy and efficient.  I enjoyed an excellent turkey sub add bacon with an assortment of toppings and they made it with excellent fresh ingredients.  

If you need a meal fast and on the cheap, you can't beat this.  I was in and out fast during a busy lunch rush.
