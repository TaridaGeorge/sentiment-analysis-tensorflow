Thanks to Stephanie my laser hair removal experience has been a great one.  She is absolutely wonderful.  I have had about 4-5 visits with her now and she is so attentive and caring.  I have always been self-conscience and I feel like she has made it possible for me to feel more confident about myself!!  She is very knowledgeable and professional.  She definitely has made a huge impact in my life... she is truly a blessing!!  I really don't think anyone else could have made me feel more welcome!!  I look forward to my next visit with her!!!  I recommend her expertise to everyone.  She has definitely made me feel much better about myself!!  Thank you so much Stephanie!!
