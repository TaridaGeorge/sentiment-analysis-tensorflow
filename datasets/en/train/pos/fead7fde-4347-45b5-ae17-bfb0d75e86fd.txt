Make the trek north as far as Scottsdale Rd. goes and reward your senses at el Pedregal.  The topography around here may make you feel like you're on Mars, and the compound that houses restaurants, shops, and a stage is reminiscent of Morocco.  It's definitely upscale and frequented by snowbirds in the winter, but it's still delightfully romantic and a must-see for all native Phoenicians.
