I could not be more obsessed with the Cinema Suites option at this theater. Plush, comfy leather chairs that completely recline and are reserved in advance so there is no hassle. A mini bowl of complimentary popcorn. Great service. A little chocolate when you leave. It is the absolute best! I wish I could go everyday. And I'm not even a movie person...
