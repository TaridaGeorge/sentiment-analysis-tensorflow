The best sushi I've ever had (and I've had a lot of sushi.) Their teriyaki dishes are also amazing, and their green tea brings back memories of Japanese hot springs. The nutty dressing on their salads is unique and delicious.

If you find better-quality sashimi anywhere within driving distance, I'll buy you lunch there!
