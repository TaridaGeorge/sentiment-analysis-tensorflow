I recently discovered this gem in Cave Creek.  The coffee is excellent, atmosphere is warm and inviting and the service is friendly.  I wouldn't dream of asking for more, but there is more.  They also serve food and judging from the delicious sandwich I had (a ham and swiss on multi grain, grilled, of the "build your own" variety), I will be back for more as soon as I make it out to Cave Creek again.  The patio area is a lovely place to enjoy the sun in a true desert setting.  We enjoyed watching birds (Cardinals, Cactus Wrens, etc) and also got to meet the owner's dog, a sweet and laid back afghan strongly resembling a stuffed animal.
