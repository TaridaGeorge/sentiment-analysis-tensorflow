I went back there last night, because it's a $1.00 off Ska Brewing beers on Wednesdays.  My hubby ordered 3 pints of Decadent and was happy just at that, but then Elise put on the movie Ghost Ship and we stayed to watch it.

The movie brought up fond memories and ignited some great conversations with Elise who is a movie buff like me.

If you want to watch a great movie, have some great beer on tap and a good time, TT Roadhouse is great!  It beats sitting in a movie theater where you can't drink alcohol or talk.  : )
