I LOVE this place. The subs are great and the staff is cool and friendly. I'm not sure why it takes so long to get my sandwich out of the toaster thingy but they give you plenty of weed propaganda to look at while you wait. 
If a Cheba Hut sub were to fight a Subway AND a Quiznos sub the Cheba sub would fully kick ass.
