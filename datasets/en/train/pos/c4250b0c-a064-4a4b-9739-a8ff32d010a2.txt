I live across the street, and work in the same complex. I eat here weekly, at least once. 

Literally ALL their burgers are amazing. The Sweet Jalapeno is my favorite. You can get their KILLER onion rings, to die for french friends, or 1/2 and 1/2! Their Greenbay chili is really good. And their WINGS. The Honey Hot is my favorite. They have truly awesome Bleu Cheese Dressing (Even if you don't LIKE IT, Try it, You'll love it!). 

I usually get the Honey Balsamic salad for lunch, with candied walnuts, fresh goat cheese, cranberries, and a dressing that is out of this world yummy!

The beer on tap selection is pretty small, but it's got some good ones. And they have damn good bloody mary's! The bartenders and servers are always peaches!
