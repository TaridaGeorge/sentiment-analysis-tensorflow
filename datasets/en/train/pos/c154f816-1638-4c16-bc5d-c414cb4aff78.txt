Went to Timo recently after a recommendation from a friend and we couldn't have been more pleased. The decor is really impressive inside and out. We chose to sit outside by the fire. The staff was very attentive and helpful with all of our questions. Our server recommended the escargot to start and we were a little apprehensive, but went for it anyway. It was absolutely delicious! We also shared an eggplant lasagna and a flatbread pizza. Both were equally amazing. The wine pairings our server suggested were spot on as well. We'll be going back to timo soon! New favorite neighborhood spot!
