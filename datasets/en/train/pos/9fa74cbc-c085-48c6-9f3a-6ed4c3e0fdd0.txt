I've been going to RA in Las Vegas and in Scottsdale for several years and it gets better all the time.  They offer one of the best Happy Hours around.  From 3-7pm and 10 pm-Midnight you get excellent drink and food specials.  Try the cold Kirin (22 oz) and hot sake (6 oz) for $7.  Then move on to many many food choices between $3-7.  Their Calamari Tempura (planks - not rings and tentacles) are the best I've had anywhere.  I also recommend the Crispy Spicy Tuna and Seared Tuna.
