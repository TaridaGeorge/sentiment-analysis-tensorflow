I love Costco.  I love their company policies, they treat their employees well and they treat their customers with respect.  If I get something that doesn't work then I take it back.  No problem ever returning anything.  Their offerings are plentiful and they've really been adding more organic and gluten free options which I am very happy about.

This location has very good selections at it.  Better than many of the other clubs around town.  You can't beat the deal on the rotisserie chicken and the seasonal items are worth grabbing as soon as you can!  Great club...gas pricing is cheaper than other locations as well.  Always clean and respectful staff.
