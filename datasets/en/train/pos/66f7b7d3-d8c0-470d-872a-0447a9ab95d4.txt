Ladies, Good Works Auto Repair is the bomb, really. As a single woman who knows next to nothing about cars I can truthfully report that this place will not take advantage of inexperiance. Glen explains every question I have in vocabulary I can actually understand, and Elsie is so fun she makes the time I'm there fly by. The whole staff is very friendly and you can tell they're their to help, not take advantage. I've been taking my car there since 2007 and will continue to take my new car there. They're work is of the highest quality and as I've said, they're trustworthy, so I highly recommend them to all the other single ladies out there.
