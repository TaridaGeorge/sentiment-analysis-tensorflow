This is the ONLY place to get Chicken Fried Steak! The portions are HUGE so bring your appetite. The pulled pork is good too! Just took some visiting friends this last week and it was delicious as always. They loved it. These guys are very consistent and the service is excellent! The have a cool little bar too. Not really for families... this is for the grown-ups!
