I am so proud that Sky Harbor is now my home airport !! and these are the reasons why ..

1. it is beautiful and clean .
2. everyone is super nice ..seriously all the time !
3. great shops 
4.decent restaurants 
5.convenient outlets in the terminals.

Other airports should really take a cue from here .(.Mainly NY .)

Very deserving of the 5 stars ! 
Always a pleasure !
