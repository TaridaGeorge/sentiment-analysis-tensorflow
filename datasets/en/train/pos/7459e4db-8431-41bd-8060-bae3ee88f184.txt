When I moved to the area, I dreaded the search for a new dentist. The reviews on yelp for this practice seemed too good to be true.

After a couple visits, I can honestly say the 5 star reviews are all true. Dr. Tran is a wonderful dentist and has a great team of hygienists and other staff. Everyone is extremely friendly and professional. The building is modern and clean.

Now, just sad that we are moving again and I will have to look for another dentist in another city..hopefully yelp can help me out again.
