I met a friend here for drinks one night and I dont know if it was just the bartender working at the time but we ordered two drinks and they were the strongest drinks we had ever had she put 15 shots in the drink and topped it off with Tea. $12 got us tipsy and the check. I would go back if I knew that bartender was working sure knew how to get a tip :)
