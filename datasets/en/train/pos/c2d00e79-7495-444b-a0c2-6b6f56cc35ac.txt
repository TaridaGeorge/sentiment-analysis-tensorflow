Great locally owned froyo shop. After dinner at Hula, we noticed that a new shop had opened in the same complex. We walked in and low and behold... It was a recently opened yogurt shop. It turns out that they opened today at 2pm. The seating and atmosphere are really relaxed but fun. They have some usual flavors (milk choco and vanilla) but they have some fun flavors (strawberry banana and red velvet) too. Something else I noticed is that they have low fat and a sorbet option. Their toppings are freshly cut and yummy! I'll def be going back!!
