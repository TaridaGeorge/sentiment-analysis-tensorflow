I love Spinato's!  We usually get Nicole's NEW Favorite, it's pretty basic, but my husband is pretty picky, so....ya. Still, it is consistently delicious and well made. They also have a spinach salad that tastes amazing, and is a pretty good size portion. When we go with a group of 4, we get 1 salad and 1 large pizza and everyone leaves satisfied. 
Their homemade sauce (which you can buy on it's own) is pretty fantastic. I think that's what makes their pizza taste better than most others. 
Another pro- Diet Dr. Pepper. Not many places offer that option, so I have a special place in my heart for those that do. 
The only downside I can find with Spinato's, is that they need a location closer to Gilbert!
