This location offers some great trails of varying lengths with beautiful scenery. Once you leave the parking lot area,  you won't know you're near the city, despite Cave Creek's explosion of housing developments. We found the staff very laid back and friendly, knowledgeable and fun to speak with. Our guide, Billy, was hilarious, adding a level of entertainment to the experience. Prices were VERY reasonable compared with other options. The horses were great. They had one for each skill level from total newbie to experienced.  The thing that made us choose this location over others is the fact that their property has historical appeal (old mine), a porch to hang out and chat and roaming animals to meet, such as a small her of burros and the aforementioned pigs. They even have a small gift shop.
