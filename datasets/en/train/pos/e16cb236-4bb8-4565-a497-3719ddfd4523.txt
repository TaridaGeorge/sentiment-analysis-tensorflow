Not sure who the snotty people are who allegedly work here. I've only encountered friendly critters! And if they don't like my clothes I just donate them to charity. And I don't cry about it either. Waaa, they didn't like my Lee jeans! Waaa, they didn't like my Tommy Bahama shirt! Who are these people? Don't take it personal y'all. They're just doing their job.
