5 stars since the combination of value for money and food quality cannot be matched. The gyros are GREAT and by themselves would be rated 4 stars. But, add the great location and price...this warranted the max rating. 

Tired after work and need a quick satisfying inexpensive take out meal? Few places will do better than Niro's Gyros.
