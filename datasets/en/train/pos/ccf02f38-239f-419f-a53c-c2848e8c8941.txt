I have always been a fan of Pomegranate Cafe's food so when I recently went in and experienced the larger updated remodel I had to give a well deserved 5 stars.  Members of my family suffer from major food allergies/sensitivity, so being able to go out and eat at a restaurant without fear of having them ingest something that may trigger an attack is a Welcomed sigh of relief. Oh and I forgot to mention they purchase from local farms and so, the food is always incredibly FRESH and Ã¼ber- Yummy. :)
