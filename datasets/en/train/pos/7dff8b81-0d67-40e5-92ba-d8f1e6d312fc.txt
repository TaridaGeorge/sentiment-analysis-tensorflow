Solid dining experience all around. Apps were great--mushroom fry and bread-cheesy dip thing. I had the duck-duck-goose.  Duck meatloaf was a little strange, enjoyable but perhaps not the best use of duck. I love foie gras, so that was fantastic. J had the elk....very heavy. M had the salmon--so yummy. E had the stetson salad...a little small for a meal but fantastic.  Cuppa hot chocolate was great as recommended...loved the spiciness. Brownie cheesecake was good but didn't blow my mind, but the pistacho ice cream was mmmm....
