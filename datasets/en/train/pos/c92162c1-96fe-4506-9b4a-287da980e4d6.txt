If i have to choose between this location and the one on 43rd Ave. It has to be this one..  

Why?  Because here, they get your drink out in literally 2min or less.  Im not dogging the other location because they do great on the drinks, but my God.. you can spend 20min in the drive-thru at times. 

If you want fast, friendly and awesome service, this place kicks all kinds of ass. :)
