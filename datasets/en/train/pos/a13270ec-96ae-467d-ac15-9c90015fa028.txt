One of my new favorite places in the valley.  Absolutely the finest fish sandwich I've ever tasted.  I was millimeters away from ordering a second one, until I successfully resisted.  

Go for the regular fries, not the pretentious sweet potato fries.  They may be good, but the original ones are better.  Besides, everyone does the sweet potato fries nowadays! The truly unique joints do the regular cut traditional french fry well.  Yum!  Our friends got some other entrees which looked just as fantastic.

Moderately priced with good scenery.  Not to mention great service (table of 6, waitress memorized our order without error), and we kept adding more people on and she couldn't have been happier.  Splitting checks was not painful at all.

Go here and get the fish sandwich, it is something to marvel.
