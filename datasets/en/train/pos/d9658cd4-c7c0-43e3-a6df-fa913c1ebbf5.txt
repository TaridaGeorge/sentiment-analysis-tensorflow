COAL FIRED PIZZA!  

Pizza that is coal fired is simply amazing!  Unfortunately air pollution laws in California prevent restaurants in California from having coal fired ovens.

The coal makes a total difference.  A nice thin crust that this crispy.  Sauce is great.  I recommend that you add fresh basil to your pizza.  Toppings are tasty and plenty.

I know this is a chain but I had to review it.
