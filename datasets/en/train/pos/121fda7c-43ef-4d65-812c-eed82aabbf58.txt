For me pizza is a love that rivals all others; my wife almost broke it off with me on our second date because I was paying closer attention to the pizza than to her. I've been going to Red Devil for years (not the one in Tempe, the other one) and I love it. The pizza is just incredible and I haven't found pizza like it anywhere else, and believe me it's not from a lack of trying.

The individual restaurant isn't stellar, but it's a sports-bar-ish setting and the wait staff is mostly cute ASU girls. For the price and the quality you receive, I highly recommend Red Devil. If you want pretentious atmosphere or pizza that's "like Chicago" or "like New York" or "like Omaha", go elsewhere. If you want excellent pizza that is the best I know of in Arizona, go to Red Devil.
