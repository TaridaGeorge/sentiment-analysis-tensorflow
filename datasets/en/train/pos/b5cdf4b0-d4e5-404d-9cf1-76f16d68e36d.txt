Wow! Super busy today! I guess the rain drove everyone in to Ikea for the day! 

Per the usual, I grabbed a tasty frozen yogurt and my go-to Lingonberry drink! 

We shopped the day away and made my wish list for the fall! Can't wait to go back and refurnish my apartment!

Their prices are always reasonable and the staff is friendly.  

Have fun! I love Ikea!
