I typically like to embellish my reviews, but the day is long and my stomach is empty so I will get right to it. 

By now you know that Seasons 52 changes their menu every season and has a new side menu each week, hence the 52 if that was not obvious enough. There are a hundred other amazing restaurants in this area but Seasons 52 truly stands above the crowd with the total experience factor which includes the great ambiance, service and food that is Vegas worthy.  

If you are looking for an upscale restaurant with moderate prices and food that you can pronounce but tastes like you can't, Seasons 52 is for you.
