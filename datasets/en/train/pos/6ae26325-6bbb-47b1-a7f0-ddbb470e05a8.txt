This little place absolutely rocks your tastebuds!  Have visited twice and will make it a regular lunch stop.  The jerk chicken is absolutely delicious, and yes a bit spicy... as it should be.  We've also had the avocado-plantain spring rolls (amazing) and the spinach pattie.  The mango lemonade with mint is so refreshing and tasty.  

Don't deprive yourself of lunch at The Breadfruit... one of downtown's very best.

UPDATE: they no longer serve lunch.
