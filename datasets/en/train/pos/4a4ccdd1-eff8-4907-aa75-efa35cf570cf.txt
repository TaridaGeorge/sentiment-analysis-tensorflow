Sprinkles was the first cupcake bakery I've tried and will probably be the last.  Since the cupcake trend exploded I have tried many other cupcake bakeries challenging them to be better than Sprinkles, but most all have failed.  I love the variety of cupcakes and the mass amount of frosting.  I haven't had a cupcake yet that I don't like.  I have loved them all and they love my hips.  They are great for gifts and still are #1 in my mind for the best cupcake bakery.
