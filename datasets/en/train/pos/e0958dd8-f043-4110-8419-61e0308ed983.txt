Great shop, great easy vibe great artists. Got my first tattoo today and I did a lot of research before deciding on the Lady Luck! Yelp was a great help in my decision and after the reviews I read I had to check out the shop myself. Loved it. Very easy going. As a first timer I felt very comfortable. Jet did my tattoo and he was great! So easy to work with and very talented!! It turned out amazing and I am sold on this place! I will be going back! I highly recommend  this shop for your next tattoo! Ask for Jet! :-)
