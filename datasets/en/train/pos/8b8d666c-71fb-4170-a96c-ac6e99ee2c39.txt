Trader Joe's is awesome. 
A great selection of independent, organic and healthy choices.
From Trader Joe's own brand of products, to organic produce and meats, specialty items, micro brew beer and wine, to the packaged and frozen food, to flowers and vitamins, it is the perfect place for the health conscious and thrifty.
The staff is always friendly and helpful.
If you have never been to Trader Joe's, it is a must see.
This location is great, really crowded on the weekends and evenings, but what you lose in time you save in price.
