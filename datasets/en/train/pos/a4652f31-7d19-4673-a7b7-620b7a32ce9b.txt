This review will get right to the point.  I had some time to kill before an early morning meeting today, so I gave Lola a try. 

Espresso = Awesome
Service = Awesome
Atmosphere & Music = Awesome

Everyone that stopped in while I was there all seemed very happy, which rubbed off on me.  I'll be back.
