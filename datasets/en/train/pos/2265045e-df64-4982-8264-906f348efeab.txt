Welcome to Fashion Square Barney's!

Oh my do you perfect the new wing of Scottsdale Fashion Square, it's about time you made your way to the Valley. You're not as large and expansive as the Dillard's or Nieman Marcus, but you're jam-packed full of chic clothes one can only expect you to carry. Oh, and parking beneath you is the best place to park at Fashion Square. It's the only easy way to get back onto Scottsdale Road. Hello valet parking!
