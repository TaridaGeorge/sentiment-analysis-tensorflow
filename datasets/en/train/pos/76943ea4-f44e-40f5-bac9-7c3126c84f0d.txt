About as hip as it gets in Scottsdale. Lots of fire, paint can shakers, construction-drill mixers, lab equipment and very unusual cocktails... all done in a secretive upscale modern lounge. There are rules too: men may not approach ladies, no pictures, no rowdy assholes, no calling ahead - show up and cross your fingers a seat is open... nice. Bring a date!
