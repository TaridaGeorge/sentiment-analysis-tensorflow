I love kettle popcorn! Of coursed it's at it best on a fair freshly popped, salty and sweet and crunchy. Microwave corn is an in case of emergency and bag one, meh.

Kettle corn at Popcornopolis is delicious! It would be perfect if it was hot, but that would be asking too much:)

I also really like the nacho cheese which is pretty spicy and the sour cream and onion. It's great that you can mix different types of popcorn in the cone if you want to!

Oh! And you can have samples of any and all popcorn flavors!

Besides popcorn they had other treats like caramel/chocolate apples and dipped bananas.

The people working there are very nice and helpful. They even got my 2 y/o extra popcorn on a little plate:) 

It's a bit pricey but worth it.
