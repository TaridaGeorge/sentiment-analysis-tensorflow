You know when you find one of those places that you just CAN'T shut up about??? Yep... found it!! Been eating here for years and completely consistent everytime! My favourite two things are the 1000 Bean open-face pita dish and the Baba ganoush!! I've seriously had strangely strong yearnings, at times, for their Baba Ganoush! :) The stuff is amazing!
Honestly have tried most things on the menu! No complaints about any of it! And, the people working there are cool! Since I've been eating there for years, I've obviously seen turn over in staff! But, they seem to find consistently good staff!
