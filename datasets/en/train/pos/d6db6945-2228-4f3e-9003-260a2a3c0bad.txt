In a bread store I'm like a kid in a candy store.

White, wheat, 9 grain, italian, french, sourdough, banana, pumpkin ... I'm not picky.

Oh and then there is oatmeal, granola, cake mixes, brownie mixes, muffins, cinnamon rolls ... get the point?

The had me when I walked in and they offered me a piece of fresh baked honey wheat (with some butter) while I decided what I wanted.

I'm really on the whole grain, 9 grain, dairy free (vegan) kick and when they grind their grains on site in their own mill, it's a plus.

My choice, a loaf of high 5 fiber bread with whole wheat, honey, flax, millet, oat and sunflower seeds (that weighs literally 2 pounds) and a half dozen honey wheat dinner rolls.  

I can't wait to make toast with peanut butter tomorrow!
