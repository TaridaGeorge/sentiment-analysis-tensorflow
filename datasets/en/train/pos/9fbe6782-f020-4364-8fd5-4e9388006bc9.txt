Cannot say enough about our superb experiences at ShinBay.  Upon entering the serene dining room, and until the last morsel is eaten, the diner is treated most graciously.  The array of pristine, beautifully plated dishes thrill the senses.  Splurge on the Omakase, sit back and marvel at Chef Kurita's exquisite offerings of favorites and rarities.  Those who consider themselves purists of Japanese cuisine will find the dining here transcendent, and the adventurous will find space in their wallets to come back as often as possible.
