It took me 20+ years to find Vicky and I'm never leaving her.  My nails and skin have never looked better - I get daily compliments on both.  Her products are fresh and she gives excellent advice without being pushy.  It's a snap to book online and always a fun hour chatting with Vicky, who doubles as my therapist and relationship expert (a great bargain when you consider all the fringe benefits).  Go see her now!
