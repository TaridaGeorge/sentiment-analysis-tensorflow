First place that has ever moved me to actually go to the trouble to write a review. I found it thanks to other great Yelpers. Everything was true. Great atmosphere,  Awesome music and Wonderful bartender! Thanks for the gummy bear martini Chris! Spot on, I tell ya! We need more places like this in Phoenix!
