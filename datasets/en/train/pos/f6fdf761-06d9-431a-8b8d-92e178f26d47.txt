Great rates, great location, and very nice rooms.

I stayed here on a weekday and I was upgraded to the Business Suites with the Sleep Number Bed and an separate office in my room!  The location is great too, next to the 10 fwy and 202 and very close to the airport.

I was here visiting accounts in Scotsdale, Tempe, Gilbert and Phoenix area and this place in centrally located at those locations.

I booked the room with a 3rd party website and I was able to get a great deal, 40% off their cheapest rate on Radisson's website.
