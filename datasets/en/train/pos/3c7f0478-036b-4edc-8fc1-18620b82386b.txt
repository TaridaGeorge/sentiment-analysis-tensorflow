I FINALLY went to Radio Milano after it was recommended to me by several people and it was everything they boasted!  The wines were reasonably priced and wonderful as in all the arcadia restaurants.  The hummus and pita compliments of the chef was splendid--with a hint of lemon as a nice added touch!  I ordered the mushroom risotto which was top notch and my friends all raved about their entrees as well.  Even my friends' date (who, based on body habitus did not appear to be a fan of food) ordered a small salad, ate all of it, then picked uncontrolably off everyone elses plates!
