I heard of this place from my buddies on Chandler PD as they go there often and told me to try it.  It's a cool theme in there, one I can relate to growing up in and around the firehouse with my dad.  Lots of firetrucks, hoses, and pictures around of firemen.  Lots of hotsauces when you walk in the door - that's nice.
Good subs and hoagies and affordably priced - I got a great hot sub for less than what I typically pay for at Subway.
And after going to their web site and learning that they have a Foundation where they give money and tools back to First Responders... I'm definitely returning and telling everybody I know about it.
And for the record, all the guys and kids working there were really nice.
