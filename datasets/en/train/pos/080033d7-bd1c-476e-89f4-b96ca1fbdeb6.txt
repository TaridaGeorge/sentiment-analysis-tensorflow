If you need excellent service take your Infiniti here.  With my 2003 G35 coupe and almost 161K miles all the major service was done by the service tech: Keith.  

Ask for Keith, my 2003 G35 coupe has been the most reliable car I have ever owned.  Maybe because its an Infiniti or because Keith does a great job on keeping it in tip top shape.  

With that many miles and zero leaks: oil, etc.  I hope it will last till 200K miles with no major problems.  It still runs great and has cold ac.
