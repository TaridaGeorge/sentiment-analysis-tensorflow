Decided to take a chance and was wonderfully surprised.  Stopped in on a late Sunday morning.  Small crowd but it's not a huge place so it felt nice and comfortable.  Live guitarist was playing some great melodies.  Service was prompt and friendly, very casual.  Food was out of this world.  I had the Chiliquedes (sp?) which was basically a green chili pork dish on a buttered/toasted tortilla, topped with all the fixin's like avocado, cheese, salsa.  My girlfriend had the c4 salad.  A hearty salad with lots of flavor.  I have never seen either of these dishes anywhere else and I can't wait to try some of the other items that caught my eye.  I have used yelp for a long time but this is my first time writing a review so that oughta say something.  Thanks for a great experience cave creek!
