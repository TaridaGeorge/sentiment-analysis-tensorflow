I love this CSA. They have always given me more than what I bargained for. Now, we can add on bread, beef, chicken, eggs and dairy. SO AWESOME! I rarely need to go to the grocery store because of this!

 I've never received anything rotten. In fact, everything has lasted MUCH longer than store produce!  

For the cost, I believe this is the best CSA out there! Also, i don't feel guilty about throwing the left-overs in my composter, since it's all organic!
