So happy I finally came!! This time, as I will b back, I had a Thai tea which was delicious with sweet and sour chicken that was better than most in the valley, loaded with veggies but a good sauce. There is so much that this place has to offer so I will def b back soon with new updates on the thai, sushi and vietnamese that this restaurant offers.
