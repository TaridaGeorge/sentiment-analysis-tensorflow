i adore the old style theatre. i wish there were more of them around. the carpet is all worn, the gentle slope of the seating area. yup. i'm in love. i'm a big fan of gentle slopes. ;)

if i wanted to climb a flight of stairs to watch a movie, i would put a stair master in front of my LCD TV.

the selection of movies at camelview is awesome. i love indy movies so its fun to see them in theatre as opposed...to..um. not.
