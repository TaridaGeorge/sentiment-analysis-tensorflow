Went yesterday and had a gyro but also tried hubby's Chicken Philly. Man, that was super tasty. And honestly, I forgot how good the fries are at Niro's. Friggin' yummy! Crispy on the outside, flaky and tender on the inside and fresh as they could possibly be.

As an added bonus, my hands smelled like tzaziki sauce and onions for the rest of the day. In the words of Homer Simpson, "ggggllllllhhhhhuuuurrrrrgggggglllllllluuuuurrrrrrggggggggg"
