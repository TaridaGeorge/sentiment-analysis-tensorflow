mmm mmm good!  My honey took me here a few weeks ago to have my first bialy experience.  LOVE it and can't wati to go back.  My whole bfast of eggs, potatos, and the "everything" bialy was worth writing home about.  

The staff was super friendly and the environment is warm and comfortable.  I assume its a family run business which makes the experience that much more enjoyable.  

Make sure you check this place out!
