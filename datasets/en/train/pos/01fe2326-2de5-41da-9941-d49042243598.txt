Absolutely charming setting inside and out and a craft that shows true love of people and food. The attention to detail is wonderful, the porky housecats add another level of ambiance, the staff provide solid service and I have not been let down by the food. 

Earlier this year I spent a few months coming here weekly for a happy hour meeting and, while I have yet to enjoy the dinner menu, I love the lunch, appetizer and salad offerings, the dishes are well rounded and always fresh. 

Three cheers for the cheese plate and drink selection!
