Seriously...the best donut I've ever had.  Once you eat these, grocery store or Dunkin Donuts do not compare.  I have been a fan from their first store on Cave Creek and the same sweet owners have opened up this new store where the old Rubio's used to be.  I was craving a burrito and noticed the Rainbow Donuts sign and drove right in.  Their donuts are fresh, not heavy, big and melt in your mouth.  They do have a nice big menu for lunch and dinner and are open until 8pm!!  Donuts anytime.

I'm so proud of them and that neighborhood just got a kick in the pants.  What a great addition!
