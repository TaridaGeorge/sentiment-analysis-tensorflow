Incredible gem of a restaurant in Mesa. In close proximity to Matta's so was a challenge to give up the local standard in order to try something different.  So glad we did! The restaurant has a quaint charm and the owner welcomes each of his customers personally.  The waitress was attentive, but not overbearing. The special was spinach lasagna with Gorgonzola cheese.  Apparantly, the specials rotate on a weekly basis and this one may not surface again for 3 months. Best lasagna we have had out here! I got on the mailing list to be notified when we can come back and enjoy it again.  We finally found our Italian spot in the valley.  Jon, the owner teased us on the way out, "see you tomorrow. " He may be doing exactly that!
