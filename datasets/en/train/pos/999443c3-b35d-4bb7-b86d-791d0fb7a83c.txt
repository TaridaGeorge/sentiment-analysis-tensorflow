Really? How amazing could service and food be? Our children have very severe food allergies and Chef Marc, Manager Travis, waitress Jenna, and our teppanyaki cook each went above and beyond to make a safe, yummy and fun birthday meal for our daughter and her brother and sister.  We can't thank them enough for their care and concern. The smile on our kids' faces said it all!!! Thank you, Sapporo, for a wonderful dinner experience.
