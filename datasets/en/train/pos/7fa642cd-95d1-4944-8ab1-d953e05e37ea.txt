Reminds me of home. (SF) 
Efficient, unfriendly service, great food, low prices. Pho Gha with heaps of fresh sides priced at 6.50 or something and a banh mi ($3) and some spring rolls for my fat hunny. 
Totally packed on a Saturday afternoon- expansive menu, vietnamese ice coffee served properly. 
I can't wait to go back.
