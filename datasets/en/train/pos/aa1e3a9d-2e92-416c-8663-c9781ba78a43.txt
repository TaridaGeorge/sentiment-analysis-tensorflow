I feel odd anytime I review a chain, but this particular location has set a pretty high bar for all other locations and they definitely deserve some props.

I have eaten at this location dozens of times throughout the years and have zero complaints. Seriously, not one botched order, rude employee or unhappy dining experience.

This past weekend I was partaking in a Rock Band marathon and we needed something in our bellies to keep us fueled up. It was about closing time but they had no problems making our dishes. Our food came out without any issues, piping hot and tasty, as usual. 

We were offered to-go cups in case we wanted one for the road and because we were the last people there, the extra chocolate chip cookies from the day went home with us, free of charge! 

Definitely a 5-star experience, every time!
