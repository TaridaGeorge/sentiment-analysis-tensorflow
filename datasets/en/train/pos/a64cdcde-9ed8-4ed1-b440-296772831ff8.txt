Great place downtown for lunch! The inside is very simple, but the menu is really good. You order at the counter and they call your number and you pick up the food. Prices are very reasonable...I believe my caesar salad and soft drink run about $7.  I would be interested in checking it out after work for happy hour sometime.

Plus, how can I not love a place owned by an Ohio State alumnus? :)
