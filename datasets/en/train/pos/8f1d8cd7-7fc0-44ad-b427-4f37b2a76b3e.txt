Neighbors had told me how great this place is and after reading the positive YELP reviews, I decided to have dinner here with my family!

Friendly greeting and service from the moment we walked in the door! Fast service and great food too!

HUGE portions!! I recommend splitting entree's. We ordered 2 entree's between 3 people and had 2 boxes of leftovers we took home! I split the lamb kabobs and the meat was tender and juicy. Hubby had the Gyro's and loved them! (Gyro's were probably enough food for 3 people!!).

Moderate prices. Averaging about $15 bucks a plate, but the dinner plates come with the amazing Basmati rice with white currants, almonds and maybe a touch of cinnamon?

I was told they had the best cannoli's in town.....so I had to save room for one!!...and they were pretty darn good!! 

To sum it up...... FAST~FRIENDLY~FRESH FOOD!!!

Yummy!!
