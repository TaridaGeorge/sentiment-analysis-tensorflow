Over the past three years, Tracy at Fast Frame Chandler has designed about 10 important pieces of art & memorabilia for us. It started with a newspaper article and  since than it's been more press and some art for our house. Not only is the framing exquisite, but the level of knowledge, for design is very helpful when you need a direction for your project. Tracy is great to work with, she has a wonderful personality, and she makes the daunting task of picking which frame and what matte will look good with your art,  fun.  Right now Fast Frame is working on three more pieces for us, I know they will be above my exceptions as I have become accustom to, with working with Tracy. If you need a project done, fast and professionally than Fast Frame Chandler is the place to go!
