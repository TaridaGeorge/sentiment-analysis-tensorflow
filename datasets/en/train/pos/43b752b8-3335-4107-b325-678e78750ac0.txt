I came in for free wi-fi (they have it) and coffee.  I got all that along with a breakfast bagel and easy wi-fi access (no codes, no expectation of buying anything), along with a great staff.  All the staff -- ALL of them -- were quick with a smile, they look you in the eyes when they talk to you and are just generally awesome.  I love this place.  Oh, and nice jazzy atmosphere.  On this morning, they're playing a jazzy Christmas medley.
