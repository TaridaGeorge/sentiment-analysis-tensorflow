YEAH!!!!  Dunkin Donuts has finally opened in my neighborhood!  It is in the same shopping center as Walmart (not a fan)...Donuts are so yummy!  Do I really need to  write a review? Opened on June 24 (my birthday) it was the priority of the day to go and get an iced coffee and donut!  Jason the owner is super nice.  Go in and get your donut and coffee!!
