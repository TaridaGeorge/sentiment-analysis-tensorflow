I had a lunch meeting here yesterday and had to wait for my clients to arrive so I got to watch the active so to speak for a few minutes. I have got to say what a fab little place with great customer service!  The staff greeted the regulars by first name and were extremely welcoming everyone coming in the door.  The food was great, the wine list was extensive  and i was told by my client that they make the best drinks in town!  I was not expecting too much from the cob salad I had but is was fresh and they did not skimp on the toppings.  I can't wait to go again.
