The Deli, husband & wife owned & operated, is delicious!

I had the special; beef, onion, shroom, & cheese on a baguette. The flavor of it all was spot on. The side, a pesto mac salad was, if not better, as good as the sandwich. 

The food and service is fresh, really good, & definitely local.

If you're coming from anywhere other than Queen Creek it's a trek! But The Deli is worth the flight.
