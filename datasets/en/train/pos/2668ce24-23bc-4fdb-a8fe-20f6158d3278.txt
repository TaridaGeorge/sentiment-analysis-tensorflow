Los Compadres is a local favorite of mine.  It's located in a rather small building that used to be a house, but it's been around for years and I'm sure it will be around many more.  I personally love the red chile burros and oh man, don't even get me started on their salsa.  I hate going to a Mexican food restaurant and their salsa tasting like spaghetti sauce.  Theirs is one of my favorites and I usually have to get more chips so I can enjoy more salsa.  Los is authentic, delicious, fast and affordable.  The staff is really straight to the point (get your order, give you your drink...).  Overall, if you have a brain and want great Mexican food, EAT HERE.
