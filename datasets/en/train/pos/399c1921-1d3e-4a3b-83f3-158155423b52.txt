Okay, so my first job at age 15 was washing dishes at Fiorello's BBQ in a Kansas City and have lived in Memphis and Chicago too.  I'm guessing that changed my genetics and the red in my veins is actually sauce.  So imagine my supreme joy upon finding Joe's Real BBQ.  You will love this quirky little place.  The sides are excellent, especially the beans, which are not to be missed.  The main items have all been excellent, but a favorite lunch is just their huge baked potato with meat on top.   See, you don't always have to get pulled pork or ribs to satisfy that addiction!  Although maybe you do need the beans every time.  Well, either way you will love the food, the ambiance and the new friends you will meet here.  So get going - now!
