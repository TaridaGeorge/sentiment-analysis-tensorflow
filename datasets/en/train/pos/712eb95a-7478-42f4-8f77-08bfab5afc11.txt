My home away from home. 

When I first moved to Chandler (almost 2 years ago now), I was a little concerned. Brand new place and not a lot of folks I knew. I stumbled across the people of Gangplank after a local meetup and visited the place not long after.

Wow.

If you've got any geek in you at all, this is your spot. The vibe is just... inspiring. It's about fun. And it's about getting stuff done. It's about hanging out with other people every bit as smart as you -- and more so. And it's about teaching others.

It's Gangplank. And I'm proud to be a part.
