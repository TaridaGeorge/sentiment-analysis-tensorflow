I always stop over here when I'm in Tempe,  you can't be the prices! The hummus, gyro, tabouli have all been great.  My friend and  usually waiter, Ali even convinced me to try the Turkish coffee, that was good.  The baklava counter is always irresistible at checkout.  I'm going to have to visit soon.
