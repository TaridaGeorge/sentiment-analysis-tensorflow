I have been training here for a little over 6 months and I could not be happier with my experience.  I will be needing to add something other than just this training but to keep myself active and feeling better Tony has been an amazing help.  I have had personal training through LA Fitness and the level of service compared to the price I paid was no comparison to the training I have received at Peak Performance.  Everyone is so nice and I always have a good time when I go.  I am not one who enjoys working out, but I actually look forward to my training sessions at Peak Performance.  If you are looking for an amazing experience and need to get in shape, check this place out.  You will not regret it.
