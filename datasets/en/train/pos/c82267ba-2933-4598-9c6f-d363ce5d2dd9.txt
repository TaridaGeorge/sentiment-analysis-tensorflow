Wow, I must have gotten lucky, maybe because it was Mother's Day weekend, but I only have good things to say about the service I received from Heidi.  The moment I walked in the door, she greeted me and my family and asked how she could help me...right off the bat!  I did see the sign-in sheet, but I wasn't asked to fill out the information since there was no wait.  Heidi was super pleasant and polite the entire time she worked with us, filling out some forms, etc.  When we were getting ready to leave, she said "Wait, just one more thing..."  and she proceeded to hand my mother and myself 2 beautiful pink carnations and wished us Happy Mother's Day!  I just had to write this review to show that there is hope for this place :)
