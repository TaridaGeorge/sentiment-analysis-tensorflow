Oooooh, I LOVE Godiva.  They have the absolute best chocolates.  I'm normally one of those people that will get a box of chocolates and only eat the caramel or toffee ones, but not with Godiva.  I can seriously eat every single Godiva chocolate in a mixed chocolate box and love each one.  But is that really a good thing?  You be the judge.

They have really inventive shapes and flavors to their chocolates and truffles, but they also have the best chocolate covered strawberries. They're delicious. I highly recommend them.  If you have a special occasion coming up or just want to surprise someone with a 'just because' treat, order them! They will love them!
