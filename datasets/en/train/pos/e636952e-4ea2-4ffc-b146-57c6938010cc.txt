I always wondered how other major Yogurt chains would compete against the likes of Yogurtland.  Yogurtology is actually quite good.  The first main difference when I entered the door is that the place had a very scientific look and feel.  As we all know, something ending with "-ology" is the study of.  This place definitely studied their yogurt well.  The flavors had an extra vibrant flavors.  They had very unique toppings such as boba and baklava.  I enjoyed that the workers gave samples, which makes sure that each of the stations are very sanitary.  I came here with a Groupon, and I will definitely repeat my visit.
