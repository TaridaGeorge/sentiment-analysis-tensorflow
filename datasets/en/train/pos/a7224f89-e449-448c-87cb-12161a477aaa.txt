I've been to two birthday parties and a Superbowl party here, plus came for a few meals. It's impressed me each time and I am not a bar person. The bartenders are top notch, accomodating, friendly but firm when needed. Most of the regular patrons are friendly to newcomers, or you can choose to have a private conversation and tune everyone nearby out. They have a well organized bar with all of the obscure bottles such as Sloe Gin, Creme De younameit, Whipped Cream flavored vodka, etc. They serve lunch, dinner, happy hour specials and have a late night menu as well. There are a dozen or so TVs, darts, ample parking, clean restrooms, etc. Accepts credit cards with a $10 minimum. Huge thumbs up.
