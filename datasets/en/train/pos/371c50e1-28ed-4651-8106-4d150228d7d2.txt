strawberry-banana smoothie with energy booster = money in the bank.  I got one for my girlfriend right after she quit her job and it made her feel much better!
Very clean, and a great looking selection of toppings for the frozen yogurt.  They had a coupon for a dollar off when I checked in with yelp also, very nice.
