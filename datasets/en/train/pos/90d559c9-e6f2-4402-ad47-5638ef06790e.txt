I think this place should be cloned and placed all over the valley. Amazing. Fun bartenders, great atmosphere, delicious appetizers and entrees. It has an enormous patio that can fit literally a bajillion people, and its strategically lit with beautiful little lantern like lights.
It can be a little difficult to find seating, but seriously - it is totally worth waiting for. 
Try out the Brussels sprouts ( I know it sounds a little off, but there is candied BACON!)
Also, the Fish and Chips is a great entree as well. I love that the tartar is made in house. Actually, I am sure that mostly everything is made in house. 
The only downfall - my drive home is over 45 minutes, or I would be every week!!
