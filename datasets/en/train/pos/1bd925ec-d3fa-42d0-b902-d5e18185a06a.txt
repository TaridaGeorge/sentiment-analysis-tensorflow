I adore Tempe Beach Park ! Stopped by for Oktoberfest over the weekend ( which was great by the way). I love being able to go and sit on the ledge overlooking the water. You kind of forget you're in the middle of the desert for a brief moment and then you stand up and see all the dirt all over you and reality kicks back in.  You can walk and hang out, paddle boat, bike trails etc. 

Great place to visit!
