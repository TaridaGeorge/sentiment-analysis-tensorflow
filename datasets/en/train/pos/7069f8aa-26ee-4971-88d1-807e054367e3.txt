Normally I'm not a big fan of your basic sandwich shop. But, IMHO, this isn't just a basic sandwich shop. 

Had the Home Roasted beef panini. Wow. Really vibrant flavors, rich with just the right amount of salt. 

He also makes his own brewed iced tea and "Sekan Jabin" apple cider (this was a new one for me)....I just made a drink of half iced tea and half of the sweetened apple cider.....amazing and unique. 

Location is just in a strip mall, so not much going on there, but if you're looking for a quick bite and want to step into some fantastic but still familiar flavors, I think you'll be pleased with this place.
