I would never have thought I could be so in love with Cupcakes, which I always thought were sort of 'blah', But Sprinkles Cupcakes are seriously from Heaven, its what I imagine the Greek Gods snack on on Mt. Olympus. They're seriously THAT good.  My favorite, by far, is the Red Velvet Cupcake which is honestly probably the most delicious 'cake' or dessert item I've ever had.  Go there now.  Oh and become a fan of them on Facebook because they always have great weekly cupcake give-aways.
