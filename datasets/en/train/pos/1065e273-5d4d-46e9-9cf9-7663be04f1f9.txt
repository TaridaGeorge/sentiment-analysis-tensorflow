My most favorite coffee in Phoenix.  And I'm a coffee snob.  Because I loooooove coffee.  Hayes also makes a tasty bowl of oatmeal too.  Served with raisins + walnuts + brown sugar.  Mmmmmm...  

My son used to go to school nearby so I was there almost every morning.  I miss it.  Especially the smell...  

Most things (quoting Tom Robbins) are either YUCK or YUM.

Royal at the Market is 100% YUM!
