This is the first time I have ever been here.  I really liked it.
 We had a great waiter, but then he was cut and we got a replacement. Though she also was very good.
Our Burgers were fantastic! Cooked fully well and very fresh.
Also, our waiter brewed a fresh pot of coffee for me.
Endless fries as well, can you believe that.
They also have this great new program, a royalty program. Sign me up I can't wait  . A free Burger the month of your Birthday and for every 9 burgers you get your 10th free. 
Clean bathrooms,as I went in there to wash my hands before we ate.
They have a TV in the Floor near the waiting area,which I have never seen before.
 I thought it was really Cool!
