I love bringing friends and out of town guests to AZ88. It has such an excellent vibe, stiff drinks, mouthwatering food, and great beats. I always start with a dirty martini and older the Hell Fries. Every bite is special! After dinner, I go for round two and order the espresso martini. 
Now, lets not forget about all the talk about the secret bathrooms. Basically push the door and enter at your own risk! You will see angles of yourself you've never seen before. It's always great laughter to see what your guests say about their experience. 

A must go to for date night or night out with loved ones.
