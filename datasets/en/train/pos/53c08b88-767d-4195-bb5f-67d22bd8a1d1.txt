Had the half sandwich and soup combo - Bistro and tortilla soup - delicious!  The half sandwich was a good sized portion, too.  My bf had the combo also, but with the organic spinach salad.  Huge salad with a yummy dressing.

They were very busy, but the waiter kept up pretty well and was apologetic about the wait.  Will definitely go back when in Scottsdale.
