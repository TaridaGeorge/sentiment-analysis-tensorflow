WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ATE ALL THE RASPBERRIES FOR OUR  DESSERT!!!  IT'S CHRISTMAS EVE-HAVE YOU ANY IDEA WHAT A GROCERY STORE IS LIKE RIGHT NOW???!!!  Oh yeah, I panicked.  You know what?  Trader Joe's got me in and out in just a couple minutes.  They had two employees on every register, and someone that met you at the door to ask what you need and point you in the right direction.  What a perfect operation Trader Joe's is.  I even got some uniquely Scottsdale entertainment in the parking lot as a teenage girl screamed a string of profanities at her mom for almost scratching the $140,000 Mercedes dad had just bought her.  Lot of yelling going on that day.
