No complaints about Sprouts! I'm a huge of fan of grocery shopping at Fry's but I will most of the time go out of my way to Sprouts for their produce. They just taste better than the major grocery store chains. Seriously, if I buy one orange from Fry's and one from Sprouts I can tell the difference because Sprouts produce ALWAYS tastes better. They also have a great variety of cheeses. :)
