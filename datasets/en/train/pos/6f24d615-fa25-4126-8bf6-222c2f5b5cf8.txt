I found Pho Avina while driving by it almost every day. I didn't know that there was a Vietnamese cuisine there. I always go to Da Vang or Thao's Sandwiches. 

I really like their food and service. They are very nice. Their spring rolls and Bi Coun are good. Delicious! I like their Pho but not as much as the other places. I really like their rice selection. They have tons of choices. What I like about their rice selection is that it comes with the BBQ pork. Shredded Pork Skin, Fried Egg (rare in Phoenix, I think), and crab cake (I think that is what it is called). Other places will only have the meat, shredded pork skin  and rarely the crab cake.

I would highly recommend this place to anyone who is willing to try food that is not American!
