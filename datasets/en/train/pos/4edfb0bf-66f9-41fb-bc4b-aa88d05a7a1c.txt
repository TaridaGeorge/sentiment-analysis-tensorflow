Hubby and I tried this place after hearing from a coworker that it was amazing. We sampled a few flavors, cookie monster with irish whiskey, apple with rum (Really can taste the alcohol!), red velvet with scotch, and chocolate jack daniels. I never pick anything over chocolate but let me tell you the red velvet flavor blew me away. It had to be the texture and the fact that there was actual red velvet cake blended into the ice cream. I am the weirdo that mashes birthday cake into the scoop of ice cream so I was all over that.  I also tried a non alcoholic flavor with graham cracker. It was awesome! The service was great too. Will be back!
