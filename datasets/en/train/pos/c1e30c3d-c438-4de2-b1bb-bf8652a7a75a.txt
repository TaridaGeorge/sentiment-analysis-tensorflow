Read about this place when looking for someplace new/nearby on Yelp, so signed up on their website and won a free medium pizza.  We ordered a small to go with it in case it wasn't enough for the two of us (myself and my 8 year old son) and the medium filled us up fine.  While my son will eat any cheese pizza and love it, I'm not so easy to please ... but this pizza was terrific!  

The place has moved into the mostly empty Target shopping center on the NW corner of AZ Ave. & Warner, but it was worth the extra few miles to get such a tasty treat!  We will DEFINITELY go back there again. :)
