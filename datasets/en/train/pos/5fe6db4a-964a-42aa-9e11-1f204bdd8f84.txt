I absolutely love this nail salon.  I am under the understanding that it has recently changed owners.  I always go to Jacqueline and she is fantastic.  This evening my daughter(10 yrs old) and I went for a late mani/pedi.  Jacqueline waited for us and spent well over an hour on my pedicure alone.  Her attention to detail is excellent.  My daughter was treated well and fussed over by the entire staff.  I did not feel rushed as it was obvious we were there well past closing time.  They know how to treat customers at this business.  I will be back and will be sending more clients.
