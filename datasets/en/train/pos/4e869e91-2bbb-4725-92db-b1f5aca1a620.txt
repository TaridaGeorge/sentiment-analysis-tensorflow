This is an awesome place...step back in time with amazing decor, baseball memorabilia, and caring service.  This restaurant  was the first one built in Scottsdale (and a different location first), and the floors were handmade wood...before tongue and groove.  The menu includes its specialty of sirloin steak, but I had the liver and onions and my sister enjoyed a mouth-watering hand-pressed burger.  Stiff drinks.  Fruit cocktail on the menu.  

We expected Frank Sinatra to walk in the door at any minute.  The bar singer Steve York (on Friday and Saturday nights) reminds you of a cruise singer...fun...engaging the audience.  This was the place to be during spring training time, and owners Charlie (who died in 2002) and Gwen knew all the players by name and handed out a free steak dinner to the guys who hit homeruns. 

This is a place not to be missed!!!
