I've taken the shuttle for 2 years now, and it's a great way to safely get to and from hohokam.

I had the texas burger, which is a couple onion rings, some green chilli's and cheese.  It was delicious!  Their fries are yum too.  They had a special on bloody mary's.  2.50.  Can't beat that.  Overall, Diamonds is a great little spot, that makes me feel closer to home.
