This place is off-da-hook! Yo. The menu is extremely creative and the food is incredible.  Large portions so forget the diet or plan an extra 45 minutes on the treadmill in the morning.

The famed Stetson Chopped Salad (I prefer with salmon) is to die for and the ribs are just a hot mess (the good kind). This is the place where Foodies and People Watchers encountered supernatural powers.  :-) Friday evenings are great for dining and then a stroll through Old Scottsdale. I strongly recommend an early reservation, particularly if you want to smooze a few clients.  No one will be disappointed.
