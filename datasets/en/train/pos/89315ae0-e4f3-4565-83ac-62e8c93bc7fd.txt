Went here during the Memorial day weekend..  Didn't think the service could get any better but it did!  Walk up to a lounge chair by the pool to lay on and a person comes up to you with two large towels and a pitcher of ice water.  Soon after wait staff is working the pool area serving drinks and food.. Very nice menu to choose from.  Also it was my husband and I's anniversary so when we checked in a dessert was presented  on a marble platter.. A yellow mini cake covered in yellow fondant with a bow made of frosting on it..a large curl of chocolate was on the side that said "Happy Anniversary" as was a small bowl of raspberry sauce to drizzle on the cake.  These little touches make this hotel 5 star all the way!
