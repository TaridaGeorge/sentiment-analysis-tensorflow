We are snowbirds from Canada who went looking for doggie daycare in Fountain Hills so we could go golfing. We are thrilled we found Zusia's. 

Sue and Dana are a wonderful hard working couple who truly love the pets they care for. Their hours are great as is the  food selection and accessories. 

Our 13 and a half year old lab, Zoe, was well taken care of in a no pen environment with a large play area in the back. All the dogs looked happy and played together. 

We also had Zoe groomed one day and she looked years younger. Nice job!

We highly recommend Zusia's and will be returning next year.
