Before moving to AZ last Dec, I practiced Bikram yoga in LA and loved it! I had never heard of Sumits yoga until moving here. I decided to give it a try and I'm really glad I did. It's a great workout and I like that it incorporates power flow in between postures. The fast pace and music really get me pumped up during the session. 

The studio itself is very clean/modern and the staff are always very friendly. 

Now for which hot yoga style I prefer between Bikram and Sumits - I like both! They are very different from each other, but both a great workout and a great way to flush all the toxins out of your body. 

This is one workout I actually look forward to going to. :)
