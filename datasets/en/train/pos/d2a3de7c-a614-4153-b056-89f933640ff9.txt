SideBar is one of my favorite places to go downtown (near downtown) and either there is something going on or there are enough people to provide the perfect atmosphere for almost any mood.  We were there this past Friday with a large group of people and the staff handled our size really well and with a smile.  The owner is a great guy and will go out of his way to make sure that everyone is satisfied with their evening (or day).  

I absolutely recommend SideBar to an after dinner drink - You can walk up from Pei Wei below - and have a great evening within a few thousand square feet.
