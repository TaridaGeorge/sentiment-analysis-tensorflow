I love this place! I've been here twice for lunch and once for dinner and have yet to be disappointed.

The last time I went here, I got the fried egg sandwich for lunch - it was very good. A bit messy though - I had to eat it with a fork and knife. The fries are great too. I've also had the flatbread before, which I enjoyed. And I ordered the salmon when I was here for dinner which was quite good.

It's the perfect place for lunching on the patio with a glass of wine. I haven't tried their brunch yet, but I hear it's amazing. Hopefully I'll be back soon for that.
