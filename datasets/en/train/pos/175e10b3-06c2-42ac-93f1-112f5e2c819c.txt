One of the best, if not the best pizza in all of Phoenix in my opinion.  It is very similar to the more famous Bianco style of pizza, however way less of  a wait.  Every pizza I've had from Cibo is excellent.  The decor and atmosphere is fantastic and perfect for a romantic date.  

They have a great outdoor area and on a nice night when the weather is right, you can't ask for a more perfect/romantic setting.  

Just so you know, if you are in the mood for some pizza for lunch, this isn't your place.  Pizza is only served at dinner and I think it's only sandwiches and salads for lunch.  I recommend it all though!
