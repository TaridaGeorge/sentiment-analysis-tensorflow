We love BLT! Hubby & I first discovered it on our first trip to the Camelback Inn in 2008 and just enjoyed another terrific dinner during another Camelback getaway. The food and service are excellent. The pop-overs alone would get 5 stars! Everything from the amuse to the cheesecake dessert was delicious. I hear there is one in LA too, but this location is special to us for our little spa retreats. I highly recommend it!
