I managed Club Med resorts around the world for 26 years. We moved from Singapore to Phoenix four years ago and found our favorite pizzeria! Mr. Bianco has created pizzas exactly like Napoli, Italy! 

After managing resorts in Bari, Ortranto & Sicily My wife and I found that the pizzas, salads and breads reminded us of Italy. So nice to see fresh products used on the pies! 

I know some say the wait is long but dinner is supposed to be like that! Also want to say that the staff was very nice and the pizza chefs have been well trained. 

Bravo!
