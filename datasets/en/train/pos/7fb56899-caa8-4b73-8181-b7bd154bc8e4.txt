They've re-organized the store and now it's much more organized and less cluttered.  They carry Seche products (although they are a bit pricey), and they either started carrying them rather recently or I'm able to find them now that the store is cleaner.  Price-sheets are posted.  My latest purchase was 2 China Glaze Crackle Polishes and a China Glaze set with 2 holiday glitter polishes and a shot glass--2 of the funnest things combined into one!  $10 wee!!

It is still a little difficult to find a specific color you are wanting, but they are arranged by collection usually.  Was hunting for some Color Club Holos but sadly could not find them :(

Currently prices (from memory)
OPI: $4 and up
China Glaze: $3-$5.  Crackle is $3.50, BOGO free.  They also have sets.
Orly: $5 and up
