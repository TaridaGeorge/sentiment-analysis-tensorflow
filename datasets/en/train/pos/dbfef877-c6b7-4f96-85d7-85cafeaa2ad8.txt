Friends took me and my boyfriend here today and I must say I'm a huge fan! We had the mini Italian subs. So great! 4 mini subs and 2 large drinks for $7 ! Amazing. The sandwiches were absolutely delicious, fresh and filling and the decor kept us entertained our entire meal. Definitely gotta try this place!
