where I am from dogs are not allowed at farmer's markets due to health code dealio reasons... so it was a shock to see so many dogs around (Scottsdale seems to be super pet friendly). 

I had a blast sampling all the goodies... lots of great things to choose from!! There is no need to eat prior to the market-- between the samples, the food and the beverages not eating was the best thing ever. 

Another thing I appreciated.. this market was totally calm, relaxed... most farmer's markets back home (minus Santa Cruz) is super uptight and folks are pushy..... definitely a spot to stroll, eat and enjoy the morning...... 

The Farm Sessions concept I LOVED.
