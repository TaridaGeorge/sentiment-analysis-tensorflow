There's alot of demanding people, older demanding people at this Joe's.  That being said this is America and many older privilaged Americans don't have a clue about the world; for instance blue berries have seasons along with strawberries and things run out periodically because of increase in demand or lack there of.  I think the staff handles these aspects very well.

However, the staff is way to talented to be spending so much of their time explaining this.  That aside, its nice to be waited on by such talented people and the Joe's does a good job of keeping them comfortable there and is always trying to make them more comfortable.
