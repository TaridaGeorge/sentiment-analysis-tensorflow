why did i wait so long to try pane bianco?! i opted for the mozzarella tomato basil sandwich. bread is yummy and rustic - crusty on the outside, soft on the inside - absolute perfection. the house-made mozzarella was some of the best i've ever had. local tomatoes were perfectly ripe and plentiful. the basil was fragrant and flavorful - a real treat. i don't know what else to say except it was amazing. oh and that the yummy, nutty, caramel-y surprise in the bottom of my bag was delish. i'm hooked.
