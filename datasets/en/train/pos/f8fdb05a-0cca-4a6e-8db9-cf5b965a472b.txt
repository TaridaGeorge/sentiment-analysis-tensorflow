Friend took me here when I was visiting and didn't have any idea what I wanted to eat...just that I needed some food...and a beer sounded good too.  This place is great.  Cool atmosphere and good brews.

I got the Tap Room Tenderloin and a Hefeweizen to wash it all down.  Both were very good.  Also got to sample a piece of their tasty quesadilla.  All good and I look forward to sampling more of the menu in the future.
