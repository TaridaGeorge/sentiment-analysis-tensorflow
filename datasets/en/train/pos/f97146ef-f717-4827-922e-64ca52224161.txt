My husband and I LOVE the pizza. He went with the mushroom & ricotta pizza and I went with the build-your-own. For dessert we ordered the tiramisu, it had a pine nut brittle. FANTASTIC. We can't wait to go back.

Our waitresses personality was a little lackluster, but the food more than made up for it.
