Rays pizzeria is my local pizza joint i hit. It is one of my favorite pizzeria's usually get Sicilian style same prices as a regular slice of pizza but i get toppings of sausage's $.50). There sausage is sliced thinner than a pepperoni not those rabbit turds. They have lunch special of 2 slices of cheese and drink for just around $5,lunch offer times are m-f from 12-3. The employees are great and put customer service e first for buiz. The bathroom is always clean as well the dining area. CHECK EM OUT ITS REAL NEW YORK PIZZA STYLE. SUPPORT THE LOCAL BUSINESSES.
