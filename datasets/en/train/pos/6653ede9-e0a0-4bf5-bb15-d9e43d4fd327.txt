I had a very positive experience with Conni, who watched my two Yorkies while I was out of town for a few days.

I called her up a few days before leaving town and we set up a time for me to come by her home and see the environment the dogs would be staying in.  As opposed to traditional boarding places, I liked that Conni is willing and able to provide more personalized care in terms of feeding instructions and time, administering medication, where they would sleep, and interactions with other dogs.  Her fee is reasonable, she is flexible with drop off and pick up times, and she provides regular updates via text messages and photos.

My dogs seemed happy when I picked them up so that is a great sign.  I would definitely use her again when I need to board my dogs.
