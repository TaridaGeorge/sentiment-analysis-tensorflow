Place is super clean and great customer service!! I think the guys who serve it are the owners because they do a great job at representing the place.  The yogurt is good but the toppings are even better.  By this I mean the fruit is always fresh and I'm pretty sure the use name brand candies because it tastes better then generic stuff.
