Everyone knows this place rocks.  It has the best bar food you're likely to come across and some great beers that are so good you can even get them at the local liquor store.

Something others have probably not mentioned -- They have the best tasting water.  My boyfriend was talking about tap water and how gross it is when he turned and said "do you know who has the best water?" I got pretty excited because I did in fact know the answer: Four Peaks.  So did he.  Then we high fived.

I also appreciate the listed % alcohol content.  Sure I used it to order things like the IPA and get fucked up, but now I genuinely like IPA. Thanks Four Peaks!
