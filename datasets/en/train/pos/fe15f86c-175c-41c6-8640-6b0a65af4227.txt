As everyone says, the food is really, really good.  I prefer the pizza here to Cibo - Cibo is great, but it can be cheese overload.

The veggies tasted really fresh, the bread is made on-site and was tasty and well-textured, and the beer selection is on-point.  I'm excited to go back when I don't have to scurry back to work.

I'm not going to mark it down for the bad service we got - but it was terrible.  In case the server is reading this, yes, we meant to give you a shitty tip.  That's what you get when you ignore a table for fifteen minutes before we have to call you to order, when you take our orders with an attitude as if we've worn out your patience simply by being present, and when you act like an all around douchebag.
