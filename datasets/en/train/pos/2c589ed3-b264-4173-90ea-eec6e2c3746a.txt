I love this place. I go once a week. I love-love-love their thin crusted pzzas. I've had them all. My husband and I usually get the short ribs with polenta, which is fantastic and a pizza to split. I think the fig & proscuitto is my favorite.

It says on Yelp that it's not suitable for kids, but my kids love North. They like to people watch. I've never had a bad experience. The wait staff is fantastic as well.
