Blue Fin is within walking distance of work so I go once a week, I'd go more but that'd just be silly.  Speaking of silly, I order the same thing every week and all of the staff knows it!!   'The Healthy Special' - chicken teriyaki (white meat), veggies (carrots, broccoli, cabbage) on brown rice with a really amazing Iced Tea.  Delicious down to the last bite!

Locally owned and the staff goes out of their way to be as friendly as possible. Always smiling and always happy to see me. 

It's also right next to a light rail stop which is OH-so convenient!
