finally! my good looks get me somewhere! free coffee the other day courtesy of the foxy chick working the stand solo that morning. oh the hectic life of a working college student, and i need a quad dutch bros to get me through those dry mornings.

not to mention tons of coupons in the mail and a text subscription scores you great deals like $2 tuesday and every time a new dutch bros opens, the drinks are 2 bucks too. 

i guess capitalism has its perks.
