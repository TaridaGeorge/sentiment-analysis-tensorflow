Disclaimer: This review is based upon one and only experience with the venue... 

Scene: April 2007.
Reason: The Shins

INCREDIBLE. 
This venue offers an intimacy that most don't, including places like the Marquee, Clubhouse and Rhythm Room. Which, if you think about it, is ironic since at Celebrity, you get to call dibs on some pretty amazing seats. Don't expect to be able to see the band, though, if you decide to sit. The entire crowd stood the entire time The Shins played. (Word to the wise: wear comfy shoes!)

My only beef with Celebrity is that they don't bring enough acts to Phoenix that would have me doing 15 cartwheels in excitement. But, when they do bring in somebody, like The Shins, it's worth every penny and every second of my time!
