We were checked into our hotel and awaiting our departing flight the next morning to get back to reality. A friend mentioned Chelsea's and their awesome patio. We went early around 4:45PM for some cocktails and stayed on for dinner. It was so delicious. The Short Rib tacos were amazing as was the Shrimp Ceviche as a starter. The service was also outstanding. What a fantastic way to wrap up our vacation!
