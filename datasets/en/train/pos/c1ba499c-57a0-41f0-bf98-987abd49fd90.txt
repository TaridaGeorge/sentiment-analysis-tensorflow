I can't believe I forgot to write my review for Kelly! 

I've had Kelly's cupcakes at several events and have always LOVED them. They are always so decadent and so flavorful. Delicious!

So I contacted her to make my son's first birthday cake. We were doing a Godzilla themed party since that is his nickname. Kelly was so great at communicating with me to get the perfect cake. She was able to take a graphic I had created for his invitations and a t-shirt he wore and put it on the cake. It turned out SO cute. She was even able to make a matching smash cake for my son to tear into.

Plus the cake was delicious. Everyone at the party loved it. 

Thank you again Kelly! :)
