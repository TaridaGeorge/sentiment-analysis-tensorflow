When was the last time you and your friends had a clambake? 
Been a while?

Not anymore.
Gather up your crew and head for Deck 9 at Terminal 4, Sky Harbor parking garage.

Security rarely comes up here, and once wick'd from all the weed, you'll get to watch planes take off and land.
A righteous evening my man. 

Now load that bong, crank that old Rammstein CD, and smoke up your mom's Lexus like it's in a Kansas City Smokehouse.

Enjoy. 
And if the po-po show up, you're probably high enough that you can jump down to level 8 and hot-foot it over to the elevator.

Sky Harbor International Airport Terminal 4 Parking garage.
Deck 9.
Rocks balls.
