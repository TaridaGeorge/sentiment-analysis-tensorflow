Love this place, however, for a few years after it opened, I wouldn't go there simply because it looked crappy from the outside.  Turns out...I shouldn't judge a book by its cover!  The kids love the hot dogs, and I love the gyros!  I go there at least once a week now for lunch or dinner - seriously.  The service is fast and friendly...and the price is just right!
