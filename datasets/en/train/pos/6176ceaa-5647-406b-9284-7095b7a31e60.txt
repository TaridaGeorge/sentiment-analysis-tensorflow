What a terrific find!  Located in the AJ's center this office provides a wide variety of treatments including permanent makeup.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I got Botox from Dr. Soldo who is very professional, thorough, and timely.  Miss Karri Hayes (medical aesthetician) assisted him and did a wonderful job.  I recently moved from California and found the prices much more agreeable here.  Will definitely return and refer friends :)
