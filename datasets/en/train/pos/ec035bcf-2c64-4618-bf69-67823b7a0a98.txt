This place is amazing.  A definite must for any baker.  They have every type of pan, gizmo, or gadget you could ever need at rock bottom prices.  I like to stock up on cellophane bags and disposable loaf pans (those brown paper ones) for holiday gift giving.  Sure, you can probably find a majority (but not all) of their items at Sur La Table, but you'll pay more.
