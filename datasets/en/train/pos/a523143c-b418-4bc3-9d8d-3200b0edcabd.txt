Always a good time and the food isn't bad either. It's not the kind of place you should go with a big group, would be a tight squeeze, but with 4-5 people it's perfect! They have live bands on the weekends and the cats sit front row (Literally there are always like 4 kitties laying around and hangin with the crowd). I recommend the Vig!
