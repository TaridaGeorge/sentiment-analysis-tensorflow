Not long ago, I needed my windshield replaced and after calling around to a few companies, I decided to use American Glass in Tempe.  The lady who answered was so pleasant and prompt from beginning to end.  She spoke to the insurance company and did all the work, all that was left for me to do was verify insurance information.  The installer was very knowledgeable as well.  He inspected my car before beginning the windshield replacement, and even explained any existing problems from the previous installer.  He stepped me through the entire process, complete with instructions on caring for my new windshield after the installation was complete.  I highly recommend this company for many reasons; their knowledge, service, prices, friendliness, and my overall experience.  They were great!!
