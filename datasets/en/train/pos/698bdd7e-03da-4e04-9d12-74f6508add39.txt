I love them too much. Try to limit my visits to once a month because they are just so darn good. Fresh! I have never gotten bad food here. I have always had friendly, fast efficient service. The prices are right, the food is fresh non nonsense straight forward good. I know there's probably 5000 calories in the meal, but plan for the occasion and splurge once in awhile. It's better than McDonalds with a bunch of frozen chemicals.
