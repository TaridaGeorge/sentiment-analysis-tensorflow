Gilbert Yoga captures what yoga really should be. Hands down the best studio I've been to in the entire east valley. Nice range of classes to choose from. Caring and unpretentious. A very comfortable place to practice. Knowledgable instructors.  The cost is lower than most studios, which I believe speaks to their generous philosophy, because nothing at all is sacrificed.
