It was an EMERGENCY...I needed a locksmith, yesterday. I needed to get into my building, it was late afternoon when I realized, I couldn't get in and I started calling around. Tim at Anytime is mobile and he told me no problem, 6pm would work for him. So, 6pm it is. He shows up, in his mobile lock van and opens the door and gets me 2 new keys and I'm only $60 lighter for the whole experience. Really, I could simply start losing my keys all the time, and hell, I've got Anytime so no worries!
