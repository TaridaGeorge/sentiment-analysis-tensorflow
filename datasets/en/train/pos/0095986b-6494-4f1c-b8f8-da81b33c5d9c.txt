Great rec center! Indoor Basketball, walking track and small work out room! Basically all of the equipment your normal gym has just scaled down.

Very inexpensive for a year! $10 a year rec pass, and $50 to use the work out (weight room). 

Site also offers a lot of classes for the kids and for the adults. Yoga, Senior Center, etc.
