I love Bob at Asian Auto. I went here upon recommendation after going to another shop that was clearly trying to rip me off. Sure enough, Bob said I only needed a small portion of the service they recommended, and he saved me a lot of money. Another time I went in, I mentioned a minor noise my car was making. He said that he could fix the noise, but it would be around $200 and it's not something that needed to be fixed, just a noise issue. It wasn't a bother to me so I didn't spend the money. Both of these visits really show how honest Bob is. He always does good work and is timely, and is a very friendly guy!
