REVIEW PURELY BASED ON HAPPY HOUR:
WOW.  where do I begin??

1. amazing happy hour prices (drinks too!) DRAGON ROLL! $6
2. fast service
3. friendly staff
4. great music
5. overall perfect night.....

except for the random girl bringing us a round of sushi and just standing next to our table, without saying ONE WORD. Just looking at us.  Not saying what she has or anything normal.  It was weird.
