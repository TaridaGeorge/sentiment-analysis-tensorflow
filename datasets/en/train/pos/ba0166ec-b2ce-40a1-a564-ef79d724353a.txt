LOVE everything I have ever gotten here. The pana cotta is to die for. Fruit flavors are so fresh tasting. The other flavors, like chocolate, coffee, etc are so creamy. My mouth is watering right now just typing this. I always get a much larger size than I can actually consume and the prices are pretty good. The gelato is creamy and so satisfying, especially when it is warm.
