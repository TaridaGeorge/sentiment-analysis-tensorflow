Went here for lunch with 3 other people.  We walked in at 1:15 and were seated immediately outside at the front of the restaurant on a beautiful day.  The restaurant is beautiful and unique and is worth taking a good look at regardless of where you are seated.  Even the rest rooms are worth a visit.  We had a great lunch here.  My friends had the spinach salad and one of the other salads and they really enjoyed them. I had the Chicken Picnic Sandwich and it was outstanding--big sandwich with lots of chicken, gorgonzola, pears, lettuce on a slice of pumpernickel and a slice of white bread.  It came with a large portion of fresh fruit.  Additionally, the waitress was really good.  She was attentive, very informative, and friendly.  I will go back next time I am in Scottsdale possibly for dinner.
