this is what local arizona stores are all about. this place is one of my favorite finds. i love the selection of cards, books, and knick knacks they have in the store. enough to keep me occupied for hours! 

it's your neighborhood radical/liberal book store chocked full of awesome used and new books. i'm currently reading a book i found there and didnt realize until i started reading it that it was written by a local author! 

my husband and i both frequent this store and really enjoy our visits every time. we always find something new. we even take our family from out of town to go here and they've all really liked it. there's a little bit of something for everyone. the atmosphere is really laid back and the staff is super nice. i love this store!
