Very cool place. They've just moved a few spots down to the corner of the block; I'm not sure if they're still in the process of moving or if the decor is how they intended, but it's great - wouldn't change it if I were them.

My macchiato is delicious, my BLT and its side salad are excellent. A friendly greeting when I walked in the door, staff seems very chill. Very cool that they do ordering and payment through an iPad and Square - it's nice not to deal with paper receipts. (Why don't *all* establishments default to email receipts with paper on request?) Free WiFi of course. To top it off, I almost always have headphones on when I'm hanging out in a coffee shop, but the jams here are good enough that I'm leaving them off... for now at least.
