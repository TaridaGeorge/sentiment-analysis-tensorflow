I love this hotel. Love love love. I have fond memories here and I see it every time I go hiking on North Mountain. The hilly location give it that "tucked away" feeling, you forget you're in Phoenix until you look out your window and see the city below you. Fabulous. I loved the restaurants here. Buildings with the connected walkways were convenient and it was a neat place to go exploring. I expected more from the pool, but I wasn't disappointed. Overall, it's a nice place to stay. I'd recommend it first for anyone looking for a hotel in North Phoenix / Sunnyslope.
