Nice place great food and service. We could definitely taste the quality in which the food has being hormone free meats and local farmed vegetables. The wheat germ crunch pancakes did not suck at all. I can't wait to enjoy the buffet on Sunday. Definitely go here if you like well cooked and clean tasting foods.
