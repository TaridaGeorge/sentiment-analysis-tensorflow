We started with the flaming cheese, OMG!  Fresh salty cheese set on fire and then doused with fresh lemon juice.  My husband and I both had the gyros, which used real gyro meat, not the frozen spam-like stuff other Greek places use and then we had a (I'm not even going to try and pronounce it but it sounded like galactic-booty-call) phylo dough with some kind of custard inside.  This food is as good as it gets.  And it's in Florence!!  I never expected food this good here.  They have a huge Greek menu and Italian too.  Everything that came out looked fantastic and fresh.  The owner's son was personable, our waitress encouraged us to sit and enjoy.  This place was full on a Monday night.  I will come to Florence just to eat here.  They used to be in Manhattan and moved to Az.  Lucky Az.!!!
