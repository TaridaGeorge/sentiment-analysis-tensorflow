This is the last down-and-dirty bar heading into North Scottsdale. The bar is long with plenty of seating, and they still have an old jukebox with the flip up cds.

The bar is cash only, but they now have an atm. The people are nice and friendly, and since they have no kitchen, you can order food from a list of local menus they have and it will be delivered right to your seat.

Fun, low-key place with all kinds of different people to talk to.
