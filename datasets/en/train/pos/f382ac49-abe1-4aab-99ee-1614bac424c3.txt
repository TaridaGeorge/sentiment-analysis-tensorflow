Stumbled across this place while I was waiting for a dinner reservation down the street, and it was just what the doctor ordered!  It is a cute little shop with a small freezer with a good array of gelatos and sorbets in multiple delicious flavors.  I tried the cherry and salted nut, both of which were perfectly smooth, not overly sweet (or salty, in the nut case), and refreshing - especially now that the heat has been turned back on.
