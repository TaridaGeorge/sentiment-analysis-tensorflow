Wonderful, wonderful animal hospital. The whole staff from start to finish was phenomenal. The vet assistant Kelly was very sweet and gentle with my cat and also very personable, as was the veterinarian Wendy. They treated both me and my pet with utmost care and concern. The facility was spacious and clean and there was ample parking. Everyone here seems to genuinely care about their work and the animals they work with. I would highly recommend this animal hospital!
