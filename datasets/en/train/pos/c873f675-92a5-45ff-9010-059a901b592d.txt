I decided to give province another try and I was pleasantly surprised. As usual, their wine collection was fabulous. The waiter I had was extremely courteous and helpful, making it an overall fantastic experience.

Instead of starting with apps, I decided to try small portions of the Pan Seared Rare Hawaiian Tuna and the House made Papardelle Pasta (I love the fact that they have small / big portions for some of their entr√©es!).
The tuna was delicious. It had the right amount of lemony zest and the romesco sauce was outstanding. this is def one of my favorite dishes. 

The pasta was fresh and tasty. I loved the mix of mushrooms and monchego.  Having been to quite  a few of the restaurants in phoenix, i will say that province is right up there with the best!
