Glad to have a Wildflower location open up by my work. It's a good alternative to Paradise Bakery. The two have pretty similar concept. They just opened up here about a month ago and I have probably grabbed lunch here 8-9 times already. My favorites are the cream cheese potato soup and the wildflower salad. I usually get the wildflower two (choose two from any: soup, salad, or half sandwich) Also the blackberry/orange lemonade is really good. I've tried two different sandwiches and thought they were okay. What brings me back each time is that potato soup! The sourdough bread that comes with it is good as well.
