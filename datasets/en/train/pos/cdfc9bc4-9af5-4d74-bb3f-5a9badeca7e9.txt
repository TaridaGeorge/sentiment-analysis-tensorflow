This is MY neighborhood market. 

Actually, it's on the way to my neighborhood, which is why I love stopping here on my way home from work. Hop off the I-10 at Avondale, and hit Fresh & Easy before heading home to Estrella. 

Fresh & Easy used to be my go-to for grabbing a quick lunch or dinner item or a bottle of wine for a gathering, but I recently discovered that they have great deals on the cereal my kids love. 

Also, I love their organic peanut butter.
