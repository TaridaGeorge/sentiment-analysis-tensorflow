When I was a little girl, we had frybread once a year at the State Fair.  Since there were only enough funds for one, my parents bought one piece of frybread for me to share with my brothers.  It was a highlight of the Fair and something to look forward to.  Now - and for some time now - we can enjoy frybread whenever, and it is a delight to have a restaurant like the Frybread House around.

Not only is the food good, the owners are warm and genuine people who care about their customers and the community.  By talking to them you get a sense of this.  I eat at this restaurant because I like the energy there as much as the food.

Many blessings to the Fry Bread House owners and employees, and thank you for all that you do.
