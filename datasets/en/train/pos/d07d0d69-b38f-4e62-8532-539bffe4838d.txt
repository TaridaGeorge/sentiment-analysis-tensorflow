AHHHHH... yeah I love this place. Could it be the monster fish tank they have when you first walk in that will mesmorize your kids throughout the whole dinner or the fabulous food? I have been here twice and from start to finish I was smiling. Their signature edamame made me look up the recipie as soon as I got home. My favorite is their "$35" combo.. which includes an appetizer, meal, and dessert.  Slammin deal for a restaurant with white table cloths! I had the grilled salmon which was perfect and the chocolate souffle (A MUST!). Your water glass will never be more than half empty, nor will there ever be crumbs on your table for more than five minutes... yes I like being treated like royalty.. :-D GO ROY's!
