Great atmosphere. Has a very trendy vibe without being stuffy. Service was extremely impressive. Our server Fernando was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us some great suggestions. The only thing that outdid the service was the food...excellent. A very unique spin on short ribs. I've had many short rib dishes and this ranked up there as one of the best. The "not your typical" chicken lasagna is also a solid choice.   Show up early and grab a drink in bar north. Bar north also has a nice vibe, but the main restaurant is more happening and has an overall more trendy vibe. If you're going to sit inside, we prefer the main dining room rather than the bar north dining room (same menu at both though). If you make a reservation and want to sit in the main dining room, make sure you request it specifically.
