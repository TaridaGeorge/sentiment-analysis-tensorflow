In my mind, there is NO better pizza place in the Valley.
From the unique atmosphere, to the awesome servers, to the food that makes you moan in a "sweet-mother-of-pearl-this-is-insane" way, Cibo's is a MUST.
And this rarely happens to me, but I CRAVE Cibo's on a weekly basis. The pizza was to DIE for, but the prosciutto-mozzarella sandwich was by far the BEST thing I've eaten in years. 

I love you, Cibo!
