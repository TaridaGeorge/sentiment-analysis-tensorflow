My wife and I love this place!  We arrange our visit around Desert Botanical Garden.  The spring is the best time to visit.  It's not too hot, the flowers are in bloom, it's wonderful!  We would be members if we lived here.  I suggest getting here about 15 mins before they open.  They will typically let you in early.  We love how well kept the gardens are.  Every experience is better than the last.  This is a MUST visit for anyone from out of town.  I can't wait to return!  

Quick Tip:
Butterfly exhibit is going on!  It is well worth the extra fee!
