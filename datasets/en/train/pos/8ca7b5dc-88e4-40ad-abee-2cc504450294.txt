PEOPLE PEOPLE! I saw Kim Porter's play, MUNCHED at this black box theatre. ( a lucky pre-opening show ) Totally engrossing and utterly hilarious. Simple, but effective set design, great lighting, and a real story. I greatly enjoyed the acting, really tied it all together for me. It's showing in New York, but you can see it here Space 55.
