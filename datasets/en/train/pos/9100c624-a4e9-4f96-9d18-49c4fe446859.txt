Was looking for a non-chain breakfast place in Mesa and picked Red Mountain Cafe based on the yelp ratings. 

We were seated immediately and our waitress came over right away to take our drink order. Whenever we ran low on coffee it was refilled promptly without having to ask for refills. 

I had the bacon & eggs breakfast, and hubby had the veggie omelet. Both were cooked perfectly and the hash browns were delicious as well. The food arrived quickly after we placed our order. 

All staff was very friendly and courteous. Will definitely go back again and would recommend to anyone looking for a great breakfast place.
