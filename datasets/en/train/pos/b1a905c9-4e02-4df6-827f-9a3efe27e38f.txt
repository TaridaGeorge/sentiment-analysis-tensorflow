We walked to Grazie from my husband's aunt and uncle's winter home in Verrado a few weeks ago and had a wonderful meal. 

I couldn't make my mind up on what to order, so I split the lasagna and Dame Edna pizza with another person in our party. I couldn't eat my half of the pizza, but splitting the dishes was great as I got to eat the cheesy, meaty goodness that is the lasagna as well as an amazing pizza. 

The Dame Edna (Mozzarella, Arugula, Parma Prosciutto, Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano) was incredible and we've attempted to recreate this dish at home. My only regret is I didn't have room for dessert.
