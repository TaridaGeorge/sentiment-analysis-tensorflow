Love this place!  I tried this location on a Wednesday night and it was crowded.  Great ambiance with candle light and nice music.  Friendly service with knowledgeable waiters.  Most importantly, excellent food!  If you have been reading their Yelp reviews, you know their brushetta is a must have.  Brie & Apples with Fig Spread is a personal favorite!  Smoked Salmon with Pesto + Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes come in a close second.  Excellent mix of a variety of cheeses, meats, and other fresh ingredients.  They have a good selection of wine as well.  A trendy restaurant for young and older crowds.  Go to Postino if you want some really good food, wine or conversations!
