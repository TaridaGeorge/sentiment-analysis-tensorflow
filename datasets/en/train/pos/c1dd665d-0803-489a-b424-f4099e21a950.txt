I used to only shop at sports authority, but I can never seem to find anyone and when I do they have little or no knowledge and far from helpful.

I decided to hit the local sports chalet for a heavy bag, and to my amazement, they had a guy who actually knew what he was talking about.  They were friendly and helpful.  I am a changed person.  

Best customer service I have had, at any retail shop, in a long time.  I will pay more for good service, but not here, they have good deals and good service
