We live in Downtown Phoenix and made the trek to Scottsdale after hearing about this spot on Arizona Midday.  It was worth the drive.

Both of the owners were running the place and providing not only great service, but wonderful and unique flavors. 

I had the mint chip and chocolate brownie in a sundae and it was heavenly.  My husband tried the salty caramel and peanut butter cup, his too were amazing.

The shop is swanky and a great idea.
