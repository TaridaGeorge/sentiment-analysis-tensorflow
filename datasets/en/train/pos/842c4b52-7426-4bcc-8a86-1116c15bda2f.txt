I have always been surprised/dismayed as to how difficult it is to find good greek food in Phoenix. 

Well, here you go. I will admit that I am a bit of a Gyro junkie and have not tried anything else on the menu, but this is my go-to place for greek food. I have been known to drive 20 minutes out of my way just to pick up a gyro from this place.

Great Food - Friendly Staff - Clean = What more can you ask for?
