I enjoy Hobby Lobby because it is very well organized and you can find just what you are looking for without feeling overwhelmed. Sign up on their website and you almost always get a 40% off one item coupon. There is a great fabric section, and a wonderful card area too. I love the Christian vibe here with some of the decorator items, the music and the fact they are closed on Sundays.
