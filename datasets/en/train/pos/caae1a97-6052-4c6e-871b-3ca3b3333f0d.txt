This place beats the pants off of Ruth's Chris!! I couldn't believe it! The best bone in filet I've ever had! We love it so much that we have made it a family tradition to go every year around Christmas time as a group. Make a reservation just in case they are too full especially around the holidays! Also ask for Alan he is our favorite server  & he's the man!
