Lets hear it for Costco! Costco has great customer service, clean aisles, openness, good deals on: gas, food, home, clothes... and selling my favorite pizza by the slice - Plus, I LOVE the free samples! If you are handing out free food, I'm there! (Maybe that's why Yelp events are so much fun for me!!) 

I love coming to this location because it's really close to my house and it's not usually too crowded so I get pretty good parking. If any one wants to come with me on a Saturday for some free samples just let me know! :D
