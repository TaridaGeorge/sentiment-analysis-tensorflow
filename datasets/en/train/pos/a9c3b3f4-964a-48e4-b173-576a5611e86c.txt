So, I've been meaning to get to Fez for maybe three years now and so it was really great to finally get there.  I have to say that the wait was worth it but I'm sad that I haven't partaken of the food this whole time due to my tardiness!  I had the Fez Burger since I had heard so much about it.  The pears really do make that burger!

All the food ordered around the table was met with happy smiles and yums all around....fries were crisp and flavorful, drinks exceptional and the service was quite impressive!  We were thanked for coming in and we WILL be back!  I have quite the menu to work around!
