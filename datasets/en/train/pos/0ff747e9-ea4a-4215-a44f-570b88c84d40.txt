This was the first place my boyfriend and I ate at when we moved to Tempe and we have been back many times since. The food is great; it's clean, fresh, and a lot of it local. It fits the needs for vegetarians, vegans, and carnivores. Everyone who works here is extremely nice and the owner is a great guy. 
Try the grass fed steak tacos.
