I wish I could pick this place up and park it right next to my work, so I could go here for lunch every day. The food is amazing! I was visiting my parents in Gilbert and wanted to try a new place and found The Deli on Yelp. Even from Ray & Higley it was a 15 minute drive.

I ordered a half Grilled Mozzarella & Fontina Cheese w/ Prosciutto sandwich, and corn chowder soup. Both were so delicious that I desperately want to go back and try everything else on their menu. I wish there were more restaurants like this more central in the valley. Oh well.
