The first time i have ever been to this Boston Market. They greet you nicely when you walk in. The restaurant is very clean.....Lots of different food cooked and in stock. Smelled wonderful in there. I got the chicken pot pie, roasted chicken, green beans and mash w gravy. As well as the lemon spinach and corn bread.  Tasted a little of every thing  and everything was wonderful. Love it!
