This restaurant literally was a deciding factor when my husband and I purchased a house in the adjacent neighborhood. The staff are so friendly, and the food is so delicious. It's our favorite place. This location is completely separate from other Thai Ramas in the valley--way better than the one in Tempe. Try the angel wings and yellow curry!
