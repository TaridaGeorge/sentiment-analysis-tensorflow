I give credit where it is deserved, so thanks, Sean M, for introducing me to this place.

I love Cornish Pasty Co. The entrees are almost like hot pockets, which excites me. Normally when I come here I order the Eggplant Parmesan Pasty. It is so delicious! I could probably continuously eat them even though I am stuffed! No, Tabatha, you need to contain yourself. 

The service is great and friendly. I really love to come here.
