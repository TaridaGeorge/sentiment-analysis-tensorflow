FOR LUNCH ONLY!!!!

Came here the other day for lunch because I had heard about the lunch special. It was a little confusing at first because the specials are written on a dry erase board and are not on the menu. But for $10 you get miso soup, a side salad and a huge variety plate of sushi. This is an unreal deal. I'd literally come here EVERY day for lunch if I could.
