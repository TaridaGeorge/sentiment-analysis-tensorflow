I have been looking for a good barbeque place for quite some time and I have finally found it!  I went here today with my husband and had the two meat sampler which included brisket and ribs. My husband had the "Big Tex" which included the brisket, chicken, and jalapeno sausage.  All of the meat was moist and smoked to perfection!

I had the corn souffle and ranch beans as my sides and they had excellent flavor. They have three types of barbeque sauce: Sweet, Sassy, and Spicy. I liked all of them, especially the Sassy which had more of a mustard base and is quite tasty. Each sauce is different and will please anyone's palate. I had the peacan pie for dessert and my husband had the sheet cake. We enjoyed both.

I will definitely be returning to this place for some great food and customer service.
