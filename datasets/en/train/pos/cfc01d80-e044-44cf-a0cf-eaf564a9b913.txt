This was my first visit and I was impressed! My group of six middle schoolers had a blast! We were able to get seated at a table right away (I called ahead) and the employees were very knowledgeable and helpful.

Btw: they must have an excellent training program b/c the girl who helped us told us it was her first day and I never would have guessed it. She really knew her stuff! We will definitely be going back again soon.
