a 'must dine' in Tempe!!  quaint historic property in Tempe tucked behind the hustle and bustle of Mill Ave.  The menu is a work of art.  The plate presentations are unique and appealing.  Their play on ingredients is masterful...the overgrown shade trees and string lights sets the atmosphere for the indulgent menu. Absolutely charming...one of the few historic original 'homes' in that area....look forward to dining again.  Not just a 'meal'.  but a culinary experience.  The only area I feel lacks slightly is the service.
