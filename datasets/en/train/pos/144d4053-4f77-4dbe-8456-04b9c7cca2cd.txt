We went here for lunch and were surprised to find it more of a fast food type versus a regular restaurant. You order your burger at the counter and they bring it to your table. I ordered the veggie burger and sweet potato fries. I found both to be very flavorful and tasty. The veggie burger tasted homemade and came with roasted red peppers and avocado. There was definitely substance to this veggie burger! The sweet potato fries were some of the best i've had. Very crispy and fresh.
