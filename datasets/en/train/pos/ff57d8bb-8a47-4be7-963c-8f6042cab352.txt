I love this restaurant!  Just had dinner last night.  The pizza was outstanding.  You can pick your own ingredients and I picked Gorgonzola cheese, roasted chicken, spinach.  It was outstanding.  The staff was very efficient and had my meal in what seemed like minutes. Since I wanted dessert, I shared my pizza with my friend and will have the saved pieces for lunch. For dessert, I ordered the Tiramisu which was also outstanding. Will definitely visit this place again. The atmosphere is very nice, muted colors.  Great for a date or after work.
