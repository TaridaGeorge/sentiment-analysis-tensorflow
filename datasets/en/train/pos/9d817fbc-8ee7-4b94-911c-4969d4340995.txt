I've been here a few times and its been a good place to bowl. 
1) Its cheap. I've been to the Brunswicks and AMFs and they are way too flashy and too expensive. This place is nice, but it still feels like a bowling alley. There normal prices are very reasonable, but then they always have deals on top of them ($1 Mondays!) 
2) The staff is friendly 3) Bowling is fun! 

Drinks aren't too expensive, I haven't tried the food from the restaurant, but it does look delicious. Definitely worth checking out.
