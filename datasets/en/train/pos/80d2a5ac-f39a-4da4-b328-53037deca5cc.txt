I got my lip pierced from HTC in September 2010. They were super professional, friendly, clean, and fun. They explained everything thoroughly and made sure I understood the risks of infection and how to avoid it. My lip was swollen and in pain for two weeks but it was totally awesome and worth it. I will come back here again to get pierced.
