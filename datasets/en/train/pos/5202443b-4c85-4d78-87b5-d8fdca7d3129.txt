St Francis is this wonderful gem in the heart of Central Phoenix with a fabulous, chic, urban patio complete with fireplace, ambiance and great looking wait staff! I highly recommend it.....and I haven't even talked about the incredible food yet :) I had brunch with a friend and we shared the rosemary potatoes and fried egg sandwhich! Soooo YUM!
