Shocked the reviews aren't better for this place. Had a live band that was excellent. Wife and kids all loved their food. Had the potato chips with onion dip to start and they were great. Moved on to the ribs, fish and chips, and fried chicken. Ribs were probably the best I've had in a long time. Fried fish and chicken were crisp and tasty. Server was very attentive.  Drinks were good.  My daughter loved the place.
