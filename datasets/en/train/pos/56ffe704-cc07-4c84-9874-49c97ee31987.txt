In the East Valley, this is the best spot to get you BBQ meats! They always have the best selection, always great quality. It isn't going to be the best prices in the valley BUT you pay for quality!! The Tailgater package is your best bet- hot dogs, burgers, brats, buns AND a small bag of the BEST pretzels ever!! They mist them in light oil and then roll them in dry seasonings_ WOW goes great with beer! Oh ya- they have a nice selection of beer and wines. TODAY- tried the green chili cheese brats... fantastic!!
