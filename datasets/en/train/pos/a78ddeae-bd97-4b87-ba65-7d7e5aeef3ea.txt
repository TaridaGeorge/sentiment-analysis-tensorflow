SWISH & CHILL!!
If you're looking for a posh place to cocktail or dine, this is it!
The menu is wonderful and creative with everything from tasty and healthy sandwiches and salads to decadent, sinful desserts. Additionally, the bartender on staff the night of our visit shook a mean Kettle One martini! (Okay, a few of them!)
The outside patio couches call to you during the evening, and the ambiance is first class.
Special note: Be sure to hit the restroom on your visit... trust me! ;)
