I love sending my fabulous clothes here. 

I drop them off at 8:45 and pick them up at 5:30... Life is good when you know you can trust a dry cleaners with your stylish hip clothing... right?! lol

They get it right and you don't even have to leave your car!!! *thought I would note that b/c I know there are many other lazy people in the world too*
