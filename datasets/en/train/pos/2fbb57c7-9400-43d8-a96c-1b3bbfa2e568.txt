My dog he had been abused and is very people shy. Other groomers put him in a kennel to wait for his turn and he was desperate to get out of there by the time I picked him up. 
However, here he was allowed to roam free before and after his grooming. He allowed the groomer to pick him up and hand him to me over the gate, a minor miracle in itself. 
They did a great job at a reasonable price, and most importantly my dog didn't act traumatized when I came to get him.
Prices are very reasonable, and they can usually get him in on short notice.
