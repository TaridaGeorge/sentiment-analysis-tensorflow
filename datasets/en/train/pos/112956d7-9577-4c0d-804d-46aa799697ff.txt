The Segway desert tour was exhilarating!
Learning to navigate the Segways along the desert trails was an awesome experience. After an introduction to the proper handling of the Segways and a few trial runs in the parking lot, we were led into the desert for a tour among the cacti. 
A few spills but after an hour and a half in the spectacular desert, we concluded our adventure back at the parking lot. 
The Segways were easy to handle as long as you pay attention to the road
 ( potholes, roots,rocks, twigs) and not panic if you inadvertently run over something. 
This is a fun experience and the desert is a great place to ride.
A highly recommended activity.
