I found these folks on Google, and just walked in the shop to check it out to ask about their services. They are THE nicest people. It's a family-owned business, and I felt like I made new friends.

I had a simple repair to the brake light system that needed to be done and it was done very fast and at a good price...far less sticker shock than the dealer. They are from the SF Bay Area, and Charles the lead/owner worked at some of the big Mercedes places back there, so that factoid gave me lots of confidence.

Am definitely taking my car back there for service again. It's so nice to go to a place where they treat you like you're from the neighborhood :)
