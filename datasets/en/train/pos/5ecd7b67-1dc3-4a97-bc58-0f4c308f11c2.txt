Cibo is another of those hidden gems that you would probably never notice if you were just passing through or don't make it to downtown Phoenix. Since this is an old bungalow that has been made into an eatery, this place is smack dab if the middle of a residential neighborhood.
Their menu consists of pizza, salads and sandwiches made on fine Italian bread with some awesome Italian meats and cheeses and fresh local ingredients. I love the meatball sandwich so much that I can't bring myself to order anything else. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is friendly and the atmosphere homey. Their outdoor patio is really a pleasant place to enjoy lunch. I really need to come here for dinner or their new breakfast. Cibo is truly among the best that Phoenix has to offer.
