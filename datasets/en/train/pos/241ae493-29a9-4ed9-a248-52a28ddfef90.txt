I love this place. I love the flat bread pizzas, I love the late night menu, I love that I can bring my dog, and I love the beers. I have a lot of friends that come in and out of town and I ALWAYS take them to O.H.S.O. It's one of those you have to try it places. The atmosphere is always fun and warm lots of things to look at and the food is great. Service is fast and attentive. I've been here for lunch, dinner, and midnight snacks. All great adventures. I am big on eating and drinking local and O.H.S.O. is my new favorite spot to have a relaxing drink. My boyfriend and I frequently come here and always bring our growlers to fill up.

Can't wait for my next visit!
