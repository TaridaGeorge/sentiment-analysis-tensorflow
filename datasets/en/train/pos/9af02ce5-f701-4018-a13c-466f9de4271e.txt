I am so glad that I found Dr. David Rusick. Our good friend, Dr. Chad Stewart, recommended him to me. Chad is also a chiropractor, but his clinic is in Laveen, so it's not very convenient for me to go to. Chad's very own wife goes to see Dr. Rusick, so what does that say? 

The staff there is very friendly, and everyone takes such good care of me. Whether I am in for a regular adjustment or I am in a lot of pain and need special attention, I always feel a million times better after visiting this clinic.
