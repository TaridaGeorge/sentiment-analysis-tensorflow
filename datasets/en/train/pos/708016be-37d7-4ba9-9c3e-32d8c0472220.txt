What can't I say that's great about this place? The menu is simple and has exactly what a pizza connoisseur like myself needs, simple, delicious toppings, however I want it, and in sizes that will actually fill me up and make me not have spasms of hunger in my small intestine. My order came out faster than I could bake a Digiorno, and I loved every single delicious, cooked to perfection slice I consumed. To top off my experience, the service from our server Alexis was perfect, she was attentive, knowledgable, and had recommendations that were a hit with the family. She even recommended a wine my wife now makes me pick up every time I'm at the store. Couldn't rave more about the restaurant and especially the service, there will definitely be more 5 star meals consumed at my new favorite pizzeria.
