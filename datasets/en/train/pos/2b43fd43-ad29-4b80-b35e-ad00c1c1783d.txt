This is the best tire shop I have ever gone to.   Employees are very friendly the service is quick an d the prices are fair. I have bought several sets of tires here over the years.  Last month I had a nail in my tire and I took it to this discount tire. They were tires that came with the car so I didn't buy them at discount tire. They fixed my tire with in an hour and there was no charge.  This is oneof the few automotive experiences I've had that when I leave I don't feel ripped off. I highly recommend the store to everyone
