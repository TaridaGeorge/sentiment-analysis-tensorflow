Great hotel for business travel. Rooms are suites, open up to an atrium, very clean, very nice front desk staff - made me feel welcome and were very accommodating. Good location, easy to/from airport, and there is a nice gym across the driveway in another building. Would totally stay here again. I'm giving it 5 stars - it's not a Ritz Carlton, it's not a luxury hotel and it's not trying to be. But it's a clean, quiet, easy place to stay with lovely employees. That is why it gets a five.
