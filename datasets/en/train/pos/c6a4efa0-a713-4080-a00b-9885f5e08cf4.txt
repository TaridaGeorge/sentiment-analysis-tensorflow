Love, love, love.

The staff here is the best. They know their stock backwards and forwards, theyre friendly, and attentive.

And the stock! There isnt much I havent been able to find here. My husband and I frequently make our own 6 packs (which comes out to around the price of a 6 pack of Bud Light at any convience store). There's so many awesome beers that we still have to try!

DO NOT be the guy that walks out of this place w/ a 6 pack of Bud Light (Ive seen it!). Expand your horizons a bit and try one or five of the great choices Tops has to offer.
