I have been going to this place for many years.  If you like to cook and you have never been, then you need to plan a couple hours for the first visit. There is SO MUCH to see and try here. It is a great cultural experience. They have food from all over the world. 

You can't find a bigger fish selection anyplace. Make sure you tell them you want your fish cleaned, unless you like to use the guts. Also they will fry your fish in peanut oil for free. Try it you'll like it! 

The produce is fresh, and there are many items you most likely have never seen before. The prices are good. 

If your looking for oriental healing items they have a counter up front with many items.  

They have opened one on the west side, and Tucson as well.
