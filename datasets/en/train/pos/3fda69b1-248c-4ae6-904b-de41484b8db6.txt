Great place to dress up a bit and feel more of an urban vibe. Hip but not pretentious. I went to Postino's Monday night around 8pm. We were given a wait time of an hour for a party of four. The place was full but we managed to find a standing table near the bar to wait out our table. We drank a bottle of "Available" per the recommendation of folks next to us (heavenly) and were visited regularly by waitstaff to fill our water. The music was just the right level to support conversation, but kept a hum in the background. When seated our waiter came to the table nearly immediately and submitted drink orders. For food we had two orders of bruschetta which was more than enough. Everything was delicious. Definitely coming back here.
