I've been going to SWINA for years now.  They totally fixed my skin! Nothing ever worked, but thanks to their skilled students and instructors, my skin never looked better.  The facility is beautiful and serene.  It's definitely worth the trip, especially since they always have some sort of great offer or special going on.  A Signature Facial for $33, come on, you can't beat it!  I bought a microderm package for $129 for 3 of them.  No where can you find a price like that.  I've never had a bad experience with the students.  The instructors seem to really make sure the students are completely ready and confident before allowing them to work on the public.

They carry Rhonda Allison and Hylunia products.  I'm still using Rhonda Allison and can tell you it's top notch and very reasonably priced.

I'm looking forward to my next trip already!
