I definitely make a stop at Evermore Nevermore every time I'm near downtown Mesa. What a cool, eclectic, unique store filled with quirky and affordable stuff. They make costumes (incl. roller derby) and sell books and handcrafted jewelry made by local artisans, as well as serve as a consignment shop for local painters/artists. I have purchased some extremely beautiful pieces here. Also love their impressive ray-gun display. It's just a neat store and you never know what you'll find -- the perfect place to shop for the person who has everything...or nothing. Love this place!  Locally owned and operated -- really cool people.
