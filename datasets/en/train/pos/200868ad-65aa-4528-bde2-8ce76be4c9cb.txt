I fucking love this place. Its helped me expand my DVD collection tremendously at a cheap price. ZIA is the best place to get the latest art, independent,foreign and new releases on DVD at a great price even if they are used, I have never had a single problem with ANY of the used DVD's I have purchased there. 

The CD collection is awesome and they usually have hard to find releases that places like Best Buy and Borders dont carry. Some other reviewer said he can get all these things for the same price on Ebay, but who wants to wait for their stuff to come in the mail and spend money on shipping and ending up with scratched material?
ZIA is the place to be!
