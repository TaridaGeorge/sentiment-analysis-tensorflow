Like so many others have said, this IHOP is a pleasant surprise in central Phoenix.  It is a chain, but offers superior food for the business type, and efficient, pleasant service.  The interior is newly remodeled and clean.  

The menu is pancake-ish, but has many diner-ish, Denny's-ish favorites too.  And it's surprisingly edible.  I had a chicken-fried steak, and it was crispy, peppery, meaty, gravy and not too greasy.  A breakfast here was cooked properly and served hot.  Coffee tasted good.  Place is clean.  Service is fast and responsive - the staff really hustles.  

I wish I'd found this earlier, that I wouldn't have wasted time and money on overpriced mediocre breakfast places in the area (Good Egg, First Watch, Coco's).  IHOPs (and Village Inns) are a couple bucks cheaper than the food at other places in the area.
