Treats: We tried the cookies (chocolate chip and chocolate truffle) and would have to give them 5stars. Delicious!  
Breakfast: Seems like they changed the recipe for the turkey maple sausage so it now has an odd herb flavor and less maple flavor, but tried the flattened meatball and liked it so might switch to that option. 
**If you go, be sure to check out the bathrooms. Each one was decorated uniquely by a staff member, and  the sinks are shared by both genders. You also get to see how very clean kitchen the kitchen is as you walk to the bathrooms, so that is a great bonus.  Overall, a great non-chain place for unique and delicious food.
