Last night, my husband and friends dined at this location.  From the valet to hostess to server, we have never had a more enjoyable experience at a restaurant.  It was truly a VIP experience!  Our server, Ricky Reyes, thought of every detail - was attentive but not intrusive, knowledgeable and generous.  He was remarkable.  We were in the restaurant past closing and were never once pressured (or even aware) that we were the last patrons.  Each member of the team in (and out) of the restaurant were absolutely amazing.
