Fabulous little Italian joint with a couple other Valley locations. I went here for a friend's birthday, had some drinks, bruschetta and the Chicken Parmesan. The bruschetta was fabulous - the bread was toasty and there were just the right amount of tomatoes. The Chicken Parmesan was mouth-watering. I am a big fan of this dish in general and Nick's did not disappoint!

An overall great atmosphere, good portions and a friendly staff will definitely bring me back to Nick's again. Highly recommended!
