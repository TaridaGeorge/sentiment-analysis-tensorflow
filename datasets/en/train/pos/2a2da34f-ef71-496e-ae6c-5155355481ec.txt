Some of the best pizza we have had in AZ.  We're from Jersey, and we're picky pizza eaters.  Great Layer Cake Primitovo wine on the wine list...you don't find that at many pizza places, so somebody there knows their wines.  The small salad can feed two as an appetizer.  The Caprese salad has nice big pieces of fresh Mozz, and firm tomatoes with big fresh Basil leaves...not those little pieces of Basil.  Only complaint is that they don't have a Cappuccino maker!!!  They need to get a really nice Cappuccino maker to really call themselves a true Italian restaurant.
