I was referred to Dr. Robinson from a website. I was able to get in to see him as a new patient with 2 days notice. I have just left a very large clinic that I had been with for two years to come see Dr. R due to being treated with zero respect. Dr. Robinson was wonderful, he assured me that I would be okay took plenty of time to make sure I have support, and genuinely cared about me and my well-being. I would refer anyone to Dr. Robinson. He in a two week period has gotten me off all the unnecessary medications I had been put on and did it with such caring so I was not miserable. Thank you Dr. Robinson, you truly are a life`saver!
