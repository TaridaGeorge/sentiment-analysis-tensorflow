I flew in from Hermosa Beach to hang out with a really good friend that lives in Gilbert.  

We decided to stop here after my flight, for lunch.

We walk in and this place is so freaking cute that I almost peed my pants.  I appreciate this sorta place coming from a beach city and never seeing anything like this.  Everyone that worked here was super nice.

Home made root beer was great!

Pulled pork sandwich was great!

BBQ Beans were the best beans I've ever had! 
(pinto, lima, cowboy beans) YUMMO!

Potato Salad was bland, not what I expected but whatever.

THUMBS UP!!
