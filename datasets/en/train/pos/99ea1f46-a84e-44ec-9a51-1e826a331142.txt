What can I say this is the best dental care money can buy or dental insurance if you have it.  I have been coming to Dr Briggs for almost 10 years and they are the most professional and trustworthy dental professionals in the Valley.  The staff is super awesome and are very attentive.  This is one of the few places where I always get the VIP treatment and one of the best few luxuries I enjoy.  The ambiance is very relaxing and the decor is like stepping into a resort.  Some folks brag about their new BMW or new Louis Vuitton briefcase but I got my teeth!
