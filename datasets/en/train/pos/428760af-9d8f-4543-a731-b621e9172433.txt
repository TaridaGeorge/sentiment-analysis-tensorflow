I've been here several times now with our new pooch and had a positive experience each time. I've also tried the dog park at Horizon Park, and Chaparral blows that out of the water. I have a Brittany, we've visited both the passive and active dog areas without any problems. We love the grass and landscaping  and it is very well maintained and clean (not dusty like Horizon). I also appreciate the shaded seats for the parents. Several people have said in their reviews that the people are cliquey and rude. I have not had that experience at all. It's a dog park for goodness sake, not high school.
