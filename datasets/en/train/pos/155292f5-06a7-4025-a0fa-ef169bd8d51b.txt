Uh, friggin' awesome deli turkey sandwiches -- by far, the best in the Phoenix Metropolitan Area.  For the amount of "real" turkey that you get, they load on the extras (tomatoes, lettuce, mayo, honey mustard, etc).  A big sandwich for $7.50. I'd gladly spend an extra $2.50 then have to settle for Subway, etc.  I highly recommend DelFalco's chicken pesto sandwich and pizza.  Huge fan -- just wish they opened another one near Mill Avenue...

Read Giovanni T's review -- he hit it on the head.
