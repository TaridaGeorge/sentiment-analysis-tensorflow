Orange Leaf is my family's favorite frozen yogurt.  Many people in the neighborhood seem to gravitate there. It tastes delicious plus the staff is always very friendly and willing to assist you.  We always get a friendly hello upon arrival and, even on those few times when things were not perfect, they  immediately stepped up to help or make good on the situation with a replacement of whatever it is we would prefer.  Also, the decor is very inviting,: clean and colorful. They also offer 2 different ways to add up your purchases to earn either free product or money off at furure visits.  We will contunue to be regular customers because of the happy experience and yummy treats we have everytime we visit.
