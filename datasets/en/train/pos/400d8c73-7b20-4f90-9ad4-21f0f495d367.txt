Just returned home from a great four days in Scottsdale.  During our stay we visited the Gainey Village Health Club and Spa and was very pleased with the service we received.  I had a facial done by Trisha that was wonderful.  She was very gentle and thorough.  I also had a scrub done by Linda.  It was very relaxing - I felt soft from head to toe afterwards.  I highly recommend both ladies.  If you are in the area, done miss out on a little pampering at this spa as well.
