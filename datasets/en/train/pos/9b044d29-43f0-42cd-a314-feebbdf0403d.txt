Fantastic for Brunch!

The menu was enticing enough that we ordered a couple extra dishes for the table. I sampled six dishes in all and all of them were exceptional! Our party of four picky foodies all went home happy.

Besides great food they have a friendly, knowledgable staff, the music was pleasant, yet not overbearing and Robert McGrath even dropped by the table to say hi. 

Excellent.
