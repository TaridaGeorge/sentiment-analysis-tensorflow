This is probably one of the nicest hotels I have ever been too.  It's located on the edge of Scottsdale allowing it beaucoup de privacy.  Ok, first off we had our own little villa and the room came with a CD, lavendar bed spray, bath robes and slippers.  Yep relaxation all the way!  The bed was incredibly comfy and the view spectacular.  This hotel does not disappoint.

Now on the the infinity pool.  The pool was lovely and the smoothies even better.  I was in heaven.  Did I mention the hotel does not disappoint.

Finally we ate at the restaurant and our table faced the desert.  Wow, the view at night was incredible.  The food was also 4.5 stars and made my tummy happy.  I cannot rave enough about Sanctuary, it realy lives up to its name!
