This place is perfect in every way. The selection of yogurts were variant, which I loved!  
I love the green tea and the sweet taro. Those two flavors are my personal favorite. 
You can stop by after dining out in one of many restaurants in the same vicinity. (Pita Jungle, Pei Wei, Baja Fresh just to name a few) 
The owners work here, so they do a good job at making the place nice and clean.
