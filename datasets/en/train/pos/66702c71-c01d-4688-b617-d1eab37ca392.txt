Always a crowd, but there is a reason.  And the reason is amazing food.  

The lunch special gets you in and out (after you get a table) really quickly.  It is always the highest quality, fresh ingredients, and a fast, friendly, efficient staff that does the best job, despite the throng of people every day. 

I've been there 3 times in the last 6 weeks and I've tried the mushroom, the chicken parmesan, and the shrimp pizzas.  All were good.  I look forward to working my way through the menu.  I haven't ventured past the Cesar salad, though, as it is just so darn good.
