What a great find!  We were actually looking for Takamatsu, and ended up here.  Nice banchan - love the sweet potato, the spicy kimchi and chewy sweet things that I think were anchovies and sour crunchy white shredded stuff that I think was cabbage.  I had the bibimbap with beef and my husband had the same but with raw fish.  Both incredibly tasty, with a ton of veggies.  Huge, too.  Very friendly service, and a nice atmosphere. Definitely putting this spot into the rotation!
