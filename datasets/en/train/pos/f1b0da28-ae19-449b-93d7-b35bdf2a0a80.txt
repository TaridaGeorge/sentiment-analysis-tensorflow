Everyone at the Salt Cellar is AMAZING!!  The food is killer the service of the staff is impeccable and the owners really do care about their customers.  We had my Moms 50th birthday party there.  It wasn't a small group either, there where 22 of us, for any small restaurant like the Salt Cellar that is a really large party.  The staff was super attentive to all of us making sure my Mom was given extra special care.  Glasses never went dry and food came out quick, hot  and all  together!   I can't express how pleased I am with the wonderful service we received.
