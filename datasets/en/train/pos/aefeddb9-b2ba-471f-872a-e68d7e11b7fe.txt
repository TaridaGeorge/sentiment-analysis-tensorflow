Always our favorite coffee place on a Sunday morning. Have stopped in on a Friday evening for wine, tapas, and great live music. Try the flatbread, very tasty! Today was our first Sunday brunch, I had the eggs Benedict, the best I have had in our neighboring areas to date. I asked for avocado and tomato substitution instead of Canadian bacon. It was not a problem, and ample portions. Seemed many Eggs Benny were being served throughout our time there. I highly recommend this restaurant for your Sunday Brunch. Friendly staff, fresh food, great find.
