LOVE this place. The sweet & sour pork wasn't phenomenal, but the orange chicken was. The sauce they used was a perfect combination of citrus mixed with a sort of teriyaki spice. Also, their servings were huge in comparison to any other Chinese restaurant I've ever ordered from. They stuffed mounds of food into plastic containers that dwarf the traditional midget-sized white take-out boxes. 

 I ordered delivery about 10 minutes before they closed and they were happy to oblige. Not only did they still take my order happily, but they had the food delivered less than 20 minutes after I placed my order. 

I will certainly be eating here again; I recommend you do the same.
