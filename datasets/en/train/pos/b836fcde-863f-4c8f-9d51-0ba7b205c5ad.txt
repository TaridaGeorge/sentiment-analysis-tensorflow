Mastro's City Hall is one of the best steakhouses in Scottsdale.  The Classic steakhouse setting with Red Leather booths and tables.  Lounge and Main Dining and some nice music to go along with excellent service, nice wine list, and an fantastic display of meat.  The Bone In Filet is the most common choice but you can never go wrong with the Strip.  All of the appetizers that we tried were prepared perfectly and our waiter was at our beck and call.  If your looking for a nice date place to really set the mood City Hall can take you there.
