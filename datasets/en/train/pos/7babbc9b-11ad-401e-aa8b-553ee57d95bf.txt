I recently came here for the first time and loved it! The staff at the front were so kind and helpful. I only had to wait a few minutes and then I was taken back into the dental rooms. Everything was very modern and clean. I felt really comfortable here, and I really think it was because everyone seemed to like working there. My hygienist Brigitte was sweet and patient. She also gave me a good cleaning with the cavitron and regular instruments. Dr. Mayer was my dentist and he was nice and answered all of my questions thoroughly. I felt like he really listened to me and cares about my teeth. I will definitely stay with this dentist and am so happy I came here.
