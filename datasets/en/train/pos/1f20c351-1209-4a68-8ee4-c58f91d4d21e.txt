Seriously, slamming Kazimierz as a wine bar is like slamming Lombardis in NYC for pizza.  Let's get a hold of ourselves here.  

Forget about the food, if you want food, go to a restaurant.

Forget about smiling doormen.  If you want smiles, buy a ticket to the next "Up With People" tour that comes into town.

Forget about light.  If you want light, go hiking in Sedona and soak in the sun.

Bottom line, if you can't find a wine that pleases from this enormous list, you must not have a tongue.
