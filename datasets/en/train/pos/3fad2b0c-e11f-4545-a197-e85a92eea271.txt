We were in Phoenix last week visiting relatives, and we went to this restaurant with my sister in law.

It's the second time we have eaten there.

Fantastic is not too strong a word for the food here.  The lemon chicken was outstanding.  Freshly made as can be and light and tasty.  We also ordered Mongolian beef which was good, and the house fried rice which has shrimp, chicken, pork, the works.  That was great.  But I really liked the lemon chicken. 

This place isn't fancy by any means but the price is right, we got out of there with three of us for about $35.  Woo hoo.  

Good food, good service, moderate prices.  It really doesn't get much better than that.  I'll go back whenever I am in Phoenix.
