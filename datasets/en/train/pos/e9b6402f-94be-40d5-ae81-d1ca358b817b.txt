I also appreciate how The Body Shop has made "going green" a priority way before it was socially popular. Although their prices are a little high compared to their competitors they use all natural products people! I always find really cool stuff that is good and good for your body. They also 
use aromatherapy with most if not all of their products which is also great for your body.Next time you want to buy a gift basket for a friend or find yourself heading to another beauty shop at the mall stop by the body shop!
