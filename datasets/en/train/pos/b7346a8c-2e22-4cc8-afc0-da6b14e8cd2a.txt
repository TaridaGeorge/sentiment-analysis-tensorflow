I've had two issues that Kevin has fixed and I have to say that he's the best plumber I've dealt with in the valley.  I will now be going to him for all of my plumbing needs.  He replaced a backyard hose/faucet at a relatively minimal cost and explained everything very carefully.  In another issue, I had a problem with my garbage disposal and instead of visiting and charging for a visit he told me how to fix the problem easily for free over the phone!   That's the kind of service that warrants high praise.  Thank you so much Kevin!
