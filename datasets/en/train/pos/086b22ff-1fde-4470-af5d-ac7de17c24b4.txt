This cupcake spot has excellent customer service.  This is something that is very hard to find these days.  My husband and I ordered 7 cupcakes for a gender reveal celebration we are doing with my family.  They were extremely helpful and pleasant.  When I went to pick them up, they were nicely presented in a very cute box.  They even had an extra one made for us with a congrats sign.  Thank you Gigis Cupcakes.  We will definitely be back for more delicious cupcakes. :)
