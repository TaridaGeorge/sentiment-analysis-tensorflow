Great place to mingle with more sophisticated people than who you'd usually find in the area. 

Jade bar does a great job with interesting cocktails and I've tried some things here that are definitely outside the box and really liked. They make a drink called the Fiery Mandarin that is vodka, lemon juice, cranberry juice, jalapeno, and orange zest. I've been making it at home it's so good. Their bartender wins just about every award in the book for cocktails.

Great view on the patio, awesome happy hour, and an awesome vibe. I could go for some Shishito Peppers and a Fiery Mandarin right now. MMMM
