This is the second time I've eaten here and it was as good if not better than the first. 

The first time I had the meat lasagna and the second time I had the cheesesteak. Lemme tell you this is one of the best Italian places I've been to in Phx.

It's very Back East feel to it and I love all of the authentic Italian foods they have there, especially the meat, cheese and pasta counters.

Check 'em out you won't be disappointed!
