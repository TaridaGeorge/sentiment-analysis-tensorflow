5 stars you ask. I say yes. Why?

1). Staff was really nice, attentive and the server we got knew her menu. When you are a stranger in a strange land then it's nice to have a friendly face. 

2). Ahhh the food. I ordered the pasta with vodka sauce. What a winner. My friends liked their dishes also and so it was a hit. 

3). Atmosphere is casual and open. Definitely relaxing and a good place to bring friends and coworkers. 

4). Parking. Not a concern in Casa Grande, but I always love free and easy parking.
