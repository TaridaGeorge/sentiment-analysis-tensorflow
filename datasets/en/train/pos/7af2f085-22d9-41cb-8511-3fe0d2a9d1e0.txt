My friend and I had a delicious lunch here on the fun patio by 2 lovely waitpersons...a tall big chubby spanish guy and a darling red haired spanish girl...i had the shrimp fajitas, he the chicken fajita's...mine had a buttery spicy sauce to dip in and this delicious polenta  and the usual grilled onions and peppers. It was very delightful and the service was very sweet and friendly and the patio very quaint. You dont even feel like you are at the mall.
