The pulled duck pizza is delicious; actually, everything I've eaten here is a win. The menu changes fairly often and all the offerings are fresh and unique. It's fun to watch your meal being cooked (the dining room only seats about 15 and the bar divides you from the kitchen).  Large wine selection as well.
