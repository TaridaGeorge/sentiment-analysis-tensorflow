My favorite pho broth around!  Nice portions, good prices.  The staff treats you like family!  They are really just about the nicest people I've ever met at a restaurant.

 I like their spring rolls, but I like the ones at Pho Ao Sen better (especially the peanut sauce there).  But this is my favorite place for pho.  It never lets me down and is always worth the drive.

The fifth star was given because I really feel like family when I'm there.
