Las Noches de las Luminarias is in full swing and even better this year with the addition of Dale Chihuly's glass sculpture exhibit. Each sculpture is perfectly integrated with the landscape along the many luminary lit pathways. There is plenty to do, see, and hear as you stroll throughout the garden. You will find comfy fire pit seating areas, great live musicians, and a few bars nestled along the path. Dress warm and wear comfy shoes because some of the paths are a little rocky. I recommend the evening event after the luminarias have been lit - 5:30 to 9:30pm.
