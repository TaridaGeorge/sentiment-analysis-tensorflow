Like the other ladies have said, this is the place to go for your lady visits!  I followed Dr. Hlavacek from her other practice to here and will follow her if she ever moves again.  She's professional, friendly, and I trust her.  It's an all female practice.  I've never waited long- they've actually called me before when they are running behind to tell me- have you ever been to a doctor's office that does that?!
