We had Sunday brunch here and it was by far the best meal I've had in awhile. I ordered the eggs benedict with the smoked salmon. It was rich, and creamy and perfect. My husband had the Sunday brunch burger and he said it was one of the best burgers he's ever had. I wish I lived in Phoenix because I'd be here every Sunday. The only stumble was that the live music during brunch was a tad too loud.
