I think I have eaten here a dozen or so times.  You think you can't get good seafood in Arizona, you're wrong.  This restaurant is amazing!  Their seafood is always fresh and tasty, the bread you get before your dinner is spectacular, the service is some of the best I've ever had, I can't say enough good things about this place.  Yes, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for.  If you don't normally go to nice dinners but have a special occasion, try the Salt Cellar.  Like I said, I have been there about a dozen times and I have never had a bad experience.
