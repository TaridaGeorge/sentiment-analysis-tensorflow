So who's the jackhole that didn't mention this place is a high falootin' date night type of joint? Maybe I just didn't read the reviews real well.

Service was impeccable. Water and tea always filled to capacity.

After getting past the language barrier ordering dinner, our food literally flew out. 

Bob with the orange chicken. Myself with the suns chicken low carb style with extra jalapeno.

bob says his was excellent. Mine was very good. Asked for some chili paste and even it didn't quite bring it up to my heat level.

I guess a lunch buffet is served? I'd like to try that I bet its excellent.

then an almond cookie? my cryptonite.
