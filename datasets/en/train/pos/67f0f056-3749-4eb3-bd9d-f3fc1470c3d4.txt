Any good city has places well-suited for kicking off a great night. Cornish Pasty is one of those places.

With so many filling options (meat-and-potatoes for the all-American, East Indian cuisine for the globetrotter, eggplant for the vegetarian), all your friends can find pasties they like. And the $3 Car Bombs are tasty and potent.

As a take-home option, Cornish Pasty offers discounted half-baked pasties you can finish at home. But I prefer to sit at the bar, have a few drinks and watch the cooks prepare pasties from ultra-fresh ingredients.

Note: Seating is limited at this location, so be prepared to wait or go during non-peak hours.
