Randy is a fantastic person and a fantastic coffee roaster. He takes a lot of care and pride into the products he sells and the integrity of this little local coffee company truly shines. I have been drinking Randy's coffee for 5+ years-- all the way back to his Willow House days, and I am so excited that he is not delving into roasting. Changing the world one bean at a time. Many local Phoenix businesses carry Xanadu these days-- but if you can get your hands on it, Xanadu makes a toddy concentrate Discutely can't be beat (they make great cocktails, too: toddy, milk, Kahlua)!
