I placed an order at the bakery for an office affair.  The next day I arrived to pick it up and they didn't have the order.  It was in the book they used and some how was not seen.  The ladies behind the counter were so apologetic.  We sat over at Starbucks and waited. Within 20 mins or less the decorated cake arrived.  The lady's name was Reggie.   I understand that everyone makes a mistake, it is how you handle it is, what I am looking for.  Safeway has always been good with customer service but this took it to the next level.  Even though their is not a Safeway in my neighbor only near my place of business.  I will start doing my grocery shopping on my way home.
