Hi: I'm back again @ sushi is fresh even better for knowing lunch is only 12 bucks! Lots of extras on the grill extras on fish cold salads, and many items from china, Korea, and all of Asia! Bring an empty tummy for all the fun foods here. Judy my lunch waitress is smiling and always very awesome so ask for her tables! 5 Stars!
