I love BUTTERS!...(and I hate breakfast!)

I've been to Scottsdale twice, and went to Butters twice.  That sums up how much i love this place.  They have great fresh orange juice!  They refill their syrup for every table as soon as the customers leave...everyone loves a full jar of syrup!  It's the little things that make me happy! :)

It's quite popular among the locals, the second time I had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  But it's worth it.  Go here!
