Wow. I'm definitely going to be re-visiting this place.

-The food:
My group ordered a few plates of bruschetta to share, and I tasted the apple/brie, mozzarella/tomato, and fig. 
First of all, I love the plating - it looks good and is very functional and easy to share. Everything was truly delicious and professionally prepared. 

-The service:
We were lucky enough to be there when it wasn't busting at the seams, although it was still crowded as usual. Nevertheless, we were seated promptly and given attention right away by a helpful and cheerful waitress. The food arrived shortly and re-fills were covered well.

-The atmosphere:
It was a beautiful day- which helps, but on top of that, it was clean and comfortable where I was seated, and I personally loved the music selections. It's a very hip and happening kind of place with good style.
