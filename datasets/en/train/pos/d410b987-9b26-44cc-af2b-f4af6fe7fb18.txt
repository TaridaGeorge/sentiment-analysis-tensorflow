I am relatively new to Phoenix and decided to try Wag N' Wash for grooming my two miniature dachshunds.  I called and made an appointment and took the girls in and Holly did the grooming.  When they were all done, Holly called me to come pick them up...they looked so great and they each had the cutest bow on their harness.  I made a second appointment which went much the same way only this time they were each wearing a cute bandana when I picked them up.  The grooming prices really aren't all that terrible for a large city and Holly did a really nice job on them.  Everyone in the store seems extremely nice too.  I would definitely recommend Wag N' Wash!!!
