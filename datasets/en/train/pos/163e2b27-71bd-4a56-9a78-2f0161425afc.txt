Bring the kids! This place has lots of good flavors. Icys and frozen custard...YUM!

I first tried this place in Maryland. Couldn't believe they made it to AZ.

They have a simple treat that anyone can afford.

Their flavors are not "sorta tastes like," they absolutely taste like their specialty flavors...like PB&J, cotton candy, swedish fish, etc.

Go get some!
