We love this place.  We tried another children's hair salon a few months back and it was a horrible experience, not "kool" at all.  By the recommendation of a friend I took my twins to Snip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah.  It was such a great experience, both my twins have gotten hair cuts a couple of times as well as my husband.  Miss Tara is really great with the kids, there is no more stress to go to get hair cuts!
