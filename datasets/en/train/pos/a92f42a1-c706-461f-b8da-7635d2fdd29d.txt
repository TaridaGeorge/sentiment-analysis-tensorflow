I can't overstate how much my wife and I love this place. It's one of our very favorite, if not our absolute favorite, pizza places in the country. We make a point of visiting Oregano's every time we're in greater Phoenix. The atmosphere is amazing--it feels fun even if you're waiting for a table. It's cozy all the time. The waitstaff is consistently casual, cool, and friendly--it's been this way for several years, every single time, without fail.

The pizza is outstanding. Fresh avocado sliced on top of a chicken pizza keeps us coming back every time. We've never gone wrong. And the pizza cookie is amazing.

Just adding another 5-star review to a great place.
