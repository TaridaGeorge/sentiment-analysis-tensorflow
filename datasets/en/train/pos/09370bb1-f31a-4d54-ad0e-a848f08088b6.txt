I love this studio!  (Actually, I go to the location in North Scottsdale mostly - but they are run by the same fabulous group of ladies).  The classes are HARD!  Seriously, I've never worked so hard while standing in one spot!  They don't miss a single muscle.  I've been going regularly for about 6 weeks now and I really notice the results.  Moreover, my husband notices and even a few neighbors!  I highly recommend this workout.
