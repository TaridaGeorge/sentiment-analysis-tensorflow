I have been going to Biagio nails for about a year and a half now and I have never found a place better than this (and I've tried a lot of nail salons)! Kevin is the absolute best and does gel nails which is difficult to find.  I've had other places do my gel nails before and find that his application of the gel is superior and makes the nails last longer.  

Everyone at Biagio nails is great.  Their store is extremely clean, looks very high end, and the nail techs are very sweet and fun to talk to.  I have been happy everytime I've gone here and will keep going back.

I do recommend that you make an appointment.  They can usually accommodate you that day, but they get booked up if you do a walk-in.

If there were more than 5 stars they would have earned them!!!
