I think any costco has the same level of awesome customer service and products. This location is the one I have been going to for nearly 3 years. Their return policy is SPECTACULAR! Anytime I have had a problem with ANYTHING I have bought, they take it back, no questions asked, no hassle at all. There have been times I bought a flat of fruit, 3 days after buying it the fruit went bad and they exchanged it no problem. Also love their little food court, where else can you feed a family of 3 for under $10?! Great treat after an hour long shopping excursion :)
