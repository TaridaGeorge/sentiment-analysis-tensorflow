I have now used Red Seven services on 2 occasions. The first time I spilled soup all over my laptop keyboard and it went a little crazy.  Red Seven replaced the keyboard and got the thing fully operational for me again. I also had Red Seven fix my laptop at that time which was running a bit slow and it has worked splendidly since. Last week my grandfather's laptop wouldn't sign on to the internet and I couldn't fix it.  I took it to RedSeven and they said it was badly infected but they had me up and running in a day. Thanks RedSeven.
