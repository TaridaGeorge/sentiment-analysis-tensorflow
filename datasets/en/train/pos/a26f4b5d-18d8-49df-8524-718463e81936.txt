If you live in the area, you must experience this.

A paved pedestrian/bicycle path that follows along Hayden Road as it winds it way by several parks, man made lakes, golf courses, and schools. A lot of local condos and houses have easy access to it. Pre and Post work hours you'll find quite a few people out walking, roller skating, biking, walking their dogs, fishing, jogging, ultimate frisbee and the usual park things. Did I forget any?

If you know where you're going it can take you anywhere in the Scottsdale area. Below is a list of possible places you can get to from it (and I know I go cycling up and down it):

If you have any questions about biking or hiking around Scottsdale, feel free to message me. I am a big supporter of the Greenbelt!
