The pizza is awesome.  The crust is perfectly cooked and the sauce is amazing.  We ordered 3 larges and they couldn't have been any better.  The cornmeal in the crust is the key.  Did I mention the sauce was great?  Great Great pizza.  The best I have had. 

The boneless wings were great along with the cheese sticks.  I can't wait to try the bufaloos.  

The owner, Todd is very nice.   I talked to him about his new business and he knows his pizza.  Everybody should try this joint out.  It is GREAT!
