THE FOOD

Sandwiches. Hot and cold. I prefer cold and they make them just fine. I would say the sandwiches are not soggie like Subway's gets to be. Quiznos bread to me is a bit better. Smoothies are also quite good for the price. Prices are reasonable.


SETTING
This is a typical corner sandwich shop. Tables are clean, the place is well lit and it doesn't feel crowded

SERVICE
Always good and patient even if you somehow manage to forget what you were about to order. If you are a regular, your sandwich might even be made without you saying anything.

OVERALL
Good place to have lunch. Getting every 12th sandwich for free as part of their loyalty "eater" program makes it that much better.
