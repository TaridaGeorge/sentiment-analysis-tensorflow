wandered in after first friday, sat right down no wait and it was soooooo good!  tiny little place, the kitchen smells amazing. very affordable given the quality and portions of the food. jerk chicken was pretty spicy, just how i like it.  my buddy ordered the scallops and said they were pretty much the best.  excellent drinks (order the coconut water and it is srved in a real coconut that you can scope the "meat" out of) and the two piece musical outfit added great music to chill but definetly not overwhelm. cant wait to go back.
