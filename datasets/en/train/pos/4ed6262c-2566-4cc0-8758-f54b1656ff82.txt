No!!!!  I am a newer Yelper and I was running through my "list of places to review" in my brain, P.B. Loco came to mind literally in sixth place.  And then I come to the reviews only to find they are closed?!

My nephew and I went to P.B. Loco in what must have been 2005 - the year they opened.  Fantastic little place.  We went back infrequently (I am not a fan of Scottsdale) to the mall but always stopped in at P.B. Loco when we made it out that way.

I hope to find P.B. Loco in a new location in the future... 

Your deliciousness will be missed!
