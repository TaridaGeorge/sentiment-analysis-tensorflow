My buddy and I were in town to watch some Spring Training, while walking around Old Scottsdale we literally stumbled onto this place.....and boy were we glad we did! It was not too packed for a Saturday nite (but it soon picked up!). They had a fairly good tap selection, but the best was the price....$5.50 for 2 beers...the best price I've seen in Phoenix so far. The crowd had a good range of ages...It wasn't all college age kids like Tempe. Seems like a place I'd like to hang out at home.
