This may be as good as it gets in Phoenix.  St. Francis has struck the perfect balance between classy and casual with good eats that are local, and a great happy hour for the less well off.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeabale.  The food is good.  I mean just that, its not amazing or something that will make the food network per say, but it is good everytime.  The food is fresh, locally sourced, and cooked and seasoned well.  This is the type of place you go to when you want a sure thing.
