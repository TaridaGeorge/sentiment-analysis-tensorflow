This sets the standard for all Gyros for me. Everywhere else has to try to at least be close to George's. All fail. I can't speak to the entire menu because I can't get past the gyro and side salad. The fries look great and they do have pasta on the menu. 

The gyro's are the perfect blend of everything and delicious. I highly recommend them. It is a local joint and although they have tried to "up" the ambiance, it really doesn't matter. It is what it is. They are closed on Sundays.
