No complaints here!  I was in California when my clutch started making horrible noises.  I made it home and these guys replaced my throw-out bearing and clutch in 1-day.  My husband called around - these guys were competively priced.  Service & time was fantastic.  Driving my truck now (163,000 miles) and the clutch feels great.  
They advised that they do ALL mechanical repairs too!!!  

Oh, and this was the SECOND vechicle we've brought here.  My husband brought an old truck in here about 7 years ago and was satisfied back then.  This place has been around a long time.  Hopefully we won't need to be back, but if need be, we have their #.
