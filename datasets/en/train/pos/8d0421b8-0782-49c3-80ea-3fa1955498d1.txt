This place makes me happy. As a native San Franciscan, Sapna reminds me of the cute neighborhood cafes with amazing food and great prices. I had a delightful brie + pear combination panini, which was served with a salad lightly dressed in vinaigrette; to drink I had a ginger lemonade which tickled the tongue. Plus...the colors of the building are incredible. Can't wait to go back.
