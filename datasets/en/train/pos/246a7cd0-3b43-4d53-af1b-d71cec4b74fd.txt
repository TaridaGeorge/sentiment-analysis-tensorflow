To put it simply, this place is amazing!!  I went in for the very first time today for happy hour after work..  The front door was opened for me and I was promptly greeted and sat at a table with some co-workers.  The waitress was very nice and efficient.  The food, oh wow, that burger was fantastic and the double truffle fries were to die for.. We also shared some zucchini fries and sweet potato fries, both were equally amazing.  The prices were even excellent especially for the posh location.. I cannot wait to come back and eat again!!
