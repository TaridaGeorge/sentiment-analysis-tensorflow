Simply the best Ethiopian I've ever had.  Grew up in VA with DC as my stompin grounds (home of a large Ethiopian population) and even had a good amount of Ethiopian home-cooked meals by friends and none was as good as this place.  

I go to AZ once a year for work and each time I am sure to stop in.  I usually get the veggie or meat-lovers meals since they tend to be such a good bargain, but have also ordered separate items as well.  

The vibe is casual and the service is excellent.  The staff have always been very friendly --- another reason I keep going back.
