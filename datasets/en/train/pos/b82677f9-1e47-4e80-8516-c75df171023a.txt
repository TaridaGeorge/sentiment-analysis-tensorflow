Well since the last time I talked to you all about this arena....I have been to many Phoenix Mercury games.....and I was even at Arena Bowl to see the Rattlers. However last night was my first concert experience at U.S. Airways Center. I went to see John Legend and Sade....and it was a show to which I have no words....but trust me it was Sultry and I was in a total trance the whole time. The arena was set up very nicely for the Sellout Crowd....other than having some better organization....I will definitely return for another concert in the future.
