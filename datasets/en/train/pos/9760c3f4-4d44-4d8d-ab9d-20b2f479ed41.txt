They were kind and opened a few minutes early for us and another customer!

The staff was really friendly and invited us to sample all we wanted, of course our son's eyes lit up and we had to explain what "sample all you want" meant.  Our son thought he had hit the Gelato Jackpot!

Chill has some really great flavors to choose from, we enjoyed Spumoni, Creme Brulee, Birthday Cake and Chocolate.  We did sample the Pistachio and Mango too.

We were excited to grab some great gelato and service with a genuine smile.  We'll be back for more "samples"!
