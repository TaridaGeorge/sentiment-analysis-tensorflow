Definitely one of the best parks in the league. Every time I walk into the park I'm overwhelmed with happiness. I reccomend going to a game on a Friday, there are fireworks after those games. Definitely go with friends for a better experience. For food, I recommend streets of new York individual pizzas. $7 for pep or cheese, $8 for supreme. Awesome pizza for a ballpark. Can't wait to go back.
