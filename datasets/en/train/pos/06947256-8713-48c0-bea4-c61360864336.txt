I've only been here during Christmas season, the place is so lit up with Christmas lights you can see it over a mile away. It definitely has an old dive-y atmosphere, but who doesn't like a comfortable, quaint little charming bar that serves cheap booze right? Its small inside, but has a good size patio full of heaters, and this place pulls in a decent crowd too. I hear it's the oldest tavern in Scottsdale, I really hope it lasts many more decades.
