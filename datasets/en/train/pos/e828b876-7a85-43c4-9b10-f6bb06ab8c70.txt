Best oral surgeon ever! I have all these annoying and complicated dental issues and he has been patient and professional through years or surgery. His staff is knowledgeable and courteous and I never have to wait too long for an appointment. Surgery is scary but I completely trust Dr. Fish. Apparently others agree too as he always wins "Best Oral Surgeon" in Phoenix Magazine every year.
