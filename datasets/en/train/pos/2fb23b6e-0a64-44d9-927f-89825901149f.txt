WOW!  Fleming's delivered in spades!

This is my favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  The food is exceptional, the wine list is out of this world, and the dress is casual!  It is a bit pricey for me, but man is it worth it.  I have never had a better Fillet and all of their wines are very well picked and represent a wide range of pricing and styles.

I can't go there often, but man am I happy when I do!
