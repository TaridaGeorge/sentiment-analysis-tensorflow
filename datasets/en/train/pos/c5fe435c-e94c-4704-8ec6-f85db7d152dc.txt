Certainly one of my favorite places to dine in Scottsdale.  It's such a cozy location, and seems missed by the typical Snottsdale persona. It's not about the flashy, just the food.  Happy hour has amazing prices, with drinks around $5 and near full meal sized appetizers around $10.  Outside of happy hour, the duck is my fav with out a doubt.  Cooked to perfection, it's juicy and sweet.  Don't forget the green chile Mac and cheese as a side dish!   Wine selection is strong, but not huge.  My only wish is they had more craft beers available.  If you're going to go, make a reservation, they use Open Table.
