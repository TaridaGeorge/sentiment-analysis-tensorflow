I came to the W last month for a Bachelorette party. My only complaint was that it was raining!  Aside from that the bar was awesome.  We got bottle service up by the pool and they were nice enough to find us another table downstairs when it began to rain.

Alyssa was a great person to work with.  I called ahead to make sure they could accommodate our group and she had everything set up when we arrived.  They made the night very memorable.

I have not stayed in the rooms but the Pool bar on the roof and the Lobby bar was awesome.  The crowd was overall very good looking!

 I am definitely going to come back here next time I am in Arizona!
