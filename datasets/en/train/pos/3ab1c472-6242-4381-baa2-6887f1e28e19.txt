Chipotle meets Sushi.

High quality ingredients, innovative idea, select your own sushi, affordable, and easy! This was definitely a great place for a meal. They keep the menu simple and healthy. You can put everything ranging from fish to strawberries in your Sushi! Your sushi can be made in 90 seconds flat. The ingredients taste fresh and healthy.

I will definitely be coming back in the future; I see them doing extremely well for themselves. It definitely brings a great concept to a competitive fast casual market.
