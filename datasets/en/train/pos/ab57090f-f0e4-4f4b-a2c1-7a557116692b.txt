Time for an update. On a seemingly quiet Monday evening, we were in the mood for good chinese food. On the way to Jade Palace last evening, I said to my hubby and son," I am SO in the mood for shellfish. I hope they have it on the menu tonight." To our delight and surprise, there was a softshell crab appetizer (delicious cooked with jalapenos) and a full lobster prepared in ginger and scallion sauce. Hubby and I split the divine lobster and it was reasonably priced- $36 for 1 3/4 pounds. Our son ordered the Yang Chow Fried rice (a family favorite) and everyone was happy. Manager Hugh (cousin of the owner) always makes everyone welcome and happy.
