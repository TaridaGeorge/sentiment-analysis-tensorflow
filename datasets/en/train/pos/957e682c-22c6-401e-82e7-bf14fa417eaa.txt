OK - I have been very sad since Franco pulled out of the Esplanade and moved his cuisine to NYC. I found out yesterday he was back and my wife I and I promptly went there for dinner last night. 

The service was great, food exceptional and as you might expect Franco was there a working the restaurant with his passion for customer service to create a wonderful dining experience. 

It was such a delight to order a meal that was very tasty and well portioned. The wine list is also fantastic. They have $20 bottles that go great with an Italian meal as well as some pricier bottles if you are so inclined. 

Franco, we are glad to have you back!
