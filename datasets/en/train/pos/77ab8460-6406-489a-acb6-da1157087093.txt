Best pizza in the entire West Valley! Our favorite is the margherita, but honestly, you can't go wrong with any of them. The crust is absolutely amazing, and the toppings are super fresh.

Of course, no restaurant is complete without fantastic service, and Sal's has some of the friendliest people around!
