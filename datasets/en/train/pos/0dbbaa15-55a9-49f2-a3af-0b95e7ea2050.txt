My new home away from home.  As soon as I walk into Keegan's....the bar and waitstaff remember me and indulge in awesome conversation.  I always meet and have fun with the patrons as well.  It is like a family reunion....

And the food is amazing as well.  And please always remember to make room for their cobbler :)  Prices are very reasonable - and Happy Hour is a menu you can't beat.  (Football Sundays is also an all day happy hour as well)
