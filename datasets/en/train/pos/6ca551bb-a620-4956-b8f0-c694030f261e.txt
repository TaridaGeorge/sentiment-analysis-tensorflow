I like this place it is like McDonald's but better I have been to a couple different ones before and they are all good. When I lived out in Az we use to go here. The whataburgers are great try the bacon and cheese whataburger and so are the whatachick'n. I havnt tried the breakfast yet so next time I am out there i will try it.
