I bought a conference table and chairs a few months ago from AZ Office Liquidators, and feel like I got a great deal on great furniture.  This month, I purchased 10 refurbished office cubes from the company, and I couldn't be more satisfied.  

Lorraine designed our floor plan, sourced high-quality units in good condition, repainted shelves at no cost, and coordinated a no-hassles installation.   I'd make AZ Office Liquidatiors your first and last stop for office furniture.
