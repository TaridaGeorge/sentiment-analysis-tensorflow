I went to irie's a few weeks ago and got the jerk chicken and dumplings.  It was AMAZING.  I love how spicy the chicken was (they did ask, so you can get it not as spicy).  The prices were not bad and the place is very clean.  The service was good, if you don't know what to get, they will help you pick something out.  I can't wait to go back!
