This place is great.  I am not sure if this place reads Yelp reviews or what... but anything negative that was said about this place is not the case today.  The place was spotless.  very very clean.  The people behind the counter were incredibly friendly and attentive of the customers that came through the door.  I was immediately greeted upon entering (even when he was helping another customer) and after ordering, my food was promptly made.  

The bagels were great.  Nice size.  Crispy on the outside, doughy in the middle.  Significantly larger than other bagel stores.  The lox were fresh.  The cream cheese you can tell is homemade. 

Overall, this will be the place I get bagels from now on.  This east coast Jew has found a winner.

Thank you bagel man.
