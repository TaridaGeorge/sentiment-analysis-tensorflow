First time to Don and Charlie's was great! The wait was not what I was expecting from the reviews here. We were seated within 5 mins of arriving for our reservation. Our server was great. He did not come by to much but enough that we always knew if we needed anything we would not have to wait.  I had the prime rib medium rare and my wife had the filet medium. Both cuts were cooked perfectly. I am a bit of a snob when it comes to prime rib but this was really one of the better cuts I have had. 

After we were finished Don came over and introduced himself. Very nice guy and seemed genuinely interested in how our experience was. We will be back soon !!
