I have just completed my first treatment at Getz Better Acupuncture. Stephen Getz asked me a series of thorough questions to get right to the heart of my issue. He provided me with two treatments In a single session, that including cupping as well as acupuncture. The cupping was a brand new experience and Stephen explained the the anatomy in terms I could understand. He was very light handed when needling me and I did not feel the needles penetrate my skin. I felt a tingling sensation at several of the points, all the time with Stephen explaining what was happening and educating me in the underlying mechanisms that were taking place. I will definitely be back to and recommend this practitioner of several modalities within traditional Chinese medicine.
