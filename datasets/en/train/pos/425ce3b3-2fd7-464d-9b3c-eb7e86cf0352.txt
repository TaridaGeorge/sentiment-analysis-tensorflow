Went here for dinner a few weeks ago. I was very pleasantly surprised. 

My bowl of bisque soup was absolutely delicious, my burger was perfect. I always judge a burger joint on their swiss/avocado burger and mine was perfection in a bun. Cooked to order and juices locked in. The ingredients were fresh and flavorful. 

Give it a try and you won't be disappointed. Will definitely have to visit again on my next trip out to Scottsdale!
