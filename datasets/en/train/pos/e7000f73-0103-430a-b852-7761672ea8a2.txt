Small shop, but all good watch places are. It's a father/son operation, and it's a genuine shop. As in they do repairs there, and don't exist mainly to sell you jewelry or buy all that spare gold you have laying around. This place could exist in probably any of the past 3 decades and the only thing that would look out of place is the moderm(ish) credit card processor. Good service, fast sercice, good price. You can't really ask for anything else.
