Ok so I'm like a huge beer guy and for the longest time have been disappointed that arizona has no real amazing breweries. That was true until I took my good friend from England in and sampled some of there exceptional beers. I had their "Scottie" which is hands down the best Scottish ale ever , then moved on to the "Rottie" which is one of the best Milk Stouts you could ever drink. I highly recommend to anyone living in the state or visiting to check them out.
My friend from England had the IPA and the Red which he absolutely loved then he had to have a scottish after hearing me go one over it!!!
DONT MISS THIS PLACE IF YOU LOVE BEER!!!!!
