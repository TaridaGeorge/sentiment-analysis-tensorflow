"When do you need the shirts by?"
"How soon can you make 'em? We got a game tonight at 9."
Concerned look on Shane's face, "I'm pretty sure I can do that."

He did. I needed five shirts for my league team with a big logo on the back and different numbers on the front. I went into the shop around 4:30 PM and got a call around 8 PM saying the shirts would be ready by 8:30. I cut it close but the man delivered. Shane was very friendly and helpful. I got a 10% discount for ordering a "quantity"

I brought the tees to my team and they all loved the shirts. They dug the design, the P.E. Shirt style, material and the fit. 

Oh, and by the way, we won all three games of our match that night. I'll be going back to Brand X.
