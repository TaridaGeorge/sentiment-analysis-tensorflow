Yay, Treehouse finally has a home!  I've been stalking them at the markets for months and was super excited to learn that they were going to have a store front.  

I had a large order of cupcakes for an event and the owner was very helpful with picking out flavors, colors, and exactly how many to order (We even kept the fact that they were vegan a secret as to not sway anyone's opinions before tasting).  No one could tell the difference and all were gobbled up!!
