After reading the long waits and snippy hostess reviews, I was a little skeptical about the quality of Pizzeria Bianco. Wow was I wrong! The wait was totally worth it, and the food had a quality higher than any other pizza joint I have visited. I had the Margherita, and I recommend it, though I heard the WiseGuy is also amazing. All in all, if you can deal with the wait (sometimes up to four and a half hours!), you will be rewarded.
