Another year, another Resolution Run 5k! This run is a nice way to start off the new year. It's quick, it's close, and the Running Masters who put it together always have such a fun attitude! 
For a $25 registration fee, you get a long-sleeve chromatic t-shirt which changes color in the sun. The race is sponsored by Sweet Tomatoes and this year was also sponsored by Cliff Bar-both of which provided snacks after the run. 
There are medals awarded to the top three finishers in each age category and a raffle for various prizes such as water bottles, sports bags, and gift certificates to Sole Sports and Sweet Tomatoes. 
The run meets in Papago park and the course takes you onto the canal just south of McDowell Rd. Starts at 9am so it's not too early either.
