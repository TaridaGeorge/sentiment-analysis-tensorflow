I love Costco. I usually do quite a bit of fresh food grocery shopping here. The produce is great and decently priced. When I go to Safeway for strawberries it's always a matter of finding the container with the least moldy ones, not so at Costco. They've just started selling crab stuffed portabella mushrooms which are delicious!
