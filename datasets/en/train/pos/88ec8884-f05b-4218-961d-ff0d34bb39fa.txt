the absolute best pancakes i've tasted anywhere in the world! Plus. Somehow they have perfected the art of making crisp bacon with no grease! Thei order of pancakes is enough for 2 people. And their fresh squeezed orange juice is the best. Plus...all I need to do is walk out the front door of my building when I get up and they are next door. So I image that makes everything tase better when I'm feeling lazy in the morning!
