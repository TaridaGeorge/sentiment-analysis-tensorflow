Dr Kahn did cateract surjury on my husband, in both eyes and he is so happy as he can now read big print without glasses and can see the street signs on the highway, He also can see that there was a light on the front of our TV in the bedroom that he never seen before. He is 20/20 in both eyes for distance....
