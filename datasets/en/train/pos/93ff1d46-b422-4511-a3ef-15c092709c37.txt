Happy that this place opened up!  Burgers are amazing...and their horseradish pickles (guessing boarshead brand) are a great addition to the meal.  Havent had anything other than beer to drink, but the Trippel that they have on tap is awesome.  Its pretty rare to see a Trippel on tap.  A great place to go any night and grab a drink.  The fireplaces are a great mood setter and the staff has been great every time I have gone there.  Giving it a 5 because I can walk here, love the the beers on tap and bottle, and food was great!
