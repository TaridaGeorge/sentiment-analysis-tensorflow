I want to say that everytime I have brought my family there, the food has been great. The person behild the counter hs been great. One matter when we have gone he has always had a smile on his face and always willing to make it right. If you want something fresh he has no problem making it.  Becuase of his attititute we will always go there in stead of the other places we have gone.  We are from New Orleans and the chicken is the bomb here.  Make sure you keep the person behind the counter there.  He has the big smile with one tooth messing....
