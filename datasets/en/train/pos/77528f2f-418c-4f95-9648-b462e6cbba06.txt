For a local coffee shop, OSP does everything right for me.

Blazing fast internet, perfect coffee, and a local scene that supports community. The walls are covered in art from local artists, the coffee is bought at fair market value (meaning they buy coffee from companies that pay their workers minimum wage - Starbucks does not!), and on the weekends they are pumping music by local bands.

If you're looking to get work done, which is often the case for me, they've got plenty of comfy spaces to curl up in and get things done. The atmosphere is laid back and the people are super friendly.

Go try it out! They're next door to Tempe Yarn (they're kind of hard to see from the street, but park when you see Tempe Yarn).
