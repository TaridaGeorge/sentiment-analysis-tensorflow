Amazing plants, events and I love bringing out of town visitors.  As a resident of Phoenix, I've had a membership to the Garden for the last 2 years and I love it. The collection of cactii, century plants (agaves), aloe, and so much more is stunning.  I love the walking path, butterfly garden, flashlight tours and especially the Luminaries every Christmas.  The combination of music and the hand-lit luminaries is stunning and a great way to celebrate the season.  Definitely worth the visit, and if you can get in on any of their events (Chocolate & Chiles, music, etc...) they are wonderful!
