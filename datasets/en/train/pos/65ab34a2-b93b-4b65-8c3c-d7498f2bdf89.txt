Men's cuts should be as easy as it gets, but somehow people figure out how to butcher it.  Sport clips specializes in Men's cuts, so I figured I would give it a shot.  If they can't get it right, I should just give up and shave my head, right?  Well luckily, they did a great job, so I don't need to shave my head :)  I can't speak for all sylists there, but Nicole did an awesome job.  She gave me a good looking cut and was very friendly.  Overall this is a great place for guys with shorter hair and the price was very reasonable.
