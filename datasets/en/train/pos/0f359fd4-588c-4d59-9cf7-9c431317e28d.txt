So I heard of JT Aesthetics thru a really awesome deal on groupon. I made an appt with the owner of the salon Jessica who was so nice ad sweet! I let her know right off back that I get very nervous when getting spray tanned because your having to get pretty much booty naked and expose all the flaws infront of a complete stranger. she made me feel extremely comfortable right off the back. The entire experience was EXTREMELY professional and comfortable which made the experience so much better!  I will definitely be going back even if there isn't killer specials for her company. She was super nice!  My spray tan looks amazing and I will definitely be referring her to my girlfriends for there spray tanning needs! THANKS JESSICA FOR BEING SO SWEET!
