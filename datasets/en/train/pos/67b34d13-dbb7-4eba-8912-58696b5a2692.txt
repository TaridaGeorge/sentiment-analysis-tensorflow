Wife and I tried this place for the first time about 6 months ago, and have been back twice since. Get there early because it is a bit cramped, but well worth it. Limited menu, but very well rounded. I've yet to have anything there I didn't like, and I can be a bit picky. Loved the dish with garbanzo beans and spinach, could bathe in that stuff (all though I wouldn't smell very good). Good wine list, several beers and I had an awesome glass of Sherry to cap off my meal. Yeah it's small plates, but that's what tapas is SUPPOSED to be! If you want a good meal and don't mind being a bit cozy with strangers, this place is a gem
