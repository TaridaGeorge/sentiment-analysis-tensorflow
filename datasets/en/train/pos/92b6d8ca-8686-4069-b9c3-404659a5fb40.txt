By far my favorite crap hole in Scottsdale.

Can't beat the price to booze ratio.  The clientele will always make you feel more sober than the guy next to you, which can be comforting at times.

They just started "Elvis at Noon" on Wednesday night.  It is awesome!

GO GO GO...  just don't go on a weekend night.  Don't go anywhere in Scottsdale on a weekend night.  Mwah hahaha
