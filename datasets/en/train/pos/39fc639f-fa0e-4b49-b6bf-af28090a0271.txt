I dropped by here on a Tuesday night after a Suns game.  The place still has a new car scent, seriously, but no worries.  The deconstructed mod decor was slick, the special dining rooms are a nice touch.   
      The pretzel fondue, apparently a Fox Concepts staple, was fantastically indulgent and delish.  So too were the steamed mussels and chorizo, make sure you get some bread to with it and soak up the broth!  The wine list was simple and straight forward, the selections good.  
     The staff was a crack squad, perhaps a little over attentive, but that's honestly not a bad thing.  The manager, Ashley, came by and offered suggestions and was wonderfully helpful.  
     I need to return for an entree, as soon as possible!
