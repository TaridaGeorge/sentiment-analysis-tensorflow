I really had a good stay at this hotel. They staff was extraordinarily friendly. They offered me water upon arrival, which was very appreciated. The room was clean and spacious. I was supposed to be there for 6 days, though l left earlier than planned. On the 3rd day, they left me some milk and cookies in my room.  Very nice! the breakfast was pretty good.
