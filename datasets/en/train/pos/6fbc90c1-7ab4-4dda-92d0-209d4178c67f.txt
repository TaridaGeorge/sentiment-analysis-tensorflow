Ate there while on vacay last year.  Food was excellent. My cappuccino was so sip worthy (see happy pic). Eggs were well made & delicious. Pancakes were to die for. Portions were big. Our waitress was extra friendly, courteous and prompt. She even gave us directions and tips on Sedona. All in all, I'll cherish this place for its memorable breakfast
