The service was fantastic, fast, and courteous. The place is really tiny, but that just adds to how much I'd like to go back. 
The menu was thorough and the prices were really awesome, not to mention the food was SPECTACULAR. 
I love good Mexican home cooking. Nothing better. 
Definitely stop by!!! You won't be disappointed!!!!
