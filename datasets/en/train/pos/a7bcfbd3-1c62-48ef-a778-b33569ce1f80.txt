Indie film heaven, folks. Not the recycled garbage showing at mainstream theatres. I've been to dozens of movies here. Always friendly attendants, and a few times they've let us come in with our outside food. Of course, we ordered from their concessions as well so it wasn't like we were trying to be cheap or anything. Pssst, no ICEE machine for those fans craving one. They've let me bring one in a time or two, though!

It's kind of cool being the only people in a theatre at night. It's like Mystery Science Theatre commentary since you can talk and enjoy the movie like you were at home. 

I'm not concerned about the old decor, it's the movie I'm interested in. I've never had a bad experience here. Thanks for looking outside the mainstream machine and bringing quality, interesting and unique movie options to the metro-Phoenix area!
