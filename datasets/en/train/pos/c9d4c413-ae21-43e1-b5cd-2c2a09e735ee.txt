Solid. Just had a trip to Phoenix to pick up a Diamondbacks game and tried Matt's Big Breakfast, well, for breakfast. I read the reviews for this place and decided to choose it based on the high rating.

Had eggs, bacon, toast and the OJ. It was easily one of the best breakfasts I've had. When I visit again, I'll go back for sure and highly recommend it to anyone looking for breakfast.

The price was about right for the organic and natural foods they offer. It's probably a little more than most tiny breakfasts stops, but knowing the food served was chosen from natural food markets, the price was spot on for the quality of food.

There was a wait because the restaurant was tiny, but well worth the wait. Trust me, definitely swing by this breakfast diner. You'll be glad you did!
