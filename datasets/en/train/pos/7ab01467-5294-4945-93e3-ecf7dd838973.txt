I have shopped at this location before, but this time I am rating the optical department.  Dr. Anh Tieu is very friendly, professional and gives you all the information you need to take proper care of your eyes.  

The assistant who runs the front desk was very friendly, also.  I arrived on time for my appointment and they had me fill out a very short form and I was seen by the doctor in a few minutes.  She took her time with my exam and discussed my astigmatism issue.  

They only take cash or debit and their regular eye exams start @ $49.  Mine was $89 for contacts and astigmatism.  They don't take insurance.  She fit me for my new contacts and I received a "free" pair of contacts, some solution and a new contact case.
