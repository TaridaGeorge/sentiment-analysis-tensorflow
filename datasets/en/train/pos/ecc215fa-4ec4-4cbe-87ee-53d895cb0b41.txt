I've been wanting to check back at NOCA since Chef Matt Taylor took over. I'm so glad I did. I had been to NOCA a couple years ago and it definitely made a good impression,but I think the new Chef takes it in a great direction.

Some amazing standouts were the Lobsta Po-boy with Duck fat fries, Seared scallop with Pork Belly and truffled parsnips and Crusty delicious Hake, a fish I hadn't previously tried. Light and mild with an incredible golden brown crust on the top and melt-in-your-mouth flakey buttery texture inside.

The rest of the courses from the tasting menu were also fantastic and the service was very attentive. I cant wait to go back and experiment with all the interesting special events they have on Sundays and other days.
