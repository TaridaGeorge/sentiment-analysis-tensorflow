Totally agree with the other reviewer on quality; very diverse menu all served colorfully and with very thoughtful tastes.  Nice family funs the place and it's spotless and very reasonable.  We know our way around a Thai menu and this is VERY good food.  Located right next to a Starbucks and a little out of the way but well worth the trip, especially if you're in the Mesa area!
