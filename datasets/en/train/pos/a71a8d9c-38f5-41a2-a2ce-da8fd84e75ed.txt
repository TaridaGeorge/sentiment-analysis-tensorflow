I have to say this Starbucks is the best.  They know who you are what your drink is and are very personable.   they are awesome I have not seen another Starbucks like this ever.  They  don't argue in front of the customers as I have seen many times before.   They ask how are you doing and don't just talk to each other (ignoring the customer)  as I have seen before at other  Starbucks.   They are awesome.  I had to relocate to another state.  Sadly I will miss this Starbucks they are simply the BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
