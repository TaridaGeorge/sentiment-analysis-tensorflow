Seriously love this place. I go here almost every day. Everyone who works here is incredibly nice and the coffee is to die for. The pizza and veggie scones
also really good and pretty well priced I think. They can tend to take a little longer filling an order but it has never bothered me. Also, the prices tend to vary.
