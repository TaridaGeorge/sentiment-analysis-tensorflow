These were some of the best tacos I've had in the states, far better than any hole in the wall taqueria tacos I've ever had in fact.

I don't know if BYOB is acceptable in the area in general, but we went next door to Safeway and grabbed a bottle of (kinda gross cheap) white wine and BYOBed, they gave us a cup to pour it in.

The girl that was working was amazingly friendly and helpful.

They have two or three small tables outside even.
