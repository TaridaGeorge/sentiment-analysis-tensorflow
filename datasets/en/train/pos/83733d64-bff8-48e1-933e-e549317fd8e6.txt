I drive by this place twice a day on my way to and from work. For 2 1/2 years. And I'd never stopped in until yesterday, when the books on the sidewalk outside called my name on my way to Trader Joes. 

This place is amazing! I had no idea it was so big. I love anywhere with books, but when you have cute gifts, trinkets and other fun stuff, it makes it even better! 

I only picked up one book, but I wish I would have had the money (and the shelf space!), I would have gotten a dozen more. I will also have to take more time next time to read the staff recommendations, which there were a lot. Excellent touch!
