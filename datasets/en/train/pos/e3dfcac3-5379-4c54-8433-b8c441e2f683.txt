Mmmm...!Delicioso!

This place is a local gem. The restaurant isn't known for the atmosphere, but for the good food! It's in the ghetto, but the food is cheap and delicious. I always get the tostada, but the butter tortillas are amazing too!!! I take my out-of-town friends here whenever they ask for authentic Mexican food.
