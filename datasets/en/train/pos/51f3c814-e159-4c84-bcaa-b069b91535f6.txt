The best sushi in Chandler. Possibly in the Phoenix metro area.

Shimogamo is a quiet sushi location in a strip mall.  The interior has just a few tables and is very peaceful.  Hurry is not the name of the game here; bring a friend that you really like and have some great conversation while you enjoy the easy going but very pleasant service.

You won't taste ice on your fish here and it's one of the few places I feel comfortable eating sushi in the desert.
