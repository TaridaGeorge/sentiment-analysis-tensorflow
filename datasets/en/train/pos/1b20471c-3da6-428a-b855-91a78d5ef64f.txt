Whatever it takes, if you are w/in a 10 hour drive, EAT HERE! Seriously. 

As a New Yorker who loves her thin crust pizza, I was elated; the crust was paper thin and crispy, the combinations we had made our mouths very happy - Margarita and the one with onions and fennel sausage. 

The kind of meal that makes you smile for the rest of the day and turn and say "mm, that was really good pizza."

We went at 2pm on a weekday and got seated right away - score :) 
Friendly staff and I also like the oil paintings.
