I love this restaurant! I ordered the Chicago gyro and salad combo for about $8.20. It comes with a drink. The gyro meat was flavorful and the pita bread was delicious. The gyro was huge! My Greek salad was good. I also ordered a side of spicy tazitki and it was delicious with gyro. This restaurant makes My Big Fat Greek restaurant looks bad!
