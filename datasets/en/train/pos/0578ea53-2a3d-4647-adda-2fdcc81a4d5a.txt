Love, love, love, love this place! Not only is the food terrific, but the entire staff makes it a fun and relaxing place to go for dinner. We have never had a bad meal or bad service. There are always lots of laughs during dinner because of the the ribbing we give the staff, and they give back to us.

Most important to mention- their monthly wine tasting is an event we refuse to miss. It's a 3 or 4 course meal, each course paired with a different wine. The food is always amazing (and never anything that is on the regular menu) and the wine is perfect. It is reservation-only event so make sure you get on their email list.
