Green is my absolute favorite place to eat on this earth! You can't go wrong with anything you order off the menu. It's all delicious, from the wonderful appetizers, to the amazing salads, to the entrees with mock meat. And don't leave without trying one of the scrumptious desserts. Everything is priced very reasonably and that staff is always smiling and helpful. I wish I could eat here every day! Whether you're a vegan, vegetarian, or meat-lover, try this place out. You will NOT be disappointed!
