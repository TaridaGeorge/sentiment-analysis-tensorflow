We just moved in down the street so I was super excited to see a Fresh & Easy just blocks from our new home.  I haven't had a F&E store near us in the past but I've heard how great it is - and cheap.  It certainly lives up to the hype.  I absolutely LOVE shopping here!  There's never a crowd, their prices are unbeatable, and the cashiers are friendly and helpful.  They even gave me an item for free tonight because it was ringing up at the wrong price.  I will be shopping here weekly.
