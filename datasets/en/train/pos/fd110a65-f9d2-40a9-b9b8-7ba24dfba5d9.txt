I prefer the hand washes over the machines that hold the dirt and grime and rub it in your paint. This car wash does an excellent job. They are always busy but they do a very good and thorough wash. Most times, when doing my final look-over things are almost perfect. The prices are reasonable but worth every penny over the coupon guys and the attendants are very professional and polite.
