I've never been to Liberty Market for dinner, though their dinner menu always looks amazing, but I have enjoyed many a breakfast/brunch/lunch there.  It is the type of restaurant where you place your order at a counter, find a place to sit, and then they bring your food to you.  They can get quite busy during peak meal times, but they are efficient at finding open tables for you, so you're never wandering around looking for a table after you've ordered.

They are locally-owned and use a lot of fresh, locally grown ingredients, so that gives me a warm fuzzy feeling when I eat there.  Pizzas, salads, and sandwiches are all delicious, but what deserves an extra special shout out is the dessert case.  The gigantic cinnamon roll is perfection.

Can't think of enough good things to say; just go check it out for yourself.
