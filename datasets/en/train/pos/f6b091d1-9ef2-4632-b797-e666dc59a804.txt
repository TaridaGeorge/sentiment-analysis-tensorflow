"Happy Feet P edicure" is what you want to get! Yes, it's $40 and worth every penny. Being on my feet all day in high heels and working as a waitress part time, I can appreciate a quality pedicure. It's not about pretty toe nails, it's about the hot rock massage, sea salt scrub, and don't forget the hot paraffin wax dip too! This was the most relaxing pedicure I have recieved all while sipping a pumpkin spice latte and watching the colorful Koi fish swim :-)
