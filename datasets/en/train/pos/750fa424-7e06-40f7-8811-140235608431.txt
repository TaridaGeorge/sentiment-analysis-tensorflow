Amazing little hole in the wall vegan restaurant!

Went on a Tuesday night with a friend and it was packed!  

The cashier was very friendly and helpful.  Their credit card machine wasn't working and she was very apologetic.  

Started off with the crab puffs and artichoke gratine.  So delicious!  Hard to believe this stuff is all vegan!?!  

For the main course, I had mum's meatball po-boy with thyme fries.  My friend ordered the singapore tofu.  Both were really good!  The singapore tofu tasted like thai food.  

For dessert, we both had a soynami.  They were huge!  And very good.  They're kinda like the Dairy Queen blizzard's but made with soy instead.

Green is also a great place to people watch.  So many different types of people came thru.  It was very interesting to see.

I definitely recommend Green.  Even if you're not vegetarian.
