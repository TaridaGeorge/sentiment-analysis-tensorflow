I can only speak for this Locations quality but I LOVE it here they have never disappointed me! 

They have delicious homemade soups each day something different. My favorite is the Tomato Bacon soup if you can be lucky enough to get there on a day they have it. 

They always have a lunch special and a dinner special to choose from, I Love that! 

Best chicken salad sandwich I've ever had, 
Best Fish and chips I've ever had juicy white fish crusted with panko crumbs NOT greasy AT ALL. 

Their Creme' Brulee is right up there with Fleming's or Ruth's Chris. 

Again I'll say this is one of my Favorite places to eat I know it is always consistently good fresh food! 

5 Stars for being Delicious Every time, I Love you Keegans Ahwatukee!
