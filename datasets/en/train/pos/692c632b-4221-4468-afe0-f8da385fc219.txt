if you haven't been, you must find the time to go as soon as you can. this is the coolest place! my husband and i went for the first time last year after living here for almost 9 years! what a shame...we really should have gone much sooner. since that first visit we've taken guests from out of town here almost every time. the architecture is beautiful and the artwork is breathtaking. it's such a nice way to spend a saturday morning. visiting this museum is definitely on the list as one of my favorite things to do.
