This was my first time hear, had no idea what to order, so I asked the waitress.  I went with all her recommendations and it couldn't have been better.  Started off with the "wedge" salad, which I have never been a fan of wedge salads, but I ate every last bit.  The bacon and blue cheese dressing were enough to make me want to like my plate clean.  Then had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico with 12-year aged Balsamic and the mac and cheese.

If you go you HAVE to have the Mac and Cheese with Lobster, it is to die for!  My boyfriend kept raving about it, and to be honest I didn't really believe him.  Not until I took that first bite, I was done for!  All the flavors just melt in your mount and bland into this amazing deliciousness, really it's that good.
