I went in today to pick up some shoe polish for two pairs of shoes.  The guy that helped me was very honest about what would and wouldn't work for me and the products they offered.  He also ended up telling me to wait or suggested two other shops that might have the colour I needed, rather than ruin the colour I wanted.  I definitely plan on waiting and bringing my business back here.

I definitely agree with Jessica that the younger guy that works here (seemingly every day) is amazing at his customer service.  He took the time to address each customer in the shop and offer advice for each situation.  He clearly knows his craft well and is proud about the services that the shop can offer.
