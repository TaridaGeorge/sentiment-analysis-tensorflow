Mmm..I LOVE me some In-N-Out! Yes, the menu is small, but the burgers are huge and the prices are a steal. I can walk out with a double-double cheeseburger, animal, protein style (don't judge, I'm pregnant!) for less than $3.50...and I won't even finish it. 

I'm stoked they changed their 'cash only' policy...as that was always a pain in the ass. They also use fresh ingredients, never frozen beef, and they cut their own fries. 

I don't eat fast food, and I would highly disagree that In-N-Out be classified as typical "fast food". Do you see Burger King or McD's using only the freshest ingredients and cooking everything to order?
