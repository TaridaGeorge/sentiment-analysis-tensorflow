I love this bookstore.  When i move i will be very sad to leave and not have one of these around.  They carry used books and new books.  You can trade or sell.  They have a very cute area for kids to read books and play.  Every week they have events and book groups that get together and family events on the weekends.  We have seen Clifford the Big Red Dog, and the Grinch.  Every Thursday they have story time for kids at 10am.  You can order books online and have them ready for you there.  i have no complaints about this bookstore.  They are also attached the Wildflower Bread Company which has awesome food.
