Such a pretty place with a friendly group of staff. A vacation isn't complete without a nice Mani and Pedi. I love how clean and elegant this place looks and how they take the time to make sure I walked out happy. My Mani and Pedi was clean and pretty and it lasted a while. The best part was the hot stone massage on my pedi how wonderful is that? I never had it done anywhere else and it comes with the pedi. I wish we had an Essence back in San Diego. Not only that it's convenient since it is located in the main shopping mall in town.
