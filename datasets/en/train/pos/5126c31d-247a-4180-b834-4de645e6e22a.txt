I would have given it 4 stars, but if I did and my wife read the review, she'd kill me.  (all right, 4 and half stars...).  Extremely elegant place.  The decor, the ambience, if you want to take someone out for an elegant romantic evening, this is the place.  Candlelight, an acoustic guitar playing in the background (spanish guitar).  They have a superb wine list, and the food is very good to excellent.
