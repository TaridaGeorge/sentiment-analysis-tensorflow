Beautiful library.  The kids area has great hands on, interactive space for children to explore.  They have a couple of nice sized quite/group rooms which I like to spread out in to get some studying done for school.  The space is quite, open, bright and clean.  The staff is very friendly. I am extremely impressed by this place.
