great selection, great customer service, nice people. 

I bought a pair of boots here that about halfway through a day of wearing them, I discovered they were not the same... right boot was kind of irregular. Even though they had been worn outside, they took them back no questions asked, and were very nice and helpful selecting another pair to replace them.
