How many times a week must I go here before I get a bad meal or bad service. Favorite meal is the kale salad with steak on top. Service is always good, great for kids. It's always crowded but the outside seating surprisingly isn't as hot as you'd think being 110 degrees outside. The prices aren't the cheapest but as I am a hungry man who eats a lot i always go home with a doggie bag. Also please take 3 chocolate chip cookies when you leave because I do and I feel bad, but they are so good. I'll probably be back in two days for lunch
