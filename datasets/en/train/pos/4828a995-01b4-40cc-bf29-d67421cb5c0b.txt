We went there last Sunday and had a great experience. The only mildly negative was the hosts didn't bring any kids menus to the table and we had to go up and ask for them. Other than that, I was really impressed with the server, he was informative, made great suggestions and was attentive. The food was well cooked and hot. The server did forget to ring in a side for me and instead of blaming the kitchen he went out of his way to admit his mistake so I appreciate his honesty. Needless to say, we will not hesitate to return!
