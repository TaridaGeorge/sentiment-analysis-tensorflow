As longtime fans of Binkley's, we've been to Cafe Bink twice now for lunch.  The service is pretty good although it is lacking compared to near spa-like atmosphere of Binkley's.  The food is excellent.  On our most recent outing here, I ordered the pasta bolognese and it was outstanding.  Who knew a meat sauce could shine like that?  And of course, the fries are required eating.  It's a fabulous alternative when my bank account shrinks in horror at another Binkley's reservation.  Wonderful job Kevin and Amy!
