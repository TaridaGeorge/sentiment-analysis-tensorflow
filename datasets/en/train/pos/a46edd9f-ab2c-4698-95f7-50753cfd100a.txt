Times like this, I wished I lived around in Arizona!

This place has everything! From fresh groceries, gift bags, to school supplies!

I was so shocked that they had fresh produce here, wish they have that back home in Oakland!

Potatoes, watermelons, tomatoes, lettuce, bird food, toberlone chocolate, tooth paste, etc! They've got it!!
