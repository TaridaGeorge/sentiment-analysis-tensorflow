A typical outing to the Veggie House with my girlfriend  looks like this:

-Start with hot tea and vegetable soup
-A small order of absolutely delicious spring rolls
-Two entrees...usually the House Special Chicken and Broccoli Chicken

Have you ever gone to a restaurant repeatedly and ordered the same thing every time?  Seriously, if I had the eat and drink the above for the rest of my life, I'd totally be cool with it.  This place is golden in my book.

One time, my friend ordered the House Special Dinosaur.  When the waiter gave a confused and funny look, my friend explained that since it isn't really meat anyway, it shouldn't matter what you call it.  Try it sometime.
