This burger place recently opened up in our neck-of-the-woods and we couldn't be anymore delighted. For us, it's our brunch-date, just us two while we are out running errands. 

My husband is a vegetarian so this may not seem like a place he should visit. Unless you know that they have grilled cheese on the "secret" menu. Oops, maybe I let our a little secret, but that sandwich is damn good! It's basically a burger (yup all the toppings) without the meat. We get ours with grilled onions....YUMMY!
