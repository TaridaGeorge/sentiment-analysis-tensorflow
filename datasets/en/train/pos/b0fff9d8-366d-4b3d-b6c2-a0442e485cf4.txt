We love RigaTony's! It's always clean and the staff is always very friendly. The inevitable 30 minute wait on a Friday or Saturday night is worth it.
Their fried zucchini is wonderful and we always get the RigaTony pasta, its delicious! Also their Apple Bread Pudding is OUT OF THIS WORLD and if they ever remove if from the menu again my husband vows to picket them. lol That is actually one of the reason's I'm giving them a 5 star. The fact that they listened to their customers who were begging for the Apple Bread Pudding to be put back on the menu shows they actually do care. As long as they keep the apple bread pudding (that my husband would lose a limb for) we'll keep coming back!
