When I want a fresh and juicy burger WHATABURGER is the place I go to !

I love the Bacon & Cheese Whataburger.  

Combo meal is only $6.88 after taxes and that includes your fries and drink.  This restaurant is always clean.  Employees friendly and nice and the best part ?  

Both the drive thru and dining room is open 24 hours !

Whataburger is old school I remember ordering their food at America West Arena ( Now U.S. Airways Center ) when I went to Suns games back in the early 90's.
