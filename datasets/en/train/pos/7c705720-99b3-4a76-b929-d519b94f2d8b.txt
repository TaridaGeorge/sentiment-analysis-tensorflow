I wish I would have remembered the Managers name that helped the associate. The issue of rolling over all minutes unused in an individual plan to a family plan was handled in under 20 minutes! The Manager offered a charger for my phone with a discount, for the time spent on my issue. Thank you ATT - You have acquired a Happy New Customer to a Family Data Plan. (left Sprint after 11 years)
