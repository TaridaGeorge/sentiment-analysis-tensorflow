One of the most scenic drives in the US, this twisting 80-mile loop contains a good 22 miles of dirt roads, so make sure your vehicle can handle it.  We took our rental Suv crossover and had an absolute blast.  My husband loves driving scenic twisting roads and I gladly let him take the wheel.  
The drive twists through canyons, mining towns, the superstition mountains, and along several beautiful man-made lakes. After you return to pavement, make sure to visit the Sinagua Indian dwelling at Tonto National Monument - it closes at 4pm so get there early to walk through a magnificent ancient cliff dwelling. 
Be sure to stop for food before you get onto the trail, because this will be an hours-long journey with little chance for food or gas.
