Honest and Trustworthy!!! Bought a Kirby from Kirby of Avondale a couple years ago,  never happy with it,  Brought it in for service here.  turns out I was sold a dud, pieced together parts from new and older models!!!!  Owner was honest with me and went to bat to make it right!!! Got me a brand new Kirby!!! Earned my business for life...Highly recommended!!!
