The food is always excellent and the atmosphere and waitstaff are wonderful as well.   I love having a drink at the outdoor bar next door while I wait for my table at Fate.  The food is always really fresh and unlike anywhere in Phoenix! They always take reservations and I love how they serve food late--one of only a few places in the area!
