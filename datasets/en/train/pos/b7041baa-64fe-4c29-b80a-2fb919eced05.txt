Since my first review, I've probably gone to Thai Hut maybe 20 times or so. I was on a real kick for a while there, going once or twice a week, and the shine still has not worn off. I love this place even more.

Their food even made a convert of my girlfriend. She had tried Thai food once and hated it. After dining at Thai Hut, she now suggests we go there, and often.

Since my first visit, I have also dined at Chanpen and Erawan, and they don't hold a candle to Thai Hut. It's still my favorite by miles.

Dammit. Now I'm craving their Pad Kee Mao again!
