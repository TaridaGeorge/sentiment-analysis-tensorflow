Oh Green, why did it take me so long to try you?
I came here with a very picky vegan friend and we both left very satisfied. We had the hot wings, peanut tofu and the curry bowl with tofu and brown rice. Everthing was Yum! Everything was so tasty I didn't even reach for the siracha, and I do believe that is the best compliment I can give, because I LOVE siracha! I also had the lavender soda which was a great change of pace from other sodas out there. Green my only request is: Please come to CenPho!!!!
