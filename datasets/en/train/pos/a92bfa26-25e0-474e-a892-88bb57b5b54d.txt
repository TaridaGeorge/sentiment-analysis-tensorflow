Well I don't have time to read all the comments, I can understand how this place can be hit or miss though.  For me it was a hit.  I recommend the Hotty Haimachi...and the fatty tuna nigri (market price for us was $19 for the 2 pieces) Cevichi Haimachi was excellent as well.  We sat outside, super nice.  Be prepared to wait for a table and once you sit the service is slow but if you know that going in it's fine....really nice wait staff.  Def try it! Enjoy.
