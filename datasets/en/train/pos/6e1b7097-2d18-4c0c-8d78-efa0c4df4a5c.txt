Kiltlifter: Remains my favorite (and most hangover-inducing) beer.

Waitstaff: Remains the most attractive in the Valley.

Food: Remains the best of any brewery I've visited, although Santan is closing the gap.

I just wish the place hadn't blown up the way it has; you used to be able to just walk in and sit down anywhere you could find a table. Now there's a hostess, a waiting list, those vibrating coaster things, etc. Maybe they'll add a second level. I'm sure the apartment dwellers across the street would love that.
