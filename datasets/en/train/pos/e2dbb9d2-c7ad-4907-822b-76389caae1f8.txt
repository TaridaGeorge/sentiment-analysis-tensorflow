I can't say enough about this bakery, everything is so delicious!  The bread is fresh, soft and light as a cloud in your mouth.  I only wish we had a bakery like this in San Diego.  Each time I go to Phoenix I visit the bakery daily.  The chocolate horns are to die for, the lightly sweet soft horn really blends well with the not overly sweet chocolate filling.  

I bring several loaves of bread home with me every visit.  I can't get enough.  If your ever in the area you HAVE to visit this place.
