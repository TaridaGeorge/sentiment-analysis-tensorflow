Easily the best record store in town. Forget ZIA, they are overpriced and cannot possibly top Hoodlum's customer service.

Hoodlum's has a killer selection of CD's and vinyl for the music nerds around town, and if they don't have what you want, you can special order it. They'll usually have the order within a few days, so it's a winning deal. 

The guys in there are knowledgeable and as friendly as you could possibly ask for. Steve, in particular, is one of the neatest people I've ever met. I've even gotten numerous great music suggestions from these guys.

For the most part, they'll have plenty of classic rock, jazz, pop, and lots of newer "indie" or "mindie" tunes.  The selection is enormous! The prices are amazingly cheap too. Regular sales keep me coming back.

Look nowhere else for the record store experience.

Keep it up, Hoods, you are amazing.
