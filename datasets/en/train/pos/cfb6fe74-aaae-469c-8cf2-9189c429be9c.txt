it's literally PARADISE. I'm obsessed with it. If i ever move to arizona, the only reason would be to be closer to paradise bakery. I go to arizona once or twice a year to visit family who live in Scottsdale and honestly all i really care about is coming here to get my banana chocolate chip muffin. I'm obsessed with muffins, and finally i found the perfect muffin on the planet.
All of the other ones are great as well, and so are all of the breads and sandwiches. Actually, basically everything is delicious. And it's a gorgeous looking bakery. man, i hope i'm going to Arizona soon.
