This place is a lot of fun. You grab a large bowl fit for as much yogurt and toppings that you want. Then you proceed to self serve yourself what you pick for yogurt and toppings. The combinations are endless. You pay by having your bowl weighed. I really enjoyed this yummy, original yogurt shop. They have THE BEST toppings around. My favorites were snowcaps, raspberry chocolate bits, Captian Crunch, Nutella topping, Ghiradelli caramel topping, and putting a oatmeal cream pie cookie on the side. I rate this 5 stars because its my new favorite desert spot.
