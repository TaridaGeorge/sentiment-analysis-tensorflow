The food, the service, the ambiance - impeccable!  Our party had the 4 course tasting and it was fabulous.  I'm not a huge on sushi because of the typical AYCE stuff-yourself fast food type of establishments but this was more my speed - sushi for people who really love food and chefs who love what they do.    Treat yourself! ;-)
