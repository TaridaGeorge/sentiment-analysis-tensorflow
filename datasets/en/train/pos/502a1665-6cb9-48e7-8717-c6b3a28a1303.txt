Simply put, it's the best independent coffee shop in the Valley. The atmosphere, especially on the outside patio is like stepping into another part of the country. They have flowers, upon flowers, upon flowers!  It's wonderful getting to sip coffee in what feels like your own private rose garden, while falling back into comfy patio furniture. All of this while looking out onto the organic farm in Agritopia. It definitely doesn't feel like Arizona. 

I absolutely love how they've decorated the place. It's 50's retro mixed with modern design, all with a bit of country charm.

The espresso drinks are excellent and their baked goods are to die for! The staff is always friendly and helpful. One thing I really enjoy is the gigantic wooden table that seats 8. It's nice to sprawl out when studying, reading the paper, or just when you have a large group with you.
