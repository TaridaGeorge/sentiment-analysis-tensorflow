Jason came out twice now and both times it was same day!  Wow, great service always on time and has great recommendations.  I had to have him out because we needed to service our garages since sometimes it would not close and then I had him out a few weeks later since my daughter decided to ram the rail of one of my garage doors (yeah, I was pissed).  Anyway, Jason programmed one of my remotes that was giving me trouble and changed the code on my keypad since I hate doing that stuff.  He calls when he is on his way and he gave me a time window that he honors every time.  He is also valley wide so dont worry if you think he does not service your area....he does.
