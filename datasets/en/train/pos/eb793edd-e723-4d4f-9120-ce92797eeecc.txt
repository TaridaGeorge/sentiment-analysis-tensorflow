I'm a fan.  I set up an appointment for installation of some Pirelli tires to replace some BF Goodrich tires that were driving me nuts as they were showing cupping wear.  I set up the appointment for 10 am.  They greeted me fairly quickly and before I knew it they were done at 1040am and I was on my way.  I'm totally thrilled with the service, I got the replacement certificates and was driving on the road and there was little roar and they handle great.  Discount seemed to be a bit more expensive but they have won me over.
