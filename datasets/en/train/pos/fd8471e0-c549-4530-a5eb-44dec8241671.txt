This is a favorite whenever I come to Arizona to visit my family.  The view is fantastic and the food even better.  The waitstaff and is always friendly and helpful and puts up with my dad's antics (aka really bad jokes)  On my last visit I had the ahi tuna rolls and practically the whole bread basket by myself.  I also had the rioja wine.  Everything was delicious!  The weather cooperated and we were able to enjoy outside dining in the relaxed atmosphere and watch the wildlife on the golf course and the mountains in the background.  I can't recommend Tonto Bar and Grill enough.
