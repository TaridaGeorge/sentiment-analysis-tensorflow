I got take out- pulled brisket and chicken, plus some buns on the side to make sandwiches at home.  Driving home, the smell almost drove me wild!  And the sandwiches!  Full of flavor, without too much fat, and no gristle in the beef.  I can't eat highly spicy food, but the mild sauce is very mild indeed- I may get some mild and some hot next time to add just a snitch of heat.  I highly recommend this place when you want something really tasty, but you don't feel like doing the fancy at a restaurant.
