I have been a patient at Kimel Chiropractic for 6 years and can't say enough about the care I have received.  I have had several surgeries and procedures for various female and stomach problems, all of which were never conclusive or able to be fixed without heavy medication.  After starting my care at Kimel Chiropractic I live a completely different life, which is not dependent on medication and actually feeling healthy!  I am no longer burdened with constant pain or problems!  I recommend Kimel Chiropractic for your entire family, my husband, and 2 year old and I couldn't be happier or feel better!
