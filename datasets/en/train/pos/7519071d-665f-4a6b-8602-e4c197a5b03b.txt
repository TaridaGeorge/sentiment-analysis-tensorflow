I cannot believe I haven't written a review for reach 11 yet. This is my absolute favorite place to run in the valley! There are tons of trails that are hard packed dirt which is a great surface to run on. It's very easy to maneuver around the loops and their are mile markers and maps every so often if you feel lost. I've have ran so many training miles and have even raced on the trails here before. This is truly a runners heaven!!
