My wife and I came here before heading out for dinner reservations.  We had a great appetizer plate with cheeses, grilled bread, preserved fruit, and other really good things.  We also had some local (Arizona and New Mexico) wines that were quite good.  The service, however, was the best--  Everyone was very attentive, but not too obtrusive, and very friendly.  I'll go back for dinner when in town again.
