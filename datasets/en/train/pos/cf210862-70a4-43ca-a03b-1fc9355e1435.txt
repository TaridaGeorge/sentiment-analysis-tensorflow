Maybe not a stellar example of a railroad museum, as a place to take the kids as well as out of town guests, McCormick Railroad park can't be beat. The biggest draw is the 5/12 gauge railroad that takes you around, over, and through the park grounds, even through a tunnel! There is also a vintage carousel, a desert arboretum and a cute western-themed playground. And here's the kicker -- rides are only $1!
