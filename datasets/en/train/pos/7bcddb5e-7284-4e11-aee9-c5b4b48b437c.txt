The pizza is great. You should order Nicky's favorite. The 12st and Glendale locate has 1/2 price pitchers on Thursdays. Don't miss out on great pizza and great service. 

It is all about the food not location.  So this place gets 5 stars.   

Only downsize is the place is small and gets full up quickly. So go early to get a table. They just need to build a bigger place for the great pizza.
