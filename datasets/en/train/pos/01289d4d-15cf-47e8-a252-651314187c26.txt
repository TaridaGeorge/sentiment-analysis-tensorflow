I am only rating this against other hole-in-the-wall chinese places and this is about as good as it gets! Not much by way of ambiance and the day I went there they didnt have a/c (dont know if it is all the time or it was just out?) but the food was delish/cheap/ and close to my work! You just cant beat a $4.75 lunch special! MMMMMM
