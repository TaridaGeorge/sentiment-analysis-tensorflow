This place rocks.  Super friendly.  Not just fake friendly; really.  I am sitting here in the lobby working and one of the hotel staff came up and offered me cookies.   The place is clean; the meals are nice; it feels safe;  nice business center to print and fax documents; good fitness center and cut-rate daily passes to LA Fitness next door; very convenient; good laundry machines.   Even our kitty cat likes it.  Being out of your house because it is flooded and needs repair is no fun, but this places has made life much better.
