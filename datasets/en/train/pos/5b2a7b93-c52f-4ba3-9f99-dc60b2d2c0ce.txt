Truly one of the more beautiful areas of Phoenix. Gorgeous homes and tree lined streets, this casual stroll around the Biltmore makes you feel like you are somewhere outside of Phoenix. Always a great bike ride or walk to Hava Java thru the Loop. 

P.S. watch for errant golf balls. There are some bad golfers out on that course.
