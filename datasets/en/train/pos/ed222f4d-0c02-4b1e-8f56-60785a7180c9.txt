I love this festival; there is a great sense of community here. So many local businesses (restaurants, artists, retailers) in one spot with tons of information and free (or insanely cheap) samples. I was so happy to check out businesses I had heard of but haven't yet visited, especially now that I can return with coupons. Tons to eat and drink, live music, kid's activities, and a really friendly vibe.
