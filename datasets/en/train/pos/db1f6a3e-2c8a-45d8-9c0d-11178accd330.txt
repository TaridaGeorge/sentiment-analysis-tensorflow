I'm usually a Lowe's shopper, because they're closest & I have often found the customer service at various Home Depots around the Valley to be to be weak when I shopped there.  Today though, I wanted to compare a couple of items that I was shopping for, & I stopped into this one.

I was very impressed by the friendliness & professionalism of all three associates that I dealt with, & they had an equivalent to my $99 Lowe's item here, marked down to $49!  Wow!  (Prices are comparable to Lowe's overall.)

I was very impressed by this Home Depot!     :-))
