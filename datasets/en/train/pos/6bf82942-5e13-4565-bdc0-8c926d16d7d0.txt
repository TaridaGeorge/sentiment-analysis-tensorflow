This has got to be the best barber shop I've ever been to in my 38 years on this planet.  I was always getting terrible haircuts at places like Great Clips and Hair Cuttery (when I lived in Virginia Beach), and I just assumed it was because I naturally had jacked-up hair.  After getting my first haircut from Israel (the barber, not the country), I know I'd have a hard time looking elsewhere.  I don't know if these dudes were ever in the military, but their attention to detail is top notch.
