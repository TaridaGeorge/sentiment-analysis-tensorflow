25th Street Automotive is what Yelp is all about. This is a local business that gives great service at reasonable prices and are completely trustworthy.

They will NOT try to overcharge you and they will always tell you what needs to be done now and what can wait so they are very conscious of your budget. I have been through about three mechanics who have told me things like my hoses and belts had never been replaced (on my 12 year old Explorer) or found other "problems" that needed immediate repair. Not these guys they will give it to you straight and will not be dishonest.

They complete the work in a timely manner and offer rides from and back to their shop within a certain radius. I found them on Yelp and I am thrilled to advise everyone on here to support this business.
