I was not pleased when I had to go to urgent care on my weekend spring training getaway.  I was even less pleased that it was 9pm on a Saturday night.  But I am SO SO SO grateful that this place is open until midnight!  It wasn't busy either.  I was in there, and out by 10pm.  Dr. Barry Summer was great, with perfect bedside manner.  If you need medical attention on a weekend after hours, go here!
