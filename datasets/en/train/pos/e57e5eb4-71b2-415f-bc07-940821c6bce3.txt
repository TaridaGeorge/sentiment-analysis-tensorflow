Damn you Jebus!!!
By The Rue

While out to lunch at Mac's,
I went in to Hoodlum's like I do,
I heard something jacked,
It was very startling news.

The iconic record shop is closing it's doors,
After 14 years in business,
I was shocked, surprised and floored,
I think I might need a Guiness.

Where will I go to get my records,
When Steve and Kristian have left,
Pre-listen to various chords,
Turn it up until I'm deaf.

Go buy some stuff and help these guys out,
Every thing is 25 percent off,
Score a few CD's and go home and pout,
Even if you choose The Hoff.

I'm going to miss my favorite shop,
Eating at Mac's will never be the same,
This doesn't mean my collection must stop,
But going to another shop is just lame.
