Great group of people, especially Bill!! The crew at this dealership are very much no-pressure salespeople (which I truly appreciate). My fiancé and I went in to look at a Vespa for me to ride, and Bill was very attentive to my questions, and willing to give advice and help teach me how to use the kick stand... did I mention that Bill spoke to ME the whole time we were there? (unlike other dealerships, who mostly spoke to my fiancé, despite his insistence that the vehicle is for me, so it was all up to my decisions)

In a nutshell, we experienced a very laid-back, positive buying experience where the quality of the vehicles they sell speak more than anything the sales staff could say.
