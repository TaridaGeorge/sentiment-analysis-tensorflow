I have been dining at Wally's for the past several years. 

Wally's has great food and drink served by super friendly people in a family friendly enviroment.  The prices are also very reasonable.  

Wally's is the Best  casual dining experience in the Valley.  

You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu but for lunch I recommend the smoked turkey sandwich or fish and chips.  For those of you that like burgers, the Wally burger is great.    For dinner the chicken parmesan is outstanding.  I also really like their chicken marcello.

Wally just also opened a second location in Scottsdale.  

If your lucky, you may even run into Wally.
