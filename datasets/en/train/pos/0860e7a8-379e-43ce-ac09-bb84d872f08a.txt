Almost every single time we go, we have a great experience at My Big Fat Greek restaurant. Our latest trip (this past Saturday), was no exception.

Food was awesome, service was good and the overall experience was great.

Vegetarian recommendations: Greek Fries, Pizza Salad (so damn good), Vegetarian Moussaka, lemon potatoes & lemon rice.
