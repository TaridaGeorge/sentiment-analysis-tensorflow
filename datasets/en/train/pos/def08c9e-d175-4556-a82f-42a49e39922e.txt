A very addictive place to have ice cream. The "Toffee Banofi" is better than any thing I have eaten in Arizona. I sampled the Bleau Cheese ice cream & thought I found heaven. I also purchased some "Bacon Brittle".The bacon is something that needs to tried out & stored in packages for disaster prepareness. Forget about the essentials, You need the Bcaon Brittle.
