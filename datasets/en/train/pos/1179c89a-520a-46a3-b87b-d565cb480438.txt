i have so many friends that love lush but had never tried them. went to the store and was greeted immediately and not at all pressured. i got exactly what i needed+ a sample of their hydratingg shampoo bar since i had mentioned that my hair was dry. i abolutely love their stuff- i've been using it for almost a week and can already see the difference!!
