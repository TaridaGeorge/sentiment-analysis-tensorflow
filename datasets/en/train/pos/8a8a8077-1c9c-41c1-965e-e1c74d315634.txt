This place has the most amazing service I've experienced in Arizona.  My 4 year old niece accompanied my sister and I and they bent over backwards to make sure she was happy with her lunch.  They offered lots of things for her to try.
We ate at the buffet and tried everything, very very good. 
And the mango lassies are excellent. 

GO GO GO!
