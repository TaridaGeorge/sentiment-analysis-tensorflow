We just went to D'lish with a friend on a lazy Sunday morning.

I had an egg, cheese, and chicken sausage bialy sandwich.  It had great flavor, and the eggs were cooked perfectly!  I never drink coffee, but I tried my fiancee's coffee and was very impressed.

The service was great and friendly, and everything came out quick.
