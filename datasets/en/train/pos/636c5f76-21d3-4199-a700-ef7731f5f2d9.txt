Growing up in Phoenix, I have always eyed Long Wong's while in the family car.  

"Is it Chinese food?"

No.

My friend had taken me there yesterday for lunch.  She had claimed these are the best wings ever and I was a bit skeptical.  I mean, what can be better than Buffalo Wild Wings?

I had ordered the Honey-Hot and my friend got Medium.  Upon first bite, it was pure bliss!  The wings were deep-fried perfectly and the sauce had me burning up with a sweet after-taste.

This is by far the best place for wings!  If only they'd kick out annoying high school brats...  XD!
