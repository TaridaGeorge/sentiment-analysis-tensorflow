Though hard to find, this is one of my favorite Thai joints in the area.

The service is excellent and very friendly.  The food is reasonably priced if not cheap for the area.  Being so inexpensive, I was expecting little, but we got a lot, both in quantity and in taste.  They also have free delivery in the area!

It's a bit of a hole in a corner, but so good!
