I took another trip to Boulder Canyon the other day, and this time the creek was flowing.  It certainly added a whole new element to the trek, and made it somewhat more difficult.  There is one point in the canyon narrows where it is impossible to avoid wading through thigh-deep water without climbing over a 30-foot vertical rock wall (not recommended--just enjoy the water!).  It took almost an extra hour, although this time I had some other people with me, and did a fair amount of waiting.

If you don't mind getting a little wet, go after it rains (not while it rains; flash floods could be a concern).
