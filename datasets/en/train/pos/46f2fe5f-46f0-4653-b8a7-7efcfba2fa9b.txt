It's hard to get away from everything when you live in a big megalopolis like Phoenix.  For a brief time, the canals can give you a break from our busy streets.

I like to bike on the canals and as it gets warmer I'll start to go at night and get the ever so slightest cooling effect from the water.

Get a map (from online or bike shops) and you'll find out that they more prevalent than you may have thought.   Go for a ride!
