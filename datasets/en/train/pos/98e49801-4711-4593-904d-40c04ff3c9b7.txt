I loved my time at Roka Akor.  The service was great, the food was just about perfect and the dining room is beautiful.  I've got nothing but good things to say.  If you are in Scottsdale and love Japanese food, you shouldn't miss this.  DONT go to places like Ra or Stingray.  You'll be disappointed (unless you're 20).  This might be a little bit more expensive, but it's worth it.
