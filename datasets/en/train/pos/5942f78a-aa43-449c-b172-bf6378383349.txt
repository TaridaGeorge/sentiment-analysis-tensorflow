Open for lunch!
My first time here I want with a group of girls from the office.
Upon walking in the place is super cozy and welcoming. The owner greeted us right away. He began telling us about the restaurant and gave us great suggestions about what to order. 
We had two pizzas and a sandwich to share. The steak sandwich was ridiculously good! The pizzas were just the right size for one person and the crust was awesome. The homemade olives are so good as well! They even have unique sodas in glass bottles.
I am loving this place and the price for lunch is great too!
