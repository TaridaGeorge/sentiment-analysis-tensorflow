I've been to Amsterdam several times and each time I go it gets better and better. I really enjoy the space, it is divided into an outdoor area, a nicer lounge area and a small dance floor in the back. The dance floor is big enough to accommodate the crowds but small enough to feel intimate. My past few nights out I was the designated driver so I can't really vouch for the drinks. The music is always upbeat and fun, pretty heavy on the rap to get maximum booty shaking.  It seems they are sporatic about cover charge, I went on a Saturday w/ no cover and was then charged $5 on a busier Friday night, probably b/c First Friday was that weekend.
