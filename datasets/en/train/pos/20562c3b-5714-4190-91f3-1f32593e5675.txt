I'm starting a new job next week, so I'll be going to school full-time and working two part-time jobs while trying to raise a toddler.  I'm a bit stressed out over this despite finding an awesome gig.  As I went down to pick up some paperwork this afternoon, I realized there is an additional blessing to the situation:  I'm now less than ten minutes away from the Fry Bread House five days a week.

Score! A regular supply of amazing-and-affordable green chili Indian tacos for me.

After a delicious, lovely fry bread dinner, you probably won't want a delicious, lovely fry bread dessert.  Make a separate trip and be sure to soak it in honey.
