Don't take your luxury vehicle anyplace else for brakes! I was quoted over $500 for front brakes on my Lexus and Gab's did them for $175 (using genuine Lexus pads since it's still warrantied). He does great work, has been in business a long time, and pricing is very fair.
I only wished I had found him sooner!!
