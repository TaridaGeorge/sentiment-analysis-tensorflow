Very particular about where I get my nails done and how I want them done. LOVED Scottsdale nails! Great service!! I got an amazing pedicure- unlike other places they really put time and effort into their work. Two days after I left one of my fingernails broke as I was assembling something. I went back to get it fixed and got taken in right away. They remembered me and were suuuuper nice. I did not get charged for getting my nail fixed. I highly recommend Scottsdale Nails. Nice place, nice people, very clean, huge selection of polish! Do call for appointment because they do get busy.
