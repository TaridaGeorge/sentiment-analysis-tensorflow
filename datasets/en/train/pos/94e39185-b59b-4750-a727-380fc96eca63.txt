These days flying is really not as exciting as it used to be and I consider myself very 'no frills' .Some recent trips have left me to really appreciate Southwest Airlines even MORE!!:
 - bags fly free
 - frequent connecting flights
 - everyone - staff and passengers seemed pretty happy - is it just me that noticed this?
 - pretty good on the ontime arrival and departure
 - where I never used to judge the munchies - they were notable
 - did I mention they were VERY COMPETITIVELY PRICED??!!!
