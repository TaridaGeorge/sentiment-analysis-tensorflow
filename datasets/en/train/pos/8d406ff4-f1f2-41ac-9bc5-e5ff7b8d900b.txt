Joe's has long been one of our favorite restaurants in Gilbert.  The pulled pork is excellent, the sides are even better, and the service is always friendly.

Don't be intimidated by a long line, even out the door, as it moves fast.  The cheesy potatoes and corn are great.  The lemon cake is very moist and a nice finish to a meal.

Be sure to stop by on your birthday and pick up a free meal.

The kids love running around outside in the grassy area, and always enjoy going to Joe's.
