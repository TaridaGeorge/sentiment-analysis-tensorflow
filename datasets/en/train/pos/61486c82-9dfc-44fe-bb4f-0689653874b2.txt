This is a great local boutique with a vast array of interesting items. I always find a great gift here. I particularly love the in house line of body care which you can add your own scent too. They have a huge amount of fragrance and essential oils. They also sell several different candle lines and many different body care lines. There is also a section with products for "lovers."

The location is great. Bonus--it's locally owned and operated and has been around since 1969. It should be a Tempe institution. 

I love the variety of products they sell. You never know what you will find, but surely you will find something for most woman and even many men.
