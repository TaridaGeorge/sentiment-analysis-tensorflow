I decided to try this place out based on good reviews. I was not disappointed.  I have been there twice and would definitely go back.  Green is located on Scottsdale Road and tucked away in a small strip mall.  It's not fancy but the food is terrific.  I had a spicy salad, and my daughter had a parmesan sandwich.  Both were excellent.  I love the green tea.  I will of course return for my third and hopefully more visits. Wish they had a place in Chandler or other locations.  It's the best!
