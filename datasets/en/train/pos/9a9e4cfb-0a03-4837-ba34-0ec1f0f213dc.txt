Happy to see that a vegan restaurant has finally come to my neighborhood. My sister and I were immediately greeted by a member of the courteous and helpful staff who offered us a complimentary mushroom soup. There are several things to choose from and finally decided to start with the spring rolls and each ordered the be-veg lunch(which included asparagus, tofu,and white rice), mumbai spirit to drink and carrot cake for dessert.  All were fresh and delicious and the menu prices are very reasonable. I will soon be returning to try more!
