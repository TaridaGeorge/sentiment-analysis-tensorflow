Simply fabulous.  

Showed up on a Monday night (of all times) and this place was hopping.  As in packed.  As in - the only seats were outside.  

I was pleasantly surprised with attentive wait staff, inexpensive prices, and absolutely amazing food.  

Had the hummus, the Falafel Pita, and some Baklava.  I highly recommend it all.

You definitely have a new fan.
