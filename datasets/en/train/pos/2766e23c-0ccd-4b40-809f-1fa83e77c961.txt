Wow, I can't believe the poor reviews others have given this place. I have been eating here nearly all my life and I maintain that it is the best place for Americanized Chinese food in the valley. The food is consistenly good and they don't skimp on the proteins or veggies. I challenge you to find a better eggroll (amazing and huge!) ot fried shrimp. Their Chow Mein and egg drop soup are the best I have ever had. To top it off the have an awesome tiki drink menu- the flaming scorpion bowl and the zombie  rock my world but just be careful because they are stronger than they taste!
