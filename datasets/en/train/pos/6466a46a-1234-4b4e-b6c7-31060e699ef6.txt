Ahhh, how I thought I would be disappointed reading reviews before going to Biancos, but I was anything but disappointed. The reviews suggested that some select people did not think it was special. Those people are wrong. I had a perfect lunch the wise guy pizza was, as billy crystal world say "marvelous". My glass of reisling was delightful. The seats at the bar left my bum hurting a bit, but no pain no gain. I will definitely return.
