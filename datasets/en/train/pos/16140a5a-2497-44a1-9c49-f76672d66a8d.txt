One of my favorites where I know I will always love my meal- breakfast all-day or lunch! I work nearby so I also pick up the yummy, yummy spring berry salad with tuna or delicious pine crusted chicken.  My favorites are a build your own omelette with a huge variety of options, French toast, turkey rueben with sweet potato fries and the above mentioned berry salad with pine crusted chicken.

The servers sometimes have what I will call an "i'm Hip, Scottsdale attitude" but they are generally very efficient and attentive (kind of like if you are in NYC). 

I love the new expanded space and the large counter service.
