My favorite pizza in Phoenix! After moving here, I was on a search for good pizza. Having lived in New York City for many years, I was used to high pizza standards. This definitely was a clear winner. I also love walking around La Grande Orange grocery while waiting for a table to see what fun new stuff they got in!
