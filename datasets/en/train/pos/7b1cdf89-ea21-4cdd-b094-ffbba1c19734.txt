Lavender ice cream really?  It's amazingly refreshing one of my favorites.  Horchata, Huckleberry or Madagascar Vanilla if you will.  This place only uses the freshest ingredients many purchased from the Farmers Market right here in Scottsdale.  Great ingredients produce great ice cream and this place has the best I've tasted.  They where recognized by USA Today as one of the top 50 Ice Cream Parlors in the nation for good reason.  They always have a new amazing flavor or two in the rotation in case you've already tried the others.  Highly Recommended.  Try the turtle sunday - extra nuts and whipped cream.  Awesome.
