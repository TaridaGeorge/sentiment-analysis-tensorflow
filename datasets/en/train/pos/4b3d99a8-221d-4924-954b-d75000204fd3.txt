Here is a real review of this place.  We were visiting family over Thanksgiving who live WAY out in Goodyear and walked down to the bagel shop for breakfast one day.  The bagels are GREAT!  They have very nice looking pastries (my son had a donut but I didn't get to try it because he ate it so fast).  I had their stock coffee which was very good coupled with flavored creamer.  The wait staff was very helpful.  They also have some great looking ice cream!  The place is cramp inside but the tables outside were very roomy.  I would definitely visit again next time we come into town.
