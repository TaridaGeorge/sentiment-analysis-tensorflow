I was so thrilled when I found out my Galaxy SII could be revived after it was submerged in water. The last time this happened to me I just went and bought a new phone thinking that was my only option. I will ALWAYS take my phone here first if I have any problems! Very reasonably priced, quick service, and super friendly! Thank you Dr. Cellular!!
