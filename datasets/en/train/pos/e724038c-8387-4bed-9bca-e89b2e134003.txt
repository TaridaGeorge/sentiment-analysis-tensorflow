THE BEST SUSHI PLACE EVER.  This place is by far the best I've had, and I've been everywhere.  They have the freshest food because they order it from the same supplier who delivers to the best sushi bars in LA.  Their rolls are unique and just plain awesome.  You'll love the food, trust me.

The atmosphere is great too.  Its ultra modern and slick.  Very cool.  They even have special Dyson hand blowers in the bathroom.  They are building a lounge on the second floor so be on the lookout for that too.  As far as sushi chef's go, ask for Huan (Yawn) and he'll take care of you.
