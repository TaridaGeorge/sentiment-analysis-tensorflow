I love me some Macy's. 
This particular Macy's is one level, which seems to make it easier to shop in my opinion. The store is new, nicely laid out, big selection of cute clothing, shoes, make-up, perfume, what else do you need? how about a Starbucks, yeah they have one of those too.
I used my 20 percent coupon on some cool shoes and I saved tons of dinero. Go check out this beautiful Macy's in the Santan Village.
