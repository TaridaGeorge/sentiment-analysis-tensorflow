Not only is this the best Flo's location, it's the best Chinese restaurant I've found in the city. In fact, it's the best Chinese restaurant I've found outside of San Francisco. The BEST hot and sour soup - the perfect balance of the spicy and sour elements. Everything is extremely fresh and they use high quality ingredients. The service is prompt and friendly, too, so Flo's is a great overall experience.
