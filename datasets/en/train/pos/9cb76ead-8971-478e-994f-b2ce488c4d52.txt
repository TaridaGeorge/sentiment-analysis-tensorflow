My husband and I have been parking here ever since 2007. We love the promptness and ease of accessibility. Their rates are exceptional and the coupon provides and even better rate. I ran into a situation where my husband was unable to get on his return flight for a couple days and I didn't want the car sitting in the lot for those additional days. I didn't have a ticket stub (in husbands brief case) and Carlos (the manager) was really helpful by allowing me to use my husbands itinerary as a date of arrival within their parking lot. He was more than accommodating and such a pleasure. I will always use Preflight Parking, as they treated me like family and I am so grateful!
