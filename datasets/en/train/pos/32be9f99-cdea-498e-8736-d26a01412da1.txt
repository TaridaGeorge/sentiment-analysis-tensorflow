Rock on Slippery Pig.  I  bought bike for my daughter and within a week  she got a flat.  She was crushed.  It was on a Saturday and I had heard about the Slippery Pig so I took  the bike up there.  The store was busy, but when he  saw my daughter, he  told me don't worry they would  get the flat fixed.  I returned that afternoon and when I walked in, the first thing he  said was  "are you the one that wanted your daughter's  flat fixed?"  I said yes, and he brought  the bike up front, flat fixed.  Could not have been  nicer, and  repair  was very reasonable.  These guys are great!
