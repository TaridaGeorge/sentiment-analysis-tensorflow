Great food- specialty pizzas & 48 draft beers! Did I mention their happy hour deals??  Half off drinks and munchies from 3-6 and reverse happy hour drinks from 10-2 Mon-Fri! The staff is friendly and the restaurant has a laid back feel. Ask for Kevin if you want great service. Each pizza is made to order on a stone and hand tossed, so prepare for a wait depending on how busy the place is- or start with a salad. I love the Dude's Chicken Salad and the Mellow Chopped salad with pepperoni!
