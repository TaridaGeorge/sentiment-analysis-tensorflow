In a word-AMAZING! Started with a hearts of romaine salad and the salad dressing was to die for! I think I could have licked the plate! For my main course, I tried the gnocchi - those light little pillows reminded me of the ones I had in Italy so many years ago! Awesome job! Service was great! I never had to ask for a water refill, my plates removed in a timely fashion and the check was delivered without asking!
