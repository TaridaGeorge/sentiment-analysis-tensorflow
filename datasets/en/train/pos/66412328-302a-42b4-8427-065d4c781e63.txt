LOVE this place!!  I had tried Ling & Louie's when it first opened a few years ago and thought it was ok.  I gave it another try recently and have been back 3 times in 2 weeks!!!!  The Ahi sliders are to die for.  The service is EXCELLENT.  Paul the bartender is a GEM!  Hardworking, personable and clearly takes pride in his job.  His customer service is top notch!  I will continue to be a loyal customer!
