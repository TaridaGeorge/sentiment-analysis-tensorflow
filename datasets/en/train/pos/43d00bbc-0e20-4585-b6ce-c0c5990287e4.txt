What a great find!  We made plans with friends to stay over the 4th and spend the day by the pool.  We chose this place because it was dog friendly which i thought was so cool.  I am going to work on my dogs manners so I can take her to places like this.  Michael and I arrived early so we had lunch at Taggia along with a couple of their chambord margarita's before heading off to the pool.  btw try one of those margaritas... so good.  The pool was nice... they had a full service bar and grill, the staff was so friendly and accommodating.  The rooms were very nice and the beds were so comfortable.  We really enjoyed our 4th of July and will definitely keep this place in mind for the future.
