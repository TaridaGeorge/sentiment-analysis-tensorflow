I love this place, I really do. Every time I visit my bf from Flagstaff we have to go there. I love the gyro combo but here is a tip I have learned - order your gyro with a side of feta for 75 cents and it will rock your world. I also order an extra side of tzatziki sauce ( had to google how to spell that, whew) and a side of their HOT SAUCE. Get it, its amazing and hot and goes perfectly with the tzatziki sauce and fries. I am counting the days until I am back in Phoenix so I can go there.
