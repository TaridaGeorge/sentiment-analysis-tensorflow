WOW!  The teas are so good.  It beats all the teas that I have tried before.  I was a big fan of The Republic of Tea, I think I have 1 or 2 containers of every different types of tea (green, white, red, etc).  After tasting the samples and getting the White Ayurvedic Chai and Samurai Chi Mate, I am hooked on Teavana.  Thanks, M.  It is your fault!
