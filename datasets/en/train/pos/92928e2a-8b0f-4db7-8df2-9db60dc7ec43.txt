I consider myself a total fro-yo connoisseur- I have tried every self-serve yogurt place in town!  And Yogurt Builderz is my absolute favorite!!  Biggest reason- their Only 8 Flavors- ONLY 8 CALORIES PER OUNCE!  You can not beat that- and get this- they are phenomenal tasting!!!  It's like magic, I'm telling you! ALL their flavors are just wonderful!  Plus fantastic toppings- everything from brownies, to nuts, to fruit, to candy bars, to sauces.  AND one of the cheaper places per ounce in Scottsdale (not the cheapest, but on the cheaper side for sure). This place has it all!  And a friendly staff, adorable interior, nice atmosphere.  Only problem- I always want to go back for seconds because it's so delicious!  Of course at only 8 cals an ounce, I can afford to- LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Did I already say that though?
