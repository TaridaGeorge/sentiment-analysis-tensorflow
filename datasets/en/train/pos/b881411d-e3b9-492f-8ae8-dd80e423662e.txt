Delicious!  The first time I had it, I didn't love it...the second time I tried their food turned me around.  Really...really good and the owner has such a great demeanor about him.  Two dollar Tuesday...great deal! 
 Cheery, friendly and they give military discounts.  

You have to love any company that supports the military!!!!
