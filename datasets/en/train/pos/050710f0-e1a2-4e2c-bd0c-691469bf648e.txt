4.5-5 stars

Quaint cafe with a very homey feel. The service was good and the food was very fresh. It doesn't seem like you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Definitely a great place to grab a bite and chat with your girlfriends or an afternoon date spot with your significant other.

1) Signature Strawberry Chicken Salad (with Grilled Chicken, Vine-Ripened Strawberries, Mixed Baby Greens, Toasted Almonds and Poppyseed Vinaigrette)
2) Mediterranean Melt (with Roasted Seasonal Vegetables, Smoked Mozzarella Cheese and Basil Pesto on Warm Ciabatta) with a side of potato salad.

The service was decent, the food was amazing. I wouldn't mind going back again!
