Extremely helpful. I first went there when Book Master did an into the night fast move with many dollars of my credit.  Denice is wonderful and makes you feel right at home. Sometimes customer suggest new authors that makes this place the perfect companion to the big box stores.   
She has ordered in book club publisher type copies to keep the costs down for groups.

Don't pass up this gem.
