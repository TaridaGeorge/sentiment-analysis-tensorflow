I was in town and curious to check out a new gym.  I was alone so I could only use the bouldering walls but I got a look at the place.  The staff was very friendly and the bouldering had a great range of challenging courses.  I didn't see any serious physical equipment for lifting weights or cardio or anything (like you might find at some gyms), and they weren't really selling any food or drinks, so it's pretty much for pure rock climbing, but they had some awesome looking walls and I was really bummed I didn't have anyone to belay for me.  Anyhow, cool gym.
