5 star fast food! Wow!

Hubby and I were in town for the Fiesta Bowl and needed to grab a little lunch before heading to the game. I checked yelp for close burger places and thought this one sounded good. Oh yes. It was. 

Not only were are burgers juicy and tasty, the cheese curds and the mashed potatoes and gravy (oh how I loved the gravy!) were also really good! And the service? Exceptional! I know I'm jaded because I live in the land of mediocre service, but this must have been the best, kindest service I've received in who knows how long. Even if the food was just ok, (and if I lived in AZ) I would come back just to say hi. These girls deserve a raise!
