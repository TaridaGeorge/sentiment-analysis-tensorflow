Cozy place. Friendly staff. French chef cooking Italian food. My favorite the hand made pizza but also all kind of  well executed appetizers: goat cheese peppadew, mussels white wine with creme sauce, bruschettas. You can order the specials, they're always a safe and surprising choice. Interesting wine selection. You also taste south of France and spanish influences. Overall great food for the money, I greatly recommend.
