Fantastic menu that can be consumed any time of the day! Personal favorites include their mac&cheese, pork chops, and mussels! They always have a ton of Stella readily available and on tap, as well as Bass and Newcastle and duh..Guinness.

Their fish&chips are delisch as well (although I am always a bit skeptical of eating seafood in the desert)...! 

i like!
