Excellent selection of designer jeans. No i'm serious. They had a great variety of Rock & Republics!! 
Oh man, and they had sooo much Miss Sixty clothing. 
I wish I could afford it all. IThat, and there's not a plethora of skinny Asian girls in Scottsdale. I wouldn't have had to fight for clothes in my own size!!! DAMMIT.

I would've walked out with that entire store..
