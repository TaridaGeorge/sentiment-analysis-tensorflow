My wife and I have been looking for a good quality, no MSG using, old fashioned Chinese food restaurant in the Scottsdale area for quite some time. Finally it seems we have found it.  We have eaten here quite a few times and while it is not the fanciest restaurant they do simple Chinese food really well. The owner is almost always there and extremely friendly and the food is tasty.

I have found the Lo Mien and the Mongolian Beef to be outstanding. The garlic chicken and Moo Shu shrimp are favorites as well.

They do deliver but I have almost always found it faster to go in and pick it up.  So, If you are looking for some simple yet very tasty Chinese food, I highly recommend this place. It is nice to have them in the neighborhood.
