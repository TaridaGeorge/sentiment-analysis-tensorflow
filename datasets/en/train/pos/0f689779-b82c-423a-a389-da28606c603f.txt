I've ordered from Rome's several times.
At first I was very skeptical because the place looked a bit run down and didn't seem very busy. We thought we'd give it a shot and now i'm a big fan. 

We usually get the baked ziti and spinach and artichoke pizza and they're just phenomenal. 

We're trying out spinach ravioli and eggplant parmagiana pasta and the lady who took the order actually let us know of the pasta special of the day which ended up being the eggplant parmagiana so our order ended up being $2 cheaper.

Restaurants usually don't let people know of specials if the customers don't mention anything but it was so honest and nice of her to let us know.

Big fan :)
