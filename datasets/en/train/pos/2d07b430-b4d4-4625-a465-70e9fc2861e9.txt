Ok, I'll admit this isn't the place I'll stock the wine cabinet at because their prices aren't competitive for the most part...  The customer service that I received there was well worth the price though.  I visited somewhat randomly and ended up talking with an employee... Ended up with all the ingredients for red sangria and a recipe that the employee wrote out for me on paper...  If you're indecisive or wanting to try something new, come here and ask the staff for ideas.. They're great!!
