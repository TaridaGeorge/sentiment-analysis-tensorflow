On our way to Tucson we stopped here to meet a friend for dinner.  I loved this place! The dishes all have a morroccan flavor with surprisingly tasty results. Even the french fries had a dusting of cumin and chili and were incredibly delicious. I had the Fez salad which was a combination of baby greens, sliced almonds, dried cherries (not 100 percent sure, could have been another dried fruit), moroccan flavorings, seasoned chicken, and a mild dressing.  Another diner in our group had a Gyro sandwich with garlic fries.
I wanted to try the Lamb sliders but just wasnt hungry enough.
They have a good selection of beers and wines and had beers on tap for $3. Great mixed drink menu, too!
Prices were reasonable, and they are open late!
Fantastic experience!
