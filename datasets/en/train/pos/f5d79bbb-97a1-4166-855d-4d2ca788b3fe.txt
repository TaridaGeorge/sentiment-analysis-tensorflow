Had a terrific time at Kazimierz tonight, on recommendation from our waiter at Cowboy Ciao (think owned by same company).  

Kaz is just a very grown-up place. Very friendly service.  Super-different bottled beer (we had beers from Poland, Russian, and Montana).  Fantastic jazz/funk/motown band on 11/18.  Just a really fun time.

I would go back for sure next time I'm in town and would enthusiastically recommend Kazimierz to anyone in the downtown Scottsdale area.  Nothing to complain about--at all.
