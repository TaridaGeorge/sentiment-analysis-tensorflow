Warning, this restaurant is way out in the boonies.  That being said, it was ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  I had a business meeting here and it was much more than expected.  Great food, good wine, great service and the ambiance was amazing.  My group really enjoyed the outdoor dining on their amazing patio.
