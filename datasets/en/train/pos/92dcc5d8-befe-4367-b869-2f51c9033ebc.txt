Brought in a used MB I had just purchased to have them check it out. Bud's service sold me not only on his shop, but on MB in general. While I've taken my C230 to the local MB dealer for service once (mainly for some warranty fixes), I can't say I'd make a habit of it when I can take it to MB Motors instead. It's a great feeling to have a mechanic you trust with such major investment. Bud is reasonably priced, knows his stuff, and has a fine appreciation for the brand. I'd give these guys ten stars if Yelp let me.
