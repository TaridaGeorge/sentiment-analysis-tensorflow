This is my favorite of all of the self-serve yogurt places that have popped up over the past few years, mostly because they have a lot more flavors than others I've been to, at least a dozen. These include no sugar added and plain. The toppings are numerous and range from healthy, to breakfast cereals, to "I'm going to regret this later." There are also different sized containers, but even the smallest is at least 16oz. I always see people in there going way overboard with the largest of the containers, but who in America knows what a normal portion is anymore these days? Being able to pour and mix the flavors and add in the toppings myself is a huge plus, and makes each visit unique.
