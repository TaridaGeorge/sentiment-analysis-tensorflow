Went here again yesterday and was blown away again by the service and the food. The managers that work here are very professional, friendly, and know how to run a restaurant. Friendly bartenders and waiters/waitresses also. Even though the place is packed and everyone is so busy, they look like they're having fun and still take time to make customers feel special. :)
