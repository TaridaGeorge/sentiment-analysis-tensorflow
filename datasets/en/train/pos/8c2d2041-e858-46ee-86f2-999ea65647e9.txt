Always a great rotating variety of draft beer, delicious food and friendly staff. Coolers with a HUGE selection of bottled beer to drink in the bar or to take home. Specialty bottled beer drank in the bar can be slight expensive and at times I would even call over-priced. If you dig milk stouts, Elsie's is absolutely the best one I/you will ever have; it's simply perfect. Great place to hang out, grab a meal and a few brews!
