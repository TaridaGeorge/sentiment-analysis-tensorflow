Want a great sandwich? Try this place. I love it! Their sandwiches are fresh and they offer a ton of toppings to put on them. You will not get board with their selection of "Picnic" sandwiches. I love their turkey with raspberry jam. I will keep coming back. They are one of the few cafes that offer dofino cheese. Call ahead or order for delivery for lunch. The cafe can get very crowded, but the food is worth the wait if you can get a table.
