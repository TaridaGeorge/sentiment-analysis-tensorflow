I've been going to Uni Hair and Nail Salon regularly for over two years now.  All of the nail technicians are efficient, friendly, and really good at what they do. They treat you AMAZING here. This place is super clean. I've always been very pleased with my mani and pedi. The price is also  very reasonable. I have brought many friends along for the experience -- all have great things to say as well !!
