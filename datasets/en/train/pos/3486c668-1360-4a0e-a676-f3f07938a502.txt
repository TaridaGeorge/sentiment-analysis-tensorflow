I love Robert's Catering!  Robert is catering an event for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society in September and has gone out of his way to make sure the menu is just right for our budget.  He even threw in his FAMOUS cakes!  Robert really looks out for his community and there is a reason he is known around town for his incredible food!  Thanks, Robert!
