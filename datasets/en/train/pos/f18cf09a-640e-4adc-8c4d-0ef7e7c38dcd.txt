I was lucky (and grateful) to have some native Arizonan's for friends when I lived in the Phoenix Metro area. It is through these people that I was introduced to Sakana.
If you are like I was, you might be carrying an unfair bias toward seafood prepared so far away from the sea.
Sakana is WONDERFUL and very reasonably priced!
Get the Baked Scallops sushi. It is DELICIOUS!
The Mango Saketini's are very very good.
The age-dashi tofu is yummy.

This location of Sakana is especially good to party in. It really gets rollicking and is a little bit loud. If you are in the mood for a more elegant subdued experience, I suggest the other location of Sakana in Scottsdale. This place is a party and you might have to yell to your date.
