Just went there tonight because i had a groupon for it. It was great! Very filling yet in a good non-greasy non-nasty way. I decided to go the vegetarian route and had the  "seven amigos." very flavorful. My husband had the " gringo star" and he enjoyed his as well. I also agree with others that the pasta salad is very good. It is a very small amount of the salad, but somehow it seemed perfect. The icing on the cake is that they have "mexican" coke ;) very small place but very enjoyable and homey. Ill definitely go back!
