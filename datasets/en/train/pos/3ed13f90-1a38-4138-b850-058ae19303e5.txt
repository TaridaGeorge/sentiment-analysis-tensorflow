Oh gosh.  SO GOOD.  I've never gotten something here that wasn't delicious.  If it were legal for me to marry the Original G buffalo wing po-boy, I probably would. Their Green Burger approximates the taste of a fast food burger, something I haven't had in probably 15 years, in a way I never thought possible.  The tsoynamis are the perfect treat for a hot day.

And EVERYTHING is vegan.  EVERYTHING.  It's so lovely to be able to walk into a restaurant and order anything on the menu instead of scanning it for the 2 or 3 things you can actually eat.

Come here, and bring your friends.  Tell everyone you know.
