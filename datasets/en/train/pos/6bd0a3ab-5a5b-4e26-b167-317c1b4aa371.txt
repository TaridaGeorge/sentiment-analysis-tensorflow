I have been here a couple of times already and have had two great breakfasts.  The wait staff is pleasant and upbeat.  We were seated right away and able to order in a matter of minutes.The food arrives fresh from the kitchen and reasonable portions.  

The restaurant has been fully updated from its previous incarnations.  The price of the food is reasonable and the coffee is delicious.

Visit!
