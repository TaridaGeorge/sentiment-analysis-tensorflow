The fiancee and I spent a long weekend in the Phoenix area and found this place on Yelp.  One of our goals while in AZ was to sample as much of the local cuisine as we could, but we ended up going to Orange Table twice we were that impressed the first time.

Great, fresh items.  Some unique spins on classic items.  Excellent coffee, great service and a wonderful trendy vibe (without all the pretention).

The outside patio area which is dog friendly (though sadly our dog did not make the cross-country trip but it was great to see locals out with their pups).

Highly recommended.  Next time we get back to the Pheonix area we will be back.
