Just went last night...Great! We sat at the sushi bar where you can watch the guys slicin' n' dicin'. I ordered the Udon noodles and chicken. SO good. Just the right amount of spice, but not too hot that it takes away from the flavor. Everyone was very nice and helpful... we got the lady up front to help us get a cab.
