FOOD IS AWESOME!
It is actually a small snackshop-like place in a grocery store.

PROS:
  - Food is tasty, authentic
  - Prices are good
  - Lots of options
  - Fast and hot
  - Ordering is simplistic, filled out in a piece of paper

CONS:
  - Small, seating is limited
  - Owners (old guy and his son) at the counter are always chewing tobacco and moody
  - The use and throw cutlery is a bit cheapo, but hygienic
