Went today on a cold and rainy afternoon. I could've stayed much longer just hanging out people watching! Tried the commuter with bacon and pulled pork bbq sandwich. Commuter was awesome as always.. Bacon was nice and crispy! Had to have that with a Havana latte! The BBQ sandwich was just ok, nothing special IMO. Will have to get a pizza next time and hang out longer! Parking and finding a table wasnt too bad today. Maybe cuz of the weather..
