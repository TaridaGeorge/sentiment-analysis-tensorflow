I needed to send something and I needed it to get there in a timely manner.  I also needed a copy of something.  This store is located next to Bashas on one side and Starbucks on the other.  I walked in and recieved a friendly greeting.  I told the young man what I needed and I was out the door in about 10 mins.  You can make copies, ship packages, rent a p.o. box, and send mail all from this location.  And the staff is friendly and helpful.  That's five stars in my book!
