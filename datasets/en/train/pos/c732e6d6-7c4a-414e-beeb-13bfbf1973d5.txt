Dr. Grant is patient and gentle. He truly likes your dog. This Vet does not price gouge or run needless tests and such. They are fair and honest.  Exam is through and he explains everything in a simplified manner. Don't be discouraged when you see the place. It is a modest small building that doesn't impress. But as a business man myself I understand the financial weight of needless overhead these days. Just go in and get excellent service at a very fair price.
