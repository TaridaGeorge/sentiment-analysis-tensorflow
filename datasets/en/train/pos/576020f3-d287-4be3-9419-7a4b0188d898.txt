This pizza has to be one of the best in the valley. I ordered a 5 topping 18" for about $25, well worth it. My brother just had his wisdom teeth pulled two days ago and has been eating oatmeal and pudding for these past two days. I holla lets do some NYPD for lunch! my brother jumps up with this smile on his face, so we head out. Fresh ingredients, good service, well worth it.
