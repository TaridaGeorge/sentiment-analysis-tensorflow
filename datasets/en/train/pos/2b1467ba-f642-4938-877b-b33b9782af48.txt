Im not really a foodie, Id rather buy a pair of jeans or a cute top then splurge on a really expensive dinner...except if the dinner is at Petite Mason. One of my girlfriends does the owners hair so she loves going in there, awhile back she invited me to go with her, ever since then we all try to get together and go to their Sunday brunch or to dinner at least once a month. 
I can honestly say its my absolute favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. I love it. We are going again tonight and I can not wait. If you are looking for somewhere to have a glass of wine and a cheese plate, Mimosas and brunch on a Sunday or an extravagant dinner, Petite Mason is just the spot. Their food is amazing and the staff is inviting and charming. Id recommend Petite for any occasion!
