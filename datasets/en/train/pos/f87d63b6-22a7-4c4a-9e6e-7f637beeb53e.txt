This place was great!!! Went there last night and had a great experience. We showed up at 9pm and there was plenty of seating inside and outside on the adorable patio with lights strung up and music playing. Our server was fantastic, and he recommended the black bean fritter appetizer which was to DIE for. I would go back again just for those, with the avocado dip, they were amazing. We also had the gazpacho soup, which was good, nothing amazing but there's not a whole lot you can do with gazpacho. Also had a chicken entree that had fried plantains and beans and rice that was quite good but too big to finish. Great wine and Brazilian beer too. All in all, a great experience and we will definitely come back soon!
