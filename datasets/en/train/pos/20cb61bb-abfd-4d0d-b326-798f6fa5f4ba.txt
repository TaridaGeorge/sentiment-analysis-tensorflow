My three year old has been going here for little over 9 months now. The transformation I have seen in her confidence can definitely be attributed to the teaching in her combo class! She comes home and shows me what she learned, is constantly wanting to practice and "teach" us as well. The staff there is friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable. The prices are reasonable and the added dance shop is nice to have next door as well - highly recommended!
