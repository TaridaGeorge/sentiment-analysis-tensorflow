This place is fantastic.  The Tonkastu ramen is our favorite.  It is very tasty.  After leaving San Francisco, we missed having ramen.  We were very happy when we found this place.  The decor is very nice.  The staff is awesome - somehow they hire some of the nicest and helpful people out there.  The snow boba is great too.
