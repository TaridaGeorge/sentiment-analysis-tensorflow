Worth every penny. I discovered this business by chance, and I'm glad I did. I enjoy a difficult haircut, and I had grown accustomed to sub par results. My experience is with the employee Adrian Romaine, and I recommend his service to anyone in need of superior performance. You'll pay more for the service, but the overall value can't be beat!
