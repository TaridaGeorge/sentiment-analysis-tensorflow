As usual, we had a FABULOUS experience here!  We brought some "newbies" to Saigon kitchen and they had nothing but wonderful things to say!  My friends had the pho, shaken beef, and the short ribs, and I had my usual beef salad.  Super yummy!!!!  The staff is very friendly and always available if needed.  I remarked to one of my friends that they kept filling her glass while she was taking her last sip! 
As always, I had the vietnamese iced coffee, which is a MUST!  So delicious!
