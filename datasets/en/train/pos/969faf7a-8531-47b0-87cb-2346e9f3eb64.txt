The German Sausage company is the closest thing we have to a big city charcuterie in Phoenix.  Our family has been enjoying their homemade ham, lyoner, bratwurst and smoked meats for 30 years.  Their prices are so much more reasonable than the grocery store deli counters and their products are always very fresh.  Walking through the door will immediately transport you to Europe!  Don't miss this Valley gem  - cash or check only just like the olden days!
