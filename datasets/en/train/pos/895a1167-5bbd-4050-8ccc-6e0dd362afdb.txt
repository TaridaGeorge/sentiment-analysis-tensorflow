We actually LOVE this place! I find it much better than Texas Roadhouse. The food is great, the service wonderful and the amount of time it takes to get seated is beyond amazing! Prices are good and I can actually have a conversation and hear what the other person is saying...unlike Texas Roadhouse. It is a good place! We will continue to come back.....
