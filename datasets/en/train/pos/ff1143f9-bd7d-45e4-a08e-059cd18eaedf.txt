Wow!  Who knew a little Italian restaurant at 40th St and Thunderbird in a strip mall would be this good.  Not just good...phenom!  It's mostly northern Italian food.  The portions are the perfect size, which allows you to try an app, meal and dessert.  We started out with the eggplant app.  My hubby doesn't like eggplant but gobbled this up!  The sauces are a little on the sweet side but still excellent.  The wine selection was good and the service was good.  I love that they serve the house wine by the glass, 1/2 carafe or full carafe.  The house wine was actually quite good.  Definitely need to check this place out. We will be back for sure.
