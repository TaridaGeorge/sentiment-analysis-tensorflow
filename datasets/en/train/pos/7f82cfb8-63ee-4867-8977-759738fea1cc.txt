This Greek restaurant is a great place to eat.

We were in Scottsdale for weekend trip and contrary to some other reviewers - we found both the food and service top notch and professional.

Greek fries are incredible.  Bruschetta was very good.  Ice Tea was actually brewed and served in swimming pool size glasses.

Too much food - very good value and we took chicken wrap home - was just as good next day.

So if you are sick of eating in chain restaurants, this place is for you.
I wish they would entertain opening in Dallas, TX.
