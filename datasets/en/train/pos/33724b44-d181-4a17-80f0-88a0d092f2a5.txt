This is my first (liberally given) 5-star rating. 
A clean, organized, stocked store. 
The crew will help you choose any style they have capacity to brew, and if they are out of a pre-made kit, they will assemble it in a hurry. Sure, you can mill your own grains but having Jacob do it while I wait is satisfactory, in the sense that I know they are willing to help without hesitation. *unlike service i have gotten from the 'other' place.

they have a little basket of toys so the kids are kept occupied while i shop. a nice touch, and if you have toddlers you'll "get it". 

this store is worthy of a visit, even if you live in Tempe. a gem, i'll be returning here time and again.
