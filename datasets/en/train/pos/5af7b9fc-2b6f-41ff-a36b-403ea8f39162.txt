This is an absolutely charming theater. Beautiful architecture, acoustics are amazing and the seats are extremely comfortable. We had the fortune of seeing Legend of Zelda. We had seats 17 rows back but I think you would be hard pressed to find a bad seat. Their customer service is wonderful, they were able to fix a ticket sanfu easily without any hassle. I will certainly keep a lookout on the Orpheums schedule and come back.
