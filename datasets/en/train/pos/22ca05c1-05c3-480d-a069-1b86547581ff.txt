I love Mama Java's. They have free WiFi, every Sunday night they have a Bluegrass jam session and their coffee drinks, chais and teas are excellent. 

But, what makes me adore them is what I experienced during one visit. The night before, I had put my debit card, cash and ID in my pocket to go to a show, and forgot to transfer them back to my wallet.  I didn't realize this until I had placed and received my order. The woman behind the counter said "don't worry about it, you win some and you lose some" and then the woman behind me offered to pay for my drink. I dug into my wallet and gave them all of the change I had, which probably amounted to 32 cents. You gotta love a place where everyone is invested in making sure you get your caffeine fix.
