Based on Yelp reviews, I decided on Piestewa Peak as my first hike in Arizona and absolutely loved it!  I was looking for cardio with a beautiful view and that is exactly what I got!

I went solo on Easter Sunday and was pleased that quite a few fellow hikers joined me on my mission to take on the Summitt.  In my experience I found parking to be a breeze.  The people were all friendly and the people watching was hilarious.  

Be sure to bring plenty of water since it really is a trek and if you can fit it, bring your camera-it is worth the extra effort!
