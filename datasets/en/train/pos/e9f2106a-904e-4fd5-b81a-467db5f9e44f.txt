Still the greatest pizza out here in the West!  My wife and I got a small garden salad, and our usual.....a large pepperoni and garlic pizza.  She had a glass of their new Sangria and I had a Pepsi.  Total after tip was about $45.00.  Well worth it in my opinion.  Simply the best pizza you can get outside of NY...and even then, this will give any pizza joint in NY a run for its money.
