D'lish would be a perfect start to any type of day, whether it's action-filled days of snowboarding, inaction-filled days of laying by a pool and reading... or even, for the approx 90% of working-aged Americans who are sauntering, driving, running, biking, whatnot off to work. 

My New Year's Eve day was perfectly (obsessively) planned, and I wanted to make the most of it. So it was with slight trepidation that I decided on D'lish to start out my day. And... it was perfect!

Perfectly hot/warm burritos filled with perfectly fluffy eggs and potatoes and savory meat to fill me perfectly full, at a price point that did not mar the perfection.

5 yums up!
