I found them on yelp. Ryan called me back right way. He is friendly and professional on the phone. After determining that maybe I should call a plumber and buy a new dryer, he did not even charge me for the time he spent. That is above what I expected. I will be using them in the future.

Called them in a couple of weeks for water heater replacement. Ryan was again responsive and fair on the price.
