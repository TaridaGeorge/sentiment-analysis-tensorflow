This was one of my first restaurants i went to in phoenix and it was a treat!! The crispy vietnamese rolls with the mint and lettuce and sauce...yum yum yum...and the pla is amazing...its crispy fish with this sweet sauce...of course the pad thai is fabulous and the tom kai gai soup (spelling ????)  Is a great starter for the table...also the evil jungle princess and all curry dishes are phenomenal...its nice b/c its on main street in old town scottsdale and you czn take a nice walk around before and after dinner or lunch...try the mango and sticky rice when it is in season...my sister thinks this is the best part of the meal...hehe...its a nice date place and more upscale...the staff is very nice and just a nice environment...
