Right now this is my favorite comics shop. I don't like mainstream comics very much and they have a good selection of indie stuff. They also have a lot of of graphic novels (which I prefer over single issues) and a lot of artist sketchbooks. The staff has always been friendly, helpful, and easy to chat with.
