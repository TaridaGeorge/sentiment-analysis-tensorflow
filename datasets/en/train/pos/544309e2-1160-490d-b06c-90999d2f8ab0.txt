Went here with my mom on Christmas Eve, and I really liked my experience here.  Resturant was clean and well decorated, and this was my first experience with PF Changs.  

We had made a reservation for the two of us, but showed up early.  I really liked how they validated our parking out at the garage for a whole 2.5 hours!  Yay!  I ordered the sweet and sour chicken, and egg drop soup.  Tasty!  

Service here was excellent.  I loved our server, who was friendly, marvelous, and educated on the menu.  

I would go here again in a heartbeat.  loved it!  I do think this place is a little overrated in some senses, as  some kind of local Phoenix hotspot, but for what its worth, I did enjoy my time here.
