This is the best Indian food I know of.  I order takeout from this place about twice a month, and have been for like 3 years.  I almost always order very near closing, and they are always happy to take the order.  

I know it's kind of dickish to place an order late, but I can't help being annoyed when I call at 9:30 to a place that closes at 10:00 and the "kitchen is closed".  That's not how these guys roll.  

Consistently great food and great service.
