The service here is always great.  My husband and I prefer to sit at the bar and don't have any complaints.  Get the pizza, with anything on it, you're bound to be a happy camper.  I also recommend the anitpasta- yum :)

What I don't recommend is arriving between 4 pm-5pm as they are stocking the oven and there's no pizza magic happening then.

Food = awesomely amazing.
Service= awesomely amazing.

We had Nikki last night, and she's great.
