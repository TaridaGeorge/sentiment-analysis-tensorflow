Wow! This place looks great inside, but the food is just do good! I had lunch here and ordered a Gyro Picado Pita which had strips of gyro, grilled green peppers, onions, and jalapenos with a side of Greek soup. The soup itself is wonderful and I could just have their soup alone. The gyro is yummy!!! You've got to come a little early to beat the lunch crowd.
