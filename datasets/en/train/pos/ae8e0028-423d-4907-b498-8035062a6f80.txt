WOW.  LOVE this place!  Sexy, relaxed, causal but elegant - this is Phoenix dining at its best!  And Sushi!!!  And great Sushi - it's true!  And check out the Hawaiian Ribeye steak - fabulous.  And don't forget the strawberry shortbread - still thinking about it.  Staff is friendly, and know their food and wines - not stuffy, just right.  Do yourself a favor and dine there NOW.
