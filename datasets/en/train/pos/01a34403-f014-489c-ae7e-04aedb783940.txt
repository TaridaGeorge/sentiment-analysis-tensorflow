Love the low lighting, the decor, the ambiance, the people, the staff, the location, and best of all, the food.

Was not hungry when I got here so just ordered a couple of starters, the fingerling potatoes and the mushrooms, and damn! A massive pile of wonderfully tasty spuds is piled up in front of me. I demolish them and the mushrooms. Couldn't help myself.

It was a Friday night and restaurant was busy so we decided to take a seat at the bar. Good move. Comfortable, access to extremely friendly staff, and plenty of people watching. Oh, and the prices were modest too.

Fantastic gem! Check it out!
