This may be one of the best cheap bars in Phoenix. The first time I went I fell in love...and then I went back. The second time I went was on a steamy  Sunday with my best friend. What I didn't learn the first time I went is that they will let you you grill your own food (outside), they have a smoking patio, and they frequently serve free food.

Really, what is better than a bar that has a decent beer selection, lets you watch live hockey, AND lets you grill your own steak freeof charge?
