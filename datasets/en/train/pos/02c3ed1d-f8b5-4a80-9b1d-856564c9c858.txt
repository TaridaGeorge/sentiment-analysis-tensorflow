I just left and ordered a turkey club on a bagel. Really good! I let her make it her way and enjoyed it even with spicy mustard. This thing was huge! I went thinking the bagel would be small, but it was more than I could handle. . They use only boars head, so you know it was a quality sandwich. When in AZ, will definitely pay them a visit!
