Although I'm happy to have tried Cibo, and am thrilled Phx has more diverse pizzas than it did years back, Pizzeria Bianco still takes the cake (or the pie). Don't get me wrong, both places have cute quaint interiors, delicious food and an atmosphere perfect for a romantic evening. Its just that Pizzeria Bianco has tastier pizza- I'm not sure if it's herbs, the cheese, the sauce, or all of the above. I love seeing the wood fire pizzas come out of the oven while I very patiently wait for mine.  And I hope you're ok with waiting, because you certainly will- for a table as well as for your pizza. Yes, even with reservations you will be waiting. Just get outside and discover the lovely historic homes & shops. It's worth it, I promise you.
