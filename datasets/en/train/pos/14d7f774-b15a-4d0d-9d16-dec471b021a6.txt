One of the best places in town for hearty cooking.  There is little on the menu that I have not liked.  The portions are perfect sized and it never disappoints.  We eat here at least once a month or so. 
On rare occasions we have had a less than stellar meal, but even then it is above average.  
For breakfast... it is awesome.
