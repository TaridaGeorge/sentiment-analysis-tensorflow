We had our entire house (walls, ceiling, trim, garage, etc etc) painted by AAA Painters and couldn't be happier. The outcome was totally amazing. The quality of the work was impeccable. David was easy to reach, always on time, took extra care to touch up the small details even we had overlooked, and completed the project on time. He even picked out and installed new door stoppers that matched our hinges to protect the new paint job. Also, there was no mess left behind, just the leftover cans of paint if we ever need to touch up a scuff. The $ bid was extremely competitive. Couldn't recommend highly enough... happy painting!
