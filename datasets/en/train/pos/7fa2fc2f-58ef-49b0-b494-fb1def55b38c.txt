I am a small business and want to support local small business, so I was impressed to find The Sign Jungle on  Craigslist.com that looked so professional and also in Mesa.  I called them earlier in the week to come out and give me a price and design idea on our monument sign that was getting a face lift.  Jeremy came out right away, had helpful ideas and I was thrilled with the price he quoted!  

How's this for speedy delivery, he had my order installed before I left work today!  Thanks so much to Jeremy, I will definitely be calling you for business cards and t-shirt in the next month.
Thanks again for your awesome customer service!
