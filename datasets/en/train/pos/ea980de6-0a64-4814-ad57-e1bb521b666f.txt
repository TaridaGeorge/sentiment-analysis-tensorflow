What a great little family owned joint!  Everyone is so friendly here, and this is one of those ran places that the family runs the place, and knows the majority of the patrons by name.  I love right here in the neighborhood, and can't believe it's taken me this long o discover this gem.  If you're ever in the old town area, it's worth the trek over here to casella's to grab a sandwich.  I recommend the hot Italian beef which was outstanding!

I will no longer be going to Subway and encourage you to do the same.  Let's keep the dollars local, and hit up Casella's where the sandwiches are easily twice as good!
