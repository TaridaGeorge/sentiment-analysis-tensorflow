I was lucky enough to get two tickets to the opening night of Giselle. What a beautiful performance. The scenery was beautiful, the dancers were great, the story was easy to follow for those of us who don't have training, overall it was amazing. This production made me want to go to the ballet again and again! Very professional and very entertaining.
