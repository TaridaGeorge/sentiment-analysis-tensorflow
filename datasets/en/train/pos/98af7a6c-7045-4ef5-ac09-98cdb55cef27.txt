I have been to Sprinkles many times as I live less than 10 minutes away and I have never been disappointed. The cupcakes are fresh and delicious every time. I can't wait to find out which seasonal will be there as they have some great choices (ex. salty caramel; key lime; smore ) to name a few. The service is also really exceptional at Sprinkles- the employees are friendly and knowledgable about their products. I have even ordered them for my cousin who lives in Irvine, CA. from the store in Newport Beach and they deliver! I Love Sprinkles!!
