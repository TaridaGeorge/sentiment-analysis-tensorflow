If you don't hear about this place you'd probably never stop here. The food is great, I especially love the Gyros Feta Salad. It's truly a hole in the wall, not fancy, but don't let appearances fool you! This place has won rave reviews from The Arizona Republic and New Times. If you're looking for some of the best mediterranean food this is THE place to go.
