The instructors are very knowledgeable.

The children learn not only to defend themselves, but to be respectful.

They teach more than karate, they teach self confidence, and respect.

This is a place you need to at least try out, you owe that to your children.

As a proud father, I can not think of a better place for my sons to learn respect and Confidence.
