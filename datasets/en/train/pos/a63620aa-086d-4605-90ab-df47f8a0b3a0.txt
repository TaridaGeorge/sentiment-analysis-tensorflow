I've loved nearly every zoo I've been to in my life (which is basically limited to the Oregon Zoo in Portland and Zoo Boise), but the Phoenix Zoo is easily the most kid-friendly. We really enjoy it here. If you've got a kid over one year old, I strongly suggest getting a membership. It'll keep you busy in spring and autumn.
