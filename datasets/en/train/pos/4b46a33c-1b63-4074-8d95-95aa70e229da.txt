Don't know what else to say but "Awesome Gelato"!  The ladies that own this place are true Italians and know what they are doing. Paola is great and friendly and you can try any flavor you want as many times as you like.  Very good spot to have close to home. Go there frequently the Gelato is delicious and a great variety of flavors.
