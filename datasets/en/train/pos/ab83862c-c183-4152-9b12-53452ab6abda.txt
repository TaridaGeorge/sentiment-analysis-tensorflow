This travel store is the perfect place to find a Christmas, birthday, misc gift for your hard-to-buy-for friends.  It also has a great selection of luggage.  They also let me find a quiet corner to nurse my baby in... which was much better than returning to a bench in the busy, public mall walkway.  

5 stars!

I think the best thing was the nice (pretty) woman that worked there.  She made me want to buy lil travel trinkets.. and I did! haha

See ya there!
