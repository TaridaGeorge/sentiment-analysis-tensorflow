Whether it's a breathtaking view of the city, a romantic sunset view, or a healthy hike, South Park Park is the place to be.  As a visitor from California, the landscaping here is just beautiful.  It's free and best of all, even if it's 100 degrees here, because of the low humidity, it feels like high 80s California weather!

I highly recommend coming here for a visit either early in the morning for a healthy cool hike or for a spectacular sunset/city view in the evening.  Bring lots of water, a good pair of walking shoes, and sunblock.  I highly suggest a GPS and camera, too!  :)
