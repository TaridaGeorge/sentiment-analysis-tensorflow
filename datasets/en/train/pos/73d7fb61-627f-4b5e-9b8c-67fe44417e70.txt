One of my favorite bars, the perfect place to drop in for a beer or stay for a couple.  Boulders has a great selection of beers on tap and my favorite part is it seems like they always have something new to try.

The food is very good and if you need a big breakfast before heading out for a weekend adventure stop in for their PBR blueberry pancake.
