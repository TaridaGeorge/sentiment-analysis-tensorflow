This is by far our favorite Thai Restaurant in The Valley!!! Yes I dare to say that. The place is tiny, but oh so cozy, and they played Jazz music in the background... what a nice touch!

The food is simply the most authentic that I can get, The Fried Rice -- if you like spicy -- make sure to get it med-to-very hot! 
The Pad thai and Panang Curry is sooo good also... make sure to get Singha Beer with them also...

Oh the best thing about them is that they have a very reasonable price. I'd recommend this place to everybody visiting East Valley, or Greater Phoenix in general. Enjoy ;o)
