THIS IS THE BEST ITALIAN PIZZA ive had so far!! its nothing like the regular delivery.. they have many specials. you call them and ask them for their specials and ofccourse they will tell you.. you can taste the oregano  in the cheese but its not overwhelming. I highly recommend this pizza.. this is what i usually get {{LG 14" pepperoni +12 wings + 2 sodas $14.50}}
