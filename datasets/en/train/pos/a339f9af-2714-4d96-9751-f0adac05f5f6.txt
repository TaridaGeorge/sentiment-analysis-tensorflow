Great place to meet up for good food and drinks if you have a family. 

We have been here 6 times and I appreciate how the place no longer pumps club music during the family hours now. 

We come here for good food (tri tip, salads, green chili are all great-avoid the burgers!) and great beer. They have high chairs for the kids and the adults can relax. 

Anyway, we are fans and regulars. If they continue to be so family friendly, they will continue to build regular family fans. Every new couple who shows up to join in on baby lunch dates...they also become regulars :) As soon as it's nice out and the RR park opens, we plan on making this our spot to eat at after playing at the park :)
