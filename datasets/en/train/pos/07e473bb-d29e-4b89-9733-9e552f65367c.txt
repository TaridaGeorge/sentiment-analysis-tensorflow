I. LOVE. LUX. 
They play the best music (The XX tonight). Their coffee and tea is always the best (my personal favorites are quattro con panne and the "velvet"). Their baked goods are so genuinely great. And now the new food and atmosphere are simply making me want to live and die here. 
I wish it were closer to me since I live in Tempe, but I'll gladly make the Lightrail trek at least once a week for my fix.
