This place has been here since 1960. A really good restaurant,with really good food. On this trip we got Pizza and wings to go. You call in and they have it  ready in 15 to 29 min. The pizza crust is really great. I always love their Pizza. It is one of the best  in the valley. We got 2 types of wings hot and BBQ. Both were fabulous! There is not a lot of parking in the lot because, it is so popular. So you may have to park on the side street but, all worth it.
