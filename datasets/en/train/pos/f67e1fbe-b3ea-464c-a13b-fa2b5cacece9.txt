Fellow Yelpers -

Hang your hats low and mourn the loss of one of my favorite Sushi restaurants - Bonzai Cowboy.

It closed its doors last month and I for one am so sorry it did!  Good-bye beautiful Trio of Sashimi in Ponzu!!  Buh-Bye luscious Stallion Roll and *gasp* Sayonara my-most-favorite-and-never-to-be-found-again-anywhere Cowboy Fried Chicken Roll!!!   (sniff, sniff)

Hubby and I will miss you!
