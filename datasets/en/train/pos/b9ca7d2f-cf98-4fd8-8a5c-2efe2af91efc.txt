I only tried one plate and it was awesome!  The person working behind the bar was great, the owner spent the time to talk to me about what she'd recommend.  They recommended the exotic mushroom deep fry and it was as good as any vegetarian meal I've ever had.  I recommend getting the bread with it for dipping.  I will be coming back here when I'm in town again.
