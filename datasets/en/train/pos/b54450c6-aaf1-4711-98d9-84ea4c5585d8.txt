This place was great. I am Korean and from Los Angeles and I love this place. The food is very authentic and tasty just like home. I ate there two days in a row when I was in Phoenix. I had the Sushi, Kalbi and Bulgogi. My friend had the spicy seafood soup and it was great.

Update - Went there again this past weekend and the food was amazing again. I ate too much but was worth it.
