There are very few places that satisfy my entire family. This one does. Great food, large portions, great value and super friendly staff! The lunch entrees for around $6 include soup, egg roll or crab puff and a nice serving of your entree and fried rice. The sesame chicken is my favorite. Its fresh and tastes great. The location is right next to Kohls and Sprouts - so you can do a little shopping afterward too! Its worth the drive for a super yummy lunch!
