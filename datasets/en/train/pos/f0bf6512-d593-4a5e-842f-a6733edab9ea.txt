This place is awesome. I've honestly never had Thai food this good (though admittedly I've only eaten Thai food a few places in Phoenix and in San Francisco).  Their Pad See Ew is amazing and their curry is awesome as well. This is actually the only place where I can even eat the curry (all other curry I've tried has been disgusting), so it's possible they make it slightly differently.

Their prices have gone up slightly in the past few years, but it is still very reasonable money-wise. Overall one of Tempe's best restaurants, I'd say.
