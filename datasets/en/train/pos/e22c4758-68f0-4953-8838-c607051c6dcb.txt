I love everything about this place.  The crust and sauce are so good.  The four-cheese pizza has gorgonzola on it and makes for an amazing flavor.  The margherita pizza is another favorite.  
A couple times I've branched out and gotten pasta and it was really good too, but mostly I stick with the pizza.  
Price is reasonable and staff is very friendly.  Love this place.  Be aware if you go at the lunch rush - parking does kind of suck, but this place is so good, I won't ding them a star for that.
