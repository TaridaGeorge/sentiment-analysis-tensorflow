I was in a pinch and my taxes were late, I was also juggling some issues with my small business and just moved to the Scottsdale area. I called Thomas' office and I'm happy I did. He was quick to answer questions and his prices are fair. He was able to clear up my tax issues within 2 days!  I would definitely recommend him.
