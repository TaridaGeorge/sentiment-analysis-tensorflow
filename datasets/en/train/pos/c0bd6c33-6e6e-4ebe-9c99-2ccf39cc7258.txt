I am ecstatic to report that In Season Deli has reclaimed its former glory.. 

Keep in mind, I don't know the whole story here, but apparently the previous owner, Lydia, purchased the deli back and had her Grand Re-Opening last week. Stopped by for lunch today, and man, was it delicious, just like the good old days. The tamales were so tender, the side portions were huge, I can't wait to go back, and I will - this used to be a weekly trip for me and it will be again. Welcome back, Lydia! How we missed you!
