Very cool and different place! Waffles and hot dogs or both. I'm not really a hot dog fan but the waffles are amazing! They have a cinnamon flavor to them and you can put any toppings you want on/in it. My favorite is peanut butter and honey. Great price and quick service. Definitely will be going back!
