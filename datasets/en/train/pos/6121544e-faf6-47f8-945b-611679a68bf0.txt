This is a great Vietnamese find!  I have been a loyal customer over the years and even though owners have changed the great quality of food has stayed the same. Everything is so fresh and service is exceptional. It's a nice casual feel and a perfect place to go before catching a movie next door. Prices are reasonable as well!  The pho is in a good size bowl, enough for someone who is very hungry.  My personal favorite is #14, grilled beef and rice. The spring rolls are delicious as well.  This is an all around great restaurant!
