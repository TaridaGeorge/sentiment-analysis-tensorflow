Nothing more to ask for when you want a delicious, healthy meal; upbeat ambiance and great service.

Their menu has many vegetarian options including the falafel wrap, veg sandwiches/burgers, superb grilled veg. salad and the must have Hummus trio!
Nevertheless, the shawrma chicken wrap, chicken salad, fish (LOVE the wood fired mahi mahi) and other meat items are delicious as well! The spicy chicken wrap is big and good for sharing.

On a pleasant weather evening or brunch time, their patio seating is great. Also love the happy hour and reverse happy hour after 9 pm with $2 yummy margaritas!!

Like I said, nothing more to ask for when you get just everything at one place. Thanks Pita jungle for your awesome service and tasty food!!
