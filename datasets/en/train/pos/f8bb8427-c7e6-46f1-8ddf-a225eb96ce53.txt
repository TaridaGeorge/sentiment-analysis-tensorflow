What a wonderful little place to have a birthday lunch.  I enjoyed everything about this place. The location, owners, and of course the homemade food.  We started with a Pierogi Platter (1 doz), three different types: potato-cheese with smoked kielbasa saute with onions, meat, and sauerkraut.  I love the meat and potato-cheese, not so much of the sauerkraut ones.  I ordered a smoked polish sausage on cibatta bread , so yummy!  As for my friends, they had a fresh mozzarella, basil & tomato on cibatta,  hunter stew, cabbage roll, and breaded chicken breast  cutlet & cheese on cibatta bread.  I will need to go back to try the cheese blintzes.  Another plus about this place was   B.Y.O.B. - (beer or wine only)..  This was certainly a hidden a gem in downtown Glendale!
