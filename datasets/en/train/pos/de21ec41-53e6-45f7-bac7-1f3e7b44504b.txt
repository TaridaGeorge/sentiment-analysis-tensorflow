This place rocks! We had the corned beef hash and eggs with home fries and was served a platter covered wall to wall with food. The hash was excellent! Ordered a side of their spicy homemade breakfast sausage patties and it was AWESOME, the best I've ever had ANYwhere! 

We are definitely looking forward to our return to PHX Metro to experience them again!
