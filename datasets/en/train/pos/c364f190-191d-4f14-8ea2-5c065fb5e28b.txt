Enjoyed a terrific lunch here mid-afternoon on a Saturday.  Service was friendly and unpretentious.  We enjoyed an entree salad, the trout, and a couple of very tasty desserts.  We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the restaurant offers a children's menu.  At lunch or for an early dinner, this is an appropriate setting for well-behaved children.  Note that there are very few tables inside, so the atmosphere would be most enjoyable in the fall or spring when temperatures are right for enjoying the lovely outdoor patio.  Note also that free lot parking is available.
