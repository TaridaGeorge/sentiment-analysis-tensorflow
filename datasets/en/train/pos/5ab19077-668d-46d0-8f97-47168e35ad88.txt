Pro Check is the only home inspection service I will use, and that's not just as a Realtor, I use them for m personal acquisitions as well.  I have the choice of ANY home inspection company, and they are my only choice.  When Pro Check inspects a property, I know what I'm buying, inside and out.  No one is more thorough, more honest and more helpful.  I cannot recommend them enough.
