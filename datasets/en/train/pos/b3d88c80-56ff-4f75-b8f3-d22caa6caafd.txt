i always thought this store was for old ladies who wore mumu's all day, with curlers in their hair, lots of cats, and bought stuff on TV. then i met my wife....she is a self-professed scrapbood/craft nerd (btw...her scrapbooks are DA BOMB! if i may describe a scrapbook that way). 

it was only a matter of time before i was introduced to Michaels. now i stop in a couple of times a year. what i really like is buying craft kits for my niece and nephew and sometime, my dad (to keep the old fella busy and senile). it's a wonderful place for the imaginative and what better way to spend some quality time with your kids than a craft that the parents will wind up finishing anyway! 

no, i really think this is a neat, neat place.
