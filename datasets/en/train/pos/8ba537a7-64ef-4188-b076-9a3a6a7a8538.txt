Wow I consider myself a Mexican food connoisseur, The food at  Los Sombreros is exquisite. It is central Mexican quinine. The lamb adobo is out of this world, a lamb shank in a rich adobo sauce with grilled veges, beans, tortillas,soooooo good. 
This is the only place i know of that actually has great mole, the carnitas are wonderful. The new shrimp dish dazzled me. We fight over the Mexican chocolate pie every time. this is making me want to go back now.

enjoy,

Patrick
