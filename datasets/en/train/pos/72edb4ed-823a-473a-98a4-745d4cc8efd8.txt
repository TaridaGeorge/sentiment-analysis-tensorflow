I was lured into this gallery by the vibrant colors and good fun that it's walls emanate. The clincher for me was a painting of two monkeys and a paper airplane hovering over the pair. Upon catching a glimpse of that scene, I had to walk through this gallery's doors and be part of the fun. 

I stress the word fun when it comes to this gallery because so much art is serious. There's nothing wrong with serious; some art should be serious. The world, more so, needs serious art. It's refreshing, however, to see more whimsical work on display. Wilde Meyer does not offer a lower caliber of fine art, but rather another degree of excellence to the fine art world. Check it out!
