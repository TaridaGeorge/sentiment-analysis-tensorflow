I have enjoyed a lunch and a dinner at this New York style restaurant in the last three weeks. Lasagna at lunch was the best I have tasted during my years in Arizona. Perfectly prepared lasagna noodles married with a rich marinara sauce. On Saturday evening, I visited with three friends. I ordered the Rigatoni Bolognese and it was delicious. The others had Spaghetti and Meatballs, and Gnocchi and Butternut Squash. The sweet brandy cream sauce on the Gnocchi was truly mouth watering. It rivaled the white sauces of my favorite French restaurants. Thank you Rob and Jamie for a wonderful dining experience. We will return soon.
