Thank goodness the restaurant we WERE going to could not accommodate us that night.   I have eaten many times at Christopher's over the years and have always been delighted with the service, ambiance, and above all the food.  Justice, our server, was excellent.   We had  steamed mussels w/white wine broth, homemade ricotta and beet salad, duck thigh confit w/ duck breast cooked to perfection, and to top it off, the obligatory chocolate tower with espresso.  I can say this without reservation, this was the finest meal I have had maybe even ever.   I can not wait to go again.   Trust me, this is one place you want to try.   I would go for your next special occasion out.   For me, that may be to celebrate any given Wednesday evening that it is not over 100F out.
