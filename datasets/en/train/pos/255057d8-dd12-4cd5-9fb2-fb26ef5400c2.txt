After going to the Chandler Best Buy and this Best Buy location, I decided to come back here to buy my computer and all of it's accessories.  Why?  Because the staff here was better and manager, Jeff, was so friendly and helpful.  

The store is a large, warehouse looking space but it's packed with goodies.  It's definitely worth the trip!

See ya there!
