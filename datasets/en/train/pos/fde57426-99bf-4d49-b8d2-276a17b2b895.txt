Finally writing a review after I have been eating here for a couple years now.  This place is hands down the best south Indian food you will find in the valley.  They do such an incredible job with the spices.  The owner is really nice, he remembers that I cannot eat raw onions.  They did not even know that they were nominated for best vegetarian restaurant this year in the New Times, it was just business as usual.  Do not go here expecting to have a fine dining experience, you order at the counter, either take it to go, or sit in the dinner atmosphere and eat some crazy good food!  Friendly atmosphere, lots of families in to eat.  Everything is great, but the paneer butter marsala is one of my favorites.
