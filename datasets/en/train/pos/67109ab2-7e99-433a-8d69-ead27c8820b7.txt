OMG I love this place. I thought it was a salad place. I stumbled upon it waiting for Ross to open on Sunday.  It was the only place in the whole lot that had a bunch of cars so I thought I would check it out.  OH! it's a health food store. I prefer unhealthy food myself, but my daughter (7) is lactose intolerant and they have lactose free milk, goat yogurt (who knew), and even lactose free ice cream - score! Yeah for her. Ross finally opened so I didn't get to explore the entire store yet but will soon - you betcha.
