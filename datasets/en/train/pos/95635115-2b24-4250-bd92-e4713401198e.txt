I misjudged Saigon the first time around. This place is awesome! I just ordered the wrong thing. 

I have returned to the restaurant several times and ordered the pho with thin noodles (I can't remember the menu number now), and it is delicious! Last night I had the salt and pepper squid and the basil beef chow fun. My meal was super tasty! It reminded me of Thien Hong, my favorite Portland restaurant. I love how they sell thai ice tea as well. It's always a perfect pairing to my dinner choice. 

I will come back to Saigon again and again!
