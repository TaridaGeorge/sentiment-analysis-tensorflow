I read the reviews. I had a craving for Flip food...so I dragged poor unsuspecting hubby along.

It's located inside the mall around the corner from the nail polish store. *swoons* Nail polish AND Flip food? Momma's come home. Too bad that nail polish is more expensive than that food!

Anyway, I was slightly put off by it not being a restaurant, but I got over it once I had that pork adobo goodness in my mouth...and all that RICE! The BBQ chicken. O.M.G. TO DIE FOR!

Their lumpia shanghai was good and 3 for $1 - I can easily see people totes forking out mega money to get that full feeling!

I met Chona and she was a total sweetheart. Note to self: add her on FB. :)

I really enjoyed the cassava cake and atchara.

I can't wait to bring mommy here when we're in AZ.
