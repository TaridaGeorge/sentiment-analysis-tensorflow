My friend Brad is always talking about this place.......so that says someting, either Brad needs psychological help or this place is really cool. 
Bean is great for the coffee, atmosphere and the high speed internet kicks into gear. 
Check this place out for all the greats and glorys..
Also Friday nites are open mikes with impromptu players.  

I just wanted to add a couple hints about the Bean for the new xtreme beaner.... 
*** Get their early, the internet access is free and its kicking like chuck norris. Your chances of getting a place indoors is pretty limited, so like i said get their early. In the day time, before 6. The place, power outlets and people fill up around 615. The outer patio area is still nice as well, you can find a nice spot to cozy up with a book.
