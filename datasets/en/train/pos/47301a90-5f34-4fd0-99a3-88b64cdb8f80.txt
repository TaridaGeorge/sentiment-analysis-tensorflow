i've never been upset at haji. never. it's super casual, located inside a middle eastern grocery. the food is fantastic. best falafel in town, hands down. the service is quick and efficient and the same faces have been working there for a long time. 

the portions are large, the hummus is great and so is everything else. as a vegetarian, i can't comment on the meat dishes, but my carnivorous friends are never disappointed. me + haji = pure love.
