Stopped in for a business lunch and it does not get any better. Was visiting town on business and the client suggested the venue. This joint hits on all cylinders. Greeted and seated promptly. Friendly but not intrusive server who was always there at the right time. Great corn bread to start. Had the BBQ chicken sandwich and shoestring fries. Delicious. Also, the five you a mini sugar donut made onsite with your bill. OMG best part of the meal. Leaves you with a great taste in your mouth. Pun perhaps intended or not ;)
