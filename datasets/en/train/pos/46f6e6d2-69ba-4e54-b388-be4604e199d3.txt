Great service from the guys here at Pep Boys. Had a hole in my tire and they patched it up for FREE!!! 

Service took about 40 minutes and they have a waiting room. They normally have WIFI but their router was down during my visit. :(

I was given a free rewards program where you get $5 off every $100. Added the mini membership card to my keychain!
