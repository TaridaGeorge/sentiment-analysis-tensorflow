I was SO impressed with the service that I couldn't wait to write a review.  I have four big dogs, ranging in age from 10 years - 14 years old so not only are they bigger, but they're hard to move around.  Carina was a pro, handled my kids with care, and they were clean in under 2 hours.  WOW.  I will definitely use her again.
