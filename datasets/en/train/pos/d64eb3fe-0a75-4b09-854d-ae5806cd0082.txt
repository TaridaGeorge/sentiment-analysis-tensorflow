This place is lovely inside, very relaxing, and well decorated.  The bussers and delightfully friendly.  I ordered the grilled cheese...it was the best freaking grilled cheese I have ever had in my life.  Nicely toasted whole grain bread, brie, swiss, cheddar, arugula, and tomato.  I asked if they could add turkey to it and they pleasantly said "yes, whatever you'd like!".   The smokey brie added so much flavor and creamy texture. YUM YUM YUM!!!
