I don't give 5 stars very often...but if you are a donut connoisseur like myself, then you must try Lamar's. There is nothing fancy about this place, but their boxes put it in the best way, "Simply a better donut." I even like Krispy Kreme donuts, but Lamar's is more of a good old fashioned donut. Personally I love the Maple Lamars Bar...but that is because I am a sucker for maple donuts!

Also, this place has a drive through, so if you wake up in the morning and don't feel like getting out of your pajamas you can just hit up the drive through at Lamar's and pick up some tasty donuts!
