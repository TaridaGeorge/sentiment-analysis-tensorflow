Love, love, love, love

My BF and I went on vacation to Phoenix,( and we are going back - we love it), and I was thinking, in US it will be hard to get Gluten Free food.
Man, I was wrong !!
We were told about Picazzo, and went there not expecting much.
We had the meat ball starter for 2, huge portion with Gluten Free bread - Delicious, fresh and very tasty
Then I got a pizza - Italian style with fine crust and plenty of topping on it, fantastic
And the best of all, Gluten Free Chocolate Brownie with Coconut milk Ice Cream - Divine

The place looked great, the staff friendly and the bill had a good price.

Will go back !!!!
