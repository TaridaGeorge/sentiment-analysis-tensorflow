I LOVE their art work of horses the most I think, all done by one artist & they are for sale.  (I would have bought one but they are pricey!) Very fanciful and interesting. When I can afford it, I'll buy some. Check it out! 


Unfortunately my favorite salad  has been bumped from the menu to make room for new and different things :( I am sad. 

It was delicious !!!! But their new things are good too. 


We had the.....
Phyllo Wrapped Baked Brie , Tiger Shrip stuffed with Jalape√±o & Wrapped in Pancetta, Dijon & Lavender Dusted Rack of Lamb, Chicken Breat Stuffed with Boursin Cheese and Spinach & The Roasted Pear Salad. 

I miss my old favorite dish, but it is still really really good (and like i said, I love the art.)
