Good service, new manager.  I had to have the 60000 service done on my car.  According to the manual there are 2 options, the spendier one and the low end service, but no specifics about desert conditions.  I took it in and the manager went over all of the manual's service requests and eliminated the ones he thought I didn't need and turned out to be 200 dollars cheaper than what I was expecting!  Nice to know an honest shop who is willing to save me a few bucks
