My Last Meal On Earth: Chicken and Waffles

Lo Lo's is the reason why.  Everytime I visit Arizona, I make sure I hit this spot up.  I usually order the 'Lo Lo's' meal which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken, with 3 waffles and a scoop of butter with syrup.  YUM!  This meal would not be complete without ordering their super delicious Sweet Tea which is served in a glass jar.  

There are two locations, one in lower Phoenix, and the other in Scottsdale.  The one in lower Phoenix is the original location.  However, it's much smaller so wait times could vary.  The Scottsdale location is much bigger,  so dealing with long wait times should not be as big of a  problem.

Winner Winner Chicken Dinner, Lunch and Breakfast please.
