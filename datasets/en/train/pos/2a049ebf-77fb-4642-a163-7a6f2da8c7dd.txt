I have been taking my cat(s) here for over 6 years.  Dr. Ford is my cat's doctor.  She is personable and easy to talk to about your animals health.   I find the front desk to be very friendly and willing to help you with any task.  I have also had excellent experience with all of the techs.  This office will call you to following up on you animal the next day to later on that night depending on your animals' issues.  I have found the entire operation to be excellent.
