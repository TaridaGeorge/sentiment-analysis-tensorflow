Wow this place is amazing. i got the special that came with 2 eggs (i got them over medium) hash browns (capped & smothered meaning mushrooms and sausage gravy as a topping on the hash browns which was amazing) 2 slices of ham, 2 pieces of bacon, two slices of toast and a waffle of your choice.

First of all this place is not called "Waffle House" for no reason, Absolutely the best Waffles here than i ever had anywhere else... and ive had waffles all over the damn place. Outstanding staff they were very nice and on top of things, if i ever come back to AZ i would come here first before stopping by at any other place.
