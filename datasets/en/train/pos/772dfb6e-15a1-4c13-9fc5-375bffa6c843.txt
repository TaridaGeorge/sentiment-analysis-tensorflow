Happiest place on earth.

The beer is awesome - check out the seasonal or the cask conditioned, but everyone really comes for the atmosphere.  It's a perfectly laid back, open air feel, with view of the brewing equipment.  It's lively without being so loud you need to yell for conversation.  Even the food hits the mark with daily specials and especially good burgers.  Overall awesome place.
