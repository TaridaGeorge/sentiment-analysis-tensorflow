My wife and I lived a few miles away.  Nice service (can be a bit slow when busy...but that seems pretty normal). Never really get the dinners (a bit more expensive), as I am hooked on the Tacos and a few of the sandwiches (with amazing onion rings for a few bucks more). Also a good place to watch a game at the bar.  Overall, it our favorite casual place in Phoenix.
