When I go out of town, I love parking here at the parking spot!  They are less expensive than anywhere else around and all of their spots are covered. You have to have that here in Phoenix. You always get a bottle of water on the way out and they always offer coupons on their website. Just be sure you print it off because they can't take it off of your phone.
