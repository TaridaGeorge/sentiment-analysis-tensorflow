If you love popcorn, this is the place for you.  They offer endless flavors of kettle popcorn.  I love the Butter Pecan, Pineapple/Jalapeno, and Caramel.  The owners and staffs are knowledgeable and very friendly.  Excellent gift idea for someone that is hard to buy.  They have smaller sampler sizes great for gift basket. The medium bag popcorn on Tuesdays is only $2.00, normally $3.00.
