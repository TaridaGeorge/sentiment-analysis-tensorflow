Easily one of my favorite places in the Phoenix area to eat and drink. I've had a variety of their sandwiches and every one of them has been excellent. The Arizona chicken rolls are an appetizer that can't be missed. They have a wide variety of beers brewed in house so they are always fresh. The atmosphere is welcoming and energetic. This is a great place to catch a sporting event or bring larger groups. The venue usually plays host to a college town crowd and is usually busy but never overwhelming. Service is usually very good. If friends are visiting from out of town, this is where we will go every time. Four Peaks is a Phoenix area staple as far as I am concerned.
