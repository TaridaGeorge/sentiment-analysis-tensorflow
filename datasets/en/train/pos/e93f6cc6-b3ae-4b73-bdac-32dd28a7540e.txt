I could live here and be totally happy.  The staff was over the top friendly.  My room was huge, amazing, comfortable and oh-so-cool.  The glassed in bathroom and the blue mood lighting was the best.  Don't forget to check out the spa.  Ummmmm....  Love their signature scent too.  Check their store out online and get some shipped to you.  Thanks to this hotel, I didn't mind staying in a place that got up to 106 by midday!
