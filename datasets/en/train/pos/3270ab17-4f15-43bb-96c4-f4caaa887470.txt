The food here is a solid 3.  But I'm giving them a 5 because of the following reasons: fried rattlesnake appetizer, an actual working slide from 2nd to 1st floor (how cool is that!), friendly staff, kids eat free, an absolutely huge steer by the entrance (you'd have to pay $5 at the OC fair to see this), and free cotton candy for the kids.
