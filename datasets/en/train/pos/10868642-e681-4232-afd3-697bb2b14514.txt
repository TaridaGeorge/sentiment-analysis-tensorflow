5 stars for: creativity in food/taste combinations, ambiance (excellent musical choices, artwork), service. The first thing the waiter did was adjust our table (it was a little wobbly), then dim the lights out a little. He gave us his honest opinions, gave us enough space. We ate he crabcakes, the meatloaf, the rellenos and farm salad. All were delicious with unique flavor combinations. Oh...I almost forgot. It was my husband's birthday and the waiter added a little candle to this heavenly chocolate cake. Perfect evening. Highly recommend-and we are from San Francisco where we unfortunately become restaurant/taste snobs!
