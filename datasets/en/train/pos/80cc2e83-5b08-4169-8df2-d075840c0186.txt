Excellent per-Valentine's Day dinner! The salmon I had was excellent and I liked their escargot. My fiance had the lamb. I normally do not enjoy the taste of lamb, but this dish was excellent. The atmosphere is really cute, really reminds me of the Provence. We did not have a chance to try the absinthe, but we'll be back...
