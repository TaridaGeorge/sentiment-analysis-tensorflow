I had two hours layover at the Phoenix Airport this week.  Since I was flying on Southwest Airlines where they don't serve meals, I strolled through the airport to see what I could find for lunch.  I decided since I was in Arizona that Mexican would be a logical choice.  Jose Roux Taco Bar looked inviting so I decided to try it out.  Am I ever glad that I did!  Tip:  try their steak tacos.  The seasonings romance your palate - truly delicious.
