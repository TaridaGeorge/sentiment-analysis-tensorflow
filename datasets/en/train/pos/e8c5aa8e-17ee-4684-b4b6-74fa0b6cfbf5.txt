i love this restaurant so much. i have yet to have something i didn't like.

i have nothing really special to add to all of the amazing reviews except to order these things:

thai steak noodle salad- mango, avocado, tomatoes, noodles, marinated steak...i meannnnnnnnnnnnn
caesar salad - their dressing is my fav and so are the croutons
bacon, cheddar burger- so juicy, so exquisite
roast beef sandwich- raw horseradish on the side
fries- order extra bc people will eat these babies UP! 


service is ALWAYS good, it's always clean, it's always pleasant. seriously, you can't have a bad time unless you're just a miserable person.
