An adventurous joy. Posh was a sensory delight and left me wanting to return soon. 
I sat counter-top, and was able to watch the chefs prepare dishes throughout the evening. The wine list is adventurous and unique. The service polished and unobtrusive. The food was inventive and perfectly prepared. Everything about the evening was wonderful, from the moment we walked in the door to chatting with chef/owner Josh at the end of the meal. 
A perfect date night, or great place to take someone while looking to impress. I'll be back soon.
