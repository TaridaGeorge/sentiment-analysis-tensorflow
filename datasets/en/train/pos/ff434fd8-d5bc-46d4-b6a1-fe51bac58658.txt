While on vacation in Scottsdale we shopped at this Whole Foods location.  We have a Whole Foods at home and this one is light years ahead of the one in our home town.  We've also been in a number of Whole Foods in different cities in the Western US and this location is near the top of the list for our personal experience.  

Great selection of all things --- amazing variety of prepared take out items in the deli, an incredible assortment of specialty chocolates, wonderful array of meats, beautiful fresh produce, lots of wine choices across price points, terrific cheeses, great assortment of other goods and really friendly people.  Add all this to an easy to reach location with lots of parking and it's a winner!
