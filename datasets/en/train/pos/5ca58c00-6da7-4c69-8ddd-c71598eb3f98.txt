So first, I am a huge Postinos fan and have been for over a decade now.  When I heard they opened up the Windsor, I was excited to check it out.  I finally made it this past weekend and was just as impressed by the staff's friendliness, the chill atmosphere and the eclectic menu.  We were lucky to find a few seats at the bar right away.  The only food we tried were the Loaded Chips.  They were "ridiculously" good too....so good, that we ate every bit of them and couldn't eat another ounce afterwards.  Great excuse to go back for more!
