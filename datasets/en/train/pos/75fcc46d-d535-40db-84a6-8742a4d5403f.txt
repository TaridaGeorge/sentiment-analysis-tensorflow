Being as far away from China as I could possibly get, I didn't expect to get something tasty from here but it was quite delightful dining.  The atmosphere is queazy like there are a bunch of mismatched lanterns all bunched up in one corner or something like that which had me staring at it wanting to walk around and fix it.
