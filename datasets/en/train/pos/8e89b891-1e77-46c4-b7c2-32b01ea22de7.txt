Best beer selection of all the AJ's in Phoenix.  Beer manager knows the product well, and is often willing to pull up beer information on his Blackberry to give enhanced info on the beers.  Virtually all beer is refrigerated as well.

Wine and spirts selection is on par with the other locations.

Good parking and convenient location 5 minutes off the 101.
