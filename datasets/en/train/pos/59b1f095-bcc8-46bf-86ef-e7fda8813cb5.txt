Yummy!  The pizzas are delicious, especially the Roasted Eggplant, which I swear has bacon on it, but apparently it doesn't.  I feel so healthy eating here.  The Tuscan Kale Salad is delicious and incredibly good for you.  A glass of white wine (the 6-dollar one is good) works well with the food I've had here.  Some may find it a little pricey, but I think the prices are very reasonable for what you are getting.  Organic, fresh food always is a little more expensive, but well worth it for taste, your health, and supporting local agriculture.
