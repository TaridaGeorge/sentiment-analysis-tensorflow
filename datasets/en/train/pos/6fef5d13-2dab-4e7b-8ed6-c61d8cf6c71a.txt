This is my go to place for a bottle of alcohol that I am gifting to someone, recommending someone to gift or celebrating with.

The selection per square foot is quite impressive and the guys know their stuff quite well. They've tried a lot of what's in the store and when it comes to Tequila, have been the most helpful bunch every time I came in.

Sidenote: sometimes the music choice is questionable :)
