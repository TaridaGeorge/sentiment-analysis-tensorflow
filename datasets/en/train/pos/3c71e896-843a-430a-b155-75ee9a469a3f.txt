Delectable and crispy wings, just on the good side of too salty. Try not to be put off by "chicken feet" on the menu; they aren't feet but rather... the most delicious and moist chicken tenders EVER (one-upped with homemade ranch dressing). We walked in just looking for a chill spot to watch some Olympiad action and were so pleasantly surprised. Friendly, divey, delicious. Loved it.
