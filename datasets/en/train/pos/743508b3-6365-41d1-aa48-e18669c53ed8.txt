For a few pennies over $5 today I had a double international with fries. The burger was perfectly cooked with a great charred flavor. It was a messy, delicious delight.  The fries were excellent, crunchy on the outside and fluffy in the middle.

I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly my order was made.  This is clearly a family run restaurant that knows their customers. I can't believe that I have driven past this place for years without stopping.  That will change now!
