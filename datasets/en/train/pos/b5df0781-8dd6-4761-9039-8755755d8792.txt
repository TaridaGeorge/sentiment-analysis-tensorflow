Ohhh Cousins. You never cease to make me happy. I moved here from Wisconsin a couple years ago and I was surprised that there weren't any Cousins. This location is really great! They have Sprecher root beer (which I can only find in WI)! My favorite is the roast beef sub with the french fries-which you can subsititue for chips at no cost! The place is really clean and the staff is very friendly! We met the owner, who was very nice! He is also from Wisconsin, which is pretty cool!
