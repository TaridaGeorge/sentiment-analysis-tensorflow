I am not a sushi eater but all my friends were meeting here, so I thought, I'm in the mood for teryaki chicken so I'll try it out!  

I ended up ordering the teryaki chicken roll which had crab it in. Let me tell you, I really enjoyed the mix of something familiar (teryaki chicken) with something new, crab. 

The servers were very friendly and funny. They have a good happy hour too!
