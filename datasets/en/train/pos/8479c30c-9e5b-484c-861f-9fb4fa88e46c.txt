Best shop in town.
Every employee at Dyno-Comp is well-informed and treats the business like their own. This translates to quality work and attention to detail, as well as attention to the client.  Nobody is trying to screw you or upsell, and the work they do is bar none the best available.
I personally have dealt with Richard, Ken, and Ron, and could not be happier. 
If you want your car to go from just a car to something truly special, do yourself a favor and take it here.
