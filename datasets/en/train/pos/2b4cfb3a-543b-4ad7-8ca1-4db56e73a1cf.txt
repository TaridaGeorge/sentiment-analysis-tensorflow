I work less than a block from this place and go here all the time.  The food is good and there is always plenty of it...  A very nice local watering-hole and family restaurant.  

The lunch specials are the best.  I can eat till stuffed and get out the door for less than $10.  The lunch specials are popular, so there can be a wait to be seated.  

I love the baked spaghetti here so much that my wife and I had this catered for our rehearsal dinner.  We fed 35 people for less than $300, and everyone really enjoyed the food.

I HIGHLY recommend this place.
