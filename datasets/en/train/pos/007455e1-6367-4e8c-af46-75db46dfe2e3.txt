The weekend of food porn:  foodie friend by trade from SF comes to town and we hit it hard.  The place that topped Binkley's -- Sens.  Yes, reread that last bit.  Binkley's which is foodie heaven (this is coming from 2 people that frequented the French Laundry and Bouchon's) was usurped by Johnny Chu.  We ordered some shochu and asked Johnny to bring us what he wanted.  The subtly and complexity.  And no foam!  Where did that trend come from?  OCD moment -- yakitori means grilled chicken skewer in Japanese.  WTF? Shrimp?
Sorry -- the fish in the banana leaf and the smokey rice make up for lost in translation. And the decor is outstanding.  And the servers can explain differences in sake.
