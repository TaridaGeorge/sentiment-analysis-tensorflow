It's a good sign when you wish you could have stayed longer at a hotel.  Everything was wonderful.  It had the most comfortable hotel bed I think I have ever slept in.  The room was very quiet, private, and secure (key card needed to access your building). I  travel a lot for business (and pleasure) so I am particular about where I stay.  I can't say enough nice things about this hotel.  It is a charming, personable, and unique gem.  I loved the decor, ambiance, food, service, staff, grounds, and of course Bosco...
