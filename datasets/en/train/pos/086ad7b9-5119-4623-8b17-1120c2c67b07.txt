This place is ridiculously good, i dont think i could find a flaw in its food quality if i tired. The waffles are crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The fried chicken was perfect with crispy skin and no uncooked fatty parts as i normally see with other places and it also had a delicious seasoning, the meat was also good being tender and juicy. They get creative points with kool aid too and this aint no bitch kool aid we mad as kids this is great kool-aid that somehow keeps it flavor even with melting ice in it. i cant wait to go back its great kinda like hot sex on a plate.
