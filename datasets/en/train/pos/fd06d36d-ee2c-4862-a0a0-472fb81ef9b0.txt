I was a regular at this location for a few years and now that I'm no longer a local, I still stop in whenever I'm in town. I LOVE this place! Don't get me wrong... the food isn't fantastic. It's fattening and unhealthy and yummy. Their freshly brewed sweet-tea is tops and for a former south-easterner, coming here gives me a nostalgic warm fuzzy. This location has always been consistent for me in terms of quality and service. I like that. It isn't a 5-star (gourmet) restaurant by any stretch of the imagination but to me it deserves 5-stars. :)
