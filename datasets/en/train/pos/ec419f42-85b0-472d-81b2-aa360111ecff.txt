Yum, yum, yum!!!

I've heard about this place for years and recently had the chance to give it a try. Wow, some of the best fried chicken I've ever had combined perfectly with crispy waffles and topped off with syrup and LoLo's own hot sauce. 

Service was very friendly and the facility was really nice, very welcoming and comfortable. Yes, you have to drive a little further South on Central Avenue than some people find comfortable, but its well worth it.

If you're looking for great comfort food, give LoLo's a shot!
