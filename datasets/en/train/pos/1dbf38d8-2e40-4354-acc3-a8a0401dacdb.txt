Lisa is a wealth of knowledge.  She listens to what your needs are is very detailed to help you work on your problem areas.  She is super friendly and very easy to talk to.  Not only does she do a amazing job but she also leaves you with the information to help prevent some of the problems you may be facing.  Being a former Athlete and trainer I have worked with alot of people in the industry, but I would have to say she is at the top of the list.  I would recommend her without hesitation!
