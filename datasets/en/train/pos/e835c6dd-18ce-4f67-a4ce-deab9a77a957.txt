Have to give this place five stars because there is nothing like it here in Phoenix!  I'm from back east and finding REAL bagels out here is near impossible, let alone a Taylor ham,egg, and cheese sandwich.  The coffee is great too and everyone that works there is friendly and courteous.

It has a real neighborhood feel.  I am a P90X coach and they let me leave my business cards out and notices about my local workouts.  When I walk in, I almost always see at least two or three people I know...just a great place all the way around!!!
