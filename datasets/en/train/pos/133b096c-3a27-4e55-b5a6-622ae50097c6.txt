I've been to Sunrise on several occasions and have had a great experience every time. Their bagels are the best in the valley (I recommend the Cheddar bagel) and the breakfast sandwiches are fresh and tasty. The space is clean and bright with wonderful art all around, all the owners are always friendly and obviously passionate about their store and customers.  Skip the chain restaurants and support a great local business!
