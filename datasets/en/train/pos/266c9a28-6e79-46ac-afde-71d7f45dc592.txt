We've been coming here for years and are so grateful to have such great, healthy, affordable take-out nearby.  The grape leaves are awesome, as is the hummus. My husband loves the falafal sandwich, I'm partial to the chicken schwarma. When he has baklava (which is sometimes) we always get it, as it's so yummy. The owner is a sweetheart and a hard-working guy that always makes me smile. We always do take-out since we live nearby. He has tables but it's pretty rustic (it's all about the food, not the ambiance) Delish!!!
