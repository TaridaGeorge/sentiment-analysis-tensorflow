This place is awesome. You must appreciate made to order, authentic food!! The cabbage rolls are to die for. The schnitzel cordon bleu, pork or chicken, is amazing. Swedish meatballs, poutine... Try it all! We have yet to try something we don't like! Not to mention each item usually comes with FOUR different sides. This is the best Scandinavian food in the valley!!
