Want to get a party poppin' With over 30 flavors to select from, one can find a flavor for any occasion.  I've been in there a little bit too much, getting snacks for the office as well as snacks for clients/meetings.  A mini is a great size to try out different flavors.  

From savory selections like Beer Cheddar, Sour Cream and Chives, fruity flavors, Strawberry or Pineapple to sweet blends, Kettle corn and Butterfinger!  Love the Puppy Chow mixture of popcorn, chex mix and pretzel sticks in sweetness!  

Can't decide? Try the Scottsdale blend...White Cheddar and Carmel, YUMMY!  

Hidden inside the strip mall, totally worth checking out!
