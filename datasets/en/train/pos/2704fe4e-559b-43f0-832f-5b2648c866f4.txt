I loved this place! I was in Phoenix for work and my friend Peter took me here on a Thursday night for a drink and the atmosphere was so laidback, the bartender was cute and friendly, and the drinks were fantastic and not overpriced. While enjoying our cocktails, he told me about the restaurant attached to the bar and its phenomenal food, so we decided to lunch there the next day. He wasn't kidding. The service was awesome, again the drinks were tasty, and the food was excellent. I had the grilled pretzel bread with dipping sauces and tempura shrimp BLTA sandwich. The grilling of the pretzel bread varied (and not in the best way), but the cheese sauce completely made up for it. And the sandwich was ridiculously tasty... All in all, I would recommend this place to locals or visitors alike.
