Go to the most expensive restaurant you can find.  Order the most expensive King Salmon you can get.  It still will not compare to what you can buy from Alaskan Pride!  We purchased our first fish from them on Saturday, June 23 and ate it last night.  In the toaster oven until the fish just started to flake.  It was the most delicious fish I have ever eaten.  We purchased while at the Central Farmers Market (Central & Northern Avenues) open each Saturday morning.

We WILL be back this week for more!
