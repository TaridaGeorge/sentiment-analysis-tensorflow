I went to DC Dental for a cleaning, exam, and x-rays today. The entire staff was kind, friendly, and helpful. Dr. Khaydatov performed my exam and cleaning, and had a great bedside manner. 

I used a coupon to get my services for $29 (which I found here: http://mydcdental.com/coupon/) and was worried that the staff would try to upsell me or convince me I needed services that I didn't need, but nothing could be further from the case. I received wonderful care and a clean bill of dental health, so I'm good for another 6 months!
