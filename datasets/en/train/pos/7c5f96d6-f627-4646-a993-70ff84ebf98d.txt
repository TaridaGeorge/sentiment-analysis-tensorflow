Trader Joe's Cashier: Hey, weren't you here yesterday?
Me: (Embarrassed) Uh... yes. But I came with different people this time!

It's true. I could go to Trader Joe's every day of the week and never get bored. I make friends with the people behind the sample counter (I like to think they will judge me less for taking multiple samples if I am friendly). I have numerous favorite items that are TJ exclusives (ginger cat cookies, anyone?), and they are all priced so reasonably!

This store is a bit small and always full of shoppers, but the workers are nice, the floors are clean, and if you can survive the parking lot the rest of the visit is stress free.
