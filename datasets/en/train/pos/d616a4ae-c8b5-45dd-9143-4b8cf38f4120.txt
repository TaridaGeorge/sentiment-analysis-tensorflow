We went here for my daughter's birthday at her request because she loves the Fettuccine Alfredo.  She also loves the creamy pesto salad dressing.  The entire family was against going here because they have removed so many of our previous favorites from their menu, however they added the Spaghetti Vesuvius back to the menu!  It is very spicy with sausage, meatballs, and chicken . Totally amazing if you like spicy.  You will not see this dish on the on line dinner menu nor will you see a meatball or sausage sub on the lunch menu, but the menu at the restaurant does reflect these items.  Our server was Jim and I have to say that he had the best attitude and made for a wonderful experience.
