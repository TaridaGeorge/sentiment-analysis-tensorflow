You can order online (which I find a pain and never do) or go to the store directly. It's like a big warehouse that you wander through trying to find what you want. I do admit to being frustrated sometimes trying to find certain items. The staff is friendly. I never have any problems ordering from the phone and if something needs returned I've never had a problem. 

The nicest  thing about Ryan's is they have the BEST prices on pet products hands down that I have seen.
