Vanessa loves the pets she cares for as she loves her own.  She is enthusiastic, energetic, and fun.  There's no need to worry about your pets if Vanessa is looking after them.  She goes above and beyond to make sure the families know their four-legged friend is stress-free while mom and dad are away. Based on the kisses I've seen my own dog give Vanessa, I'm pretty sure she's a sitter to keep as long as you can.
