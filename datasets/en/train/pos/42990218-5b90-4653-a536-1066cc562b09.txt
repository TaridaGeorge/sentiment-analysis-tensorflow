Just an update.  New owners took this place over about a year and a half ago.  It is better than ever.  They constantly have great entertainment and the food is always fresh and has a little different twist.  The wait staff always gives a friendly "your in our home and we adore you" vibe that makes for a huge faithful following.  Best Coffee haunt in Cave Creek!
