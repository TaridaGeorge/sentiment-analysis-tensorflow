Definitely a place you gotta check out on a hot day.  Actually, I'd probably go here on a cold day too.  It's self serve so you can get any amount you want.  I tried the vanilla, peanut butter and oatmeal cookie.  I should have just gotten the oatmeal cookie.  While the other stuff is good, the oatmeal cookie is amazing.  You have to try it out.  It has oatmeal in and just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar.  Really, you gotta try it.  They have an awesome selection of toppings to put on.  They say they have 60, but the guy behind the counter said he has more in back.  There was so many, I was too confused what I wanted because I wanted the all.  The workers are super friendly and will help you out with suggestions.  This place is definitely worth visiting.  Go.  Now!
