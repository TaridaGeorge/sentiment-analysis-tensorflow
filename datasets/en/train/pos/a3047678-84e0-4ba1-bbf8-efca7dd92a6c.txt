I love FilmBar so much and had to write an update for them giving them the 5 stars that they deserve!  It seems that they have worked out some of their newly-opened-business kinks and everything is now wonderful!

I've been going to FilmBar at least once a month (although usually twice) for the past 5 months because they have such an amazing lineup of truly independent films.  On Monday nights they let a local organization show a film and keep the profits from ticket sales - a great idea!!

They now offer beer on tap and popcorn - something I had been anxiously awaiting.
