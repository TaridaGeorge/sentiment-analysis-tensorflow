My boyfriend and I have passed this place countless times and this time we decided to go inside and check it out. When we first walked in we had a sample of the pumpkin spice and wow!  YUM. So moist and sweet. We ended up buying two of the smaller cakes, lemon and pecan praline. Like I said, moist and sweet wonderfulness!!

Lemon was our favorite and we're stopping by in the near future to try the chocolate flavor and the raspberry cakes!!
