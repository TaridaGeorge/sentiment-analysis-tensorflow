Their brunch here is DELICIOUS! I didn't want to expect too much out of the red velvet pancakes, but they are really as good as people say they are. We also ate the brussel sprout & pancetta flatbread, and that was equally as delectable. With a mango lemonade, that was the perfect brunch meal for us. I wish I would have tried this place earlier than the last weekend before I moved! Really cute place and good service.
