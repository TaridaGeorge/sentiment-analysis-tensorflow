Been a fan since it was May's Best of the West!  The food is consistently good, therefore, I don't mind the higher prices, they are proud and rightfully so.

The Parisian Omelette and the Eggs Maximillan (with or without chorizo) are my favorites.

I love the salsa they make and the biscuits and gravy rock too.

The service is usually pretty good!
