Good lord, Pita Jungles pop'n up everywhere. As you can see from my review profile I am a fan of the Jungle. I frequent there Desert Ridge  location the most but I live almost exactly between this location and the Desert ridge location so now I just flip a coin. This location has some really nice decor inside, very conteparary.Same good clean healthy food as the other locations and same good service. I have been ordering the Mahi Mahi a lot lately. Good flavor with the cilantro hummus and the pea sprouts, yes I like pea sprouts. I like to eat it like a bruschetta. I take the little pita chips it comes with and put a little bit of each ingredient on it and take a bite. Good stuff.
