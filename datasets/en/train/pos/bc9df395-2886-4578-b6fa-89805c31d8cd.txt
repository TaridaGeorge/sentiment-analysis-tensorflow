I lost my mind in here last night.  I don't think you understand what its like to live your whole life with no Nordstrom, to hear your friends talk about how great it is, to be able to use the website but never go to the store.  When I finally did, I was like a kid in a candy store.  My husband had to drag me out of the store.

Its great because it has something in every price point.  There are so many designers there that I often buy online or at small boutiques (Ella Moss, Trina Turk )  The shoe department is unreal.  I've never been a big department store shopper but this is much different than your regular Macys.  Its well laid out and spacious, its not just a ton of racks crammed together.  The Anniversary Sale is right around the corner and I cannot wait.
