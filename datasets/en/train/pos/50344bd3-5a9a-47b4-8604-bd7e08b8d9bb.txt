I don't know much about Artlink except what I've read.  But I experienced First Friday last week, and had a great time.  I was only in one area (Roosevelt street, and some of the side streets surrounding), but thought some of the work was great.  To be honest, the best thing was that I discovered some really cool restaurants and bars in the neighborhood.  You would never know them because they are in actual homes.  The bars primarily served beer and wine, but had lots of artwork,  and were a bit swanky.... I like it!
