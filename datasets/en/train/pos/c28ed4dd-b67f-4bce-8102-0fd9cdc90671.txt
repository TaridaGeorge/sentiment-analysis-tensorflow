mmmm mmmmm mmmmm  ......  I'm surprised Cookie Monster is not camped outside of this awesomely fantastic cookie joint.  I swear I tasted every single ingredient, right down to the butter.  Huge cookies with huge taste.  You can even special order egg-free cookies.  The Tropic and the Simple were outstanding.  I could gain 20 lbs in a week at that place, that's how addictive and delicious these cookies are!

Can't wait to go back to try the Ollie cakes.
