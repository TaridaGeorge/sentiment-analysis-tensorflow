I will absolutely return - I had been meaning to check out St. Francis for a while now. The server was very helpful in navigating and suggesting items on the menu and the wine list. The goat cheese appetizer was lovely... main meal was delightful and the local dessert was heaven. The noise in the busy restaurant wasn't too loud, so I was able to carry on a conversation with my date. Just like I mentioned in my opening - I will absolutely return, what a great find on Camelback!
