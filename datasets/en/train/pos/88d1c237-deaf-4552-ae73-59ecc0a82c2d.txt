Taggia deserves mad props. Tucked into the Firesky Resort, this is a great place to grab a business lunch or casual date without all the public hoopla of other Scottsdale restaurants. On every visit, service has been top notch! They take their time, but are always present, and everyone from the bus-boy to the waiter has a sense of humor and comfortable personality. 

On one occasion, my coworkers and I split a salad and pizza while pitter-pattering away on our laptops. The other, we enjoyed the burger. It's nice of them to let us use their outlets, and set-up camp for an hour while we get away from the office for some fresh food and fresh air! 

Prices at lunch are reasonable, and it was calm enough for us to talk business without worrying about who's around.
