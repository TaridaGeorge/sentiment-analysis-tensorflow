My brother and I had a great experience here last Wednesday while traveling in Phoenix.  Stopped by to take advantage of the free wifi, breakfast, and hot drinks.  I ordered the Tomato / Tom-ato egg sandwich (great vegetarian option with greens & protein) along with a cup of hot chai, and both were very tasty.  Comfortable atmosphere and seating, friendly service, clean facility, wifi worked great, no complaints!!  As an added bonus, our server handed out free baseball tickets to the D-backs / Pirates on a day when we actually could make the time to go!!! (How often does that happen??)
