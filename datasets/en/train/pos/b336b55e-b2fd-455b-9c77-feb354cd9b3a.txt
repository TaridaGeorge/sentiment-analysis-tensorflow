I was at Jam's Picket Fences event and Caroline from Boho Farm and Home was were.  She had homemade jams, fresh eggs, etc.  It was cool!  I got a jar of the raspberry rose jam.  My hubby LOVES it!  Caroline mentioned to check out her website too (www.BohoFarmandHome.com).  She participates at different events.  She offers tours by appointment only:  info@bohofarmandhome.com.
