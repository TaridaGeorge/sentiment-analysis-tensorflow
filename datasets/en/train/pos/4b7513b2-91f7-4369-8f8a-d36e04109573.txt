First visit recently and I thought highly of it...

Pro's
- value.   For the lunch price and what you get, it's a great value!! (that's what earned the 5th star)
- quality of food I felt was very good.  Had twice cooked pork and veggies and the pork were all good 
- several people waited on me; good, friendly service. 

Cons'
- it is a little dark inside.  

There are several options for this cuisine; I'll come back....
