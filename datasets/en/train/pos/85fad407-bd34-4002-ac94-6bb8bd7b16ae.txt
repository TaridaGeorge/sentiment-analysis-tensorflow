Another great spot that has not been reviewed!  Inconceivable!

Armitage is up in DC Ranch near Baroque and Eddie V's.  They are open every day from late afternoon to late night.  It's a great spot to enjoy a (or several) glass of wine with your honey or good friends.  Lots of comfy sofas to sink into and they also have a patio which is really nice at night.  If you are going with a group, you'll want to reserve one of those sofas as they are snagged pretty early.

The staff are not snooty wine snobs at all.  In fact Armitage is a great spot to learn about wine...if you are a wine snob it's a great place to try new wines.  They have a great selection of flights, frequent wine tasting events, and a small but respectable dinner/nibbly menu.
