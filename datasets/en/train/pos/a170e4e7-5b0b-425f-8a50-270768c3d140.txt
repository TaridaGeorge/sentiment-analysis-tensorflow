Dr. Loo has been my primary care doctor since moving to the valley.  He came highly recommended by a coworker.  His easy direct manner and interest in the whole picture of what is going on in your life set him apart from other doctors I have seen.

The office runs seamlessly which is a big plus in my experience.  I have actually changed doctors in the past because the front office and staff is difficult to deal with.
