This is by far my favorite coffee shop in all the land!!! Great coffee, great philosophy and great barista's!!! We buy our beans exclusively from them. Locally owed with fair trade organic coffee...can't get any better.  Honey nut latte is a favorite. Great food as well!  I'm so happy Bunna is here to stay!!!
