This place rocks. If I wasn't on a temporary, self-imposed rehab binge, I would be here every night. Especially Friday. 

I walked into the bar and they have Star Trek mannequins. Um... hells ya! 

I walked up to the bar and ordered myself a $1 alien slime shot (Hard core vodka jello shot with 7-up) and got MESSED UP. 

I walked into the bathroom and guess what - they are unisex! 

I walked back to the bar and ordered myself another $1 alien slime shot whilst I was serenaded by the amazingly gay lounge duo. 

And most importantly, I found out that I too was gay. The lovely lady lounge singer used her gaydar machine and that thing practically blew up. 

Sorry Dally. 

There is nothing wrong with this bar.
