Tony's.  I'm salivating just thinking about the place.  I'm a gourmet chef and so I can be picky about my ingredients. When I want Pancetta or Prosciutto I get it from Tony's.   He slices it to whatever thickness I need.  And when Mama looks at me with that twinkle in her eye and says, "I made fresh cannoli..." I can't resist. Nestled back in one of the frozen food cases is the most wonderful pasta sauce; I keep some on hand for a quick meal.

And it's not just the food items. Walking in to Tony's takes me back to the days when I lived and worked all over Europe and bought many a meal in little shops just like it.
