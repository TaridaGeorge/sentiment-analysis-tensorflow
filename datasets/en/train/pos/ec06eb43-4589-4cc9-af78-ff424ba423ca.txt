I've eaten here 3 times now and each and every time I have had a wonderful experience.  The presentations are artful and the food is simply delicious.  The daily lunch crowd adds to the warm and lively atmosphere in this small but comfortable downtown eatery.  I highly recommend it and can't wait to go back again.  I'm still having red curry flashbacks!  Uhm, uhm, uhmmmm.
