One word... AMAZING! Read a few reviews, craving Cuban and close to home we took a shot at Mimitas for lunch. Sat outside and had service within a minute, beers in hand within three. Ordered the house Cuban sandwich, wife ordered the pulled pork and grilled onions.  I make it a tradition when visiting NY to eat at Cuban cafes, hard to believe there's one in my back yard that's better. Five stars on service, portion size, quality and price. Do yourself a favor and make a visit, you'll thank me for it!
