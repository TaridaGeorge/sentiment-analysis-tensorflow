Had so much fun there for our son's birthday in July. Phoenix feels like a mini city coming from San Diego. We had a view of the airplanes coming in from the west and could see the city wake-up to the morning. The kids liked seeing into the highrise office buildings nearby, too.  Room service was so fun with a suprise birthday candle in the cake! There is a "suspended" pool on the 4th floor that we looked down on and we saw all the furniture blow into the pool when a huge windstorm kicked up. Walking distance to a mall with some decent restaurants if you don't want to dine-in. You CANNOT beat the beds. They are a special brand for these hotels and they are THE selling point for my husband when weighing out the cost of the room!! Very good experience!
