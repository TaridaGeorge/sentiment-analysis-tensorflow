This is an awesome hidden gem! I've worked right down the street for 10 years but never knew about this place until my uncle recently told me about it. I had the philly cheese steak with peppers and sauce and it was amazing ... and huge! I could only eat half. Great prices for so much delicious food! This is a great little family owned place that has been there for 34 years!!! (They had a big sign stating they just celebrated 34 years on 4/1/11)  It is a cash only restaurant, so make sure you stop at the ATM first. The chef's daughter offered me a sample of the chicken salad her dad makes there daily. It is amazing! They sell over 100 pounds of this a week! Just a really neat place, friendly people, and amazing food! I will definitely be back!
