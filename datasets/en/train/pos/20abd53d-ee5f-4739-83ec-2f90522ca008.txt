I love this place.  I regularly go to Tott's for lunch with a group of friends.  The service is always great.  The manager is extremely friendly.  The food is fabulous as well, with huge portions.  I typically order from the kid's menu and that is just the right size for a reasonable lunch - and I can't beat the price.  It usually comes out to around $4 plus a tip. Most of the time the food is ready as I get to the table or only a few moments later.
