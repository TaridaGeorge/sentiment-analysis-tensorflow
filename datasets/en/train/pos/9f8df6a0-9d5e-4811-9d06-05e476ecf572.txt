WOW, what an amazing resort. The grounds are kept in perfect pristine shape and everyone that works there is professional and very polite.  From the 25million dollars in artwork to the stunning views that the Phoenician offers, I dint think there is a better resort in the entire state of Arizona.  If you are coming to Arizona for a relaxing time I couldn't explain how wonderful the 9 (that's right 9) pools that the Phoenician has are.... including the 1 million dollar Mother of Pearl pool.  They have everything you could possible want or imagine right at your fingertips.  If you would like a massage ... DONE.... some horseback riding..... DONE..... how about Rose Petal turn down for your room....DONE..
