Best gyro I have ever had.  I prefer the chicken gyro but the beef one is good too.  The seasoning on the meat is amazing and the Tzatziki just makes it even better.  I could eat here every day.  Price is pretty reasonable too ($5.99 for gyro and fries) and you can sub fries out for a salad for just an extra dollar.

I think they raised the price a little - from $5.99 to $6.25.  Hmmm.... Interesting.  Also, on a side note, why is this place always packed with cops at lunch?  I guess people will either feel very safe here OR very uneasy.
