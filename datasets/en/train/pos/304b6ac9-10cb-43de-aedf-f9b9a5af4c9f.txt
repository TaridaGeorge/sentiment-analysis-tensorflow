Lovingly prepared Japanese "appetizers".     There are two similar Izakayas in the Denver/Boulder region so we had something to compare to.     The menu at Nobuo is smaller, but we were impressed by the server and chef taking time to explain the foods and flavors, and you could tell they took pride in getting things just right.    Exotic and delicious food, with service to match.
