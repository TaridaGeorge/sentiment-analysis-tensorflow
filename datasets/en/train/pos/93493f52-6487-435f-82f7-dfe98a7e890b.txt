All the things I tried had names I couldnt pronounce or understand but it was all great. Very very spicy but delicious. My eyes were tearing up, my nose running, my throat and mouth on fire and yet I kept on eating because it was just so good. 

Service was excellent, Mike, the hispanic/asian guy needs a raise. I found out that the glass dragon everyone talks about consists of hundreds of individual pieces that all had to be hanged individually and took weeks to put together.

A little known secret: Try the avocado ice cream. Yes I know it sounds gross, dont be a wuss and just try it, its very good. I even bought a quart to take home.
