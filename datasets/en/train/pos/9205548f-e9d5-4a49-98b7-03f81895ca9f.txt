For the value and quality of the food, this place has to get 5 stars.   It isn't a high end place, but the 10+ times I have been there, the food has been excellent.  Salads are big, pizza is crunchy and chewy, and the sandwiches are great.  Even the pastas are excellent.  The service isn't particularly fast, but for pizza by the slice, I think this is the best I have had in the Valley.
