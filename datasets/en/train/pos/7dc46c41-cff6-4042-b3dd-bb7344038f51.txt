My friends and I agreed that this was the best gallery we saw on this particular First Friday in Phoenix. Located conveniently next to Modified Arts, an attractive low-ceiling space showcased some of the more "advanced", "mature", and "developed" art were the words we came up with. A smaller room, opened up to a much large space to the left and at the time there was a small installation in the backroom that was interactive and impressive. Definitely a sophisticated gallery in a fantastic location, highly recommended.
