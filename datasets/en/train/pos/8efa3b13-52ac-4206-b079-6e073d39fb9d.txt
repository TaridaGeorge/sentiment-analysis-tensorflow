The sandwiches here are fresh, tasty and cheap. The Baguettes are made on site and you notice it. The sliced peppers in the sandwiches are a bit spicy, but that makes them better in my opinion.

This is a place for a quick bit. It feels a bit industrial, noisy and busy. However, they seem to be very efficient and the restaurant is extremely clean. 

It is cash only, but that shouldn't be a problem since the prices are so cheap.

Also try the spring rolls, mniam mniam!
