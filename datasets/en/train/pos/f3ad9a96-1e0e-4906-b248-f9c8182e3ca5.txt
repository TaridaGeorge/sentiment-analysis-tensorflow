Love this place! Which is hard for me to say of most of the vegan/vegetarian restaurants my mom has dragged me into.

The sizzling rice soup is my favorite! I can't believe how amazing it tastes being vegan and how good it make you feel.

We always get the summer rolls, sweet and sour pork, and the lemon grass chicken.

I haven't been since it changed names but before service was always a little weird. The guy servers there seem like they are so aloof.

It's always really clean and the bathrooms are nice too.
