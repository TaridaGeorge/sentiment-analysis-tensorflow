My favorite yogurt place in the valley- and trust me, I've tried just about all of them.  I don't know why, but Yogurtology always tastes the freshest and least aftificial to me.  I love that they have so many delicious flavors and toppings as well- and never scoff at you when you want to try every flavor! ;)
