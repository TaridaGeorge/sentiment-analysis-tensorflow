This is a sweet place, and unexpected in the desert. I have been here in the past for paddle boating on the lake, concerts in the park and a few runs. This past weekend I ran the Frank Kush 5K - lots of people and their dogs, good weather and a nice gathering spot. The area has many portable bathrooms, picnic tables and even a baseball field. When someone from out of state visits, I often try to bring them here - especially if there is an event being held.
