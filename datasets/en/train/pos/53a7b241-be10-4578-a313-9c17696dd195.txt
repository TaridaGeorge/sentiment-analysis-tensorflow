This is the one late night place you can count on; ask for the comfy corner table...what a great assortment of bruschetta, from Proscuitto/figs to Tomato/mozzarella.  Add a $20 bottle of MountainView Chard and you'll just want to keep coming back.  The outdoor fireplace gathers a quick crowd, though, so get in early or late :)
