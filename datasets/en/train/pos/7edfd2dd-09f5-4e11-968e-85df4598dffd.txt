This place is awesome! Mesa's downtown is becoming more and more engaging and unique amongst Phoenix's surrounding cities and if you're along this strip for the 2nd Friday art walk or visiting any of the other unique and interesting stores in downtown Mesa be sure to make Lo-Fi THE place to stop in and take a quick break. You'll most likely be served by the owner himself (or a barista under the owners watchful eye) and he is just an awesome dude. Support your local businesses and help grow the AZ economy! 

They are always whipping up a new latest and greatest batch of home-made vegan delicacies and even if you're not into coffee they have a wide range of other drinks and pastries to make the visit well worth it. I stop in every 2nd Friday Art walk I attend and try something new and it's always delicious!
