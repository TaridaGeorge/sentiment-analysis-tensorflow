I {heart} QT!!!! Yes, I'm a nerd for loving a gas station...

Forget Circle K, 7-11, Mobil, and the rest of them. QT is like the SW Airlines of gas station convenience stores...fast, efficient, and friendly!

Competitive gas prices, lots of beverage & snack choices, grab n' go sandwiches, and most importantly they have clean restrooms! 

They are so fast, that they have already rung up 3 other customers standing behind you by the time you get your change back into your wallet! Holy gas station sandwich, that's REALLY FAST!!!
