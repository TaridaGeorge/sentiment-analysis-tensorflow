I took my son here to get his hair cut. I have had my sons hair left long since he was a baby. He looks like a little surfer. So getting his locks cut always makes me nervous. Maybe it's just me.(your saying yes aren't you?) I have to say that this salon was very nice. It didn't have that overpowering chemical smell that other places have and it was decorated with warm colors. Friendly receptionists and clean. I made the appointment with Amanda and she had everything already set up for my 8 year old. Booster seat and all! She was really sweet and was asking him about what he did for Thanksgiving. She listened when he told her how he wanted his hair and would give the look asking for approval. His hair turned out great! He was a happy customer! Will be back again.
