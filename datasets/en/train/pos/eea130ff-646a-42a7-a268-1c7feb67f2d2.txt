i ordered the reuben sandwich on rye.  it was a great sandwich.  i also ordered some chips and a fountain drink with a side of potato salad.  all the food tasted great!

i went here for lunch and the parking lot was madness.  the line to even place your order was crazy.  bring some patience because it's worth the wait!
