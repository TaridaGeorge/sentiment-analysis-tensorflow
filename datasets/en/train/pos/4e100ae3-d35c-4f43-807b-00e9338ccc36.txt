I'm originally from Kansas City so when I found this BBQ restaurant in the heart of Oldtown Scottsdale I was a little skeptical...To my pleasant surprise, Big Earl's became my new favorite BBQ joint!  The beef ribs fall off the bone and have a smokey flavor that your dogs will knaw off your fingertips when you get home!!  The pork ribs are just as good, slightly sweeter.  I didn't care for the crisp coleslaw, I prefer creamy but the ingredients are fresh.  
The chef came out and introduced himself.  He was super friendly and easy to talk to.  He even made fresh baked cookies for us to try.  
I will DEFINITELY be frequenting this restaurant again, not only for the amazing, moist BBQ, but also for the ambiance and friendly staff.
