I think the first thing one should talk about when reviewing a coffee place is the coffee which is FANTASTIC here. I decided recently never to visit Starbucks again (not if I am expecting good tasting, non-burnt coffee anyway!) and try to find a local place. This place is on my way to work and WELL worth the 10 minutes out of my way to stop and end up with a little taste of heaven to get me the rest of the way to work.

Cute location, welcoming seating area, and friendly staff round out the mix. I recommend this place to all my friends.
