Had lunch with friends and of course we were not disappointed. WCG is consistently good. Service and food terrific. We all has the Filet Mignon Chopped Salad. Yumm!!!!  I highly recommend WCG to everyone anytime!
Another one of my fav's is the Maytag Burger...absolutely delicious!

Go Visit White Chocolate Grill...you will NOT be disappointed...!

Tell them Van sent you!
