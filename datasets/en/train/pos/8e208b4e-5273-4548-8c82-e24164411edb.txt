Let it be known: I love Decio Pasta and you will too.  The first time I picked up a pack was at the Phoenix Public Market a couple of years ago and I've constantly been returning for more.  Follow the instructions on the package to the minute; you may doubt the times, but if you ignore them, the pasta will become mush.    As long as you adhere to the directions, this stuff is heavenly.

Spinach Basil Garlic Fettuccine?  Saffron Linguine?  You can't go wrong here.  Toss with olive oil and perhaps a mild cheese, and you're golden.
