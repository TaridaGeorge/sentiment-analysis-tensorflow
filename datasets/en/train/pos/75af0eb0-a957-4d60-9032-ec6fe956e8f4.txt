I am sooooooo glad there is an awesome asian market here in AZ. I was searching for something like this when I moved here from Oregon. I was searching for this specific chili oil sauce that I couldn't find anywhere in the northwest...and long behold it was here :-).......anywho this place has a lot of variety of asian food...even indian food. Cheap prices as well for everything. I highly reccomend this place...plus the meat and poultry is cheap here peeps! (and no don't be afraid what meat is sold...it is legit). 

Also there is a threading lady who does eyebrows, lips, and other facial hair stuff for women.....this Indian lady is very good and tried it on my gf. Cheap price for what she does. She has a webpage as well www.bridalbydeena.com  so ladies try it out while you shop here.

G approved!
