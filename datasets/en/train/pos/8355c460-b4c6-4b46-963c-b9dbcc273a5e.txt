Ate here about a month ago for breakfast....delicious!  The decor of the place is very nice and modern...simple and clean.  The food was amazing.  I don't even know what my boyfriend ate, I was too in love with the breakfast grilled cheese.  Which was so good I tried to make one at home the next morning and failed miserably.  Can't wait to take my parents here when they come to town!
