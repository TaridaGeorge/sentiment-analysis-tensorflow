My wife and I went out to dinner at Brios with my parents on Thusrday night and every one of us was very happy with our meals. The presentation and atmospher was equal to or better than any "5 star" rated restaurant in the valley. This was our thisrd time there and as usual the night out , the service and the food were supberb. It's always fun to go out to the Kierland area and this night was no exception. Great Italian/ Continental at reasonable prices. Try it you will love it!
