This group is awesome.

Always funny, not for the faint of heart. If you dont like off color, political, raunchy, ridiculous, awesomely funny shows dont go see them. But know that youre missing out.

Have a drink and dinner at Paisley Violin next door and then venture over to Soul Invictus for the show.
