If your a NY/NJ transplant to Phoenix and miss the Italian Bakery & Deli that you took for granted in your old neighborhood then rest assured because Romanelli's will make you feel like your back home.

Great cold cuts and subs.  Everything high quality.  Amazing homemade Italian sausage.  You got your Polly-O cheeses like back east and Wise potatoe chips and cheese doodles.  

Everyone mentions the Canolli and it deserves it.  I am not sure its the best I have ever had but its up there and they will get you fresh ones upon request with no hassle.  

Everything is fresh and everything is delicious and for a NY/NJ transplant it is a refreshing spot when feeling a little homesick!  

They even got great freshly baked Italian cookies and breads.  

Thank God for Romanelli's!!!
