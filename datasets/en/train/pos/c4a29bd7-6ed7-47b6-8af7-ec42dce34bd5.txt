Love Baker's Nursery!  I bought some rosebushes from them last year, and they are doing really well.  

I just went there yesterday for a free talk on the care and pruning of roses.  They had gift certificates taped under some chairs, and I won a free 5 gallon rosebush!  

The staff is very knowledgeable, and their selection of plants is excellent!  So much better than Lowe's or Home Depot.
