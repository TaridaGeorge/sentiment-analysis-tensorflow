Finalmente!  

I'm not what you'd call a "great cook" or a "good cook" by any stretch of the imagination.  I make two things very well; cereal and reservations.  Like a superhero swooping out of the UK, F & E has saved the day... and my living situation.  Sure there's a lot of great take-out places nearby (Rubio's, Pei Wei, Chipotle, etc) and there's huge grocery stores down the street.  But none of these offer what F & E does.  Small, manageable, cheap, quick, and sized for one.  

If my wife and I don't feel like cooking or going out or ordering delivery, we walk over to Fresh and Easy pick out a few of their single-serving, fresh, delicious, never-frozen, scrumptious pre-packaged dinners.
