Wow, these guys were great!!!! I had a few minutes to kill waiting for a restaurant to open and remembered driving by many times. Pulled up to the automatic cleaner and the guy started spraying the front of my car, so I rolled up my windows and they continued all the way around, rinsing and scrubbing. When they were done, I paid the guy $7 for a average a little above basic wash and went into the machine. When I got out, 2 guys were there and dried the rest of the car and used an air pressure thing to get the water out of the little crevasses they get into and leave water marks. They did an excellent job and will continue to go there when in the area.
