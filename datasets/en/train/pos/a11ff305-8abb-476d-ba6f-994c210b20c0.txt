Best hummus on the planet. 

My favorite restaurant of all time.

The chicken pasta salad and the chicken combo platters are my favorites.

They catered my wedding almost 7 years ago and recently catered a bridal shower I hosted for a friend.

I've been to the Tempe, Scottsdale, Arcadia and Desert Ridge locations. All of them are awesome!
