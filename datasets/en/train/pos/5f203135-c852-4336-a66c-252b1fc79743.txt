For toasted subs, do not, I repeat, DO NOT go to Quizno's! Come to the Cheeb instead, where your hummus gets toasty, your eggplant crispy, and your chicken salad stays nice and cool. Some favorites (besides the aforementioned) include the pastrami, loaded with pepperoncinis, the meatball (of course), and the mushroom. Everyone is super-cool, and they don't even bat an eyelash if you want marinara AND mayo. Thank you, Cheba Hut, for your acceptance!
