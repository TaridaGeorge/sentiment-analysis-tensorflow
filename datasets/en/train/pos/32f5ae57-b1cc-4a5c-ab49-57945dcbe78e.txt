It has been more than 1 year I have not been in Sushi Ken, but I still remember the taste of salmon Kama. It was like my home. This place is amazing. Owners are nice and so hardworking. I will be back one day and will say hajimemashite :)

PS. People who give one or two stars to this place please get california roll from safeway and continue to think that japanese cuisine is only california roll
