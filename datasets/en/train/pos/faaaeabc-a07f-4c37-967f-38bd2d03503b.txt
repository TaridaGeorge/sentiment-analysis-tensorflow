This is a gift to Scottsdale. As small as it is I was surprised at how much character it musters. The atmosphere, staff and food are all enchanting. I suggest sitting at the bar facing the chefs so you can watch their every move. My pork shank was decedent as were the leeks.  The menu is constantly changing and features locally sourced organic ingredients. Bonus Tip: If you're waiting on a seat, Kazimierz is right next door for a quick glass of wine.
