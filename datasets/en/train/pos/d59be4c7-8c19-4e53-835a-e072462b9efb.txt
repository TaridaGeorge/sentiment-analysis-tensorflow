Target Greatland - Desert Ridge.  You ROCK.  That's all there is to it. 

You're clean.
You're gigantic.  
You're casual, yet stylish.
You always have what I need. 
The thought of seeing you at the end of the day keeps me going. 
Your items sometimes make me laugh. 
You're a cheap date.

You're everything I ever wanted in a....discount department store.

For a minute there I forgot what I was writing about.  Damn.  

You have probably the biggest selection of housewares (and everything else too) of any other Target in the Valley - even better than the ghetto-ass Target I go to.  I just wish you were closer....

If you could just let me through your check-out gauntlet without spending a minimum $100, I'd LUV you even more.
