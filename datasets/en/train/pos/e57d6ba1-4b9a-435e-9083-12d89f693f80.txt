One of my favorite places to go for lunch! The food is great (greek salad, hummus, tzatziki, veggie pita pizza, spinach feta roll ups), the staff is friendly and the wait time on the food is never bad. Decently priced for what you get. Get a reusable Zoes cup for soft drinks, etc. if you plan to go here often!
