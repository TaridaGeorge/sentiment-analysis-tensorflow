Burgers are fantastic, service is friendly, vibe is just right - hip and mellow. But the best thing about this place is that you must have been taken there by a local, because it would never in a million years occur to a tourist to 1) visit this obscure location and 2) go through the humble, mysterious doorway. There is consequently an immediate "very local" feel to the place that I think really adds to a restaurant's appeal.
