I have been to this restaurant 3 times in the last 3 months.  I cannot emphasize how great the food, atmosphere, serving staff, and owner are.  The salad is fresh.  The meat is regularly tender.  The sandwiches unique and delicious.  Even the dessert crepes (you get 2 with one order) are devine.

It is a welcome change from the chain restaurants all over the area.
