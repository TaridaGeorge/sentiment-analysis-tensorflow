I go for the HOMEMADE root beer. I grew up on chili dogs and A & W root beer floats. These take me back to summertime in Illinois. Free refills on the root beer makes it a meal in itself. The husband loves the oversize baked potato with the salt rub eats the entire potato, stuffed with BBQ, cheese and sour cream. Our friends had a resort wedding and the best part was the rehearsal dinner at Joes!
