Um, hello, this place has been open for over 60 years.  On that fact  alone they receive 5 stars from me.

Do they have some magic type of fryers that no one else in the world has? I think so because I honestly couldn't tell my meal was fried at all. 

I had the fish, shrimp, and chips combo and every item was crispy, light, and as ungreasy as fried food can get.  

The interior is old and outdated for sure and it's totally in the "hood" but who cares.  Darn good fish and chips IMHO.  

---PS, they have one of those pump thingies of ranch on their condiment bar so even if you don't like your meal just cover it in good old American ranch dressing.     Ranch makes everything better!
