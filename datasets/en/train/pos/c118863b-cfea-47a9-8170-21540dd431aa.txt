Let me start off by saying that this 5 star rating is based on their reverse happy hour and that alone. Monday thru Saturday they feature a reverse happy hour from 10p to close. They have drinks for under $5 and sushi rolls for under $6! They have a few other things on the menu like their potstickers, etc... and the food is really yummy! The highlight of the night was enjoying drinks and food for under $15. This is only available in the bar area but I highly suggest everyone check this out.
