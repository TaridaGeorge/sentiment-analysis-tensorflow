What a concept!!  The yogurt is better that most of the other yogurt shops I've tried.  They keep the place super clean. When think about the number of kids and folks that show up there, it's amazing they can keep it clean at all.  They have staff whose job it is to just keep cleanning... constantly. This place is always crowded (check the weekends some time) and for good reason.  Gotta watch how much you pump into your cup because it will fill you if you overfilled the cup.  They do a real nice job of keeping the topping fresh, interesting and abundant.
