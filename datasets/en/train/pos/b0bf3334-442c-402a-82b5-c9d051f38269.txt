Incredible. On a Friday night with no reservation, they accommodated my wife and I. The food was just exquisite. I had oysters, and my wife had the crab cake. She said it was the best crab cake she has ever had. For the main I had the Chilean Sea Bass in a lemon-white wine broth that just melted in your mouth. My wife had the Georges Banks Scallops, and she said were very good. The BEST though, was the side dish that the waitress recommended with my sea bass - sugar snap pees. I never would have thought to order this, but she highly recommended. Both my wife and I thought this side dish was amazing. Prepared in butter, and served crisp, these had a really nice spice that kicked in very subtle. Overall excellent, and would go back anytime.
