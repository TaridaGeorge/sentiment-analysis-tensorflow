We have been shopping this Bashas since it opened, and it is probably my favorite of the grocers around here. The people are very helpful and friendly. They by FAR have the best meat around and have butchers on hand to get you exactly what you want! The produce is fresh and fairly priced and they have the BEST bread, rolls and donuts of ANY grocer in the valley. I have never had a bad experience here!
