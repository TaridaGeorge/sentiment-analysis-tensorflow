After visiting with some friends in Tempe, myself and Emily R. decided to stop for a quick nitecap. Very cool place. The DJ's were jamming, the bartenders were friendly, and everyone seemed to know everyone. Plus it's 20% off on Sunday's nights so that makes it even better. Even so, it really is a cool, laid back kind of place where you can grab a drink, catch up with friends, or even a cool place for a first date. I will definitely be back here soon.
