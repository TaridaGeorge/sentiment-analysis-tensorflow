If you have no other reason than a soda machine to go -- than, so be it.

This machine has everything. If you press a button, more options magically appear. Probably no less than 75 options? I don't know.

None the less, Five Guys is Five Guys and you can guess what is hear based on the previous reviews. However, the best seat in the house is by the soda machine and seeing everyone's reactions to it.

Every option imaginable and than some.
