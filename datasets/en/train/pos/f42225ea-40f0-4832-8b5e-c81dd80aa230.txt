In a word.......FANTASTIC!
I went in for what I thought was going to be an EXPENSIVE fix and was delighted to find that less than $30.00 (YES, THIRTY DOLLARS) later i am back on the road and the fender is looking fine!!!

The coolest part was that the owners father was out in the shop, under my car looking and giving advice!   I want to be that engaged at 86 years of age.  An honest family owned business that is true to their word.  I am certainly glad I grabbed the card I saw at IMM.
