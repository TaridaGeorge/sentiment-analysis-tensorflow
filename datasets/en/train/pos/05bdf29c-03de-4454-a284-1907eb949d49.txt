Family operated.. everything is fresh. It seriously does not get any better than this place! Some of my personal faves include the Butterscotch scone, Chicken Pesto sandwich on croissant, and of course, the infamous Scotch Kiss latte. Enjoy it on the relaxing patio with friendly neighborly folks, surrounded by beautiful, quintessential atmosphere of a small town farm. You will fall in love!!
