I could easily eat here every day and not get bored.The robata grilled meat and veggies are generally spectacular. Yuzu miso-marinated black cod, grilled scallops with shiso and wasabi, burnt tomato salad with soy dashi, baked green tea custard with caramelized banana and vanilla - presented with artistic flair and lip smackingly brilliant. I cannot rave about it enough basically. Go, you won't be disappointed.
