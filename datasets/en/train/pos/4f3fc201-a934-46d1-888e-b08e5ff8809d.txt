This is ice cream at its best! Tried Sweet Republic last week for the first time and it definitely lived up to the hype. Everything here is homemade, they support local diary farmers, and best of all, no artificial ingredients or preservatives! They rotate their flavors and offer 24 selections daily. 

It's a little pricey at $2.95 for a single scoop, but when you think about the quality of ingredients it's worth the extra cash. The sundaes look amazing and run around $7 (but include 2-3 scoops). I went with the Real Mint Chip, after being warned that it tasted unlike other "mint-flavored" ice-creams. The real mint flavor is fantastic, and the creamy texture did not disappoint. 

The store is located in a strip mall off the busy Shea/101 corridor near the Scottsdale Healthcare-Shea center. A little tricky to find, but the parking is easy.
