The best dentist I have ever been to by far.  The pricing is very fair, and they have worked with my insurance changes.  Dr. Erskine is very honest, and very personable, he doesn't talk to down to you, and he never tries to push dental work or procedures that you don't need.  The first time I came here, it had been about 4 years since I had seen a dentist, and it was a great experience.  He said that all I needed was a deep clean since it had been so long, and didn't try and push anything extra on me (expensive mouthwash, extra charge for deep cleaning, etc.). Both hygienists that I have seen have also been great, and I have never had my mouth feel so clean after a dentist visit.
