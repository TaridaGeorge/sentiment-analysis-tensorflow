By far, THE BEST HAWAIIAN BBQ. I would make the far drive from tucson for this place. Everything made and cooked perfectly. Perfectly seasoned. Great prices. The best thing of all, that sets this place from the rest......MACARONI SALAD. What's in there? Macaroni. Why its so good? IDK it just is. TRY IT!!!!

My order: Half and half kalbi and chicken katsu plus an order of spam musubi.
