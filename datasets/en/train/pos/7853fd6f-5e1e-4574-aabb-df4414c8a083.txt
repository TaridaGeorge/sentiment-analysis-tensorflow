Excellent Vegitation
I drive all the way from Chandler to this nursery because they have quality vegetation and excellent customer service.  The quality of plants, long term from Bakers, are healthier, grow stronger and last forever.  The staff is friendly, calm and very caring about plants, people and their cats on the premises.  I like to support small businesses who still provide great customer service.  Makes sense to spend your money where you receive the value on it's return.
