Another GREAT Boba spot that has Soy Milk!

The decor is really sweet... graffiti style walls and contemporary seating.  Their drinks are large and very good.  I had their Red Bean Milk Tea w/ Soy Milk and Boba.... mmmmmmm.  They used real red beans (another boba spot in the e.valley uses like ground red beans.. not as good).  They offer a lot of other goodies, but I'm a boba fiend and can never fathom getting anything else.  $3.50 for a 20oz milk tea, no extra charge for the soy... nice.
