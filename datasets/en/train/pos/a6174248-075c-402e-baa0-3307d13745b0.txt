I feel a little silly reviewing Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  I mean, everyone already KNOWS about Bed, Bath, and Beyond.  But I've had such good experiences here that I feel like I owe it to the store to give them a shout out on yelp.  The people who work at this location are the most helpful people I've ever encountered at a big box store.  They will walk the aisles with you, helping you search for an item.  And if it's not there, they will find it in the computer.  And make helpful suggestions.  And offer to take it to your car.  Thank you, B,B,&B, for making my errand-running so much more pleasant!
