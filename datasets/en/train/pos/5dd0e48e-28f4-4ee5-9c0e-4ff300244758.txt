Just tried Tomo for the first time this weekend, and i LOVED it. I would not have expected such a cute little place in the little strip mall location but it was awesome. Way better than Nakama, which is in the same area. Amanda was my server and she was very sweet and attentive. Let me tell you it can be hard to find good service anymore, but she was great! I don't normally eat sushi a lot but I really liked it here. They have a happy hour everyday I think and the specials are really good. I had one of the specialty martinis and it was nice and strong! Also the bartender made me a black cherry mojito which was delicious. I recommend this to everyone looking for good sushi in the area and will definitely be back again!
