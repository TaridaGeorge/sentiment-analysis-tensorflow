What a great new concept!  I love how you can create your own sushi roll.  You start by selecting brown or white rice, seaweed or soy paper then veggies, meat/fish and top it with your choice of sauce(s).  If you aren't creative they have some menu items already created for you.  And, to also note, if you aren't a fish fan, they have chicken and beef as well.  Each roll comes with 10 pieces, so portions are big.  The food is fresh and it was a blast to create my own roll. I will definitely go back!!!  Well done!
