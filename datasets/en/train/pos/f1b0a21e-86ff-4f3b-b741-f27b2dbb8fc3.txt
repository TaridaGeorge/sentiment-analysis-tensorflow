I came here for a networking event with the Tempe Chamber and this place blew me away, just pulling in and knowing they are that close to In N' Out, j/k. Really though, walking in the door and the talent at the front door was very nice and the layout was great, no wasted space. Very clean, everyone was very helpfull. We got to check out a few rooms and talked price with the GM and Wow, thinking I should put my girlfriends mother there to stay, j/k. Their meeting room seemed to be top of the line, loved all the extras that we got to see, would definately recommend this place to anyone that comes in town. Nice central part of town.
