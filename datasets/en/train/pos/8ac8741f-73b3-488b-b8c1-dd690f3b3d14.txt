I was in Phoenix for business and wanting to relax so I came here because it was close to my hotel. I am a stickler about mani-pedis to the point where I don't get them anymore but had no choice since my nails looked tragic. It was totally empty and the women that did my nails were amazing! Paid very close attention to detail and couldn't be happier. My only complaint would be that their polish colors aren't the best but I found some good OPI I liked.
