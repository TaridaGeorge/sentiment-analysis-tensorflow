I have been going to Megan for the past year to get my eyebrows done and she always does an amazing job. I often get compliments on my eyebrows and even get stopped by people asking me who does my eyebrows. She is by far the best Eyebrow artist that i have been to in Arizona and I have gone to a lot of places! She is very detailed, professional, and knows exactly what she is doing. I highly recommend her, you will be happy you went to her.
