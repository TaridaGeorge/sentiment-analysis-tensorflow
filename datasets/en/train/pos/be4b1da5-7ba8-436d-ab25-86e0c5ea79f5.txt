I love Native New Yorker!  I frequent the Gilbert and Germann location usually.  Bartender Angela and server Victoria are my favorites :)  The wing specials on Tuesday and Thurday paired with a nice cold beer, make going out to eat super cheap and enjoyable.  I love the variety of sauces they offer for the wings also.  Friday nights are karaoke and that is a blast!
