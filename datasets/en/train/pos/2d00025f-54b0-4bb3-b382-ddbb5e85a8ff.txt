I can only say that anyone not giving this place high ratings is obviously NOT from NY.  This is the real deal.

I drive all the way from north central to get a pie.

For anyone who wants a true 'back home' experience, get the pizza!!
I can't comment on the other items because I can't stop ordering the pizza.

It's true that the girl behind the counter isn't always the friendliest - but hey, that's just like NY too.
