Places like Sweet Pea are exactly why I love living downwtown. Tracy's review says it all. 

My visiting brother and I stopped by here today and picked up some cupcakes for Mom, after enjoying a coffee at the Royal Coffee Bar. I forget all the ingredients that went into them other than chocolate, and pomegranate seeds. Weird! But yummy!
