It has been over 2 months since I purchased tires for my Nissan Versa and I've been telling everyone how amazing the customer service was/is!! Time to write about it and post it!  Coming from S. CA, I was shocked to be treated so well..but this was exceptional.  Had an appt via the website, service rep met me in the parking lot...asked if I wanted water...made good recommendation for tires, took the car in the shop, put the new tires on and I was out the door in 45 mins! Amazing. This is the place to go for tires!  Good work Discount Tires, mgt must treat their employees with respect and trust...Great mgt at this store in particular!  I'll be back and keep recommending!
