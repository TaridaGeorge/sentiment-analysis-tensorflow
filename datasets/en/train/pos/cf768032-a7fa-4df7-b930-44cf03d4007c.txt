LOVED this place! The happy hour is phenomenal. My girlfriend and I had each had 2 drinks, so 4 drinks total, and the chips and salsa with the extra crab dip, and one plate each for $30! It's hard to get 4 drinks for that cheap let alone an appetizer and dinner for two. Our waiter was super nice and helpful. It wasn't that busy somehow! There were only about 3 tables in their whole dining area. 

I'm definitely making this my new happy hour place. The Sangria was amazing! A lot of people on Yelp recommended the Blood Orange Mojito, which I ordered to start, but my friend's Raspberry Mojito was much better. For dinner I had the Monster Quesadilla with Tilapia and it was really good and there was enough for leftovers!
