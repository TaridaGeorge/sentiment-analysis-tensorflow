I love Bookman's long time.  You really have to limit yourself to a few sections or it's sensory overload in this huge used bookstore. This location really has it all. From weird boardgames, magazines, CD, DVD, knick knacks, electronics, and oh yes books. My only complaint is this location doesn't have a coffee bar like the Flagstaff store does.
