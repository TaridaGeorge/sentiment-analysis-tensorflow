I love that there's a farmer's market on Shea! It's a relatively small farmer's market, but it's new so that's to be expected. They had a nice variety of vendors (fresh fruits and veggies, prepared food, preserved/jarred items, jewelry, live music, and more). I bought some delicious salsa, pomodoro sauce, orange blossom honey and made an amazing fresh bruscetta with local tomatoes and basil. Can't wait to go back!
