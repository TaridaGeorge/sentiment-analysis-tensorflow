Once upon a time, in a city far, far from Cranberry Twp, two special little elfs stirred up flour and sugar and tons of chocolate together, (actually it was childhood friends Eileen Spitalny & David Karvetz) and founded Fairytale Brownies way back in 1992.  Since that day, many diet rules have been broken and many pounds have been gained.  The pecan brownies and pecan blondie's are to die for.  And the best (or is it the worst?) part is, you can order these things on-line!  Isn't that great??? I will never have to bake, again!!
