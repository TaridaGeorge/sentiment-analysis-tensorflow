There's now a bar we can WALK to any night of the week!

We were greeted warmly when we walked in, and were treated well until we left.  The lighting is fantastic, the furniture oh-so-cool, and the location (upstairs in a brick building) certainly helps the vibe.

I had a chocolate stout and a glass of red wine, my husband had a Czech pilsner and an MGD...no disappointments there.  Everything was really reasonably priced, too.

Hmmm...First Friday, anyone?
