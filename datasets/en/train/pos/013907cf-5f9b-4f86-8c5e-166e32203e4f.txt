Absolutely LOVE IMX. Not only a wonderful studio with great equipment, but truly amazing staff. The instructors are always friendly and helpful in tailoring the workout to each person's needs. The owner and instructor, Melissa, is very welcoming and knows everyone by name - plus a GREAT pilates instructor. I've had memberships at numerous reformer studios in AZ and this is by far the best. All the instructors make their sessions fun and enjoyable - at atmosphere that shows in the clients and staff alike.
