Favorite wine bar by far! More for the food of course. Bruchetta....is the best you will ever find. It's more of a french bread with toppings. Not super crunchy...a tad chewy. The prosciutto, cheese and fig is my favorite. This is a wonderful date spot and is perfectly lit for a romantic evening. Maybe a tad loud and the wait may be long, but worth it!!! Check this place out. There is one being built on Gilbert Rd in Old Town Gilbert so no more long drives to my favorite spot!!!
