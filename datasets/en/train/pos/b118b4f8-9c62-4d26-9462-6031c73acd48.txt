I can't wait to go back!! Found exactly what I was looking for (a corked glass bottle to put my homemade mouthwash gift in) almost as soon as I walked in. Tons of cute gifts, even for the person you think is most impossible to buy for. Great greeting cards, I honestly wanted to buy 90% of them just to have. Gentleman behind the counter was so super nice - and again, I just can't wait to go back!
