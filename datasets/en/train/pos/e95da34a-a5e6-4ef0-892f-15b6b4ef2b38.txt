my boyfriend and I stopped by for an early dinner and there are zero complaints about this location.  It's a small shop, family-owned and the food was amazing (as long as you like cajun-style food).  My boyfriend is a huge fan of cajun food, spent a lot of time in New Orleans and loved the authenticity of FOL.  I am not nearly as familiar with cajun food and tried the fried pickles and alligator combo.  I loved it.  The helping was GENEROUS and definitely enough for leftovers.  The restaurant is going to be opening a second location in Phoenix and it should definitely be visited.
