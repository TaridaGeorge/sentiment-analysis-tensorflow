I just had a wonderful evening at Atlas Bistro and I have to say that the food there is some of the best I have ever had.  Every thing I put into my mouth was delicious and very fresh, props to their chefs!  The atmosphere was great and the service was top notch and timely.   I also thought it was very unique and convenient having a wine store next door, a smart and convenient  partnership.  If you've thought about going to Atlas Bistro but haven't gotten around to it make reservations, you'll be glad you did.
