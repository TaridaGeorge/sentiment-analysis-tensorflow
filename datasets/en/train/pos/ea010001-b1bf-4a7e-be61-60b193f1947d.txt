Awesome

This restaurant is run by Beau McMillian.  It's a great place for an evening dinner.   

I started with the Butternut soup which was by far the best I've ever had.  EVER.

The waitress recommended the short ribs, which is cooked Korean style.  She was not wrong.  Some of the best I've ever had.

The atmosphere is very intimate even though it's wide open.  The lighting was perfect and the open firepits added an ambiance.  

I can highly recommend this place, but especially good if you want to impress a date, or may to propose.   

Again just awesom
