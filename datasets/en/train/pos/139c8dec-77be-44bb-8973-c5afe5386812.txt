Dear FedEx Office / Kinkos, you have saved my ass on numerous occasions, and I am forever indebted to your fabulous hours and helpful staff. 

Being the procrastinator I am, this place is my haven on Sunday night when those nasty Monday morning presentations need to be..well, presented. Went in here again last night with the same scenario, and got in an out with no problems! Living on my Mac for so long caused me to feel like an idiot when it came to the Windows operating systems, but with a little assistance, I got it! 10 page presentation with color images for 8 bucks? Heck yes.
