As far as Filipino food in Arizona, this is the place to go.  Lots of choices to choose from.  Pancit freshly made right as you wait, halo-halo which is to die for, and the lumpia is just delightful.

The decor is plesant with Filipino television playing in the backround. The staff is ultra friendly and can speak English or Tagalog depending on your mood. Very clean place compared to the other Filipino places nearby, but the food speaks for itself.
