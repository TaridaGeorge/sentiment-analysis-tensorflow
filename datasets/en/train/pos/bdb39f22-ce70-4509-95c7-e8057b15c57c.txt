TJ's is great - fresh, fresh tantalizing produce well displayed; good selection & pricing on organic produce; TJ's wonderful house brands in an interesting variety of great foods - but everyone knows that already.

However, the cool thing is that for some reason, this particular TJ's always has the nicest clerks & managers.  They explain stuff, make small talk and are not only friendly but N-I-C-E!!  Kudos on a great staff, TJ's!
