after several fatburgers i feel it is still to come clean and admit i have become a really big fan. i have never had a bad burger. This is my favorite and only place that i do eat a burger at. 

i was a hater at first yes. But Fatburger worked its way into my heart and i admit they know how to make a delicious f-ing burger here!!


Consistency in their food is solid here, and nothing better than being able to count on a place where you will always get a good meal...over and over again.

Kudos Fatburger
