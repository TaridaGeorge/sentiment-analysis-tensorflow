This is my first 5 Star Review for a time share, yeah, not a hotel but didn't see a timeshare category.  (dear yelp seems the time share reviews is an open market)

Top Five Reasons for Five stars
1. The Kierland Villa employees will over and over again out perform your expectations.  From the Bellmen and front desk to the pool employees and hotel 
2. The Rooms are large and the bathrooms are amazing and has a jacuzzi and a shower. I love the furniture and the two bathrobes in my room. I hope one did not fall into my luggage.  
3. Pools are not crowded and the hotel overlooks a golf course
4. Once again the staff is what takes this place to another level.
5. The golf course is great, your choice of a cart or a Segway with a golf bag holder.
