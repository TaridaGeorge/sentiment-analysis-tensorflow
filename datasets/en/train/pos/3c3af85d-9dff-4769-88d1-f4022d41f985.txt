Great food and atmosphere. It is small and personal and reminds me of restaurants actually in France. The waitstaff works hard and is pleasant. I have had salmon, ravioli, and most of the appetizers. I have gone twice with large groups and everyone loved their food. The wine is also great and the menu is reasonably priced. When I went with vegetarian friends, the kitchen and staff offered alterations to the menu so they could enjoy a meat-free meal.
