This library is great!  They have an awesome selection of audio books, being my #1 pull in.  They have a little cafe outside that is handy if needing a latte or a snack.  The workers are incredibly helpful, and it's super convenient to my house.  I am there at least once a month, and will surely be regarded as a regular soon :)
