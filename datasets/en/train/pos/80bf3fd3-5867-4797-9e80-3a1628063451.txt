Once again, I took my vehicle to Paul @ CCC and am an extremely happy customer.  I was able to drop my car off early.  I was given a phone call once diagnostics were finished an quoted a very fair price for my repairs. Everyone at the counter was absolutely a pleasure to work with.  This is my go-to person for regular maintenance and unexpected repairs.
