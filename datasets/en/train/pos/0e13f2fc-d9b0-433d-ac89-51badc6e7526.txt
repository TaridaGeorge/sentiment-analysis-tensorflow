I typed in sandwiches into the Yelp search today while in Mesa and this was the first hit. It was so so so good.

I got the Grilled Veggie Sandwich with Goat Cheese and my friend got the Thanksgiving sandwich. We both declared our lunches to be amazing.

The sides were also awesome. The portions seemed just right.

Go there, you won't be sorry.
