Seriously.  This place is fabulous. TMI is tucked on Sheridan, just east of 7th Street. Evidently, the space used to house Lisa G's. I didn't live in AZ then, so no clue on that. After living in SoCal, The Pacific NW, Chicago, and Europe, one of the main drawbacks of AZ is the lack of hip, delicious, unpretentious eateries. Thank goodness for TMI. It's chic but not snobby. On some days it reminds me of a German pub as you've got people from all ages congregating, it's fabulous! The decor is sleek, warm, and soft. There is a large patio and seating is available for both large and small groups...even intimate tucked away corners if you want a romantic dinner. I love the food, The Calvano with Turkey is the best sandwich I have ever had...ever. Hands down. Chic, fun, delish.  Life is good at TMI.
