This was my second experience at this spa.  The first time was Christmas Eve 2008, and second was spa week 2010.  Once again a fantastic experience.  They have one of the nicest facilities in the Valley.  Great service, nice outdoor waterfall hot tub, nice indoor hot tub, and an overall wonderful experience.  I will return again for sure.
