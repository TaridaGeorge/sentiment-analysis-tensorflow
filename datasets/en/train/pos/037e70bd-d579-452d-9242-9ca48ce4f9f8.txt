I am from out of state and every spring break I must go to house of tricks. This place is one of my all time favorite restaurants. The lunch is delicious. They always have amazing lunch specials and the atmosphere is wonderful. Nothing is better than enjoying an iced tea and eating a fabulous lunch outside at House of Tricks!I love this place!!
