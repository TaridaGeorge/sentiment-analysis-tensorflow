10/11

Took the day off from work and treated myself to an hour of grounding, yet spiritually-lifting mass at Chandler's beautiful (both interior and exterior) St. Andrew the Apostle.  Father Coleman was once again a delight to hear, and the adult choir and accompanying band of talented musicians always bring joy to my soul- I am ever enthralled watching the pianist perform!

Took a few photos of the Prayer Garden, installed by Father Joe, who  retired in 2007.  Hope you enjoy!
