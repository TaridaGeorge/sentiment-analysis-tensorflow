You know, that Thomas S. really knows his shopping.  And I would follow his reviews every time.  He is totally correct about D. Frank Designs.  This tiny little store is GREAT!  I don't know if I met D. or Frank while I was in the store, but whoever they were, they were very helpful and almost giddy with excitement over their merchandise.  As was I.  They had a very impressive pale wood mirror that I fell in love with.  Wouldn't fit in my suitcase, but they are more than happy to ship.  Plus, they are very eager to help you find whatever your little heart may design.  Great store.  Great people, I love D. Frank Designs!
