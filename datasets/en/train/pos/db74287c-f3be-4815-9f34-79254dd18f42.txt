My Sister's Closet it is a cute little consignment store in Town & Country. The very first time I came here was a couple of years ago.   I'm glad I found My Sister's Closet.  They have great prices and the staff is great too. Also they have the best selection of jeans in town.  I always end up buying my jeans here for a great price.  

If you are in Phoenix looking for a great consignment store, you should head over to My Sister's Closet.  They now have a new Men's store that has a great variety of everything that is right next door.   :)
