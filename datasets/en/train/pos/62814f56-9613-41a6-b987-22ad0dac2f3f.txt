I wish Chris would come up to San Francisco and open a resturant. I cannot find pizza here that's even near the same level of his wood fired pizza's. You do need to show up at Bar Bianco about 2 hours before you want to eat, but it's worth the wait. The bread, the salads, the wine and the PIZZA... all fresh and tasty and... damn, I can't wait to visit AZ again!
