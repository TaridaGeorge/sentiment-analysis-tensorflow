These are the world's greatest donuts.  They had quite a few locations in the Las Vegas area years ago that all of a sudden closed once I got hooked.  When I was transferred to Scottsdale I could not believe that I had location within a few miles of me.

The donuts are just amazing.  They are not overly sweet like Crispy Creme, but are tasty and fresh.  I honestly cannot imagine getting a doughnut from anywhere else.  I stopped by yesterday to pick up a few dozen for my co-workers, who had never heard of you guys, and they are all now huge fans.

I seriously hope you continue to expand in the area.  Your donuts should be up there with the likes of Dunkin, Crispy, and all the other chains in terms of name recognition.  They are amazing.
