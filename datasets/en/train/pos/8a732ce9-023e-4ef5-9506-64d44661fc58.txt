The steak was so good I started having heart palpitations.  Oh my god, I don't even know where to begin.  The dining room is beautiful.  The service was flawless.  And the food was out of this world.  Really tremendous.  The ahi tuna tartar?  Amazing.  The bone-in-fillet? Amazing.  Lobster mashed potatoes?  Are you kidding me?  Ridiculous.  By far, the best steak I have ever had.  Better than Flemings, Capital Grill, Morton's, Ruth Chris, Durant's, El Chorro...  Seriously.  You are looking at about $100/head including drinks (not wine) and it is worth every penny.  I'm going to go pass out now.
