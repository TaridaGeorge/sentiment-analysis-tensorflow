Meatgasm.  Meat.  Meat.  Meat.  Why thank you, Brazil!  

This is a man's paradise.  Beautifully cooked and seasoned meat and all you can eat.  The first dude to flip his card to red is a sissy.

Don't make plans after you eat here. You'll be so full are you likely to pass out in the parking lot.  Brilliant!

My favorites include the filet mignon with bacon and the ribeye.  The mashed potatoes and plantains are also great!  The salad bar is nice too, but skip it and eat all the meat you can possibly fit in your belly.

The first time we came here some doofus refilled my Mai Tai with iced tea.  Before I could let my complaint roll off my tongue, there was a manager there to correct the problem.
