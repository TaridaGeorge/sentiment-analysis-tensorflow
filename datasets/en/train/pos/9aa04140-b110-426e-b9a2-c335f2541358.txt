I work nearby and visit the Greek Pita for take out lunch.

The gyro is DELICIOUS, the service is always very fast and friendly. The woman working the counter is always so sweet. 

The amount of meat on the gyro is great and it is very flavorful and tender. Definitely recommend for a quick bite to eat.
