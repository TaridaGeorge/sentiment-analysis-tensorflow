Loved this place, can't wait to return!

It was a 15-20 minute wait, which I don't think is bad for weekend breakfast.  Once we ordered, the food came out very fast.  Always folks coming around to offer to refill your coffee.

I had an omelet with chorizo, pepper jack, avocado and sour cream.  It was delicious!  They didn't use too much egg, it really focused on the ingredients.  For my sides I had hash browns and biscuit and gravy.  I love biscuits and gravy, but theirs were very mediocre.  The hash browns were good and crisp on the top..

My hubby had the bacon and eggs with hash browns and sourdough toast.  All very good.

The portions are also large, no way you can leave feeling hungry.  It was also very reasonably priced.
