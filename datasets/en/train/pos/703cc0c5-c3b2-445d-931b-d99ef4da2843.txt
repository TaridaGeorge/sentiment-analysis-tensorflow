If you're looking for a great refreshing burger with freshly cut fries, this is the place.  I highly reccomend dining in rather than taking it to go simply because the fresh cut fries are likely to get cold and soggy quick.  

If you're adventurous, try getting your burger or fries "animal-style", while it's not on the menu the employee working the register will know what you are referring to.  Animal style consists of melted cheese, special sauce, and grilled onions, simply delicious.  

Another great menu option is the protein-style burgers where the bun is replaced by crisp refreshing lettuce.  

Finish off your classic American meal with one of their three thick milkshakes!
