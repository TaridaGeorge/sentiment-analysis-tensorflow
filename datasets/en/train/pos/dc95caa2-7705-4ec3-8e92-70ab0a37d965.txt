What can I say?  I love Grimaldi's, and this is my 2nd favorite location in metro Phx, just behind the Chandler location.  The coal-fired, ultra-high-heat cooking method produces a pizza that's great in ways that are hard to describe, you just have to experience it firsthand.  Believe the hype - especially when it's coming from Brak - this is the real deal.
