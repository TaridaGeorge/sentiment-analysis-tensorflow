The airports with mini museums and art galleries just tickle me! It is a wonderful thing to be able to enjoy a dash of culture with all the other mania that goes on in airports. I can think of a some other airports with fun displays and bits of history, like Dallas, Charlotte, and San Francisco with little displays that help eliminate the sterility. Thank you Phoenix for your part in the Art world!
