I've been in the market for a new mountain bike for months and I've been to shops around the valley.  I was really starting to get discouraged by how uncooperative the folks were everywhere, I needed some guidance and all I got was attitude.  I saw an article in The State Press and decided to check out the shop.  I was suprised at the laid back atmosphere and the attentiveness of Ryan the owner.  He asked me a series of questions to figure out what I needed and then told me his recommendation.  I will get my new bike in a couple of days and not only did Ryan agree to let me help build it, but I also get FREE lifetime service?!?  Check them out, worth the time for sure!
