This is my favorite course in the greater Phoenix area. The course is challenging, and the views are amazing!

This course is one that for some reason is generally overlooked as one of the best (in my opionion the best)  course in Phoenix. It is off the beaten path a lttile, (sitting in Fountain Hills) but is really worth the extra 10 minuet drive. Staff is excellent, The last 6 holes (the Wicked 6) are a fresh idea in ending a course, and I enjoy it thuroughly. 

The practice green is well kept, and is a great determination of how the course greens are. The chipping green is one of my favorites in town.

Cart girls are friendly, and always smiling. Prices are just right!

Im always coming back, and they never give me a reason to not come back!
