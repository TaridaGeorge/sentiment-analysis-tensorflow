My wife and I absolutely love this place. It is a bit pricey, but if I could eat here every day I would. I agree with some others that think they should brand themselves as "healthy" or "vegan/vegetatrian" fare, but I don't care what they call themselves as long as the food is outstanding. Furthermore, I enjoy the quiet atmosphere in the restaurant (I hate all the chatter of Chili's, for instance). It allows me to sit around with family or friends and actually enjoy our food with real conversations (instead of yelling to the other end of the table). 

If you're into macrobiotic, vegan, vegetarian, healthy, or you just want to try something delicious, then this place is for you!
