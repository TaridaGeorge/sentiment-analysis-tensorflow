We fell in love with O.H.S.O. immediately and we've been coming to OHSO regularly for some time with our kids for their $10 beer brunch on the weekends. I love their breakfast burrito on the beer brunch menu. On the regular menu my favorite is the brisket burger with a pitcher of something local or regional.

O.H.S.O. is a great example of a locally owned restaurant supporting local breweries (while working on their own) and other local community organizations.
