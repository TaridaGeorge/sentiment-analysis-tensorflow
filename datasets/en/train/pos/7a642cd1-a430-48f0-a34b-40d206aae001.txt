For somebody who likes to try "weird" things, this is the perfect place. I even found white big corn (from Peru)!!! I would buy more of their fresh vegetables, but I have to write down the names and find out some recipes. I take people who is visiting me to have a walk here and they always end up buying something they just want to try. 

Their sea food selection (fresh) is amazing (same as the smell). 

Aside from Food City and sometimes Sprouts, this is the place to find Papayas.
