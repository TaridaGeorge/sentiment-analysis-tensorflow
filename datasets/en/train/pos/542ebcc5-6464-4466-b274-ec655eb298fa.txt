My family has been going to Crackers for years... it's one of the first breakfast places I can remember going to (the old location of course, but this one is much closer to me now). I've had most of the breakfast items and have honestly loved every one. My very favorite is the farmer's skillet- just fabulous! This place is HIGHLY reccommended!
