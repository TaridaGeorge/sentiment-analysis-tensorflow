My family and I love this restaurant--as well as the FLW location. We moved to Phoenix about four years ago and it took us a good two years, eight Thai restaurants to find one we love. We always order #33 mussamum and 34 gang gai and they are the best I have had anywhere. The staff is always friendly. The only negative is that at this location they have a waterfall that drives us crazy because it's so loud in the dining room so we always get takeout :)
