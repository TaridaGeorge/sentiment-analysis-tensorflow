UGH I LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH :( Like too much.. srsly..

Yummy selection of flavors that they are always changing up. Tart and pomegranate raspberry are delish as well as pistachio. Last time I went they had coffee and peanut butter flavors YUM!!!!

The fruit toppers are the BEST! Always fresh and sweet. I like that they have different toppers from time to time.. today I went and they had CHOCOLATE. COVERED. STRAWBERRIES. Yes, I know.

It's always clean in here and the staff is always super friendly. Don't go in the bathroom though, kind of smelly :(
