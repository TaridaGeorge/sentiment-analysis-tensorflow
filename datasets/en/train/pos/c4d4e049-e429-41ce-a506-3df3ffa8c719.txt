I love the Mongolian beef with noodles & have getting here for years. I was glad to see no Arpaio in sight & the doors back open. My wife loves the Dan Dan noodles & the kids get honey seared chicken. I stop in this crazy busy location only when I'm in the area because the parking lot is insane. I think the concept is great & the service is always quick. Consistency is the key to this place.
