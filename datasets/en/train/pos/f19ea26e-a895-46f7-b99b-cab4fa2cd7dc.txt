Not sure if you'd call this place a restaurant, an amusement park, a vintage clothing store, or a soundstage for a '30's Chicago boxing movie.  I just know I love any excuse to go there and have fun! Steve and Andi have created a one of a kind place with something for everyone.  If you're looking for some place memorable to take visiting guests, think this place.  I think this year's Christmas wish list is going to be "anything vintage from the store at The Duce."
