AC died on a Friday, called several places Sat morning, only Flores picked up the phone (left several messages for others -no response). They couldn't fit me in Sat so I scheduled for Wed at 4. Tech showed up at 445 (called earlier to confirm, let me know he was running a little late). He was courteous and professional, and friendly. 

After some troubleshooting (fuses, wiring) he confirmed it was a dead transformer and installed a new one.   Tested fine, gave a me a years warrantee and his number in case there were any other problems in the short term. He said it was unusual for a transformer to die with no visible signs of why it failed and to hold onto the receipt just in case. No up selling, no BS, no games - just thorough and friendly. AC fixed for well under $200 - bargain. Highly recommended!
