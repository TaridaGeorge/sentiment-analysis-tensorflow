Shenan was absolutely amazing! She had the challenge of taking photos of my not even 2 week old newborn and her patience was far reaching. She was professional, kind and wonderful to work with. I would absolutely recommend her to anyone. She captured my baby and my family in such a natural way. The photos didn't look staged. Oh and the photos are...well...precious and beautiful.
