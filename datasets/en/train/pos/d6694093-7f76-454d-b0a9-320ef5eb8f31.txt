This is an amazing place!!!!  As far as bistro's go this place tops any one that I have been to in Phoenix.  Everything they serve is absolutely amazing.  The cuban pork is my favorite, you can add it to a salad which I think is best, get it by itself or even get it in a sandwich!!  The salad bar has like 40 different things to choose from in your salad which is always a big plus to have.  I would reccomend this place to just about anyone, as long as you are in the mood for a delicious sandwich, pizza or an awesome salad!
