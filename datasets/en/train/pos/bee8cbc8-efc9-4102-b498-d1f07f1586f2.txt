Visiting from Chicago we found Hula's on YELP.  It completely lived up to the reviews!  We will be back on our next trip.

Food - simply delicious.  Close to anything we've ever ordered in Maui.  I had the butter fish crusted in macadamia nuts.  Fabulous.  The mango chutney topping was the bomb.  Great flavors and combinations going on.

Drinks - excellent.  Well poured, mixed and delivered with love.  Staff - very helpful with recommendations and had a great sense of humor.  Ambiance - sit outsdie.  Awesome patio area with firepit-perfect for a cool February night.

Will recommend to all who visit from Chicago.
