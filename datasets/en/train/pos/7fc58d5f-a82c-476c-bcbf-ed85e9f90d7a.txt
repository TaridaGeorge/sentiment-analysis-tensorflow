Massive portions of french fries - oh MY.

Note to self: order a regular size next time.

Whenever we go, we never finish all of our food and have to throw a lot of it away (boo).

They have free shelled peanuts for the taking as well.

The burgers come with 2 patties as standard.

The burgers & large fries are $5/each.

If you come during rush hour - be prepared to WAIT for your order. I didn't mind though, the quality was amazing. It was loud and crowded but I can see why. 

Keep in mind though, I order things plain so if it comes to flavor - I may not be the best judge. Everyone I have brought it rave about it as well. It was a nice treat.
