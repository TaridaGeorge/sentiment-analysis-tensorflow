All of Crazy Jim's menu is delicious!  Their food is authentic and made fresh daily!  My favorite is the Steak Picado Pita which includes Steak, Grilled Onion, Green Peppers and Jalape√±o.  Add their homemade Tzatziki (with no sugar or preservatives) and you will absolutely love it!  

The pizza dough is also made daily and the wonderful flavor of the pizza sauce is great!   They have a great variety of toppings to choose from and the portions are great for the price.

I highly recommend you to go and try EVERYTHING on the menu!  

Enjoy.
