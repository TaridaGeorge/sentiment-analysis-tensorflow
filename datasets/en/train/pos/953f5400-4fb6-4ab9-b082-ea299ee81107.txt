Had the most positive experience in a government building when I visited to get my social security card. I literally walked in, checked in with the security guard, she gave me my ticket, checked my bag for weapons, and I sat down for literally 4minutes and was called up to a window. 

It was about noon when I visited on a Friday to get my Social Security Card, and the representative was super pleasant and helpful. I strongly suggest if you don't want to deal with parking issues with the downtown location, come here!
