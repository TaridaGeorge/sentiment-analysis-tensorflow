I have lived in the Valley for over 15 yrs and I have finally found my favorite Chinese restaurant.  The owners are very attentive to making you feel at home and the value is amazing.  The sizzling soup is amazing and always fresh.  The egg foo young is delicious and we have yet to find any complaints.  We have gone as a family and as a large group and everytime, it has been a great experience.
