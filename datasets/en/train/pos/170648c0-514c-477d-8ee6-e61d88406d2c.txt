My favorite burger. Period. This might be in my list of last meal foods. Food is always fast, fresh and delicious. It's awesome to still be able to find an old school style burger restaurant with a simple menu. You want chicken? Go somewhere else. You want turkey burger? You're in the wrong place. You want a salad? Get the hell out of here. You want a juicy burger with fresh toppings? In N Out is the place!

Outdoor seating is nice and ample. I usually bring my dog and sit outside, weather permitting. She loves fries and watching the birds.

This place is great and will always bring me back to my childhood. We used to always go to In N Out whenever we were in California. It was always a special treat for us since it was only located in one state.

Favorite secret: Animal Fries...trust me...
