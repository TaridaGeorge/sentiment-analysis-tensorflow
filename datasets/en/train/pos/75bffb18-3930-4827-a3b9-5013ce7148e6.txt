The staff is all very friendly and knowledgeable, every concoction I've tried has been beyond delicious, and the environment is always refreshing. I always get a kick out of the fact that the jams are spun off an actual record player, and if there's an album that catches your eye in the collection, they're always more than happy to put it on. All in all, an awesome establishment!
