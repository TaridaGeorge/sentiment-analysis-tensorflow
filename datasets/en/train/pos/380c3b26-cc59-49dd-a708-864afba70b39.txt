For being a local business that just recently opened, Echo Coffee is doing a phenomenal job. I have had nothing but great experiences (and none of the snafus that tend to plague small businesses when they first open). 

First, their space is fantastic. It is a clean, open and very modern buildout that manages to feel warm and inviting. The service is prompt, efficient and professional. And finally, the coffee is excellent; each drink has been consistent in flavor and quality. For a nice vacation from daily life, step into Echo Coffee with a book.
