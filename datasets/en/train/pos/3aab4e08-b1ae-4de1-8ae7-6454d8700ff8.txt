I used to go to this place all the time.  It's been awhile since I've been, pretty much because I stay within the radius of my neighborhood in N. Central Phoenix more these days.  

But everytime I've gone here, I have enjoyed it.  They have great drinks.  Nice big martinis and cosmos.  They're pricey, but they're also about the size of 2-3 regular sized drinks.

I love the way this place is decorated, especially the art displays that are different everytime you go.  Always kinda funky and different, sometimes odd, but I like it.  The food is good, but I have to say I usually fill up on a couple of drinks and wind up forgetting about the food!  

Stylish atmosphere.  Great place to dress up and have a few drinks with your friends.  Excellent people watching.
