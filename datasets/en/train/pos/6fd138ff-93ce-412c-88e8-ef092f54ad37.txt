This grocery story is truly as good as it gets.  It's like Whole Foods with a dash of Trader Joe's with low prices.  The meat section is awesome -- great quality meat at good prices, including organic, grass-fed beef.  

The service is also excellent -- the checkout person I talked to today kept going on and on about what a great place Sprouts is and how good it is to work there.

I highly recommend checking out this location, or any of the others (I've been to a couple others) in the Phoenix area.
