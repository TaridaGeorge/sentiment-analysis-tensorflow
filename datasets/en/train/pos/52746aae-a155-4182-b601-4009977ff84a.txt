Great bagels.  New place.  Nothing fancy but if you want good thick New York style bagels then this is for you.

We all know it is hard to find a good bagel in Phoenix area.  But this is good.  $1 per bagel and like $2 with cream cheese.  I like the Jalapeno cream cheese.

*update: after having one of the best bacon, egg, and cheese on a onion bagel I have ever had, and really thinking about how good the bagels are, I upped it to 5 stars.  I only wish there were other reviewers, this is the best bagel in town, hands down.  Don't go there for atmosphere, go for an amazing New York style bagel*
