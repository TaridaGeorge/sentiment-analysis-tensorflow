Hair, skin, massage . . . I get it all done at Glow!  The atmosphere is warm and cozy, just like walking into a friend's living room which is not what you would expect when parking or walking through the rest of the business complex.  Everyone at Glow is super nice and helpful, they make me feel like more than just another customer!  

They have a variety of services, great products, including an organic selection, and music DVDs playing while you wait (good ones!).  

A few weeks ago was their Customer Appreciation Party.  I stopped in to say hello and take advantage of the 15% off for the day.  There was wine, snacks, and a full house of customers and staff chatting like it was a gathering of good friends.  (Are you seeing a theme?)

I highly recommend making an appointment; I wouldn't go anywhere else!
