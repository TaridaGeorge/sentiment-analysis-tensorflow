What a fun little gem in the NE Valley ( NEPHO ? )...I have been going frequently for the past month and have to say that I am pleasantly surprised!  What a great way to spend a beautiful Saturday morning 
( before the "burn" of summer ) and discover local goods...Salsas, soaps, honey, eggs, veggies, and on and on are there for your enjoyment.  In this day and age of being disconnected from those in our own community, this is a great place to reconnect.  I have vowed to try at least one or two new things every time I go and I cannot wait for next Saturday!
I almost feel "European" buying ingredients for a dinner later that night and knowing that it all came from my city, my state :)
