Best calzone around.  Great lunch menu.  Able to support large groups well.  This is a locally owned community friendly restaurant.  Did I mention the calzone?  Nom. Nom. Nom.  

Awesome to see fixes to large group service.  Have had multiple large groups on busiest times recently and the service has been FLAWLESS!
