Went to go and see Dr. Cathreine Hollenbach for the first time yesterday.  I really like her.  I am very picky with my doctors and I must say that she is definitely a doctor I will continue to see!  Everyone in the office is super nice.  If you are looking for a an eye doctor, I must recommend Dr. Hollenbach!
