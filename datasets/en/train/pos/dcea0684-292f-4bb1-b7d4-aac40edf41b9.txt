We ate there only because it's Alice Cooper's.  I thought it would be overpriced with lousy food.
Since we were just traveling through on vacation, we didn't know there would be a game at the stadium across the street starting an hour after we drove by, fighting game traffic.  Crap, should we just go somewhere else? We really wanted to go there, so we did.  There were even a few people lingering out front, so...
The place wasn't overly crowded, we got right in.  The service was FAR above expectations, as was the food.  Good menu and beverage selections.
I'd go back in a heartbeat when I'm in Phoenix!  Hats off to Alice (who apparently only shows up every few months, so don't expect to see him serving you your Big Unit :)
