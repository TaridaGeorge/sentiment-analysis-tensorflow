A Jersey girl in a cowboy bar...One would never think.  However, this Jersey girl checked out the newest restaurant/nightlife addition to Old Town Scottsdale...Saddle Ranch Chop House.  And I have 2 words...LOVED IT!  

This restaurant/bar first garnered attention in Hollywood.  

I didn't have the opportunity to eat there, but I did enjoy a frothy beverage!  The patio is big...and the selling point is a mechanical bull!!  Great western bar, fun atmosphere and a bull!

I will update my review once I eat there.  But you must go!!

**UPDATE***  
GO ON SUNDAY BRUNCH!!!  $1.99 Mimosa and Bloody Mary's....The food is good too!
