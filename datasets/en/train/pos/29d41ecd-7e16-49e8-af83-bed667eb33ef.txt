I strongly recommend Jacqueline Hanna Photography. I found her very easy to work with, and I found her work to be excellent and reasonably priced. I needed only a few head shots for marketing/publicity purposes. She surprised me by suggesting that we shoot at an outdoor location. The various interesting backgrounds and natural lighting produced work that exceeded my expectations.
