This place rocks! I'm from Kansas City,Missouri, so I know a great steak when I taste one...this is the real deal, folks. I spent three nights in Scottsdale, and two of my meals were here...I was so impressed with the first visit I HAD to go back. It might be a litttle pricey, but cheap steak is not good. Savory, delicious filet. Chopped salad was heavenly. Bread was phenomenal. Oh, Modern Steak, why must you be so far away?
