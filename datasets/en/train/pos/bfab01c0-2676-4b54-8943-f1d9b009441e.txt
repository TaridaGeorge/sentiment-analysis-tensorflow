This is the best one yet (out of all of the My Sister's Closets). I've found so many yummy things here. Cashmere sweaters, designer jeans (Sevens, AG and People's Republic), Coach sandals, a Prada moon bag and some Juicy Couture dresses - and those are just the highlights. They're very picky what they accept when you consign, but that's what makes them a good consignment shop and their prices are really pretty good. I always stop here after Last Chance. It completes my shopping day and a good deal makes me happy. Forget Prozac, what we need are Prada bags for $200 (it was a super sale day - and I'm not on Prozac, just being facetious).
