Been coming here since I was but a wee-scout, and my family since they moved to Arizona.  I remember when the rafters were dusty, and the place smelled musky (and looked a lot like the 'burger Works used to).  I kind of miss those days, but I'm a nostalgic fool.

The food here is amazing.  It's a hole-in-the-wall, local known kind of place.  A little known fact that we use every time patronizing this wonderful joint: they do call-in orders.  Because everything is hand made, and they can be swamped at lunch time, this is a Godsend for a hungry hungry hippo, like myself.
