Brios is a delectable Italian restaurant that recently opened at Santan Village. Located inside a structure made to resemble a Tuscan country villa from both the inside and outside, Brio's offers a variety of fine Italian cusine. 

  I came to Brio's for the Happy Hour and was very impressed with the appetizers. Each was only $2.99, making this one of the better if not the best happy hours I have been to. I tried the mini burgers, the steak bruchetta and the margerita flatbread . All three items were delicious and I can't wait to come back here for more.
