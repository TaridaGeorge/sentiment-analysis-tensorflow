When we needed a ceiling fan fixed, I went straight to Yelp to find a reputable electrician. After seeing the rave reviews for Good Guys Electric, I gave the business a call. The man I spoke with was very helpful in telling me over the phone what might be wrong, and I scheduled an appointment for the next day. Today, when Mike came out, he was very professional and quickly fixed the fan (the receiver inside needed to be replaced). I was so pleased with the job he did that I then asked him to install another fan, as well as address an outlet problem we were having. Everything was done quickly, and the pricing was fair and reasonable. I'll definitely use this business again for our electrical needs.
