It is so hard to find good southern food in this town. So far I have had the shrimp etoufee and and shrimp po'boys. There is nothing fancy about this place, however the food is amazing. Located in of course, a strip mall, next to LA Fitness. Somewhat hard to see, but definetly worth checking out. The prices are great too. Everything is under $10. Their menu has catfish, shrimp, chicken and a few other things. This is just a mom & pop little place which is awesome. I hope this place sticks around.
