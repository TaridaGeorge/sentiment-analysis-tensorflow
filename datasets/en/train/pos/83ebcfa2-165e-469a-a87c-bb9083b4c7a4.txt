Seriously, even if you never plan on buying a cookie bouquet for someone...

go into Cookies by Design and buy an "oops cookie". These are cookies that came out a little misshapen and therefore they can't use them. They frost them and sell these gems for one dollar. ONE DOLLAR. 

I'm not even joking. Once you eat this cookie, you won't ever want another cookie in your life. Or at least, you will constantly be unsatisfied with other sugar cookies.

I've never ordered a bouquet from them but I've seen a lot on display since I used to come here every single day after school when I was in high school. They always look beautiful and I'm sure they taste even better than the oops cookies do.
