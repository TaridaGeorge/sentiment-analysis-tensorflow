This is by far, the best chicken and waffles I've ever tasted. I've tried them all...in Oakland, Long Beach, and Los Angeles. And none of the restaurants can compare to Lo-Lo's!! The waffles are amazing, it's fluffy and soft while the chicken is crisp and juicy. I love how they have Kool-Aid too. The other restaurants I've tried in California don't have Kool-Aid!!! And the Kool-Aid at Lo-Lo's is fantastic...it has a perfect balance of flavor and sweetness. It's like they put crack in it or something! My girlfriend had the "Stupid Fries" which had cheese, peppers, onions, and chicken smothered all over french fries. It's crazy good too and I definitely recommend to order that as an appetizer to share. Can't wait to return to this place again when I come back to Phoenix :0)
