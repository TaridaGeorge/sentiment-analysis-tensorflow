REALLY Good! It's so good, it makes good look not so good! I can honestly admit that this place was the second best pizza joint I've been to in my life (the first being some random italian mom and pops in NY that I forgot the name of). 

The spinach pizza was extremely tasty, the sauce and the cheese went hand in hand without overpowering the spinach. The calzone was very enjoyable. I haven't had one before, so I went ahead and decided to try it at a place that had good pizza, and the spaghetti calzone was a great compliment to the entrees. This was also the first place I've been to aside from Taps that actually has Blue Moon on tap, which is very cool.
