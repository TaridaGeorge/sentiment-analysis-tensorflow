Went there twice this past weekend and was met both times with absolutely unsurpassed service and sundaes.  

They bring you water as soon as you sit down, which I appreciate as it always helps me make more clear headed menu choices.  And no matter what I chose off the menu I wasn't disappointed.

Anything you want ice cream wise, they will deliver!  No request is completely out of bounds, and each server I had was extremely friendly, they made me feel so comfortable.  I want to come back to Phoenix just for another sundae.
