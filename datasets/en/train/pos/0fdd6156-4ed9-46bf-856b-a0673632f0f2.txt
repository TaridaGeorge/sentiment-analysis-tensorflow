I love the Biltmore. Now, if I only had the money to shop there. Sure, there are some more averaged priced places...Macy's, Borders, MAC, Pottery Barn, but most of them are truely top shelf retail establishments.  Gucci, Saks, This Little Piggy Wears Cotton, Tommy Bahama, Betsy Johnson, etc line this outdoor shopping layout.  

My favorite part is that on Fridays (at least they used to do this, havent been on a Friday in a while), they have an open air market in the middle of all the shops complete with fresh fruits and vegtables, and hand crafted gifts.  

During the summer an outdoor mall is a bit intimidating but once it dips below 100 degrees, this up scale shopping experience is much more than just browsing for new shoes.
