Really cozy and tucked away, I enjoy that about some of the downtown gems. We had the cheese curds, chicken and waffles with string green beans and the steak. They were all really unique and delicious. The waffle ended up being one of my favorite parts of the meal:) also their homemade ginger ale was delicious. Our server was very nice and offered great suggestions. Good pick overall:)
