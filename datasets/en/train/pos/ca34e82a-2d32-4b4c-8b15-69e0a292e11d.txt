Impeccable service, exquisite food, chic decor...Modern Steak provided a wonderful dining experience. The waitstaff was incredibly attentive and polite. 

The FOOD!  I had a beef vegetable soup to start; the broth was so flavorful and robust and the veggies were crisp. The cheddar bacon bread with sour cream and chive butter was to die for!  For an entree I had the Caesar salad--romaine lettuce, Caesar vinegarette, and Parmesan croutons. It was crisp, fresh and just the right amount of dressing evenly coating each leaf. I also had the baked potato "bar": a steaming hot, buttered spud accompanied with braised beef spareribs (smokey and slightly sweet!), cheddar cheese, creme fraiche, bacon and steamed broccoli. My mom had the filet, which was incredibly tender--practically melted in my mouth!

Most options on the menu were pricey, but the unsurpassed quality is well worth it.
