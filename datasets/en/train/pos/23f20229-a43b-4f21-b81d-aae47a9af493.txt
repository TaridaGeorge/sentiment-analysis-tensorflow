The Vig is Arcadia's Neighborhood Bar!

Swanky Vibe W/ Fantastic Music
Consistantly Good Food
Great Friendly Service 
& A Price Tag That Won't Bankrupt you!

"Oh Yeah"
- Awsome Monday Night Burger Special
Their Burger is as good if not better than some of these over priced Burger Joints!
The only draw back  it does get very crowded...

Still The Vig is one of my favorite places to go for a fun night out...

They did an excellent job remodeling this cinder block run down building to its 1960's splender... The mature landscaping with trees that hang down over the outside tables and the dim lighting candlelight ambiance set the mood. 


Weather your out with a few friends or on a hot date this Resturant/ Bar will not disappoint you!
