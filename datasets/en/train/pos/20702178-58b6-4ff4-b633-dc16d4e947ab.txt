Aw, Cartel. You've won yourself a spot in my cold, dead heart: Better hours, better setup, better everything. You have achieved (near) perfection. 

Plus, now that it's fall and the weather's cooled down, I can ride my bike right up to the big garage-style warehouse door in the back. Like the cool kids.

And even though I'm not actually cool, the baristas here are really nice. Hipster style without the hipster pretension. I like it. 

Perhaps most of all, I just plain started feeling guilty about giving three stars to a place I frequent at least twice a week. And as I have said before, guilt's a bitch. 

Now that I'm absolved of my sins, I think it's time for some coffee.
