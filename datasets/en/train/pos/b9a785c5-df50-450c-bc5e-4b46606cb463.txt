Josh is a great guy, fun. . talented. . and wears amazing hats! I started my tattoo when he was working with Americana Tattoos and then he switched over to The Lady Luck and I of course, followed him. Best Decision EVER! My tat looks amazing, and people stop me all the time and say how lifelike and real looking my garter looks around my thigh.
Like everyone says there were movies playing and the guys were all joking around and having fun. Great Shop. Great People. Fun Times! =D
