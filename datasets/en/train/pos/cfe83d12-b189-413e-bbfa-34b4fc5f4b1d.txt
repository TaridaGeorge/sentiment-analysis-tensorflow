Durant's is an icon. Every photographer in Phoenix can show you at least one portrait of a political figure or celebrity they have shot in these hallowed (red flocked) walls. Every single person you come into contact with as you walk through the kitchen into the restaurant says hello to you. I just have one more thing to say: when you order a beer at the bar it comes topped with a toothpick skewered with meat and cheese. Respect.
