We had our 9 year anniversary dinner at Different Pointe of View, and it was one of the best we've had.  We sat on the patio and had one of the best views in the valley.  Luis was our waiter, and a true professional he was.  Sometime you have an experience that you know will be burned in your memory for a long time... this was one of them.  Thank you Luis and DPOV for making our anniversary such a great one.
