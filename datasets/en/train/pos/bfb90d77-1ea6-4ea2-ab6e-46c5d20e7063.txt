I could not have asked for a better meal. I went there last night with my best friend. We got there about 7:30pm on a Saturday night and it was packed!!!! They handled the crowds amazingly and made it feel like we were the only people in there. I was so amazed how organized they are. 

The food was delicious! I got the picnic salad and devoured the entire thing. I had a bite of my friend's sweet potato salad. SOOOO GOOD!!! I can't wait to go back and try something else!

Be sure to stop in the bathrooms. So original.
