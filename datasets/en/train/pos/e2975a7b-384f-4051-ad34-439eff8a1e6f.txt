US Airways has been my domestic airline of choice. I experience the best connections and convenience in the variety in connections, period. I think in reading all of the reviews regarding delays....I hardly believe that there exists an airline that experiences better timing. Maybe I haven't noticed. But what I do notice is the hospitality factor. Flying isn't what it used to be prior to 9/11 but I DO appreciate US Airways and the positive service that I receive. They make a difference to me and my weekly schedule.Comparatively I feel they succeed other domestic choices.
