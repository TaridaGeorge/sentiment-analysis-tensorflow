I am surprised to be the first reviewer.  I found out about this vet by reading a ton of rave reviews on Yahoo.  A lot of people mentioned driving from across town to use this vet.

They took excellent care of my Bullmastiff when she had to have emergency pyrometra surgery as a puppy and we have seen them for other minor health events.  We love this vet.  They really love animals and they have 4 doctors so it is easy to get a seond opinion.  The doctors have each other to consult with and that makes me feel more confident in them because let's face it...doctors are human beings and they can't always know everything.   I have met with all 4 doctors and each one gave me a good feeling.  

I refuse to take my dog to any other place.
