I love this place, specially now that it has been remodeled and the best two stylist stayed (this used to be Snip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah).  Ms. Tara and Ms. Julie are really great. The salon is airy and fresh looking, and has a nice playing area for the kids as well as TV and DVD players for them to watch movies while getting their hair cut.    Today my little girl had the works, she even let her hair be wash in the "big girls" sink.  Ms. Julie finished her cut and made a beautiful braided crown and put little flowers around.  She looked adorable.  My little boy, well there is not much to do with a boy, but he got his hair cut nicely and spiked.  Total rocker.
