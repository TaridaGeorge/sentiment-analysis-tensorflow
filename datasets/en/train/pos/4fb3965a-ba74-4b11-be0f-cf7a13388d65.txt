I rarely visit a restaurant where the service stands out to the point that it deserves an update to the five star review I already gave it. While visiting Spinatos recently, I couldn't help but notice how very friendly the restaurant staff. Immediately upon entering, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who showed us to our seats and grabbed us water right away. Then, the second the the hostess left, the waitress appeared and enthusiastically greeted us. The friendly service continued until the moment we left and it left a lasting impression on me. Staff is normally friendly, but the Spinatos staff definitely woke up on the right side of the bed and you can tell that they truly love where they work! Great pizza and great staff! A + Spinatos!
