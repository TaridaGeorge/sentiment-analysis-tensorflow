The best breakfast around.  NOBODY can make omelettes like Andre.  Portions are huge and quality is so much higher versus the chain breakfast places.  Memorabilia is real stuff, not some black and white pictures.  One of the other reviews commented on "Child labor".  Duh, it's a family owned restaurant and all the owner's kids have worked there.  The kids work their butt off.  I've watched them grow up.  Their Kid's meals are 99 cents all the time and that includes a drink!
