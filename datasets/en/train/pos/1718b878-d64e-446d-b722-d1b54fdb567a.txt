What a lovely place, it's small but what they dish up is just Fantastic and as close as Scottsdale is going to get to real French cuisine.
Definitely Quality over quantity and the Chef is very friendly, comes and mingles with the local subjects.... :).
A must Try, going back this weekend for seconds.
