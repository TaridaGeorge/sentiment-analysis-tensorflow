I am very satisfied with the level of service I have received at the Missouri office. They took the time to explain the procedure to me, offered in house, interest free financing and recommended a general dentist that I love as well. My son loves to go with me because they have video games and cookies. That makes my life so much easier.  I am so happy that I found them and I highly recommend you check them out.
