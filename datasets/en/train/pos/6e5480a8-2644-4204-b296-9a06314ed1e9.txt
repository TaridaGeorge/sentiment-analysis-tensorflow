JCL Dear Valley is a wonderful facility with great staff personnel. All the nurses and the entire medical staff are excellent in patient care including the PCTs!  I'm extremely fortunate to work along side an incredible TEAM of professionals.  I've visited Tele, Med Surg and Ortho units. 

This facility is also very organized, clean with a safe environment. I greatly appreciate this facility in our community. :)
