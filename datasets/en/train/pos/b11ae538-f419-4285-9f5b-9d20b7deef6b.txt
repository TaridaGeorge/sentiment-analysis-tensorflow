This is one of my favorite lunch places.  They have a WONDERFUL lunch special which includes one slice of pizza and a salad for an affordable price.  They have good service during lunch and you can sit inside or on the patio, depending on the weather.  Also, ask what the special slice of the day is...  it is very hit or miss.  But, sometimes you can find a gem!!!
