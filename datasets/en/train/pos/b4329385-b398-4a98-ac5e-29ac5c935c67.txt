This was a pleasant find and I hope that the rest of you out there generate a little bit of buzz about Bailey's. I dropped in this place on a thursday night, not expecting very much at all. What I got was an awesome selection of kareoke, amazing drink prices, and about the friendliest group of customers and staff I've seen in a Phoenix bar. The only downer of the night was that Sonic was closed after I got out of Bailey's (but that isn't their fault). At any rate, this is perfect place for anyone to be among friends.
