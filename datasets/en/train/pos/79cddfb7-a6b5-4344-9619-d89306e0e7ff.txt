Ima put it this way, you arent finding a fresher gyro.  The pita, the meat, the sauce.  Best in the area.  Even if you gotta drive 3 or 4 miles, definitely worth it.  Ive tried everywhere else and they just dont make em as big or as well as chicago gyros.  The owner is a stand up guy and they have frequent buyer cards that have great discounts on them.  

Not the cheapest but at $8-10 for a combo meal, you're not getting better food for the same price elsewhere.  Great atmosphere and good music, tv is always on the game or nfl network, maybe cnn sometimes.  Staff is really friendly and helpful.  Not "really" a sit down restaurant but plenty of room for 2-4 people(maybe 6 max).
