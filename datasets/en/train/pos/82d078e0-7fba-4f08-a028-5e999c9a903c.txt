My boyfriend and I were apartment hunting in Ohio for a week and Brenda was an enormous help in taking care of Mo and Mew. She came to our home, even though it was a little out of her service area, and made sure the girls were fed, walked, and played with. Brenda is fast on her feet and even noticed some things that we had forgotten to take care of before we left. Her communication skills are awesome and I felt like I knew what was going on at home while I was away. She even sent me a text on one of the first days of her visits to let me know that Mo and Mew were doing great. I really feel like my fur kids couldn't have been placed in better hands.
