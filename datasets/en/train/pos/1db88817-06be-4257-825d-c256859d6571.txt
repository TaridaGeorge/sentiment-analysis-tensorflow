While I have never shopped her for grocery's, I come in all the time for desert or lunch. All of their deserts are amazing. If you are looking for an interesting way to end a date, stop here and grab something from their European style bakery counter. They also have a really great salad bar for lunch where you can load up a salad to your liking (sold by the lb). The store is always clean and has a charming atmosphere.
