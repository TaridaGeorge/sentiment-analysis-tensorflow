I love the urban feel of this place, and the swanky Apple Store is a big enough draw for me! The place is brand new, so not too many things are going on yet, but more stores are opening all the time! There's now a really high-end iPic movie theater, a frozen yogurt place, a great Nike store, and much more to come in addition to H&M, West Elm, and the delicious Oakville Grocery Co. 
Parking is fine and it's easy to navigate. When you're done here you can walk to Kierland across the street, too! :)
Can't wait to see what they do here in a few years!
