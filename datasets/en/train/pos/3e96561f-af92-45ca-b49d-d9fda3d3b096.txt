I've been coming to this theatre for 15 years. Seen my most favorite films here. Price comparison : for the price of a ticket at amc or harkins at this theatre you can see 2 films. On Tuesday the price drops to $1.50 a ticket. If you bring a child under the age of 2 they are free. I saved $300 seeing films at this theatre last year alone. The staff are always friendly and nice. Some movie buffs themselves. I remember seeing "tomb raider" here. I come back for the memories and the smell of the popcorn. Or and for some reason , the cherry coke in the soda machine tastes fantastic. I don't know why. Glad to see after all this time that it's still open.
