My boyfriend, who introduced me to Vietnamese food, brought me here for the first time about 4 months ago.  It is not convenient to where we live, but it is worth the drive.  I order the #39 and he gets the #4.  The owner knows what we both order and its always delivered quickly.  Their Thai Iced Tea is amazing.
