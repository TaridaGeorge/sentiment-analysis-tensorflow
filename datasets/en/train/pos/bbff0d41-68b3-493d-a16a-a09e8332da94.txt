Jane, one of the owners, is one of the most gracious, and pleasant business owners I know.

Tanya is one of the most awesome bartenders (and friends) I've ever known.

I have been going for about a year, and I feel like this is my "Cheers". I know many of the other patrons, and I know the staff well. They always treat me like a friend, and the atmosphere is very welcoming.

They also have free WiFi, and one of the best patios in Phoenix.

They have free pool every Wednesday night, and pool tournaments every Tue. and Thurs., plus free ping pong on the patio, and foosball and darts in the front room.

They have several large-screen televisions, with various sports events on.

If you like small, semi-dive bars, and you've not been, stop in and tell 'em Vern sent you. Trust me, you'll like it.
