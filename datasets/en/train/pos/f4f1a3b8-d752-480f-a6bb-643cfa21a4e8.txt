This place is awesome!  Very no frills, but all that energy goes into the meats.  We tried the brisket, the pork loin, the ribs, and the jalapeno sausage...all served in a soda basket on butcher paper.  The brisket and the ribs were my favorite, but they were ALL very tasty, moist, and cooked with some of the best rub we've had anywhere.  They were hoppin for a Tuesday night, so it looks like word has spread.  The only so so thing was the potato salad, tasted storebought, will get the cole slaw next time.  The pecan pie was a great finish. We WILL be going back. This spot is definitely a new favorite!!!
