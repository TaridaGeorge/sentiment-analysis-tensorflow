I love this place and have shopped there since it opened.  Fresh and cheap veggies, fish and meats.  try the Basa, it's a great fish.  on one visit I went nuts and bought about 17 different kinds of packaged rice noodles.  I'm still plowing through them.  Don't expect to get milk and cheese here.  they don't have it.  but they've got tons of products from Asia, africa and all around the world.  it's awesome.  it used to be less crowded than LeeLee's but now that's not so true.
