This building has been a variety of restaurants, none were ever good enough to stick. 

If effort and results have anything to do with staying power we should have a winner this time around.

The food so far has been quite good in a nice setting with a good staff.

This restaurant is located in Estrella, once known as Estrella Mountain Ranch.

So take a drive up there and take a look around, a nice community with now a nice restaurant to enjoy a meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.

Oh and of course if you decide you must move up there, give me a shout and I will help you find just the right home for you.
