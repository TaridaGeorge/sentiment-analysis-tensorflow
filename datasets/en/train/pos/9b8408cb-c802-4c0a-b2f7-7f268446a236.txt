If you know what a real bagel is... then you will understand that this is where you can get a real bagel! Delicious NYC bagels, good selections of cream cheese, real Lox with capers even. not to mention a great basic egg bagel. Then you have enormous sized sandwiches. And red potato salad to die for. The fruit salad is also amazing fresh cut on site fruit- not your typical nasty slimy fruit salad. Great food. Best bagels. Good atmosphere and in a great location.
I took my Manhattanite-turned-Socal girl friend here and she was SO EXCITED to have a real NYC bagel. enough said!
