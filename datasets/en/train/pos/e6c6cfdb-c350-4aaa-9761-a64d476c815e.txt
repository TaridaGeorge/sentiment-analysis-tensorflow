Had an excellent lunch on my 1st visit recently. Appetizers of chicken livers and fried calamari ( more tentacles please ) were great, followed by a couple of sandwiches of gargantuan proportions. These were equally good as well as the service, which was the best I have seen in years. A couple of cold beers and we were good to go. Walked in through a kitchen entrance, a very nice touch. My visit was like stepping back in time, food, atmosphere and service from another era.  Lunch for two $104.00, not cheap, so talk some business and expense it. I loved the place and will be back.
