Had a bad toothache late on a Saturday afternoon.  Did an internet search for emergency dental and this office came up.  Called and was happily surprised at the response that I got.  The receptionist was wonderful and contacted the Dr.  She met me at the office and did an emergency procedure to take care of my pain immediately!  They were fantastic!  

I had never heard of this office before today and was not a previous patient and they took care of me like an old friend.  

I will certainly be returning to them for all my future dental work!
