we only came across this place because an acquaintance recommended it to us. I've lived up the street from this place for years and never knew it existed, it's quite the hole in the wall and easy to pass by.

The place was super clean and the owners did a wonderful job serving everyone in a timely manner and being super attentive. We felt so taken care of!! :) 

I thought the prices were a little on the high side but when they brought out our meal all I could say was "WHOAH!". The portion sizes were CRAZY awesome and my hubby and I could have really split one entree and still had some leftover. 

The food was fresh, the meat tender, the atmosphere pleasantly divine! 2 trips now and I'm such a fan! :D
