I always have tons of laughs and fun here. We saw Dave Attel in Dec. '08 and Christopher Titus in Feb. '09..both pretty hilarious. They have great tasting food but is a bit on the pricey side...their primerib with aus ju is to die for. I would like to see a little more room for tables and chairs, but I guess I like how we sit close to other couples and get to know them as well. I love this place!
