i have super dry skin and spa nordstrom seems to be the only place i can find this product called cheeky baby butter. it's 99% organic and 100% natural. 

i use it on my face instead of a night cream. my skin feels soooo much better and looks amazing the next day. 

so if you have super dry skin like me, this will save you.

this website has more info about their products.

ps. we replaced lotion with this bc i don't care what any product says about no 'residue' after there's always one. but this stuff just leaves your hands soft and delicious
