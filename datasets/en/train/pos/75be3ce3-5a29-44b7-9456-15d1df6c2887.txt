The largest selection of gelato in AZ, however the number of items offered at once has declined and these days they don't often have 64 available. I've seen everything from Twinkies to Pear to Pomegranate offered, there's always something new to choose from and sometimes as many as a half a dozen flavors that were not there last visit, no matter how recent last visit was. Always has several chocolate items, several green items, some sugar free items, lots of fruit flavors, plus they offer coffees, gelato cakes and cake slices, gelato cupcakes, and gelato shakes. Generous with samples,  patient while you're deciding, huge thumbs up! Great place for a date, to bring the kids to, ideal as your first gelato experience, etc.
