This is the warmest and nicest library I've ever been to. I grew up walking to the library every summer and making my parents drive me on the weekends (I wasn't allowed to watch tv as a kid, figures). Scottsdale has a great library. If you want to get in touch with your childhood, be ready to receive strange stares and glares from the workers when you enter the teen section.

Just saying...

Oh, and you can browse the internet, and print thing, AND a library card here is free. I've always had to pay $5 for a library card! Free is free, so go get one!
