I live in San Diego and needed help for my dad who has cancer and is doing chemo.  He doesn't keep the house clean even when he wasn't sick so it was going to be a huge job.  They sent 4 people and ended up needing six to get it done in 3 hours, all for a reasonable price considering what they can do.

  You would not believe how they turned a house that you wouldn't want to spend 5 minutes in to one that you can have a dinner in!  They used magic cleaners to turn a tub that had grout so discolored that you thought replacement was the only option.  A few hours with their magic work and it's new again. the same with the toilets, etc.etc... The whole place sparkles.  No job is too big for them.  We are so happy and amazed!  Thank you!!
