I recently signed up for their Native Hawaiian membership, which will get you a 50 minute basic full body massage or facial for $49 a month.  It's a great deal, and the quality of massage is so much better than the massages you will find at the discount massage clinics.  You can also use your $49 as a credit towards other services, which come at a discounted rate through the membership.  I'm happy to report that Steve is back at the Chandler location on certain days.  I'm pretty picky about my massages, and he is one of the best massage therapists I've encountered!
