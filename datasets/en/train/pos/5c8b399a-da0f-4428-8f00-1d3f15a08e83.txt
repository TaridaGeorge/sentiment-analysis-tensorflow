I swear I have a love hate relationship with this place. Everytime I go to just buy one bottle of wine, I end up with at least 4?!? Grrr But you can't help it. The prices are great and the wine is fabulous. Bevo Mo is ok but Total Wine rocks!!  Check out their prices on all the spirits, beers, etc. You will be amazed that's for sure.
