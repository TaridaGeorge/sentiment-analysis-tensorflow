I absolutely love the Farm.  It's a great place to bring out of town guests and always nice just to walk around on a day you don't have much else going on and enjoy the gardens and a yummy treat. I had plans to meet a friend for lunch here yesterday but she had to cancel and I thought why should I miss out, so I packed up the baby and we went ourselves. I had a delicious roasted vegetable and portobello sandwich which only could have been better if the veggies and mushrooms were warm.  After my sandwich we walked around and looked and the chickens, what was growing in the gardens and enjoyed some of the raspberry bar I bought with lunch. What a perfect lunch.
