It was love at first bite ! i will never forget my first In and Out burger (nothing like this place on the east coast) I was stunned at the simple menu ,and then stunned again at the utterly delicious, fresh as all hell -burger i was tasting ! and the fries rocked too. 

Less is definitely more ...this is why ,In and Out excels at what they do .you get a whole lotta, fresh ,yummy burger for a mere bag of shells .and why i keep coming back for more .this is the only " fast food " place ,i will stop into for a burger .

Mickey who ?
Burger what ? 
Wendy who? 

5 stars are for courteous service , well prepared fresh burgers and fries ,and overall price value .
