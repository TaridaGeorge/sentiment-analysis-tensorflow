Upgraded an extra star for being a magnificent place to watch the sunset.

There was only one other group on the rock at the time, and despite there being an airport nearby, it was pretty peaceful. When we were there the day before Thanksgiving, planes were landing and taking off nearly every couple minutes and it still didn't take away from our view.

P.S. If the lot's full, park in a nearby lot. Since the rangers do come around often, cars not parked in the officially painted spaces risk a $90 ticket.
