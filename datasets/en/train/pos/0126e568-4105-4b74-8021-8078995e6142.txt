I met a couple friends for drinks and appetizers and WOW, the food was amazing!  Very friendly staff, love the managers!  Atmosphere was perfect.  You must try the Greek Olive Lahvosh...the half order is huge!  Three of us shared it.  The Firecracker Shrimp is also a must try...I expected it to be spicy, but it was not and the flavors...well, it's just too good for words.
Can't wait to visit again!
