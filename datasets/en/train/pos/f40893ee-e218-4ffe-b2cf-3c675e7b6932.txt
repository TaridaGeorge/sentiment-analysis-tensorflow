My boyfriend and I LOOOOOOOVE this place. The food is really good and reasonably priced. We mostly go here for breakfast and make a special request for chocolate chip banana pancakes which are the best I've had anywhere, and I've done my share of requesting those in many places. The pastries are great, the sandwiches and salads are awesome. You can't go wrong. I brought my parents when they came to visit and they love it too. Friendly staff, free internets and outlets at every seat is icing on the cake.
