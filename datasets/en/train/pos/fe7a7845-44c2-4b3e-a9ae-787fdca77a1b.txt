We were lucky enough to go here the first week we moved here just over 3 years ago. Since that first time we have kept coming back even though we have moved further away. The service is also fantastic. The food is so good and there is a great selection. 

The only downfall would have to be the wait some times. If you try to avoid the Sat and Sun 9am rush then you will be good. They are extremely good at getting people in and out so even if you have to wait you can see that your turn is coming.
