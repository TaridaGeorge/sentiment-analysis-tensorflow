We love this place! Great vibe, amazing beer, and the food was just incredible. We started with the calamari, which is usually pretty standard. Theirs just blew me away it was so yummy. For entrees I got the seared Ahi Tuna, Mom got the baked Mac & Cheese(I gave her grief). Both were perfect. And the price point was pretty amazing a well.
The atmosphere is relaxed but still nice, Scottsdale flair without being pretentious. Plenty of TVs inside will make this a great place to be for games,(but still classy enough us ladies will want to come with). And hello, that patio is wonderful, plenty of seating outside and very cool features, can't wait to spend many Arizona summer nights sitting outside enjoying a cold beer.
