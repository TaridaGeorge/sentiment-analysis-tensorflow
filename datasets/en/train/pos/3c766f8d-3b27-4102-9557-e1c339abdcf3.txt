UFO is next to the drag shop I've previously reviewed and between the 2 shops,this dingy lil strip mall is being transformed into a destination spot.
It's unnassuming from the outset,but once you step inside and learn that everything is very gently used,then reworked and turned into individual conversation pieces of comfort and decor,you'd think it would be tres expensive!Not so!
The owner Leonardo has an eye for the eclectic and makes sure he keeps prices so affordable even the most frugal would be designer can bring something home.
There's everything from home furnishings to objects de art and one of a kind paintings that in themselves make amazing accent pieces.
The staff is inviting,and it's just a really cool space to be in.
Go.Go now.
