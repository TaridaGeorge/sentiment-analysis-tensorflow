I never write these things. But I have to say that you will not be disappointed with Paletas Betty. Especially with the weather right now, it is a delicious and healthy treat, made with seasonal ingredients. I highly recommend the lim√≥n amarillo when in season. Delicious frozen lemondade/lemon drop on a stick, tossed in a sugar rub. It is for certain served in heaven. That is all.

P.S. check out the hours, yo. You know what's up.
