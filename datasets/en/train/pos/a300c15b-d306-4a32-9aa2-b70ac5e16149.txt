The best salsa in town, for their style (blended restaurant). Bobette the owner, and salsa genius is usually there and I believe that the rest of her family helps her run the place.
So beyond the salsa, it's one of those convenience stores that has everything, from booze to snacks to slush puppies, a real throwback to the mid-90s and it seems like they haven't raised their prices since then. The salsa runs $2 for 8oz and $5 for 32oz, and they had a special the other day, 12-32oz Budweiser bottles for $12, but that sold out quick and now I have a fridge full of Buds.
One more thing, it's a little set back from the McDowell and honestly never noticed it until my friend told me about, even though I live down the street. And if there's a line of cars, park and go inside.
