If I could have their salad forever my life would be complete. It has chickpeas, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, olives, mushrooms, cucumber, feta and the most amazing house dressing....for months I went here thinking the Classic Euro pizza was the end all be all but that salad changed my world. 

Side note: don't sit at those little tables by the bar, it really ruins the experience. 

Slight annoyance, there are coupons for Nello's in the entertainment book, but they wont work at this location.
