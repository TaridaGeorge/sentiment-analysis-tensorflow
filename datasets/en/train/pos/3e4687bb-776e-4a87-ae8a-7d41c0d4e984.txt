My new favorite local wine bar and hang out! 
I called ahead because I have food allergies and wanted to ask a few questions- host that answered was very nice and helpful. Same when we got there- everyone working was happy, upbeat and friendly. Nice live band but not so loud you couldn't talk. The waitress brought me 2 wines to taste before I ordered a bottle. Food was very good and priced right. Nice atmostphere. We will be back on a regular basis!
