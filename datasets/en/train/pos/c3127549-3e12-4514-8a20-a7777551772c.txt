I love this place and it's by far the best Indian food in the valley that we have found.  The owner is always there to greet you with a smile and you'll be amazed by how many of the patrons he knows personally.  

The dishes are wonderful with plenty of food to be taken home.  I would highly recommend this hidden gem of a restaurant.
