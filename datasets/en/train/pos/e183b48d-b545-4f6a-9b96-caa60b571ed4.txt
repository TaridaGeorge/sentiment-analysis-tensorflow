A friend brought me here and everything I had was excellent. We ordered the roasted brussels sprouts, roasted corn pizza and a meat/cheese ravioli with some sort of cranberry sauce (it was a special). All were super delicious. I also recommend the peppered pear martini. I'd go back in a heartbeat, I want to try everything else on the menu!

Also, the valet parking is super handy since the parking lot is so small. I'm happy to hand over my keys and let someone else take care of it.
