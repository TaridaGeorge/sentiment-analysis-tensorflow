Forget Chili's, forget the others... it could be the beer, but I believe this is the best BBQ I've ever had in my life. I can't believe this place has been here for a year and a half and nobody told me about it. 

The service is great, the salad is better than most, and the BBQ... Oh, the BBQ. 

They also have an old school arcade game. Burgertime anyone ?. Tons of fun. 

Hands down, try this place at least twice.

Oh yeah, Moose Drool on tap!!

And a patio where you can enjoy your drink while doing the tobacco thing.
