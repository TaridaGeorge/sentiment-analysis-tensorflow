This is one of my favorite breakfast eaterys in the valley. they know my order by heart and the staff is so nice! its clean bright and very modern inside. great music everyday and cartoons sports and news on all the tv's ...a little bit for everyone! i wish it was a tad closer to my house for when schools in its harder for me to get there. they need to open more locations!! great place definitly in my top five for breakfasts in the counrty
