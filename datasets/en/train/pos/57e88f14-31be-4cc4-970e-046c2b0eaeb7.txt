Dr. Fern was referred by friends who have been seeing when they need to for many years, so I tried him out, due to a recent injury. He has really helped me as well. He is skilled Doctor with premium equipment and staff. Tanya give a excellent message as well.

I have seen many Chiropractors over the last 30 years due to various injuries. All of varying skill levels. I'm a big & tall guy and most Chiropractors are useless with us. He had no problem.
