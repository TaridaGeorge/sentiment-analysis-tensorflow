Have been back to L'Amore since my first review and things still as wonderful as ever.   This time I tried the seafood special, which was the Sole.   It was prepared just right with a great lemon caper sauce.   The salad and sides included with the dish were fantastic as usual.   Can't wait to go back here again and again.    Just so you know they sometimes have specials on "Local Dines" where you can get $40.00 voucher for $20.00.
