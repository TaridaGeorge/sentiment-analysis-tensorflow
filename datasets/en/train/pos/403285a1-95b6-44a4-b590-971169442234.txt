Yeah, the butter burgers are great, but that is just the beginning. The onion rings are Fabulous! The concrete mixers have many more options that Dairy Queen, the side salads are worth a mention for the healthy alternative. They even have green beans as a side dish. OK, it is fast food, but good fast food that does not taste processed. (McDonald's and Burger King)

It is as good at is gets for taste, value and menu. There is not a more robust fast food offering that I am aware of.
