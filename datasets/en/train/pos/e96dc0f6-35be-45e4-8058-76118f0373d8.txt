I love this place!!  It is a little too pricey for me to go too often, though.  Sometimes I will go here when I feel like I deserve a nice night out.  I have never been to Chicago, but I have had plenty of Chicago style pizza.  This is my favorite Chicago style pizza out of all I've ever had.  I also saw an employee from here wearing their work shirt out at a place I worked at.   I told them that I love their pizza, and the man looked so happy that I said that.  You can tell the workers take pride in their pizza and appreciate their customers.  :)  There's nothing like the feeling of eating somewhere that you feel appreciated at.  I highly recommend trying this sometime. :)
