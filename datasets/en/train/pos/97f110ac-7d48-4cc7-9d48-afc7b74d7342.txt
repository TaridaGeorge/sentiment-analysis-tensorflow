Desert Club is a fabulous place to live.  The staff is always helpful and willing to go the extra mile.  There maintence is on time and helpful and they even send you an email update to see if you liked your service .  The rent can be paid online which is an amazing feature. The rates are very affordable and fair, especially for being in such a great location.  We also love the pool and the gym.  It is always clean and beautiful.  i would recommend this place to anyone!
