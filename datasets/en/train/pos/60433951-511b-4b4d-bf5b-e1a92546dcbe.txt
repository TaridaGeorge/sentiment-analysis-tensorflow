WHAT A GREAT PLACE FOR KIDS!!!!  I came here tonight to dine and what a surprisingly kid friendly place. I thought there would be no place to bring the kids in a fancy, upscale restaurant like this, but there were other toddlers yelling and screaming in the bar. So I let my kids run around too.  I'm sure nobody in the dining area minded. And even the teens get a great place to hang out adjacent to the bar! Tonight was American Idol night, and they let us turn up the volume on the TV sets in the dining area. Just a little louvred door was pulled shut to help quiet the 80 decibel noise from the guests. I'm sure they didn't mind. The food was deeee lish!!
