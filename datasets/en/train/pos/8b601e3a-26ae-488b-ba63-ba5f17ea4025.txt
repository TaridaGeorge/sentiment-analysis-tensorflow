I know that locksmiths are a dime a dozen but when searching for a locksmith on Yelp, nothing really stood out UNTIL I came across Mr. Lockout.  A perfect name to my locked-out-of-my-house situation.  

I gave Mr. Lockout a try and received great and speedy service at very competitive prices.  Mr. Lockout was even able to make me extra keys - - as many as I wanted.  Yippee - no need to make a special trip to Home Depot or Lowe's!
