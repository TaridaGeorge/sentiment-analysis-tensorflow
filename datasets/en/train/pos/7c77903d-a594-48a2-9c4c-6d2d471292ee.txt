This is my local watering hole. Jody and his wife are the new owners and it has gotten a lot More drama free and chill. I love this place the food is always amazing, from there wings, to sliders, to California chicken sandwhich to their burgers. Happy hour till 6, and everyone is friendly... This place is like Cheers. This place is amazing during football season. They have nice flat screens everywhere, so you can watch all the games. I would truly suggest to stop by for a brewja or some chow. Its worth it.
