My boyfriend and I came here for an early dinner. Neither of us know much about Ethiopian food so we opted for the Lalibela Exclusive to share. It was a little more pricey but came with tons of food and choices. We dominated the entire meal and then shared a slice of tiramisu made homemade by our waiter. The service was great and the atmosphere authentic. We'll be coming back!
