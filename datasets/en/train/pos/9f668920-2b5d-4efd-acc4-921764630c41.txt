"Welcome to Ultra Star. May I take your order?"

Seriously, we have our own personal waiter?

"Here's our menu. Would you something to drink?"

Wait, you serve wine and beer? By the way, your seats are ridiculous. Did you contract with an airline to purchase from their first class seat vendor? Oh, and loved that only 40 people - all over 21-years old - were in the theater. And all the seats are set as doubles? Perf.

Too bad there isn't one in Nashville. I'd be there every weekend.

"Ma'am, how was your panini?"

Perf I tell you, absolutely perf.
