At first service was a little slow because they were busy. When we received our meal though none of that mattered. The presentation was amazing and once we bit into the sushi all four adults agreed it was the best sushi we had ever had. Our favorite had to be the checker board, the tuna melted in our mouth like butter. Even the kids loved their chicken cutlets and Udon noodles. From now on we will definitely be making the drive from Casa Grande to Mikado for our sushi.
