We showed up at 2 am after a grueling 11 hour drive through LA traffic. The man working at the front desk welcomed us with bottled water, complimented the cuteness of our dog, waived the pet fee, gave us a deal on the rate of the room, and free access to the wifi network. The room was impeccably clean, the bathroom was a little tight but stylish and clean, the bedding was really soft and fluffy, the coffee maker was AWESOME (just remember to unplug as to not blow the circuit). 

We were visiting for an event which was held on the property: the service was excellent. Polite, attentive, and quick on their feet. I left wondering why I hadn't stayed in a Hilton before. It was a great surprise after all that driving and definitely worth the trip.
