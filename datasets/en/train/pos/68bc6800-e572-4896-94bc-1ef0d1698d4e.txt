Alessia's staff, chef and owner are AMAZING!! We were referred to Alesia's and are back as often as we can (almost every weekend).  We love the wine recommendations, the food is out of this world and we can't wait to see the weekend specials!  Thanks for making this a fun and wonderful dining experience.  You had us at "Hello"!
