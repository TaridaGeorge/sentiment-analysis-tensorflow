Finally, a legitimate cheese shop with a great selection of wine, meats, pasta and gifts!  Great shop to run in and grab a fabulous gift basket to go for that perfect hostess gift or just because.

We loved our little 4 cheese platter with nuts, yummy olives, crackers and fruit.
Very nice staff and a clean small setting for either a Happy Hour or a light meal with a stellar glass of wine to accompany.

They are still small, but you have to start somewhere and although limited seating their selection of cheese, wine and meats is awesome and we managed to find a table.  

You can eat inside or out and I suggest you sip on your first glass of wine or beer to let the cheese get to the right temp that the flavors come out and BAM....you'll love this little spot.


Thank you Wedge & Bottle!
