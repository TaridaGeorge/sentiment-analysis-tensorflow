Wonderful ambience, great food, friendly service. I loved selecting my entree and sides from the glass case. First time I've ever had gelato-how did I live without it? And the coffee was great.
I've been there twice, both time with groups. We phoned ahead, they saved us the back room, and we had a meeting over the meal.
