LOVE this place!  
-Service was very friendly & professional.
-Our truck was FULL of sand from dune trips and short dog hair from my bullmastiff.  They did an excellent job cleaning it up inside and out.
-Washed by hand and F350 fits comfortably on their conveyer.
-Very fair prices!  (FYI: they give a discount for early birds & 1st timers)
