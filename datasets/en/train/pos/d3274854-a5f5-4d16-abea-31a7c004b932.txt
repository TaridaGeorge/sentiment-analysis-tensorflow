I  tried Oregano's for the first time recently and was amazed by the quality of food and portion sizes that they give! I got the bruschetta and the Originals Salad in the junior size + Chicken and was absolutely stuffed! The food is so delicious it made it as the first entry on my food blog! I have been in AZ twice in the last month and made sure to go back for the second time.
