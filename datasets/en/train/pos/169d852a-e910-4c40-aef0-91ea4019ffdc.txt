Wow sign me up! If only I lived in Tempe and could pay just $50 for such a great facility. Here in San Fran the only thing that compares is the Bay Club and it's monthly dues are about $125! If I ever leave here I hope to find a Life Time Fitness close by. I found the facilities to be very clean. Love the indoor pools and the outdoor pools. It is a great place to beat the heat in Tempe for sure.
