I love Dr. Chris and his staff!  The front desk has had a little turnover recently, so I'm not as familiar with them yet, but I am usually greeted by name when I go in there.  Nonetheless, the front desk is always very nice, and even offer you a bottle of water when you walk in.  The dental assistants and hygienists are also very nice and knowledgeable.  The office is clean, which is always a plus, and Dr. Chris makes you feel very comfortable when you're there.  I have in the past, and will definitely continue to recommend Dr. Chris to my friends!
