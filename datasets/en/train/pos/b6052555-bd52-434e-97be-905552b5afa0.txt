Friends and I had lunch at Windsor last week and were wow'd by the delish food! ...but let's talk drinks first! $5 pitchers (roughly 2.5 beers) from 11-5 - HECK YES! Ok now onto food. I had a burger windsor style - soooooo tasty and the burger was cooked perfectly. For my side I had mac and cheese which was a nice original version with more of a white cheddar base and bread crumbs - also yum! Everyone enjoyed their food and the ambience was nothing sort of trendy/hipster - a great place to catch up with friends! I'd highly recommend Windsor :)
