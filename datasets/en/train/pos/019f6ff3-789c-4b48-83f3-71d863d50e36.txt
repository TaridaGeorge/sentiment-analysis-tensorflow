I recently moved within just a few miles of Paws Salon, so I thought I would try them out based on the reviews here and convenience. What can I say, they have set the bar at a whole new level for me as they did a great job with my Cairn Terrier. The location is also very welcoming. My dog, usually scared to go to the Petsmart groomer, was in good spirits when I dropped her off and picked her up. Another bonus is the turnaround time.... I had her back in just over a couple hours, it was great! Lastly, I would like to say I appreciate how they price accordingly to the size of the breed. Being that my dog is smaller, I found the price more reasonable than anywhere else I have taken her. I will continue to use Paws Salon and I highly recommend them!
