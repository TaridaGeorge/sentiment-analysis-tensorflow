While visiting friends in Scottsdale (from Seattle, where we are spoiled with good Thai food) we got a craving and our friends suggested Thai House. Everything was so good! I had the lunch special with panang curry. Could have been a little spicier (though I did only order 2 star) but otherwise it was perfect. Will be sure to come back here on my next trip to Phoenix!!!
