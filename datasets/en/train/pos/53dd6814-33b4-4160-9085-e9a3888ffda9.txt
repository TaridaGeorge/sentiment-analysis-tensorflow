Bootlegger (Turkey/Roast Beef, extra beef plus bacon). I had never had this particular sandwich place before. They may be huge in the midwest but there are only  a few of them in Phoenix. 

Much better than Subway or Quizno's. The bread is fabulous and the price is very similar. It was excellent and I will drive the 5-6miles to go get it. Nothing negative about the food. Hope they put one in mid-west phoenix :)
