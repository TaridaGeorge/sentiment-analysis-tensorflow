One of our favorite spots.  Four Peaks consistently delivers superior food and drink with outstanding service.  Love all the handcrafted beers, which is to be expected from a brewpub.  But two things really distinguish Four Peaks -  food and service.  The food is inventive, tasty, and consistently excellent.  Also love the daily food specials.  

The people are incredibly friendly, helpful, and service is stellar.  You will not be disappointed.
