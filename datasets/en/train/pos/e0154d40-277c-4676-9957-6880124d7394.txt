My friend lives walking distance from here, so we like to reward ourselves with carne asada fries and an horchata every time we come, even when we drive. Gosh darn, they are addictive! 
If you don't know what they are its simple: take ordinary french fries and add carne asada, guacamole, sour cream and cheese! Heaven on a Styrofoam plate! 

However, if thats not quite your speed, they have a melody of other wonderful mexican food! Try the breakfast burrito! Even the one without meet! its delicious!
