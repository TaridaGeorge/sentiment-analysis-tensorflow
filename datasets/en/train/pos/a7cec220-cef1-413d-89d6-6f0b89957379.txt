I am a G-Spot addict!  Had to limit myself from going every week though.  

Took the hubby there after a date night the other weekend.  It was his first time to try gelato.  He's a ColdStone guy 100% and he really enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato!  

The focaccia flatbread is awesome!!!  And I would post a photo of the Focaccia Flatbread I got earlier to eat along with my homemade salad, but (in the words of LOLCat) "I eated it" and forgot to take a photo first.   :)

My favorite salad dressing is the champagne vinegarette!  
The mintchip gelato is freaking awesome!  
The stracciatella gelato mixed with mint - even better!!!  

G-Spot is so awesome, that I just walked back over and got my Mint / Stracciatella combo.  Baby C wanted something sweet!   :D
