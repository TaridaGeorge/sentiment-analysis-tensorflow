I LOVE THIS PLACE! The service was great here, everyone is so nice and helpful. I went here for only one thing and it was the waffle dog. I definitely recommend it to everyone! The portions are relatively large so the pricing isn't bad. Its a really laid back environment where sitting at the bar isn't bad. Its gets pretty packed just before noon, so get there early.
