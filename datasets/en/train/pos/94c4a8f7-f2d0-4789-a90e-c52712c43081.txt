We eat lunch at Wildflower several times a week. The staff is outstanding, as is the food. Nobody in town makes salads that even come close to Wildflower! I only wish they would bring back the Caribbean Cobb Salad--it was wonderful--but the others are good, too. Our favorite soup is the vegetarian vegetable. Some of the soups are a bit esoteric, but give them a try! If anything there is not to your liking, the staff will bend over backwards to make it right. They know us by name and greet us with a smile every time. I only wish we lived a little closer....It does get crowded at this Chandler Mall location around lunchtime--from 11:30 to 1:15, so go early for lunch. Also, weekend and holiday mornings are crowded with the breakfast bunch. I can't say enough good things about this place and its food and staff.
