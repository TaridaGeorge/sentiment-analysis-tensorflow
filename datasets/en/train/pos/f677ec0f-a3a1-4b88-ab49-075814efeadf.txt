I've been going to Big Wong for at least a decade (even in the old location) and am very sad to hear that they are closing/closed.

Gina and the rest of the staff have always treated me like family and I can't believe that it's going to be gone.

In all that time, I have NEVER EVER had a bad dish. EVER. I've eaten practically the entire menu and visited so often when I lived closer that they would put in my appetizer order before I even got a table. Many of my friends were introduced to this place by me, and when visiting from as far away as Alaksa would ask me to go there when in town.

If they do reopen somewhere else, I'll be 1st in line for some paper wrapped chicken!
