So far this is the best hamburger in Phoenix that i have found.  I am a big fan of how they cook them.  they are actually cooked over a wood grill!!!  this is not your typical McDonalds grill... beacuse of this the burgers have a unique flavor...  once you get your burger you walk to the hamburger bar where you put on it what you like... much like fudruckers, but much more original!  I am also a fan of their fries... the place is pretty easy to get in and out of... 

do yourself a favor and try this place!
