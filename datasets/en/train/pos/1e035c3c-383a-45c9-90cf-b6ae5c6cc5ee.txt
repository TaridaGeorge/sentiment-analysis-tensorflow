I've had two experiences here.  The first was a few years ago - body damage caused to my car by another party.  They fixed it nicely and quickly.  No complaints.

Early last year we got a brand new truck.  My husband scraped the entire drivers side with the riding lawnmower and left a long, black streak across it.  I took it in for an estimate to get it buffed out and they did it for me for free while I waited.  There are still scratches you can barely in the paint from the lawnmower, but the nasty black streak is gone.  Exceptional service - if we ever have another "incident" I will surely return.
