Favorite new bar in town.

$5 pitchers of beer and cocktails for happy hour? Great prices the rest of the time? Yeah, I'm sold.

Amazing food, better than you should be able to find at a local, laid back place at prices like this. If its your first time, order one or all of these:

Russian Roulettes - sometimes mild, sometimes spicy roasted peppers.
Deviled egg dip - deviled egg, bacon and home made kettle chips. Yes.
Porkwich - do you need a description? PORKWICH. Bacon, ham, pulled pork, gold bbq sauce! Bring your cardiologist.

For sides, the Kale salad is insanely good, and their mac 'n cheese is enough to sate this m&c snob!
