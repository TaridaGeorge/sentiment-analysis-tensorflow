Chrissy not only offers group classes and individual training sessions, but she also has Mommie and Me classes and summer exercise classes for kids. When it is so hot in the summer and kids only want to sit inside and play video games that is the time to enroll them in Chrissy's summer program. The kids think they are playing games, but in reality they are exercising their butts off! The best part for Mom is the kids are tired in the afternoon and want to rest! 
Chrissy's classes are fun and she will push you to do your best, whether you are a beginner or seasoned student. She always seems to come up with new torturous exercises and she does it all with a smile!!
