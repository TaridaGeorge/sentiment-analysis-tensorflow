Absolutely perfect! I hosted an event here earlier this week for a party of 60. From the rooms, to the food, to the spa....I can't think of one thing that could've been better. We host many events throughout the year at luxury properties and this was the best one in the past 5 years. This is what hospitality should be! Special shout out to the group sales staff (Claudia Lockwood) and the manager of IlTerrazzo (Katherine) for amazing  group event planning. And, a special thank you to Tom Buckley for the quick a/v solution at the last minute. From the check in process to the servers....they were all spot on! We will certainly be hosting more events and I can't wait to
 visit again with my family.
