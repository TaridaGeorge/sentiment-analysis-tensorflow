This small shop is big on great coffee and friendly service! My kids are quietly working on homework while we sip on our iced drinks. The atmosphere is relaxing and cozy. I love the eclectic look and felt at home as soon as we walked through the door. Seriously, though, the coffee is fantastic. Locally roasted and internationally award winning, the beans are top quality, which you can tell with the first sip of any of their espresso drinks. I am definitely making this a frequent stop!
