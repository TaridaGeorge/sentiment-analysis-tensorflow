Shelley Sikora has to be one of Phoenix's most passionate restaurateurs. She has a remarkable history managing a restaurant empire and also has more than one published cookbook. She was one of 34 U.S. chefs chosen to appear in the 2006 IACP cookbook, "For the Love of Food". Her newest cookbook called "Skinny Bread", 100 Amazing Ways to make Flatbread. I'm looking forward to reading.

Bobby Q's serves up authentic dry rubbed meats cooked to perfection, and spicy sauces. Walking in, it feels very comfortable. The decor has always been outstanding for the past twenty years. The attentive service is solid.

I could rave about dinner but let me just say, this house is in the top 5 'best BBQ' In AZ. Want to be #1 on my list, let's have live Blues. And I almost forgot to mention the cornbread and donuts.
