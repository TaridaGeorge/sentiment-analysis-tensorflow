So. Much. Fun.

We really thought we wouldve been in the top 2 since the majority of places we went told us that we were the 1st people they saw, but a big congrats to the actual winners anyway. ;)

Lindsey U. and I had so much stinkin fun trying to figure out the clues and running around Old Town. We discovered a few places that we'd never heard of that we'll likely be back to, finally made it to a few places we'd heard of but never made it to before Sun, and were "required to visit at least two old faves.

Cant wait for the next one! Thanks Lindsey and Local First!
