I finally detoured myself down 7th St yesterday morning and stopped here.  Got a great iced soy latte and a mango scone.  Yum.  Stopped there again today and got a hot soy latte and a cranberry walnut scone with lime glaze...seriously yum.  Cute place, good art, friendly staff, easy parking, great soy lattes, great scones = my new favorite coffee shop.  And free wi-fi and a lovely patio!
