This is Arizona's best kept secret.  When I bring friends and family visiting from out of town to LGO, they all tend to marvel.  And that makes me feel like a proud resident of AZ even though I'm a fairly new transplant and still feel like an "alien" out here.  I love the crepe, french pancake.  However, it's annoying that they always look at me crazy when I order it and say it like the French, especially cause I speak French.  

I love the music, food, vibe and ambiance.  It's a happy place.
