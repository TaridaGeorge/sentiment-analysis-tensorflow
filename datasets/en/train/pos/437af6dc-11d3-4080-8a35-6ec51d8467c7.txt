Great Barbershop!  All of the Barbers are friendly and easy-going.  I enjoy going here monthly for a haircut and sometimes a shave too.

If you try this place once, I'm sure you will be a repeat customer.  

Saturdays get busy with walk-ins, but it's a great place to relax a bit before your haircut.  If you are in a hurry, try weekdays in the late afternoon.
