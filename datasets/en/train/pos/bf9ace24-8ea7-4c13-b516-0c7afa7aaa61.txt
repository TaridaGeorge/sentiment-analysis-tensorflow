Ahhh the Yard House, its good for a date or for family. Been here for both many times and loved it. Their menu is quite diverse, usually offering something for everyone. I love their chicken nachos, being someone who hates nachos, that says a lot. There is no liquid cheese involved! It's a heap of grilled chicken, beans, sour cream, guacamole, fresh shredded cheese that's melted, on chips. I also love their turkey club. The bread is perfectly toasted, turkey is juicy, bacon is crispy, and avacado is creamy. Their garlic parmesan fries are to die for. I did not care too much for their pizza though, had the margarita and I've had better. Service is always good and the ambiance is nice.
