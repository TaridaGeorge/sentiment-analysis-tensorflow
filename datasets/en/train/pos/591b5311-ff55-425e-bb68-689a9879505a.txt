I came in today with a group of 22 colleagues for a last minute holiday lunch. The service was outstanding even with such a large group. Drinks were kept full and the food came out fast! As always, the food was great and at the end, Chip (our server) split the bill for all guests! I don't know another restaurant that would have accommodated us the way they did!
