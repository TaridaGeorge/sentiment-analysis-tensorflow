I had never heard of this place. I became a member of Open Table and they kept recommending it. I am very glad I decided to make the reservation for The Valenite's Weekend. The menu ran Saturday, Sunday and Monday so that was nice. 

The dinner included 3 courses. A glass of champagne was not included with meal.

We had a table right next to the floor-to-ceiling windows providing spectacular views of the valley of the sun. If you don't get a window seat, don't worry--the tiered dining room affords great views from every table.
 
Happy Valentine's Day!!! Make it special...
