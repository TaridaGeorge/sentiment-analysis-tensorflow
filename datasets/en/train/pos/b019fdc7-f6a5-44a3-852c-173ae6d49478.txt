I come in here to get a little work done a few times a week. The people are friendly. The coffee is great. I usually don't order food at a coffee shop because I've always been disappointed. Today I was super hungry so I ordered the Caprese Melt. To my surprise it was huge and tasted amazing. Under $7.
