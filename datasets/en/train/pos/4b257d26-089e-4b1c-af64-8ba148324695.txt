Ahhhhmazing! This place is so yummy and fresh!  I've had the salad (which they serve with a fresh made tortilla placed on the bottom), the tacos, the quesadillas, and the enchiladas. Was kind of meh about the enchiladas, but the grilled chicken and the sweet pork are fantastic in the tacos, salad and quesadillas. The setup is Chipotle-style in that you can pick your beans, rice and extras, but it was so immensely better than Chipotle. The ingredients are quality and fresh and the service is quick and friendly. If you're looking for a healthier option, this is the place to go!
