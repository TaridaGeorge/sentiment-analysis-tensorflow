Excellent restaurant! I am a vegetarian and there are tons of options on the menu, even for vegan or gluten free diets. Everything is so fresh and delicious. We went with a group for brunch and not a single person left unsatisfied. You have to order the banana quinoa Johnny cakes or an omelet, they are divine. Even the juice/smoothie menu looked great.

The staff is quick and friendly and the food is even better! My favorite part is if you sit inside, you can see all of the food being prepped right in front of you. Quality ingredients and great taste/prices. Even if you aren't observing a special diet, I highly recommend True Food Kitchen for any meal of the day!
