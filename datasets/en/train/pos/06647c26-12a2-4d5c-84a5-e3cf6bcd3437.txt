I would hardly call this a hike. This is straight up rock climbing minus the harness and helmet! If you have a fear of heights, I don't suggest this route. What an adventure though! I couldn't believe some of the ages of little kids climbing. The trail we chose (Echo) was awesome, scary, difficult and rewarding all in one. There are two points on the mountain with handrails. I suggest using them. My boyfriend climbed up the mountain like some sort of monkey--no fear. I was a bit more cautious, planning out my every step. Oh, and on the way down, don't be afraid to go on your butt. Overall it was a great workout and a fun time. I can't wait to go back next time I'm visiting Arizona.
