Great spot in Downtown Phx! I got there almost by accident, tried the Chai-espresso and its delicious! The staff was really nice, the place has a good vibe, free and open wi-fi, great location.... I love it! 
I don't like that they close at 4pm on Fridays and at 1pm on Sat... They should close everyday at 8pm and even on Sundays it should be open.
