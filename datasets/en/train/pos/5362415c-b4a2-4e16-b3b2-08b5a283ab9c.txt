great food, totally legit vietnamese food. little hole in the wall for sure. we had to wait about 10-15 mins for a table for 4 people. fast and efficient staff. we ordered spring rolls and everyone got pho. the vietnamese iced coffee was delicious. this was our first time here and def. will come back for pho. not to mention its authentic and cheap! perfect lunch on a weekend with friends.
