Now I just recently been collecting records for a hobby because I dig old music. I collect records mostly from the 70s to 80s (Why 80's you ask? Because 80s rock rules and I don't like cassettes much). So I found this place because I went to check out Naked Daves music because of some promotion they were having with a musician doing a meet and greet.  Anyways I went into this place, and it's what you would expect for a lot of used records, tapes, etc etc. I really like the fact that you can find decent/good quality records for under a dollar (if already hasn't been picked up).
