They always have great new things to try... visit this location every week and Im never disappointed. 

Not only are Fresh and Easy stores cheap to begin with, but they run some of the best deals weekly in town. Not to mention they have a discounted section in every store. Luv the grab-and Go section for when Im in a hurry for a lunch or dinner...they are very good. Pizzas are excellent as welll as the Hummas and their brand of chips.

Can sign up online for coupons  = $6 off of a $30 purchase which make good deals even better....amazing.
