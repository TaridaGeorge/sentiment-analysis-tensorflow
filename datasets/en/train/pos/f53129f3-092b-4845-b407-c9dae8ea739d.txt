I have been here several times when I was visiting my inlaws in Arizona. I was pleasantly surprised. The last thing that expected was decent italian food in the middle of the desert. They proved me wrong. The food is comparable to any high end italian place here in NJ. The service is also very good too. I am looking forward to visiting here the next time that I am in Arizona.
