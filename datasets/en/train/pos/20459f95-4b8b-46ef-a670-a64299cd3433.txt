Today I changed my wheels and I had to break the lug lock on the wheel since I don't have the key. I went to all other places but they said they can't break it. I went to this one because the rate from other site was all good and it really was. They broke my locks for $5 each. I had to replace all 4 wheels with my new wheels and it was free!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! $20 for breaking the lug nut lock and changing all 4 wheels. I think I will never find a deal like this. Their customer service was very good. All friendly and professional.
