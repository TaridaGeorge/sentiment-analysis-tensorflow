This is hands-down still my favorite Thai restaurant in the Phoenix area. 

All I need to say is "I love curry", and they by far have the best green curry in town. 

The food is consistently amazing and the portions are very generous (I usually get a second meal out of my entree leftovers), and I have never been disappointed
