Excellent food, great service, friendly staff, reasonable prices.  What else to say?  Probably would be busier if location wasn't in a strip mall, although it gets pretty full on Friday and Saturday nights.  I prefer the Fra Diavolo dish myself, had that tonight while my boys had individual pizzas.  Will definitely go back, prefer these types of restaurants much more than Olive Garden or other chain restaurants.
