I have been coming to this place for at least 3 years and still can't get enough. It's an odd location, considering they're right next door to another Chinese Restaurant, but the food here is fantastic.

The service is always quick and the food is delicious, my fave: Beef Chow Fun. This is one place I don't mind picking up the tab :)
