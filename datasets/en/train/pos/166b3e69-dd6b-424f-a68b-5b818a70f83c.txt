My preferred bookstore, they have a very good selection of books on Celtic Paganism. The atmosphere is excellent, staff always helpful, prices are good, and, the place is ACTUALLY organized. You can occasionally find some great finds. Recently I found a old leather bound version of To Kill A Mockingbird for $8. I always tour the discount tables out front featuring some great discounted books. Sometimes if you find a title you like you can dig the stack and find a trade in version, which will save you a bit. There is plenty of parking, but getting a spot close can be challenging on popular days.
