Cornish Pasty is one of my favorite restaurants, and the ambiance is great, whether it's for a quiet lunch or Happy Hour on Friday with the place crowded. The food is always outstanding, and the staff is so chill and laid back.

Try the Chicken Pesto pasty, and the Cinnamon Apple Pasty for dessert. nom nom!
