I've been Crossfitting for almost a year now and have visited quite a few boxes while traveling on business. I have to say that if you are looking for a box that embodies what Crossfit really is, you found it right here at CF Southwest. Ken is very gracious to his guests and extremely attentive to his members. I will go out of my way to make it to CF Southwest every time I am in the area. Thanks for everything!
