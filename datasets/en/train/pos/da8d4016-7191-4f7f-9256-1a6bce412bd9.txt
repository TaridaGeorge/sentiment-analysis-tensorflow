When you've got an itch for something better than the norm- The Vig is it. If you enjoy salmon, I highly recommend the Achiote Salmon. It was perfectly cooked without being fishy and the sweet corn cake was divine. Topped with a fresh mango salsa, this meal couldn't have been any better. Mark and I  shared a bottle of the Sextant Zin and it didn't disappoint. Sextant was rich and jammy, complimenting the entree perfectly. The vibe there was cool, and low-key--not over the top, like so many places hedging Scottsdale. Outdoors on the patio at The Vig is the epitome of relaxation when the temps are lower and the heat lamps are burning.
