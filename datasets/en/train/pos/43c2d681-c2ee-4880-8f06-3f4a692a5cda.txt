Great Target. You can't beat the clearance items in this store. BBQ for $12.00 a couple of weeks ago. The checkout is never short on cashiers so the wait is rarely longer than  a couple of minutes. LOVE the pharmacy.  I've never waited longer than 10 minutes, even at a busy time. The prices can be 10% - 20% less on some drugs than the corner Walgreen along with a far better staff.  Not a big difference when you have low co-pay insurance but if your retired parents are in the Medicare Donut hole and you're paying full retail, 20% less on a $500 prescription is always appreciated.
