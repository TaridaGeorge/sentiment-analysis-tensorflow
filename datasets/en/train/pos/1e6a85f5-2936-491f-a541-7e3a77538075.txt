Some of the best food in Tempe. They have everything from breakfast to sandwiches to salads to appetizers (most in the 6$-8$ range).  I personally don't like coffee but I'm told their coffee is great too. Amazing atmosphere and a great place to hang out or get some work done. Free WiFi and they even have iTunes DJ setup so if you have an iPhone you can vote on the songs that will play next while you enjoy your time at Brosenbrus.
