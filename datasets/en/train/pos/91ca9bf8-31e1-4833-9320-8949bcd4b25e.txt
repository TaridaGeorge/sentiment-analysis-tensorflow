My visit to the Peoria Sports Complex was a dream come true! I mingled among my favorite San Diego Padres and swapped stories with other fans. The staff is super friendly; one gentleman, John Bear helped us snag a photo with Skipper Bud Black! Another hooked my son up with a pin and stickers. We loved hanging out at the perfectly manicured practice fields as well as enjoying two games at the stadium. It's family-friendly, clean, and the price is right!
