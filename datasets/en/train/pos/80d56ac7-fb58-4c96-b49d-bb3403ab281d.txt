Use My Guy Services is a darned good service.  What makes it really worth calling back again and again is that there doesn't seem to be anything they can't handle.  Plumbing?  Sure.  Electrical?  No problem.  Build an addition on the house?  When do we start?  No reason to call anyone else, they do it all and they do it right the first time.
