Ok, I love Mr. Goodcents. My co-workers and I have been coming here for about 12 years now. I love subs, and this one is my favorite. They are simple, the bread is soft, everything is fresh, the pepper jack cheese is yummy. Everyone is super nice in this franchise which isn't the case for a few of the other Mr. Goodcents franchises.
