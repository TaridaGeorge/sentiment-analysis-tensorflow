This place is fantastic. We order here from work so much that the people know our names and our typical orders. 

I have had their Chicken Yellow and Green curry (yellow is by far my favorite). My friend has their Red Curry Duck. It is also really good. 

Their Thai Iced tea is also very awesome it helps the burn...and believe me if you have never had Thai food DO NOT ORDER SPICY...no matter how much you think you can take it....you can't. Build up to it.

Love this place and go here at least 3-4 times a week if I can afford it!!
