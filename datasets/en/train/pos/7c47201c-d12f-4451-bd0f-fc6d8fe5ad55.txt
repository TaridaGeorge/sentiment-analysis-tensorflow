This place has the most amazing Blueberry Pancakes! They are soooo good, with real, plump blueberries dropped right into the batter! Why this is so amazing to me is that I have never, ever, seen blueberry pancakes served like this in a restaurant ANYWHERE in AZ. Normally, blueberry pancakes come with the overly sugary blueberry compote that is used in pies, dumped on top of greasy flapjacks. They make the pancakes like I do at home.

I could eat this dish every Sunday, because that is when Oak's serves breakfast ALL DAY! They are open everyday from 7 a.m. - 2 p.m.
