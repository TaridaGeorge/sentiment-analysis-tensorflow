This is the third Paradise Bakery I've reviewed, so it's apparent I love the place. This is the cleanest one I've been in. Still haven't had anything other than the Bleu Cheese crumble salad, but I'm a creature of habit. :-)  I did take a couple of bites of the husband's Southwestern Caesar, and it was pretty good too. It has quite a kick so if you don't like spicy I don't recommend it. He doesn't like a lot of heat and it was too much for him. Paradise is a good "I am not sure where to go so I'll stick with what I know" sort of place to eat.
