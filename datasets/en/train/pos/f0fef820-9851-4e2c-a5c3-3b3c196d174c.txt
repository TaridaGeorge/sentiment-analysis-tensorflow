Back again for the second time last Sunday with friends. This time I had the corned beef sandwich and Susan the eggs benedict. EXCELLENT. We did not need the order of fries served with three sauces... just too much to eat. The fries are magnificent and served the french way in the little paper cone. The sauces were good but I usually like a little more flavor. Really, the fries don't need sauces. They stand on their own due to the way they are cooked. My friend had the eggs benedict and said they were the best he has ever had. Service has been terrific both times we visited Cafe Bink. We didn't need the second bottle of wine either but it was terrific.
