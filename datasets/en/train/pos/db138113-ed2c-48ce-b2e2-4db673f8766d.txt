New favorite restaurant in all of AZ! Perfect retro building, most amazing drink menu (black lava salt, thank youuuu), and ridiculously tasty pizza.  I want to eat every meal here! 

It's a bit insane on a Friday night and we parked across the street.  Appie - roasted beet salad. I don't even eat beets, and OMG made the meal.  Pasta - cavatelli. I don't know what the sauce was, but i would've licked the bowl.  Pizza - Pesto. Best quality tomatoes yet.
