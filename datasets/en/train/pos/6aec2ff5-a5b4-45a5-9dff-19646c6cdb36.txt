I had an old folk art oil painting I dearly loved. Drug it all over the US when I moved, then moved one mile and poked a huge hole in it. I was heartbroken. Arizona Art Restoration to the rescue!

For a mere $60 she made it look fantastic! Fixed the hole, cleaned it up a bit and fixed another area where someone had tried to clean it and pulled off paint.

She is awesome!
