How have I not written a review about Sochu?! I am ob.SESSED with this place. Love the new location. Interesting decor, eclectic crowd, fantastic martinis, to die for tofu dishes (the red curry is a MUST), fun lighting, the list goes on and on and on and on. Only downside is that parking can be kind of a nightmare when it's busy. We usually go around 7 for dinner - I heard it picks up later on in the evening. An absolute must-try.
