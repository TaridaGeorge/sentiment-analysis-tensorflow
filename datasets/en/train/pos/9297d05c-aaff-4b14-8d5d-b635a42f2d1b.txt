Love this restaurants atmosphere. Thursday nights usually have an awesome singer (Ivan Hashman) - he reminds me of U2 or Eddie Vedder! The atmosphere is really nice. the Lobster dip is great! The food is hard to choose on the menu, its a little different. Their ceasar salad wasnt that great - dressing tasted store bought. The cheese enchiladas are good, Margaritas are great and I've heard they have great relleno, and chimis.
