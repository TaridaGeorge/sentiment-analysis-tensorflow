If you want excellent coffee, an interesting but off the wall conversation that is completely politically incorrect, and a great time with interesting knick-nacks to buy, this is your place.  John Sagasta, the Owner formerly of Sagasta Coffee, is a great barista and can talk about anything.  Bring your taste buds and an open mind and you'll have fun no matter what!
