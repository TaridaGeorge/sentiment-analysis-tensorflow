I have been a loyal customer at this shop for about 35 years.  I had a bad experience at the Discount store at 1677 W Chandler Blvd in Chandler and just finished a stinky review for that location.

The guys at the Scottsdale Rd and Oak location have treated me right for nearly two generations.  Free flat fixes, free air checks...even if you don't wear Discount tires.  No wonder Discount has grown into the largest independent tire and wheel retailer in the nation.  Except that Chandler shop, it is doomed.
