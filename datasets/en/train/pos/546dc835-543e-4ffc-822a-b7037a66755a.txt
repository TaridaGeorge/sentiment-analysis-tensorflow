This is easily my favorite Sushi place; they have a large assortment of authentic sushi and unique local favorites, and some of the best crab puffs I've ever tried. It's a small place, but it's never very crowded or over-done in anyway. It's great for a casual lunch, or a nice dinner and sushi. I recommend this place for anyone looking for great sushi, and not some over-the-top franchise.
