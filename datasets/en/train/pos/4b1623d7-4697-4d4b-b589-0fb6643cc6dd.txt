Amazing food! The sangria is delicious! You defiantly should try the cheese of the day, I usually dont like cheese but theirs is to die for! I love the decor and how you can actually see them cook food on the wood fire oven! Great spot to kick back and relax! I love it! Also if you like champagne defiantly try the mimosa flight for brunch! Yum!
