This place is always great with kids.  My son hates having his haircut.  HATES IT.  He hates even having his hair touched.  I was really apprehensive about bringing him here, but he said he wanted a mohawk, so we went.

Well, he took scissors to his mohawk just so he could go back here.

To bad hes bald now, because he cut a little close.  It is going to be a while before we can go back.

Thank you Snip-its, I think...  You got my son over his fear of haircuts.  Good price for what you do.  I have never seen a kid leave this place sad.
