This place is RIDIC.  I crave the shrimp boil here like nothing else I have ever craved.  The most amazing flavor. Go hungry because it's a lot of food & you will want to eat every last bite, lick the bowl clean even, it's so good.

If you've never had a seafood boil, it's basically a delicious stew with all sorts of delicious spicy goodness.

OMGawd I want some right now... 

Seriously, if you love seafood, this is a MUST try.  If you don't love seafood, get over your non-seafood-loving ways and just go.
