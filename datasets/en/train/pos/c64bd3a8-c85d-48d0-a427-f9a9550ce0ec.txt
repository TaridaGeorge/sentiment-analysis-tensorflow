I have yet to be disappointed by anything I get here! I have my usuals but once in a while i like to order something different and come to find out almost every time whatever i try next turns into my favorite! The pasta, the salad, the bread, the sandwiches the desserts...its all yummy! and they have free WiFi!! 

The environment is great, the service is great, the food is great...what more could you ask for? :o)
