Malee's single-handedly changed my feelings about Thai food. I used to not be a big fan, and ever since I tried Malee's I can't get enough. Their food is delicious, they use high quality ingredients, and they give you your money's worth! Some plates can be made into "half orders" which are still huge (I can't finish them even sometimes) and even the regular sized portions are well priced. The atmosphere is nice, as it is located in Old Town Scottsdale which is a cute little area and a nice place to have a meal. I reccomend the Drunken Dragon Noodles (for you spicy lovers!) or the Panang Chicken. Spinach Chicken is also delicious.
