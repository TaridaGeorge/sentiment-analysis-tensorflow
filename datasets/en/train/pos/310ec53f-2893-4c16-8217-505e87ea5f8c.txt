Best cigar lounge in Arizona period. Just as any casino or resort the cigars can be pricey so you may want to bring your own. Shadows is worth the trip. The ambience is nice they have two outside seating areas and one inside sittng area with live music and a bar. When the weather is nice it's hands down the best place to smoke and enjoy an adult beverage. One of the bes thing is that it's open late night where as most cigar stores close around 8:00 pm. Decent scotch selection the cigar selection is above average. It is very accomodating to Women and couples, the most I've seen in any cigar lounge. definitely give this place a try any night of the week.
