First thing, if you want to celebrate something here with your friends or relatives, makes sure to call for reservation... the place is not that big, and during Weekend, this place it's just packed.

Service is fast, there's not that much variety but some worth mentioned: "Squid Salad" and "Shrimp Tempura Roll".... yummy... make sure to drink with a Sapporo... then it's a complete package.

The nice thing about eating there is that, at the end, they will stack up your sushi plates... Alllll.... the way up there... it's fun and make the occasion memorable.

With not many options in this area, I'd say Teharu is the best in the valley ;o)
