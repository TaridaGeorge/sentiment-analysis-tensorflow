Yay for FEZ, I need to visit again.  I used to go there all the time, brunch, lunch, dinner and um, happy hour :)  Love love love sitting on the patio.  Since I moved to the east valley I haven't frequented as much, but it's always a treat when I do.  

My favorites are the apricot chardonnay fusion.  I always have to have that, actually I usually go with a friend and we split a carafe (or two).  Their hummus I think is the best hummus I've ever had and I never thought I liked sweet potatoes, till I had FEZ's sweet potato fries.  Everything is pretty reasonably priced too, which is always a plus.
