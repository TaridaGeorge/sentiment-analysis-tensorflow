I love pho, ramen, basically any kind of noodle soup.  

I have had my fair share of pho and I can honestly say that this is some of the best pho I've ever had!

This is my go to place for a down home, no frills, cheap meal.

Stick with the pho soups here, but some of the vietnamese rice dishes are scrumptious too.  

Get #37 (Pork Chop Rice), it comes with pickled vegetables, shredded pork, something like a sausage patty, an egg cake, a pork chop and a side of fish sauce.  Here's a tip ask for a fried egg also which just goes great with the pork and rice. 
-(so delicious) 

I have been known to eat two meals a day here.

Also, the staff is very friendly and it's family owned, so an extra + in my book.
