I heart La Grande Orange Grocery.  I think we ended up here or at one of the LGO Hospitality restaurants everyday of our trip.  I had the pastrami and potato omelette for breakfast twice.  The black-bottom cupcake is incredible - one of the best that I've ever had.  It's a trio of french chocolates, baked into the center.  There is a a teeny bit of super rich chocolate frosting on the top.  They have salads-to-go and sushi-to-go.  It's always busy and hectic but I love the environment.  The grocery store part of it sells wine, fresh-baked breads, artisan meats and cheeses and assorted gourmet food items.  They also stock gifts and stationery - lots of French Bull items.  I wish we had something like LGO on the east coast.
