I have been buying from this store for years.  They have always had a good selection and decent prices.  Best of all i always liked they they knew what they are talking about and can give me honest recommendations.  Recently the glass screen on my iphone cracked so i took to them and they were able to fix it for a fraction of the the cost of buying a new one.  Thanks Paul your are a life saver as always!
