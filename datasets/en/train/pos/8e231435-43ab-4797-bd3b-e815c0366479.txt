If you want a great home cooked meal...then eat here. The place is real small but the food is great. For 10 and some odd cents you get a whole lot of food for little money.

For drinks they have  Iced tea, lemon-aid, coffee, kool-aid, water. The outside and inside do not look like much, but it's the food that is great. Try it, you'll go back!
