We don't have a Dunkin' Donuts anywhere near where I am from even though there are ALWAYS commercials on TV- extremely unfair if you ask me- so we wanted to get as much Dunkin' Donuts as we could while we were near one. 
This location was very easy to find with easy access. The staff were so friendly and you could tell that they enjoyed working there with each other. The staff was so friendly and nice that we decided to go back there again even though there was a closer location to our hotel. 
I wish I could eat here every day- but in the end I'm glad.
