Hands down the best playing conditions of any course I've played!  (I hate to say it, but it's even better than the country club I'm a memeber of.)  My friends and I were out for the PGA tourney last year, stayed at the Westin and played all three courses while we were out there.  We were so impressed that we booked a trip that we just got back from and had a great time again.  The guys working the proshop also told us they had just won Troon's award for Best Course Conditions for Feb. 2011...and I believe it.

We're definitely making it an annual weekend getaway place!
