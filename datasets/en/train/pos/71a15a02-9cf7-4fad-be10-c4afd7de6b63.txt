Pavle; he's done it again. Food and service was great. Took my travel partner and she loved it! Thanks Phoenix for the great recommend!

The only thing was by the time I got there; they had run out of a couple entrees and one of their salads. I had a salad with a very light vinegarette dressing and the duck. Absolutely delicous
