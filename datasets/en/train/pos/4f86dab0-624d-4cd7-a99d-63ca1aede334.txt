Fact: Did you know they had layaway at the .99 Cent Only Store? Me neither til I saw the sign today. These are tough economic times obviously and even the .99 Cent store is affected by it!

This particluar location is fabulous! Clean, well organized, and a huge selection of random, useful stuff....hardware, food, soda, home goods, plasticwear, kids stuff, DVDs, etc...all for .99 (or less). I picked up some kids educational DVDs for an upcoming road trip, books, shampoo, etc...and would have bought tons of other stuff if my 2 year old wasn't running up and down the aisles letting me know it was time to leave.

They have a large selection of groceries...just be sure to check the expiration dates since some of the stuff isn't expired YET , but pretty close.
