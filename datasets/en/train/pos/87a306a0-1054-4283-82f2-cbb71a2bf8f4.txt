Why did it take me so long to find you? Been in the neighborhood for 6+ Years and I just recently found this place! 

I have tried most things on the menu and love the Chicken or Been Teriyaki & the House Chicken/Beef. Go with a Large only a buck or so more and you get a huge meal that can last you 2-meals. 

Food is always really good, Lots of it, great flavor and the guy who runs the place is always friendly and helpful.
