Who doesn't like Four Peaks!? They have a beer for every taste and a full bar if beer is not your thing.  Hey ladies the Peach Ale is a nice non-scary "girly" beer.

The food is always delicious. Great burgers! I really enjoy both of the beer breads. Spinach dip!

The only negatives for a hungry customer are the parking and the wait, but once you get in who cares, right!?
