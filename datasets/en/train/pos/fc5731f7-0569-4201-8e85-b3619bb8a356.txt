Bonnie's Barkery carries most of the high-end, organic, natural, (etc., etc.) dog and cat foods available in major markets. I like the fact that they don't sell anything that is not natural, such as cheap rawhide chews. Lots of great interactive dog toys, deer antlers, tough toys, frozen raw diets and bones. We are so fortunate to have this great shop in our neighborhood!
