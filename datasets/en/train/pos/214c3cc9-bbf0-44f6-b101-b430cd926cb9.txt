While in town for business I stopped in with a female co-worker and we loved the place. And while a great many people mention the obvious bits about the uniforms (which certainly doesn't hurt), I loved the food and the friendliness of the waitstaff. Far too often you're seated in a restaurant and never see your server after the food has been delivered, or wait 10 minutes until someone greets you at the table. Neither of those things happened for us. We were greeted and served quickly even though the place was packed. I went with a female friend who wasn't at all bothered by the outfits. It was great all around. The Shepard's pie is outstanding and the drinks we got were solid. (We need one here in Los Angeles.)
