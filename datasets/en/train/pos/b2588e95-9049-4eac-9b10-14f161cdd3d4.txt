Don't let the outside of this place dissuade you from going in. The inside is very clean and nice and the booths and tables all look new (or newly remodeled). The atmosphere is very much like an old country kitchen. 

Went in planning on having breakfast and ended up ordering lunch instead. The hot roast beef sandwich was insanely good. The bread was thick and they provide you with a knife but it cuts with a fork like it's made of cotton candy. The roast beef is very lean without a lot of funk in it and the gravy and fries were great. 

Tasted the pancakes and they were out of this world good. Very happy to have chanced upon this place and I will happily go back.
