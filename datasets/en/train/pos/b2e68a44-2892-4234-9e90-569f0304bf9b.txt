Yum-yum good! 

Best New York Pie in Scottsdale by far. I am a cheese and pepperoni kind of girl, simple does it for me. They give you a HUGE thin slice of pie, the way it should be. Also, the hot wings are great too! 

What else can you say about a good pizza? Joe's is so good I now have resorted to calling there pizza, pie.
