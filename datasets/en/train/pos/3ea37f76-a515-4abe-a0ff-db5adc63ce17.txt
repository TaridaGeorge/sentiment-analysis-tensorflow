Situated in the picturesque Paradise Valley (it's named that for a reason!), this restaurant provides a nice getaway for locals and tourists alike.

There are quite a few vegetarian options on the dinner menu. I strongly recommend the Polenta and Vegetable Napoleon (I especially enjoyed the red bell pepper sauce) and the Gooey Caramel Cake (if a dessert item has the word 'gooey' in its title, it's bound to be tasty!)

The crowd seems to be 32+ (apart from some of the servers). Parking is not a problem-they have an abundant self-park lot for those wishing to pocket $5 that they would have otherwise shelled out for valet.

If you have a sweet tooth, be sure to order a basket of their sticky buns. They usually come out before the entree, but who doesn't like a bit of sugar before spice?
