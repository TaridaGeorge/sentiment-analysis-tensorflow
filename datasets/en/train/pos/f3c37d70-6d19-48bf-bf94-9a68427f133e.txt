I met a friend for coffee at AJs the other morning and she told me about this place right across the street, so we walked over.  I was impressed.  A large selection of hand made items from local folks who are clearly doing what they love.  I really liked the pottery/ceramic work made with little found objects by the artist from Jerome.  I also liked the woodwork -- bowls, small furniture etc.  Practical art also adds to the events downtown by having shows/meet & greets on Fridays with certain artists.  A great addition to the central corridor.
