Mike's on Yelp!  I am a big supporter of Pre-paid legal and Mike is my guy, It's a no brainer if you don't have a will since that is the first thing you do to save money and then the next time you get ripped off or if you have a billing issue with someone trying to rip you off you have access to an attorney.  With my short sale, it was nice to have an attorney to talk to and figure out my rights.
