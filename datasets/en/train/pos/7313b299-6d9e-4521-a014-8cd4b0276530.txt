The Calcutta Curried Chicken Wings are the best wings I've ever had in my entire life!

Great service, great food, great prices, this is my favorite spot in Scottsdale. I was reluctant to write a reviewon this place because I don't want everyone to know about it, haha.

The bartenders are great, they really know their drinks, and make some the best drinks in the valley! I mean good tasting drinks, not frosty beers, not stiff rum and cokes. They are true masters of their craft, they are balanced well.
