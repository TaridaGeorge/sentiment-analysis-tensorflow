Okay, so it's a "chain restaurant," but you'd never know it by the quality sandwiches and welcoming staff. 

I always love walking in the door and being greeted by a laughing, singing, and altogether boisterously friendly crew. 

The quality of the sandwiches is above any other "chain" sub shop. All the meat and cheese is freshly cut when you order, the bread is always great, and the veggies are above par (i.e. no wilted tomatoes etc.). 

Subway fans... Fear Mike!
