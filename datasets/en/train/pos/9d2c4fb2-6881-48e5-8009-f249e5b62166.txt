You are always looking for that little gem of a restaurant to get away to... this is it! 

The food, and yes all the food - have tried almost everything on the menu is amazing. The service gets crazy at times depending on how busy it is - but that goes with anyplace that gets slammed.

The owners are great, the food is very very good (love the Shaken Beef), and the prices will surprise you... very affordable!!

Cap it off with a Mochilito and your night is complete!

Great job guys!
