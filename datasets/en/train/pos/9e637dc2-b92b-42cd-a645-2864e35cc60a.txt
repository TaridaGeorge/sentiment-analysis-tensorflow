This is one of my favorite places to go when in Phoenix. It has a kitchy, adorable, laid-back atmosphere and always has a fun soundtrack. It has a mini, super fancy grocery store where you can get great wine deals and adorable trinkets and gifts. They serve breakfast all day, so I definitely recommend the Croque Madame. It's hands down my favorite breakfast. If you're feeling lunch-y, you can head over to the LGO pizzaria and try the Gladiator, which has delicious sausage from Schreiner's Sausage (the best in Phoenix). It has a great patio, which is perfect this time of year. It draws a regular crowd, so you usually end up making friends with the other customers. I highly recommend this restaurant (especially for some hearty food after a hike on Camelback mountain).
