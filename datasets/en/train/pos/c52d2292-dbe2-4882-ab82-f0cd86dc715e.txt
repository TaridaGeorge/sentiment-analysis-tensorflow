Best Italian food in town.  Always great and entertaining service from Donna who has the ability to remember a customers preferences time and time again.
The chicken dishes are all very good but the pizza dough and calzones are truly the best you can find West of New York.  I can't justify going to another Italian restaurant in town because of the quality of the food.
Also - as it is a BYOB, you save a little money on drinks.  Simply the best of Phoenix.
