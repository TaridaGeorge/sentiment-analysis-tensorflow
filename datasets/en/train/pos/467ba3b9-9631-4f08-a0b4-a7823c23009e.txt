In a word: delicious! The family that runs this place are always so kind and welcoming. The food is fantastic and there are plenty of options for both carnivores and veg-heads alike. I am totally devoted to their dolma (grape leaves stuffed with rice and spices). Gyros, chicken, veggie patties, and falafel are all equally tasty. The rice is EPIC with delicious almonds and dried fruits - we are picking up a platter for our Thanksgiving feast year. I always feel at home here at Eden's Grill Inn (so much so that the family knows me by name here now!) 

If you're coming in on a Friday or Saturday evening, I recommend calling ahead for a reservation as they aren't a large restaurant. I strongly encourage you to support this wonderful, family-run business.
