Yogurtology, oh how I love thee!  This is my favorite fro-yo place in the Valley!  I like their flavors better than MoJo, and it's just logistically easier to get to since it's not located at the busy Biltmore mall.  They also have a rewards program where when you spend a certain amount, you get $3 off your next order.  

I always get the salted caramel and promegranate fro-yo flavors, and top it off with peanuts and rainbow sprinkles. Love it!  The staff is always great too.  There's a guy who was working in there for a while who was always really helpful.  He hasn't been in there the past couple of times I was in, so I don't know if he's still there or not.
