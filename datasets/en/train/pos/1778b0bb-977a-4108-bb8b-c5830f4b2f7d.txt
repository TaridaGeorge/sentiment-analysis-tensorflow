I love their coffee. It does seem just a smig overpriced, but the real reason I go here.....
The cute, flirty baristas! Boy does DB have a great business model! I love when hot 20 something boys flirt with this 40 something mom! If you are having a bad day, need a perk in your self-esteem, definitely get yourself a coffee, or iced tea or ANYTHING at Dutch Bros.
