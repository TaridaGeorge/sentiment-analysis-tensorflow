Monkey pancakes- not since cup cake came together has there been a more flavorful union! OJ is fresh, the baristas actually know what they're doing and the serving sizes are HUGE.

You might be put out that the tables aren't as orange as the name suggests, but it's easy to get over it. 

Get there early to avoid a wait, it you hit this place at brunch time on a weekend, you'll wait a bit.
