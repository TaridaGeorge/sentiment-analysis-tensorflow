Review for hotel and properties only - not the restaurant part.
I could automatically give 5 stars, as I booked a king size room and ended up in a 1 bedroom casita. But no, there are certainly more aspects. The pools - without a doubt the best pool area in the valley. Very attentive service from skinny ASU kids. Nice grounds, felt a bit like a good European hotel and obviously a good golf course, although I could care less about the old-men-in-triple-pleated-dockers-sport - yawn. 
Therefore back to the room. Nice, clean and laaaaaarge. Two terraces and two full bathrooms, both with tubs. Full living room and full dining room. Room service was good and to the point.
One little negative: please solve the parking problem around the casitas ASAP. Build a separate parking for the people in the triple pleated dockers.
