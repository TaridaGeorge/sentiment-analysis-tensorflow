WOW!!!  so I was trying to find a bar near where I live and lo and behold, this pops up!  Hubbie and I went there tonight.  The guy behind the counter (gonna assume its the owner)  was awesomely friendly and the beer? fantastic!!! 

Camelback IPA:  Not quite as bitter as other IPAs.  It has kind of a citrusy undertone to it.  Its quite good.
Watermelon Ale:  Was good.  Reminded me of a hard cider.  Very Light and refreshing.  My Favorite!  
Freitz nonfiltered ale:  very good.

Prices are super great for the quality.  Go on in and support local businesses, and especially support local breweries!!! (and beer)  

They do not have food, which is okay because they let food trucks park there.  The food truck tonight was good;)  Cajun Food:) yummie.
