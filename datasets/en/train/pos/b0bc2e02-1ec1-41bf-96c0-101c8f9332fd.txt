Amazing food!!  A separate gluten free vegan menu for those of us wanting to skip the wheat gluten.  I can't eat the tsoynamis, so the desserts here aren't as fun as the the Green in Phx that's next to Nami.  Even so, the food is to die for...especially the buffalo wings and chili fries.  OMG!  Besides the "junk" food tho', I love their sweet and sour chicken...yum!
