Cornbread alone is worth the trip, but don't stop there.  Get the chicken.  Don't think of getting anything else (at least not your first time).  Just get the chicken - it's extremely moist & deliciously simple.  Rustic modern decor with a charming waitstaff complete the package.  It makes you wonder why there aren't more restaurants doing this kind of thing.
