I was pleasantly surprised to find such a classy old-world Italian eatery so close to home. La Stalla is in the heart of historic Downtown Chandler, kitty-corner to the San Marcos hotel. 

Here's my recommendation for the perfect dinner, ala a night in Venice, without leaving the Valley:

Start with the Bocconcini al Prosciutto, prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella topped with mushrooms and breadcrums. 

Contadino focaccia, with grilled eggplant, roasted peppers, with mozzarella, mesculine and tomatoes, drizzled with a balsamic olive oil dressing.

Penne alla Vodka, al dente penne pasta in a delicate vodka-cream sauce. 

Finish off with fresh fruit zabaione or (maybe and?) chocolatte souffle. You'll have to allow an extra 10-15 minutes for the souffle, but it comes straight out of the oven.

Delizioso!
