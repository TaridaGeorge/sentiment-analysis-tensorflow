Had such a great time here! I came here with coworkers as part of a team building activity. There was only 6 of us and some had never climbed before and we also had avid climbers. The staff was great and made me feel very comfortable. It was great I had so many different types of walls to climb. I can't wait to go again.
Maybe when it's a bit cooler though. They only seem to have swamp coolers and fans which is no match for an Arizona summer day.
