Five stars because this place is awesome and has a little of everything. Not very many other places can you go with you find a really nice outdoor mall anchored by a movie theater with big box stores surrounding it like Target, Best Buy, and Michaels. The concept is simply perfect. The mall area is very nice and has a pretty good, typical selection of stores with more than plenty to eat and more than enough parking for everything. I love the lasers on Target and Best Buy at night too. It's such a simple pointless effort, but I appreciate it so much. I'm a huge fan of Tempe Marketplace, and and extra plus, it's right off the 202 Red Mountain Freeway. But thenagain, isn't everything in this city off the freeway?
