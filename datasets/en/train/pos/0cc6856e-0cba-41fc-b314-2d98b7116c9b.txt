After reading on Yelp that they are indeed open I popped in there for lunch 2 weeks ago. Super, super friendly staff. I ordered the $5 burger, fries, and drink deal and couldn't finish all of the burger or the fries. Made  fresh to order and piled with toppings, the burger was fantastic. Loved the fries. The guy who took my order came to check on me during the meal to ensure I didn't need anything else. It was a little warm in there, is my only complaint. I sat right in front of the fan but next time I might just take it to go or come on a cooler day. But I will go back. And did I mention how friendly they were?
