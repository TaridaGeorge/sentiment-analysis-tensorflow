Went here with group of friends for dinner.  Waited for a long long time - 90 min.  (granted. my fault not making a reservation).  I cant say it for my friends, but I feel it was worth the wait.  I wanted to try this place because it says its the best pizza in arizona.  Two pizzas I enjoyed the most were Combo and Mama Spinato's pizza.  Right in the middle between soft and crunchy, just right amount of cheese, and savory taste.  Service was great even though we were eating at the balcony.  Definitely will come back
