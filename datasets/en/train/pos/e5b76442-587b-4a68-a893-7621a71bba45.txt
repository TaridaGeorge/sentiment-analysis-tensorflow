Cook E Jar is a uniquely independent restaurant that serves as a cornerstone of the best of what a small historic downtown Casa Grande can be. The food is always delicious and plentiful.  The service is great too. The support they give to other local businesses is fantastic.  If you want a good meal with some good treats, you must go when in Casa Grande!
