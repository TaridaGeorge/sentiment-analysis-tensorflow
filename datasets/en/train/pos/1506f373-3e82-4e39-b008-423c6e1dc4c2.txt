I don't know what the negative reviewers are talking about. I just finished stuffing myself with 2 chicken legs & a waffle. It was delicious. I tried bites of my friends' catfish and porkchops, also good. The porkchops are deep fried rather than pan-fried. Everything arrived perfectly breaded, hot and fast. I love deep fried anything unless its overly breaded, the breading isn't spiced correctly or its greasy.  None of that is the case with anything we ordered. The mac n cheese was clearly homemade (the only thing we had that wasn't fried). My only disappointment was I didn't save room for the red velvet cake.
