Decided to go into this new store yesterday as a walk-in and had a great experience!  I had never been to a chiropractor so I didn't know what to expect.  The woman who greeted me was actually the doctor who chiro-ed (?) me.  She was friendly, and incredible knowledgeable.  It is amazing, almost spooky, how much she could tell just from the way I naturally lay down.  I liked that she talked me through every little thing she was adjusting, letting me know what the expect and what it's purpose was.  She also gave me some great advice about things to look out for during the day and good stretches to do.  It was an amazing deal for $19!
