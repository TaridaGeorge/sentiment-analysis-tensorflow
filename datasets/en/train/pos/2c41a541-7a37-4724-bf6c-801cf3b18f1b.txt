I found Ryan on Yelp, and what everyone else has said is true! He came out and quoted me a very reasonable price to cut down a tree in my back yard. I mentioned that I wanted to do some other yard work, and he made some suggestions and gave me a quote for that work as well. He cut down the tree the next day and removed all the debris. Since I didn't have time to call blue stake, he cut the stump a little below ground level and covered it up. That will be fine for my situation.

The following week, he came back and removed all my front yard grass, treated the ground, and replaced it with rock. He ordered just enough rock, and my front yard looks great. Ryan was very professional and did a great job.
