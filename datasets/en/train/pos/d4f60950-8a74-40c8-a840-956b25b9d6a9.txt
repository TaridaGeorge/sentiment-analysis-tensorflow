Our first trip to Superstition Farm was in Spring 2010 for an Easter event. We have addicted ever since. Even after being at the farm for hours my son never wants to leave. He loves the petting zoo, the snow and the milk bar but, by far his favorite is the tour to see the cows. The moo-tique is adorable and we have taken home a number of items. The staff is great, super friendly and do a great job of remembering repeat customer and making them feel like they are home. I bring my family & friends whenever I  get the chance. This place is a gem!
