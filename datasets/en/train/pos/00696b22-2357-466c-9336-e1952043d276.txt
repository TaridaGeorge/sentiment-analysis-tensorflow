Nothing like a weenier and a beer to get your weekend started right! 

Met some friends at the Brat Haus to try the new place out.... and it was great! I liked it because it was different... brats, fries & beer! What more could you want! Oh yeah - home made pretzels! Everything was delicious! 

I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a laid-back, chilled atmosphere with great food and beer of course!
