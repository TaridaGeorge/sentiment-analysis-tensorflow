Oh the caprese salad.  It's what dreams are made of. 
And the pizza. Oh and the desserts.  Well, pretty much everything is fantastico here at Cibo.  I wish I could kidnap the chef and turn him into my personal man-chef/slave so he could whip me up delicious Cibo-esque dishes whenever the mood struck.

I really am kidding about that. 

Kind of.

But really, the food here is great, the service is fine and the prices aren't bad considering how great the food is. 

The restaurant is a really cute, intimate place and my only problem with it is it's far away from my house!
