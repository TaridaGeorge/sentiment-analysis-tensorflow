The store is very clean, the staff is always exceptionally friendly and helpful, they have a wide variety of flavors and toppings and their yogurt has a smoother, thicker consistency than others I have tried. It is a great place to go with large groups and children. The kids enjoy playing in the grassy area out front. It is expensive but worth it!
