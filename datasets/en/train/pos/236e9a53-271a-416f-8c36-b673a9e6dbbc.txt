I cannot understand why I haven't visited this restaurant more...it's really good!
Two of us went and both had the Double R Chopped Salad and both  agreed it was delicious! The greens were fresh, as were the veggies and meat. 
My hubby had the butternut squash soup and it was fab!
This is a great place for lunch, but if you're with a group of friends that want to talk, be forewarned: it's LOUD in here!
Still, GREAT FOOD and reasonable prices....we'll definitely be back for more!
