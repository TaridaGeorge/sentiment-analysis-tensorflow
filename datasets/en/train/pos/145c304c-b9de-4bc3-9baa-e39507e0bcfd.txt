This is a great little Starbucks.  The fact that they have a drive thru alone puts them at the maximum alloted stars.  But, the people that work here have always been friendly.  When I used to live a few blocks away I went here a couple times a day.  I was just back in town for a few days and came here everyday and they are still holding strong with their customer service.  If you live in this part of Glendale, you probably know that not too many places have employees who smile or seem happy but this Starbucks has hired some good people it seems.  Definitely worth the drive if it's a little out of your way.
