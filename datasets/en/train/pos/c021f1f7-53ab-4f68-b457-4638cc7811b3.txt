You ever thought of a life without Costco. I know. Scary thought. I love Costco (but I'm also easily amused). It's the only place I can snack (for free) while I'm walking around shopping. Brilliant.  Guys like buying anything bigger. Bigger is better - RIGHT?? Life is good at Costco, and I will continue to spend way to much money there!
