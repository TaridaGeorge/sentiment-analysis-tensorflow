Mido Sushi! Also known as Sushi Hama from Tucson AZ..  I have been their fan since 1999.. I remember taking long drive to Tucson to savor their "spicy scallops hand roll"!  Yumm..  its making my mouth watery!! LOL!    Now, they are here .. $20 all you can eat!!  plus miso soup, salad, tempura, and three choices of ice cream for desert, mango, red bean, and green tea..  

I have tried many different sushi places in AZ and Cali.. but I have to say..  Mido sushi is always my #1 choice..   

Did I mention all you can eat for $20?? =  )

Try it, and you won't be disappointed!!
