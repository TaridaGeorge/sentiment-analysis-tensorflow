I totally agree w/Kristin!  My husband and I wondered if the same people that brought us Pei Wei brought us Rumbi.  Rumbi, Rumbi, Rumbi!  It's good, good, good.  I got the chicken rice bowl and my husband got a salad.  He was thrilled with the non iceberg lettuce.  We sat and enjoyed the quick service.  The portions are jinormous.  A little chili paste in the rice bowl and you are in business. 

On our second visit we shared a chicken sandwich.  The sweet potatoe fries were a hit w/the hubby and it was spiced nicely.  I didn't care for it and will stick to the salad and rice bowls.
