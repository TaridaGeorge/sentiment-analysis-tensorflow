Six stars if I could!!  I just bought a new refrigerator and double oven for my house.  Wow this place is a real find!  I knew exactly what I wanted because I'd done quite a bit of research and I wanted to stay with a brand that matched my other appliances.  I worked with Brian.  He gave me a great deal, he actually beat the prices of the internet appliance store I had checked out.  (I didn't even ask him to do that.)  The appliances came in exactly when they were supposed to and they delivered them right when they said they would.  The install guy is also very pleasant, efficient and careful.
