I live in the Pacific Northwest, which is rich with vegan options when it comes to sweets.  Of all of the places I've explored up here, I've never come close to finding treats as mouthwatering as the ones from Treehouse Bakery!  And this definitely isn't one of those "i'm vegan, so i've just forgotten what a cupcake really tastes like" kind of deals.  I've fed them to non-vegans who always remark at how moist and perfect they are.  Everything they make is amazing!  Cookies, cupcakes, muffins, cakes, you name it.  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about it.  The Cherry Almond cookies are to die for, and I think I actually have dreams about the red velvet with cream cheese frosting cupcakes.
