Elizabeth is amazing.  She has helped me in urgent situations now twice!  The first was a ball gown I needed taken in with very short notice and jut today she hemmed a flower girl dress I needed by tomorrow night...she isn't even open on Monday's!  And she is very reasonable.  Thank you Elizabeth!  I will never take my clothes anywhere else!
