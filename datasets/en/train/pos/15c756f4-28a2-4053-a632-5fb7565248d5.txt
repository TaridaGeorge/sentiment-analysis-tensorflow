Cute, quick place to stop in for a lunch on your lunch break. They go above and beyond with little details like cucumber in the water and coolers on the patio. You can tell the owner takes pride in his business and cares about the customers. The food was very fresh and put together well. Overall I think this is a solid addition to my lunch choices in Scottsdale.
