Hospice of the Valley is awesome!  And the people from Hospice of the Valley are awe-inspiring!

A few years ago my dad needed their help.  They were amazing in how well and how smoothly they entered the picture and did their job.

I recommend Hospice of the Valley to anyone who is in that kind of a situation.

Additionally, the Social Worker who worked with my dad is NOT an MSW:  He's a Ph.D. in Social Work!  When I asked him about that, telling him that I expected that a Ph.D. would be in a classroom teaching - not out in the field, he told me that while he had taught for a short time, he wasn't happy teaching - instead of talking about it, he wants to be on the front lines doing it.  I can't overemphasize how good he is or how impressed I am.
