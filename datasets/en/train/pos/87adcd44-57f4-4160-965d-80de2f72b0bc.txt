The restaurnt serves superb seafood and steaks. The ambience, service and execution are as good as it gets. During the course of dinner I had the unfortunate experience of choking on a piece of the steak-all my fault. As it happened the General Manager,Frank Schneider, happened to see I was in trouble. He sprung into action and the offending piece popped out. The man saved my life and I am truely grateful. That's service and dedication.
