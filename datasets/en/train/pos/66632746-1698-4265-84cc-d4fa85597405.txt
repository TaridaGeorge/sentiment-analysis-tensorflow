Wow!  I was really surprised!

My coworked asked me to join him at Pita Jungle and I was assuming a place similar to a Pita Pit.  Instead what I got was a full-menu, some great offerings, and not one disappointing order!

I got:
Hummus - one of the best plates of hummus I have ever had
Dolmades - smaller than I am accustomed to, but they were almost meaty in consistency and taste, though it was vegetarian.
Tabbouleh - spooned helping after helping into my falafel pita, wonderful, crisp, just enough vinegar, refreshing
Falafel - freshly fried, hearty-tasting, I was fulfilled until the next morning

Highly recommended for a long lunch or a shorter dinner.  This place is great!
