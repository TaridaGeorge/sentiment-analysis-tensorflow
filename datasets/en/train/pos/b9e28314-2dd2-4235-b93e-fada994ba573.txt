I had cushions done for my outside lawn furniture.  They are fabulous!!!  Ann helped me and designed the style and the edging.  They turned out very "custom" and classy.

I then brought in a bench to have it recovered.  Ann again helped me and designed an adorable bench with five different fabrics and edging.  I will always go to this store for my fabric needs.
