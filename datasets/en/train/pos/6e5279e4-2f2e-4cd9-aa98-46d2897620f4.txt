I love this place!!

I miss my Chodang dearly. It's been approximately 4 months since my last chow-down. Now I can come back every other week and enjoy some great Korean food once again. I really should try everything on the menu. Today's order was #8 the one before that was #21. I did enjoy the octopus dish... I'm salivating thinking about it.
