In Short: The best boba in town, period!

I love boba, it's like a meal in a cup.  Something to drink, something to chew, you can't beat that.  It's safe to say that I've probably been to dozen boba places in the valley, and by healthy margin this is the best.  The street may not have the frills of some of the other places but the quirky atmosphere and the great quality of the boba makes up for that.  

You have a choice of going for slushy or the milk tea type of boba.  My favorite being taro and thai iced tea.  The boba is prepared perfectly, soft yet very chewy.  It's prepared a little too hard at most other places.  While you are there, take a moment to soak up the atmosphere, it's unlike anywhere else I've been to.
