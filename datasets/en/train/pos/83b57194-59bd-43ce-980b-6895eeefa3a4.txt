Woohoo Chinese food!  Found out about this place from neighbors.  It's close enough to walk from my new condo.  Great service.  Once you step inside you get the feeling that you are in San Francisco for Chinese dining.  We loved the walnut fried prawns and the chicken curry!  This will be my new go-to place for Chinese food (dine in and take out).  China Chili, I'm glad you're nearby.
