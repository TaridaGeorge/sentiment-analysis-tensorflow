I ate there with my wife on a date night... The burgers were top notch.  Service was not bad.  Nice atmosphere.
Lots of stuff on the menu, but it's an a la carte type menu...
I love that you can build your own burger..adding whatever toppings you want...If you go a little crazy, it will get expensive.
Not a cheap place, 2 of us ate (burgers with a few extras), sweet potato fries were incredible mainly because of the dipping sauce... and 2 sodas...Total including tip was about $35.
I would go back again if I'm in the area....
