Stephanie has the unique ability to diagnose your voice from a mechanical as well as an acoustic level. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to improve on both fronts and step up their game. I've worked with only a handful of other voice teachers before yet after working with Stephanie at Sing Your Style Studio I have no need to go elsewhere. This studio is the place for me.

Stephanie pulls the fixes out of me astonishingly FAST, singing feels easy and she is very ON TOP of her game!!
Doing this has been very enjoyable. I never expected to sound this good!! I was just doing this as therapy for my speaking voice, yet Im sounding great singing, my family can't believe it. 
Thank you Stephanie &
Sing Your Style!
