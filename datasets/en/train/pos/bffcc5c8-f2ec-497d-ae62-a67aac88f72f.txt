Tue night is dollar kids scoop night (and $1.50 big scoop)!  It starts at 6pm and goes to 10pm How can you go wrong with that?! We are going to start a Tue tradition of walking the dogs in a big circle so we can take advantage of the yummy treats!
Also, the staff is super nice and the store offers many flavors of ice cream as well as sorbets, cakes, and drinks. :)
There are some cute lil benches and outside seating so you can have your pets with you... pet-friendly!
See ya there!
