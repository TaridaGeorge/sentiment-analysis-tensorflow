EVERYTHING I have had here is amazing. I'm just going to make this review short and sweet. GO THERE. It's worth the wait. Always busy, but fun atmosphere and you will love the appetizers, entrees and desserts. AND the drinks. Only place I will make the drive to from Gilbert. I heard people travel from different states to come here! I get it now! ;)
