Do-it-yourself frozen yogurt is overplayed, we all know it.  Thanks a lot, Pinkberry.

But Twirl is a different story.

What's wrong with most places?  Crappy toppings, ripoff prices, the same bright pink-green-yellow color scheme, the same yogurt flavors (that boring sour and tart vanilla flavor comes to mind).

Twirl has good flavors.  It's cheap.  The toppings are great.  The people are nice.  The owners are cool.  It's a relaxing place to sit and hang out.  It is the antithesis of a Pinkberry clone and that's why it's worth it.
