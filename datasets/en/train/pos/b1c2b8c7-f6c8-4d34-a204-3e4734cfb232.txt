This place is fantastic, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere makes it all work.  Food was light and this is not your hearty portion restaurant.  The Prawns were great as well as the Volcano rock was a good touch.  The real appeal to this place for me was the drink list.  We had 2 different types of Sake which were both great.  Hitachino and the "33" beers were both good and the hot and dirty martini was more than worth the mile walk before the Sun's game.  The wait staff was very friendly and offered the above great selections.
