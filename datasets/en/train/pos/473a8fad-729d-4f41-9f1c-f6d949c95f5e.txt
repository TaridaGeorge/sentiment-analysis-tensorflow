Anything I write will not do justice to this awesome, awesome hotel. I've stayed here a good dozen or so times over the past three years and it's always fantastic. I love all the rooms. If you can get a suite, you're an extra lucky duck, but even the basic rooms are adorable with phenomenal bathrooms.

The bar and restaurant is also great, with fantastic appetizers, wonderful specialty cocktails, and fun rat pack music. Breakfast is better than most restaurants, forget about comparing it to standard hotel fare.

The location is also good, with plenty of shopping, restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.

This place is not within my normal price range at all, but it is worth every penny and I would never stay anywhere else in the Phoenix area.
