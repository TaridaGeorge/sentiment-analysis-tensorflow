Great restaurant. Food was fantastic. The crab cake is a MUST. The special of raw scallops were so good! Service was perfect. 
The band playing Saturday night was really good ! 
We live closer to Wild Fish so we probably won't drive up to Scottsdale Quarter but I would recommend trying either when you can.
