One of my favorite places in town. Bar none. The bar is one of the better ones in town..... fresh herbs getting pulled as you walk in.... and a potato pizza with an egg? (Chef's recommendation, ungodly rad) was the best advice I got in years on a dish! If you haven't been there, save yourself the headache and just go! Also, if you can catch Kris Korf behind the bar on a weekday, get ready for a drink that rivals unicorn blood in greatness!
