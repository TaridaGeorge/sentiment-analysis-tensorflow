My husband and I have always wanted to try Pure, but with so many sushi options (and favorites) in our area, it took us much longer than usual to get there. Happy to report it is now on the top of our list! Contrary to other posts, our service was excellent, the quality was great and pricing fair as well. We had 20 minutes left on happy hour,which was great to save a bit on numerous items. Great feel inside...we will definitely be back.
