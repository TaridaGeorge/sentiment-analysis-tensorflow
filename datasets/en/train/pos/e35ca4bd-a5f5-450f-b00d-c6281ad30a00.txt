I called Ann as a new client and she went out of her way to fit me in with my time constraints. 

I was so happy that I met her. I needed my eyebrows waxed and I am really particular about it.  SHE DID AMAZING!!  I will be going back and will recommend her to all my friends. Her price is awesome too.  ONLY $15 and the first waxing is FREE!!!

An added note, I have sensitive skin and the wax she uses was actually the best for my skin and did not irritate it.  

Definitely go see her.  From a dude's perspective she is cool and gets you in and out. From a girl's perspective she really listens to exactly how you want them done and gives it to you.  The quality is great!

Cheers!
