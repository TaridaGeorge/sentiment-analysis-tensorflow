Damn Good Pizza!

I Love a pizza without tomato sauce and NYPD's White Pizza does it right! 
Check out these slices of Glory (see pics) One with Tomato and Ricotta and the other with Spinach and Ricotta

They had about 6 or 8 different pizzas to choose from for a slice, not to mention a full menu of signature and custom made pizza, calzone, pasta, soups, salad and appetizers.

The pizza had a  crispy crust with a fluffy interior, not too doughy but just like a perfect french bread, I Loved it!

Great spot for lunch to grab a slice or two and maybe a salad.
I would love to try out some of their dinner items as well.
