i had a craving for some tasty Chinese food but didn't want to drive too far from home.  i got on yelp, read the reviews and i was sold on the chicken wings.  i called ahead, placed my order for the garlic wings and egg rolls.  make sure to take cash, no cards accepted! as soon as my order was ready i got in the car and immediately the aroma from those wings filled the space.  

these are the best wings i have ever had!!!  crunchy, full of flavor, and really big pieces.  the brown bags keep the wings nice and hot, and keep the scent. really inexpensive-4 wings and 2 egg rolls for $7... definitely a little hidden hole in the wall in phoenix!
