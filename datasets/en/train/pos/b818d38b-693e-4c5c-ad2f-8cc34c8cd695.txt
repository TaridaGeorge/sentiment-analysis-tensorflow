God DAMN I just love this place. My visit last night was complete reaffirmation of why Last Chance is one of the best reasons to live in Phoenix. Two pairs of black Uggs, short and tall. Black over-the-knee flat suede boots. Black leather knee high slouchy boots with a cone heel that look quite similar to the totally-sold-out-and-unaffordable-anyway Balenciaga version. Theory tank top - basic white, not some garish color that didn't sell. Citizens of Humanity wide leg trouser jeans, with the tags still on, $9.99! Black "jeggings" (yes, jeans/leggings). Some Juicy velour pants, because I needed another pair like a hole in the head. ALL FOR $250. The stupid tall Uggs are $200 ALONE if you pay retail. 

My main problem with Last Chance is that it COMPLETELY RUINS me from paying retail for anything. For real.
