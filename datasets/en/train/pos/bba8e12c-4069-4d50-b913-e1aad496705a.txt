Love this place! I used a groupon at drybar and had a horrible experience. I'm soo glad Primp and Blow blew them out of the water! My stylist actually took the time to ask me what I wanted in detail, was suuuuper sweet, and time sensitive for a dinner I was getting my hair done for. I got to look through Perez Hilton on an iPad when we weren't chatting and a short but amazing head massage during my shampoo. The manager also gave me a 10% off my next visit after I mentioned it was my birthday. Overall I would recommend this blow dry bar over any other place on town. I got major compliments on my hair that night!!!
