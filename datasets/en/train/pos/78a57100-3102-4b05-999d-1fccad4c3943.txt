I LOVE this place!  I usually avoid any restaurants that have gluten free or veggie friendly menus since I'm as true as a carnivore as you can get.  However, this place has absolutely amazing food, service, and drinks.  It's a relaxing atmosphere with fresh, healthy food that doesn't sacrifice flavor or appetite.  Both alcoholic drinks and nonalcoholic drinks are equally superb!
