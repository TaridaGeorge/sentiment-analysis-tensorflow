Holy Crepe...this place is amazing!  

My friend and I came in and were dazzled by the friendly staff and delighted by the gourmet crepes.  She got the papa k with ham, pepper jack and mushrooms and I got the veggie stack. The expertly prepared high quality ingredients resulted in hard core multiple crepegasms.  We wrapped up our crepe escape with the vanilla bean custard crepe served with berries. They won't give it to you to go but stop crying and just eat it there - it's totally worth the 5 minutes. 

I suspect the ambiance in this place is pretty cute but I was so hypnotized by what was happening in my mouth (and a hot chef) that I can't really remember much about the decor.  Even if these crepes were being served out of a dumpster I'd still be back to try everything on the menu.
