I love this place!  I brought my first couches from them for our new house.  After 5 years the main couch, finally gave out.  Everyday use of us and the dogs.  We still have 1 two seat sofa that became the dogs' sofa now.  I am now back for maybe a dinner set, a new couch, or anything else I see... LOL!  Yes, they are pricey but the pieces are quality stuff.

FYI, they custom ordered our couches from Italy (we picked the heavier material and the color)...
