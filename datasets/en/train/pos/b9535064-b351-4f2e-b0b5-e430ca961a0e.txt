For those that need a break from Western medicine, this is the place to go. I've been suffering from allergies my ENTIRE life and after two 5 day tea mixes, I can breathe, mow the lawn and live a normal life. I strongly recommend a visit to the doctor here. He takes walk ins and it's only 10.00 for the doctor visit and then the cost of the herbal mix! Try it, you will not regret it.
