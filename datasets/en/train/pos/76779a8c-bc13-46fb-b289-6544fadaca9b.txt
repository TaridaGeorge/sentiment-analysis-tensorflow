Delicious! Loved the food, very creative and very reasonably priced. FYI, I recommend the chicken/portobello pasty. I wanted to try one of the dessert ones, but I was stuffed after lunch. The guys working behind the counter were very nice (and cute) and the decorating and atmosphere was pleasant and clean. I'd definitely recommend it.
