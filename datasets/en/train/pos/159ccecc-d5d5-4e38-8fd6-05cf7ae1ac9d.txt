My first time visiting this place and I really liked it. Service was really good, but more important the food was excellent. I ordered their salad, soup & half sandwich combo. I'm not a potato soup lover, but I really enjoyed their version-- topped with bacon and chives...YUMMY! I didn't expect the sandwich to be as good as it was. Lots of good turkey meat with fresh avocado, bacon, tomato on sourdough. I even really enjoyed the side salad because of the delicious balsamic dressing. 

I would definitely go back!
