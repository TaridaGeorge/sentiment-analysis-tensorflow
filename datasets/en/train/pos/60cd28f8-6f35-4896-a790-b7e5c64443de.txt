I just got my lashes done by Layla and I absolutely fell in love the moment she was finished and I looked at myself in the mirror! I have super short, almost invisible lashes and whenever I would use strip lash extensions they looked so fake and awful on. I was nervous that these extensions were going to be too dramatic but Layla made them the exact length that I wanted and they are long enough to make my eyes stand out naturally and so much better than what I had before! I definitely love not having to wear mascara and eyeliner on my top eyelids anymore! Layla was amazing and I recommend her to anyone!
