The spring on my garage door broke, Lodi came out right away and fixed it quickly. The person I had talked to was very informative, pleasant, and helpful. And the man who did the repair was  dry nice, professional, he did a great job. 

Not only did they fix the broken spring, but our door has never operated as well as it does after he fixed the spring. I think he really went above and beyond, he adjusted things, lubed parts, it operates better and is far quieter than before.

I'll definitely use Lodi again.
