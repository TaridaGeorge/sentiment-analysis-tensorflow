No need to ask "Y".

ha!....but really- if you're looking for a place that has everything you need to get fit: nice facility, good machines, awesome free weight selection- all without any unnecessary pretense, this is the place. 

They have Yoga lasses, ZUMBA- and that stuff too. The staff is really helpful and well informed.

The whole "workout" area is lined with glass, from floor to ceiling. It's nice to have an expansive outdoor view when you're on an elliptical for a half an hour. You feel less like a hamster in a wheel.

Overall, it's an extremely comfortable, friendly place with a healthy community- focused agenda.
