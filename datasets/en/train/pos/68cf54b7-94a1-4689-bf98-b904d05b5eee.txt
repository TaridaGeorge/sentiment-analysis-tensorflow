Shogun is one of my favorite spots to grab a few rolls.  It is the only place in the valley that I have found that serves Wahoo (otherwise known as Ono).  The spicy Wahoo roll, the Wahoo sashimi and the Sunset roll are two of my absolute favorites.  I have been stopping by for years and it is consistently good.  I have a lot of friends that are fans of the Godzilla tails too.  Oh, the tempura onion rings are the best onion rings I have ever had!  I will continue visiting this favorite little spot.
