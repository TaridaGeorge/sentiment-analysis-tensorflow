If you absolutely have to be in AZ, then why stay anywhere else besides the Ho? I love this little oasis in Old Town Scottsdale. I can fantasize that I am that girl who seduced Don Draper into coming with her and her band of merry vagabonds to Palm Springs in that one episode of Mad Men...

Needless to stay, I love the decor, and I hear that they put on some pretty cool events throughout the year, though one has not been happening at a time when I am in town. Even if you aren't staying here, just pop in for a drink and be whisked away to another era.
