Just became my new favorite spot!! Love everything about it....

The ambiance, service food ...perfecto!

We went for lunch and were seated right away even though there were really busy. Attentive service without being overbearing. brie and then shared the club sandwich...both to be raved about. 

The only thing was the crazy lady next to us but I will def be back!
