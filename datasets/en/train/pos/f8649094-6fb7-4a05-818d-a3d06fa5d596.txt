My favorite Restaurant in Phoenix by far, I keep searching for better, but who knows why!

Dishes that separate Tarbell's from others:

 Soups to die for
 Caesar the way it was meant to taste
 Pommes Frites as heavenly as any in Paris or 
                                     Brussels
 Sliders to crave many days after
 Scotch Beef I continue to dream about
 Pan Roasted chicken - I NEVER order chicken in a 
                                     Restaurant, except here
 Mac & Cheese good enough for dessert

If this isn't FIVE STAR in Phoenix, I can't imagine what is, but I want to go there!
