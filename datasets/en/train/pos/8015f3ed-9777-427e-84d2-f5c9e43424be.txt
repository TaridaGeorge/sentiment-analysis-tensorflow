MMMMMMM.......Hearty food in a flaky crust. What else could you ask for? My favorite is the royale with cheese. Basically a cheeseburger with caramelized onions, sauteed mushrooms, and potatoes. But it's so much more than the description. For some reason, everything just comes together perfectly in every bite. And add a little barbecue sauce...bliss.

I've never had a bad pastie. The oggie and shepherd's pie are classic. The italian ones are good. The apple one for dessert...better than apple pie. Banoffee pie is great too.

Portions are big. 1/2 is a good meal. Eat the whole thing and you'll be stuffed. 

Don't take impatient friends here. These things can take a while to bake!
