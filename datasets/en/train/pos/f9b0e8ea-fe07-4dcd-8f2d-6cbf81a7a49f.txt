Giant sports bars, with lots of seating, lots of TV's, rock and roll memorabilia around, and HUGE PORTIONS OF FOOD!
First time in Arizona, to visit family, friends. I had seen this show from the Man Vs Food Show... it was epic. such a blast, the food was great, I split the BIG UNIT with two other people, it was really delicious and the toppings were awesome. I think I could take one by myself (maybe next time). I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes to eat, drink, and be in a loud environment.


I forgot to mention, Help the homeless guy outside of this place, he was super nice and helped us out of getting a parking ticket, so we got the guy his own BIG UNIT, and he was STOKED!!!
