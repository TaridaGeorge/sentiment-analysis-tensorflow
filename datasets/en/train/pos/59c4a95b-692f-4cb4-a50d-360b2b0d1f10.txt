Ok, as an avid carnivore, I must say that the grilled beef is pretty damn good.  But don't stop there - and please note, i'm sticking with just the basics here.  The pita bread, the plain ol' pita bread - great stuff, especially warm.  And besides all the delicious traditional Arabic sweets (halvah, don't tempt me!!), try their unassuming butter cookies.  So good!
