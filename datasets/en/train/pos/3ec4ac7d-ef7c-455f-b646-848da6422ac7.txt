I'll tell ya what:  You have to go HERE if you have a Mercedes.  Honestly, one of the best, most reasonably priced shops I've ever dealt with.

You go inside and you will meet customers that have been going there literally for years and years.   

I've never had a bad experience- just today they got the ignition switch fixed after I had to tow it in LAST NIGHT- yes, it involved undoing the steering column and using all kinds of nasty cutting tools to remove teh old switch (tumblers failed)  but they had it FIXED in less than 1/2 the day.  

WOW.  

Fast, accurate and best of all real good pricing....

PS- BUD is president of the local MBCA (benz club) so yes, he is a bit of a fanatic about these cars.
