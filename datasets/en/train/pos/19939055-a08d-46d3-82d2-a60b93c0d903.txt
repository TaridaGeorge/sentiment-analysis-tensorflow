Mike gave me a fair quote over the phone to install a 30amp outlet outside my house. Was very helpful, explained what he needed to do, was on time and I would absolutley call him the next time I need any electrical services.

Listen--if you want a no hassle experience call Good Guys. You can thank me later.
