WHY OH WHY is there not a Dunkin Donuts here in the Bay Area? Because the good people at DD do not want me to become diabetic from drinking their crack (aka extra cream, extra sugar) laced coffee twice a day? Oh okay. That's very nice of them. I guess.

Seriously though, I look forward to going down to Spring Training every March not only for the baseball watching but also because that's when I get my DD coffee fix for the year.

This particular location has a drive-thru window that's open 24-hours.

Only 11 months and a few days until my next Spring Training trip. I can't wait.
