I love Pita Jungle! I frequent the one on Indian School and 40th street, but make it around to the one in Peoria and the one on Shea. Regardless which one I go to the service is great, the food is fantastic and the crowd and atmosphere has wonderfully warm energy.

The only thing that I have not enjoyed greatly was the Broiled Chicken Pita. It was a little bland. I have tried so many other dishes and they are all wonderful.

Love you guys!!!
