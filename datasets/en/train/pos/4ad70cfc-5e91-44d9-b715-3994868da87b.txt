This location is the closest to my house and I've eaten here many times. The service is always great as is the food. Their minestrone soup is amazing and I never fail to order it. I've never even tasted one of their salads. Have also had the manager come to the table and chat on occasion as well as give us a complimentary copy of one of their cook books. I love non-chain restaurants but Carrabbas is one of the exceptions. I can't imagine ever getting tired of their food.
