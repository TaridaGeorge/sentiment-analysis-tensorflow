One of my all-time favorite places. What other Asian restaurants serves you bread (super yummy bread I might add) at the beginning of the meal? The menu features Thai, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese and Italian.... yes that's right, Italian dishes. I've never had any of the Italian items but friends of mine say they're delicious. I honestly have never had a bad meal or bad service there. Lots of tofu and veg-head selections, plus fabulous sushi, noodle bowls and rice dishes. The lunch time Bento box specials are a must--tons of food, great price.
