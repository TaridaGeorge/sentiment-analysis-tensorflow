Hands down...I NEED Yogurtland once a week!!!!!  Noone can argue the increasing popularity and uproar of "do-it-yourself" yogurt businesses.  You can find on almost any corner or in any strip mall.....However, I am never as pleased as with Yogurtland's choices.   My fave flavor is the plain tart.  Noone has plain tart like Yogurtland's!  And when it comes to toppings they have yogurt chips...cereals...exotic fruits like lychee and mango (my fave) and even recently I noticed syrup toppings like marshmallow cream or butterscotch.  Not to mention their featured yogurt flavors like red velvet cupcake!!!  Sooooo good!  And I love how they post the nutritional information on the yogurt titles.  I find it useful when deciding how healthy I want to be...which...its hard to go wrong with yogurt in my opinion.  Definitely if you haven't checked this place out...GOOOO!!!   And don't forget Sprinkles cupcakes is right next door!
