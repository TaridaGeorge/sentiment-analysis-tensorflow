i read their menu and decided it was too simple for me to try.  then my husband said he wanted to go so on we went, and boy i was surprised.

yes it's simple; burgers/dogs/milkshakes/fries.....but they do it WELL!  the fries are some of the best i have ever had...they taste sooo fresh. 

pretty cool building too, and a lot of outdoor seating.
