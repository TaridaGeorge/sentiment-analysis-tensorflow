Every had a croissant just melt in your mouth? With that just right combination of flaky and, yet somehow moist and buttery, all at the same time? If not, try the croissants at Essence Bakery. You'll never go back to those pretenders again. 

Close my eyes and, as I slip that little bite onto my tongue, I can almost hear the street sounds and smell the flowers of Paris again. Paris is in my head; croissants and latte swirled together in my mouth. Ah . . . heaven.

Essence . . . the essence of life.
