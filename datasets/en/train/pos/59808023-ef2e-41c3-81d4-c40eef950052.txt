Food Was Excellent!

I had Yellow Curry Chicken. The meal was so rich and filling I could only eat 1/3 of it! I took the remainder home with some extra white rice and my wife and I split the meal.

She said that was the best she had eaten and we're both Thai food lovers.

Definitely worth a visit. This was my 1st. It's kind of hidden or set back so you have to look for it. It's near Best Buy off the 101 loop in Scottsdale, that's where I ate.

I can't wait to go back and try another dish!

Enjoy
