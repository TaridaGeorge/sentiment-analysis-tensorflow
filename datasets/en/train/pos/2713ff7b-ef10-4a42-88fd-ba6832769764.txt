Review for Bliss:  Simple, non-complicated menu that is executed very well.  The portions are good sized and the prices are VERY reasonable.  Overall a GREAT restaurant.  Had the Mac and Cheese with chicken and Bacon and it was awesome.

Review for reBAR:  Layout is excellent and the drinks were poured good...I like the fact that it is open and people can just walk up to the place.  The crowd is mixed and it seems that the "pretty people" have left other bars to hang out here.  This could end up being the ultimate happy hour place for those young executives downtown....and good looking ones at that....  The place clears out after 10pm, but still enough people around to have a good time.  High times seem to be from 6 to 9pm.  Good pre-bar.....hmmm...maybe they should of called it preBAR.
