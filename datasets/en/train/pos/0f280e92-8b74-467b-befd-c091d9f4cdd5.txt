Amazing, moist and delectable little creations! I ordered a mix of bundtini's to take on a girls trip last week, and these mouth-watering treats did not stand a chance!  We devoured all 12 of them in no time.  The dozen came with a mix of flavors allowing me to experience heaven in my mouth, again, again and again!  My favorite was the white chocolate raspberry with white chocolate frosting, although the lemon was also superb.  While waiting to pick up my box, I also had the opportunity to try a (few) samples of the blueberry cake with white chocolate frosting, it was like a blueberry muffin, but soooo much better!  If you can't tell by the over use of exclamation points in my review, this place is a Must! Must! Must try!
