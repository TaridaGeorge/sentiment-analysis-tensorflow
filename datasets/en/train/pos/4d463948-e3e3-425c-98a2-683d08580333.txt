This is probably the best place to shop!! i love this little boutique. it's clothes are ones that turn head and say "fashionista" haha, but seriously it's an amazing store to shop in or to just browse around. if you love your seven jean, true religions, or diesel you wont find it in this store. this place carries the best selection of jeans around, from Ksubi, April 77, to Habitual. 

The shoe selection is awesome!! you can't find the kind of shoes they have anywhere in the valley, from Alexander McQueen Pumas, Nike, Swear. 

they also have little parties, so if you sign up for their new letter they post when they have gatherings.
