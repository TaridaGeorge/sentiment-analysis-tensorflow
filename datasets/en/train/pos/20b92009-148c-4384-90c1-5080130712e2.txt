This place is great!!! Michael has been telling me about this place for months and I finally showed and I am glad I did. What a great hang out. I am not the typical big bar, dance club, scottsdale type. So this place for me was perfect. Nice and cozy, very inviting. The owner was there working making sure everyone was happy. It was his wife's birthday, so they had food. Don't know if that is normal, but it was nice to see. I personally like the layout. The prices are second to none, especially in Scottsdale. Definately a must for everyone. Thanks Michael for the recommendation to this place. Great job Brackin's!!!
