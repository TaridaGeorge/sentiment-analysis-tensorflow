Urban, cool, excellent meals... and a good value, nice folks, good, service, in fact the last time i went (a week ago) the waitress remembered my order from 2 months prior ...and I'm not that memorable, nice.
Just a fun place to bring a friend or a small group and get catered to with solid food, great pizza (easily stacks with Bianco if you factor in the wait) and a comfortable atmosphere.  Always a fall back for me and a place i like to show off in central Phoenix ...the place I'd like to own if I was in the food and drink biz.
