The people who run this place are honest, totally on top of their game, and nice.  I've brought in lamps that I was sure would need replacing, but they worked their magic - a couple of times within just a few minutes - and have charged me anywhere from $4.00 to $24.00.  I highly recommend taking any of your broken lighting fixtures here (even if they are missing parts).  The inventory of lamps, furniture and antiques is so vast that you will be fully entertained by walking around the store if you have to wait while they repair your fixtures.  A solid five stars!
