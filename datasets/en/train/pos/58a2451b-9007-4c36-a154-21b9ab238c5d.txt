This review is for the staff that I dealt with at the Hilton Phoenix Airport. I contacted the hotel last week to obtain a copy of a receipt. I spoke to a gentleman by the name of Cisco who answered the main phone line. He was over and above a very helpful, professional and kind person who ensured that I got in touch with the correct people to get the information I needed very quickly. It's rare to see wonderful customer service like that these days, so I truly appreciate it.
