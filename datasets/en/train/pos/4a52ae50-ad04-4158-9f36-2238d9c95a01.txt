Our son is due here very soon (like I could have him today if mother nature wanted..I'm 37 seeks), and I needed to get our new car seat installed ASAP.   I called and spoke with Jim at Hi-Tech yesterday and had a 3pm appointment all set up on the same day.  

Jim was AWESOME in teaching me how to install a car seat, in multiple locations within a vehicle.  Very informative.  The only thing it cost me for the install lesson - 40 minutes of my time!  I'm confident that our baby boy will be fully secure in his car seat, and that makes me a happy mommy (to be)!
