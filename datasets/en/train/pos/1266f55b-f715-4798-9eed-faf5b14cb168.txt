What great food & service. Started with Corn Bread & grilled Artichoke.  Corn Bread is out of this world. Grilled Salmon was melt in your mouth, served with Mash Potatoes and Broccoli.  Could not ask for a better meal. Wife had Flying Tuna platter  - words cannot describe the flavors.  Must Try.

Ask for Megan as your waitress. She was just awesome.
