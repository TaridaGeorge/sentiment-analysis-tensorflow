I came away from my meal (complete with cocktail + dessert) with no guilt. Local, fresh, tasty and healthy cuisine here. For the first round, order the fig tart! I'm a sucker for ahi sashimi and this salad had some homemade pickles that were just out of this world. I didn't miss the fact that there was no dressing on the salad. Almond Olive Oil Cake made me curious, and while it was tasty, I will be getting the Lemon Tart next time!
