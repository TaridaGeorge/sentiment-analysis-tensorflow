I've never been so happy to give somebody my money!  Without exaggeration, it is the best customer service I have ever received.  As silly as it sounds, I actually felt like they wanted nothing more in life than to cook me food.

The food is pretty good.  Some of the items are just average, others are great.  The prices are average.  Somehow I walk away from the place grinning every time, though.
