This theater is the best kept secret. It's never ever ever crowded. Even on opening nights. Like any theater, it's expensive as fuck and they try to rip you off at every turn. However, the parking garage for the Arizona Center Garage has placed a validation machine in the theater to reduce the parking fare. 

Anyway, I've found the staff here courteous and welcoming, and this theater is my very favorite.
