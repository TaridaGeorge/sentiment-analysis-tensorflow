Although it was a little out of our way, D'lish was worth the drive, times ten.

The guys behind the counter rock the casbah. They inject friendliness like they have a PhD in positivity. I loved every minute of sitting at the counter, I would have gladly swapped my 6-hour passenger seat spot home to LA to sit there and chat and slurp up their complimentary samples of the "breakfast buzz." Apparently it goes by many different names but just ask for the peanut butter thing and your am will forever be changed. The breakfast bagel I had on bialy bread was also top notch, filling, and inexpensive.

D'lish, want to take a road trip to LA?
