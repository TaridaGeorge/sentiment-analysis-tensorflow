Dinner Time Tuesday! Its so cozy! Dim Lighting. Great service, delicious food, priced right. Salad was super fresh! I had the King Crab Dinner, bf had the Steak and Lobster. All was delicious.  For dessert, The BEST chocolate cake I have ever had!! Large portion that came with 2 scoops of ice cream with raspberry  sauce. I love this place!! Will be coming back!
