Delicious food crafted with love from ingredients grown , milled, and locally sourced by the chef/owner.  And we know this because we were told it by the unassuming , Chris Bianco, who walked around the dining room asking diners if their food was ok and then described the ancient grains in our farrow dish, the tomatoes he grows in California, and the Arizona wheat he mills for the flour used in the pasta dough.  And our amazing desert was homemade by his mother, who happened to be in the restaurant that night.
