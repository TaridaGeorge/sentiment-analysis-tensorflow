The first night I went to this bar was on St Patty's day. The atmosphere was exactly what I was looking for. It has a Cheers feel. If you are a regular everybody knows your name. The staff are curteous and service is fast. The food is phenomenal. They have different specials every day. My favorite is the wing special on Sundays and Mondays. The karaoke on Saturday nights is the best I have been to in a long time. If you want a place that is filled with friends, this is the bar for you.
