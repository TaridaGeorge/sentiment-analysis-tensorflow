Do you fancy yourself a music snob? Then this is the place for you! If you can find it at Target, you probably won't find it here, which is why I love it. Within the confines of the four tiny walls lies a treasure trove full of obscure, independent and local bands that you won't find anywhere else. 

The listening stations are great- i've fallen in love with many new bands this way. 

I love Stinkweeds. If I visited as often as i'd like to, I'd be living in a box. But hey, I'd be in a box with a kick-ass music collection.
