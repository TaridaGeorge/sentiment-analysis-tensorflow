This place is always excellent.   It's the closest to the food I've had in China that I've eaten in all of Phoenix.    Particular favorite is the preserved egg.  If your lucky you can get them to serve it to you sliced like is done in China. Though it's good in their tofu dish as well.

They used to offer Chinese and Americanized Chinese on the same menu, but, now if you wish the Chinese version of dishes you need to request the Chinese menu.
