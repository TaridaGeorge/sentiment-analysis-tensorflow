My people.........The Vig Uptown still rules but they now charge an extra dollar for that gluten free bun.  Just started.  Hey, Monday still makes it a $6 burger and fries, so I'm all good!  We get there a little after 5 now and take advantage of some half price appetizers!  Then at 6 we put our burger order in.  We are cheap but the food is NOT!  Value, quality and great service.  Sometimes you wait when they're packed but who cares?  Best darn value on Monday in town!  Nicole is my favorite waitress!!!  Ask nice and they'll sell you some dip for the sweet potato fries!! ( I cannot duplicate it at home but still want it when I fry them myself!)
