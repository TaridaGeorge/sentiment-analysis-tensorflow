Went here had a unusual experience. Had a custom T-shirt made to order only to discover a problem after getting home. Called the store from California the next day.
Manager not only said sorry, they sent a new shirt to me a few days later no charge!
Great service, nice friendly staff, and lots and lots interesting gifts of varied prices and interests. Check it out when your in Old Town Scottsdale for Ol' time service.
