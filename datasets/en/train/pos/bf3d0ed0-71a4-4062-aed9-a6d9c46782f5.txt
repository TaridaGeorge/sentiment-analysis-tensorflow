What would I do without Elizabeth and her alterations.  My friend, Norma has been going to her for years.   As far as Norma, is concerned, there isn't anything that Elizabeth can't do and do well.  Based on number of customers she has and what I have seen people bring in, I am inclined to agree.  I also include wedding gowns and the number of delighted brides I have seen being fitted and picking up their gowns.  If you can do thet, well...

What I think makes Elizabeth special is there obvious knowledge of style and fabrics and fit.  I base this opinion on having personally worked with women's fashions for thirty years.  

She may not be the cheapest in Phoenix, but in tailoring, you do pay for what you get.  She does do the job right and that makes her services worth what she charges.
