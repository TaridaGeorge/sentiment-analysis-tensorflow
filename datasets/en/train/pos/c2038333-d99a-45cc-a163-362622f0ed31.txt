Just heard about this place last weekend. It is my new favorite addiction! The Only 8 yogurt has only 8 calories per ounce and the flavors I've tasted are yummy. My favorite two, so far, are Oatmeal Cookie and Cookie Batter. I'm working out and losing weight and this place takes care of my sweet tooth without putting me over on my calories. Give it a try!
