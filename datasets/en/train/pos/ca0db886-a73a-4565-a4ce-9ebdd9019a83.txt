I have to say that I do really like Oregano's. It has been around for quite some time now and every time I go it is a good time.
This location right on University is no different. Nice place, smells very good when you walk in , friendly staff.
The food is really great! I have never had a bad meal here.
 Pizza is too good!  Wings and toasted Raviolli  are just what the Dr. Ordered!
I do not have little ones, but I love that they give kids sough to play with while waiting for the food along with crayons and things to color. 
I have to say they think of everything . Nice job!
Bathrooms are clean, but parking is sometimes hard during busy times.
