Hands down, best Happy Hour value ever. Great food, topped off with amazing desserts. I'm very picky when it comes to desserts because I feel a lot of restaurants are secretly giving us trader joe's or betty crocker desserts. Here at the Cherry Blossom cafe, I enjoyed self-respecting desserts that were light and airy--a dream on a spoon. Yay!
