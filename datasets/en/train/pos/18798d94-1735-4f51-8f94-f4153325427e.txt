Amazingly relaxing.  By far the best aesthetics experience I've ever had.  I trust that Amber uses the most pure ingredients to find- raw local honey, coconut oil, and well-researched brands that I'd never even heard of.  The next morning my skin was glowing and radiant, which made me oh so happy inside & out.  Planning to go back on a monthly basis if not sooner to try out more of the makeup & sunscreens she carries.
