I flew into town for a last minute interview in the Phoenix area and needed a suit altered within 3 days. After looking on Yelp I decided to check out Valentina's and I'm so glad I did. Though she was hesitant about getting the sleeves done in time (I guess they're tricky), she said it would be ready by when I needed it. Everything turned out PERFECT! Not only did she hem my skirt, but she was able to change the shape to best flatter me. If I ever need an alteration in Phoenix again, I'm definitely coming back.
