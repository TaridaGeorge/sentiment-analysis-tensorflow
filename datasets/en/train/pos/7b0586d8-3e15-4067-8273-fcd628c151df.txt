I like Sprouts, though there is none too close to my house. I do find them when i and out and about , here and there. Sprouts has a good price on everything. We got wonderful Lobster tails there and Buffalo Steak. For a great surf and turf dinner. Both the Lobster and the Buffalo steaks were great! Can't beat it.  Lobster tails were only $6.00 a each!   Lots of good things to choose from here and .5cents off your bill for every bag you in.
