this is one of the, if not THE BEST burger in Phoenix.  And I wasn't prepared to say so.  But it is.

The beers are too expensive, so is the rent, I'm sure, but the burgers ARE delicious, the garlic fries... -- FORGET ABOIUT IT!!!!! -- THE BEST!

I'm not a fan of Sam Fox Restaurants.  Sauce sucks, Bloom blows, North is hit-and-miss... but Zin is wonderful!
