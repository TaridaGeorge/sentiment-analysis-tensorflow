Really extensive Native American Indian museum in Phoenix.  The cover all aspects of history, culture, and just about anything else.  Went here with my Australian friend because he was interested in it.  A lot of the material will be familiar for anyone who's grown up with it as part of history class, but even so, the exhibits are very well done and you'll learn a lot.  Definitely recommend the museum if you're in the area.  The student discount was also pretty sweet.
