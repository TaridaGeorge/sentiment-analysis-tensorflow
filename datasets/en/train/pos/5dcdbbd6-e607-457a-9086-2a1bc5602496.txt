A wonderful grocery store for ethnic foods. They have a great selection of noodles, decent seafoods, and fresh meats. The store was pretty clean, and the organization wasn't bad as well. And the snack isle was WOW! And the cashiers were all friendly, kind, and even adorable. I would highly recommend this place to anyone interested in asian foods, this is as good as it gets!
