Old 60's house, converted + urban farm + KILLER food = Joe's Farm Grill.

BEST burger!  OMG the fontina cheese and bacon on it made it SO yummie.  I rarely eat red meat and knowing it was fresh and free of antibiotics and manufactured feed created a guilt free experience!!   I got HOMEMADE bleu cheese dressing for dipping the KILLER ONION RINGS (which are hand breaded with rosemary and dill in the batter).  Really??? YES!! Everything on the menu has a cool twist to it but not overstated.  Got the homemade strawberry lemonade, YUM.

Worth the 40 minute drive from Scottsdale!!  

Don't forget to save room for a cupcake a the Coffee Shop next door!
