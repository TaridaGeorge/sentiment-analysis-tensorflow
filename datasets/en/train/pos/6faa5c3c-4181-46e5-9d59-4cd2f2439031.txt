I L-O-V-E the Skeptical Chymist!  I went for a Seahawks game, while visiting Phoenix and had an amazing time.  The decor is great and the atmosphere was lots of fun. The staff was very friendly and effiient.  I had fish and chips, which was very good and my friend had the cod sliders, which she loved.  This place is everything an Irish Pub should be.
