Great stuff, we went during happy hour.  I couldn't believe the prices at the end of the day.  The only problem was the salt and pepper chicken didn't have any salt.  Probably some snowbird complained that all the salt would raise his blood pressure.  $25 for two of us, both are over stuffed, and not oiled out. I am going back for sure.  
Also I saw Flo.
