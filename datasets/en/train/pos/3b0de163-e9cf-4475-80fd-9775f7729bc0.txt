This is the best restaurant in Az. We very happy to had give this place a try. We visit for dinner at list once a week now. I have to say we visit because this is a very friendly location and every time i visit I feel that I am going to my friends house. From the owners to the servers they are all super friendly. The food is very fresh and delicious. (I am very picky about service and food). This is the place to join for a great meal. If you try their Humus once you will never be able to eat Humus anywhere else, try the lentils soup like no where else. Their Baklava is out of this world. I highly recommend this restaurant to the world. Must give this place a try!!!
