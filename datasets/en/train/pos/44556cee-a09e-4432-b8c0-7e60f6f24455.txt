Just like it was when I went to ASU years ago! Packed on a Friday Night! It has that Bar/Pub smell...the smell of Beer! There were plenty of Tools, Hotties, and Chicken Hawks present. I was there to meet a Buddy and head out for a Night Ride on Purple Rain (my motorcycle). It was too crowded to try some wings like fellow Yelper E W. suggested. I will have to return to see if she was not lying (I am sure she knows the deal as she likes them Extra Crispy). If you are one of the younger 21-25 year old ASU students...You should be able to get your sexy on here, that is if you have any game at all.
