Ive had so much fun climbing up and down these rocks. When you get out of the car you realize it's a damn hike just to get to rocks which definitly a good warmer up before you start flying up these red beauties. 

Once your half way to the rocks you start to feel like your starring as Fred Flinstone in the next over rated box office bomb "Flinstones in Arizona". Once at the top you can see all of tempe, and you also can realize how small the zoo looks from up there. That is kind of a sad realization. :(  Its beautiful view and worth the trip and effort to see!

Be careful and don't over do it. One of my friends fell like 20 feet down and luckily only had a broken leg.

Be Safe! Bring water!
