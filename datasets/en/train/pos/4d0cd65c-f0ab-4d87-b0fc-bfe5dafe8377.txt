Their selection of flavors will leave you astounded. Not only is it vast, but the good gelato folks have prepared some enjoyable mixes for the Ammurican customer. Do try their whiskey cream if they have it out. 

The gelato may be the best I've had outside of Italy and their cappuccino was done quite nicely.
