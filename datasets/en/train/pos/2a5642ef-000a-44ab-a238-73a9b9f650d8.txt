Perfect marriage of Mouth-Watering deliciousness that I crave for! 

Garlic Shrimp (requested it to be prepared traditional extra Thai hot) is my absolute favorite here. Yum!!  

Service always great.  Owners and cooks always preparing my food perfectly hot & spicy!

Thai coffee is fab; and even the glass of water is refreshing with a slice of cucumber.
