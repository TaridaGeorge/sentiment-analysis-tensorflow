As the 5 stars show "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" Ok, it is only breakfast but  great, consistent fair. Tiny little place so you will have to wait but they keep the folks rolling in and out. Been there twice and have sat at the counter both times. The Hog & Chick with bacon, thick bacon...awesome!  Eggs the way you want. Get the hash browns as they are better than you can make at home, but if you like your potatoes chunky then get the home fries but a warning for people who aren't into rosemary, home fries have rosemary on them. Fresh sliced toast and homemade jam, I think it was plum. My wife had the omelet and loved it.
