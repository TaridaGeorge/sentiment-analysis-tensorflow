We usually do takeout because the interior is pretty drab, but the food is anything but! I have eaten a lot of Indian food in many parts of the world (London, New York, Toronto) and this restaurant is one of my favorites (though a notch below Chutney's on Drummond Road in London). I highly recommend the dosas (all are good) and the vegetable curry is unbelievable. I am not a vegetarian, but if all vegetarian dishes were as good as those at Woodlands, I could easily convert!
