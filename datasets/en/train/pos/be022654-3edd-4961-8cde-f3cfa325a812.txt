How can I be craving a Rocket Burger Reuben and I have only had 3 in my life? That is how delish this place is! Went there for carryout today. The owners are super nice, as usual. When I got home, mu food was piping hot and YUMMY! I hope everyone in the Northern Phx area begins frequenting this semi hidden gem. The food is excellent and affordable and the service is the best!
