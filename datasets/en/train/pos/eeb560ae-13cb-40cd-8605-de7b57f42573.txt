Awesome experience! Best food you'll find in the city of Gilbert. Nice staff, great wine selection. Relaxed atmosphere; you can literally sit and drink wine as long as you want. Also, cheap corkage fee (only ten dollars). So, grab your soul mate, grab a delicious bottle of wine off of the shelf and enjoy an amazing night/afternoon into night at this amazing venue!
