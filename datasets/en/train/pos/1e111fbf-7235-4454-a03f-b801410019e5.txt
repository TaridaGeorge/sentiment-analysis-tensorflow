The weather is cooling down, and wearing a long sleeve shirt is about to be the norm. What goes better with cool weather than a hot bowl of soup? A hot bowl of Pho with meatballs and brisket from this place! This was the best Pho that I've had in Arizona; the broth is flavorful, meat cooked to perfection, vegetables fresh and green. The staff was incredibly friendly, offering small cups of soup as a sample, and even offering my girlfriend the opportunity to change her order if it was not to her liking. (She was a bit braver than I and got a more traditional Vietnamese bowl, which she LOVED) The restaurant was clean, bathrooms were nice, and they even had the UofA football game on the tv! I highly recommend this place over any other Pho restaurant in town. Check it out!
