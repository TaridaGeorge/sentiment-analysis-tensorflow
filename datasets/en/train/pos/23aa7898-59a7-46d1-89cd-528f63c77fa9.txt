This restaurant is located inside of the Mekong Plaza. This is an authentic vietnamese place that specializes in middle vietnam cuisine. I come here for their speciality and this place is consistently delicious. Try the BUN BO HUE (spicy red soup) and you can tell them how spicy you like it. It can get pretty intense so plan accordingly - mild spice. They take cash or credit so no worries about not having cash in hand. You would not expect that this place to be a "restaurant" since it's looks like a mall food court. I still leave a tip on the table since food and drinks are technically served to me. I love me some pho noodle soups, but when it comes to bun bo hue - do not go anywhere else but here!
