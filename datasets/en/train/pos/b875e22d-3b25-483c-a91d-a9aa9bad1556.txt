My friend had the baked halibut with a twice baked potato. He loved them both. I got the top sirloin with rice pilaf and mushrooms. Everything was excellent. As soon as I ried the rice I knew I made a good choice. wild rice with tons of flavor. It went really well with my steak. Nothing but good things to say about the entire experience. My dinner was only $25 which was very reasonable for the quality and portion. 2 people dinner 1 drink each was like $72 plus tip. If your in the area I would defiantely give this place a try.
