I am not a burger girl but this place is AWESOME. We don't have one on our side of town so on the weekends if we want a good burger, we make the diverges are super fresh and fires are simple but tasty. I would recommend ordering one regular size order of fires and sharing with 2-3 people. It is really a ton of fires. Overall I highly recommend even if your not a burger lover like myself.
