David was professional and punctual. He had very competitive prices, and he did an amazing job. He matched colors for us and painted two bedrooms that had been completely butchered by the previous home owners. You would never know looking at it now! He even went the extra mile and fixed the overage paint on the ceilings in the other rooms as well.  I will definitely refer friends and family to him!
