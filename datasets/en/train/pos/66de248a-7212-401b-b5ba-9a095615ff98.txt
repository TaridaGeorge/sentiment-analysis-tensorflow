In my opinion, one of the best steakhouses in town.  My husband and I go here for all our special occasions and have never had one bad meal.  The service is the best just like their steaks.  I recommend the Caesar salad, fillet, creamed spinach, cream corn, garlic and lobster mashed potatoes.  We will continue our tradition and keep coming back here.
