I have a huge sweet tooth, but being a baker myself, I'm always very picky about the desserts I choose. I have to say, Woobie's Cookies are definitely high on my favorite cookie list. The cookies are consistently soft and fluffy with some really cool flavors. I tried their Caramel Brulee Woobiedoodle last Saturday for the first time and I was surprised at how yummy rich the flavor was. My favorite, though, is still the Cocoa Ganache. These ladies have NAILED the art of ganache which is not an easy feat. It's also good to know they use quality, organic ingredients, which is a HUGE plus for me since not only is it better for you, but it really makes a difference in the taste. It's cool to know I can find some really good quality stuff from this unique small business right here in downtown Phoenix.
