Me and the my 2 boys have been going to CHC for along time. We dont let the girls in the family go because it's "the boy place".
Everything on the menu is great!
And the chocolate malts? never had a better one!
Fire dogs are perfect, the owner is always helpful.
But.........dont think that you will get a parking space or a seat around lunch time cause the customers are lined up out the door.
This place is truly a gem.
