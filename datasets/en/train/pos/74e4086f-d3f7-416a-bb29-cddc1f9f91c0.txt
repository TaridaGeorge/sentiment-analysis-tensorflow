For some reason, not every bar in town offers Sangria.  Enter My Big Fat Greek.  Sangria here is good and in fact, I got really drunk off some chocolate martinis there a few weeks ago too.  Nearly forgot about that.

Aside from booze, My Big Fat Greek has great food IMO.  I really like the chicken salad or the chicken pita.  The hummus is also always a great starter.  

I've always had attentive service and like the general Greek vibe I get when I eat here.  Casual atmosphere, great for lunch or for dinner.  Good location in Old Town next to many shops and bars.  Highly recommended!
