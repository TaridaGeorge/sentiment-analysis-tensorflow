Great service, delicious food with huge portions! I was a little skeptical about eating waffles with chicken but the flavors compliment each other beautifully. I wish the waffles were belgin style but other than that I loved them. They were made with cinnamon and the syrup was amazing. I had the KK (number 1) which also came with grits and eggs. I could have done without them but only because it was so much food. Next time I wanna try the Mac n cheese and collard greens.
