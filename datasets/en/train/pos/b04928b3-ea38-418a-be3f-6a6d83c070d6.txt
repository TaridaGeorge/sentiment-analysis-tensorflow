Best BBQ in the area hands down!! Fresh meat prepared daily so get there early! Mac and cheese...... Redonkulous!! Only downside is no alcoholic beverages:(  Despite that and no tv's, theres a huge outdoor seating area that looks like your grandmas backyard (minus the swing set) that makes for a real comfortable dining experience. 5 stars all day!!
