I am a bit of a beer snob and will not drink beer that is not up to my standards. I really enjoyed the beer. I had the IPA and was quite happy. 

The staff is quick, responsive, and personable. I enjoyed that fact that the TVs did not have sports showing. Instead it was science fiction shows. 

One of the things I truly loved was the fact that they didn't decide to jump into beer and food. They focused on the beer. With that in mind, the option for food was to order out. This gave everyone a wide selection to choose from.
