Mr Hiro you got a review of the day with a little help from Michelle M of course.

I am no expert here. I have however known Mr Hiro for many years and right from the start loved how the chefs took extra care when making food and how I would feel in his small restaurant with all the style.

I remember my first visit with my friend, a sushi maniac so many years ago. I hardly understood the food at all. We ate crisp shrimp heads. I hardly believed this was food.

Anyway I have grown to love sushi and sitting at the bar. It's more than just a food, sushi is an art form enjoyed for its taste as well as presentation. 

Hiro Sushi, better than a single slab of o-toro tuna.
