This place is terrific!!!  Rob and his staff are knowledgeable, extremely good at what they do and they make it very easy to get your car fixed.  They worked directly with my insurance company.  All I had to do was show up when it was done.  The job was done right the first time and when it was promised.  You can't even tell where my Lexus was damaged.  If you take your car anywhere else to get fixed you are taking your chances....this is THE PLACE.
