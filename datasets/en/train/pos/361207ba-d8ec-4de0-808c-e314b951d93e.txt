Fabulous!  Denise and her staff are amazing.  I went to them with a challenge--fix a broken plastic motorcycle tail light and turn signal assembly that is no longer available.  They repaired it with a fiberglass-type material, filled in the missing parts, sanded and shaped it and repainted it, and it's better than new!  They took on the project as a challenge even though it was a complete shot in the dark that it would work.  Great people, excellent work, honest and friendly--the very best!
