One girl was talking to her friend and the friend's mom so I had to re-stand in the line while a few others who walked in after me got waited on by the one poor girl trying to help everyone but she was pleasant. I loved my purchases, oreo fudge, mint oreo fudge and peanut butter in chocolate fudge. Crappy customer service wont keep me away from chocolate, I mean it will somewhat but I will go there again. Ill just make sure I stay away from the one girl and get in line for the other girl.
