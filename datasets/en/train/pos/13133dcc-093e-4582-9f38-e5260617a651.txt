Took two classes at Bikram Yoga Tempe and found the facilities and instructors to be top notch. Facilities were very clean and both teachers for my classes were great. The "carpet" is really cool in the yoga room...more like a fuzzy, grippy mat. The humidifier did a pretty good job for Arizona...nothing like Texas where humidity is natural, but enough to make it a nice sweaty class.
