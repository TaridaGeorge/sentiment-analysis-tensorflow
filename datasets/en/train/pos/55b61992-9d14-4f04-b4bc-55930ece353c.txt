One of my best friends in college refused to call Ikea Ikea. Instead, she would only respond if you called it "The Magical Place of Wonderment." I think she was onto something. 

It is like Costco only with good short-term use furniture and without the need to buy in "years." And the snack bar is just as good, too, if not better. The swedish meatballs are no joke and neither is the breakfast. 

WORD TO THE WISE: Near the cashiers by the door there is a used and returned section that is a can't miss. Most of the stuff there is broken or missing a piece, but catch it on the right day and you might find a smokin' deal on a piece of furniture or art at a fraction of the original price. Check there before you check out.
