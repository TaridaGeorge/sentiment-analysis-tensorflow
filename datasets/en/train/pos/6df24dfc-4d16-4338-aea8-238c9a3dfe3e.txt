A bar with one of the best views around that serves up amazing cocktails as well?! If I lived in PHX, I'd be taking all my dates here. Gorgeous, cozy, romantic... LOVE IT!

The bartenders are all very friendly, and they are fantastic mixologists. I absolutely loved my Bourbon Sidecar. And you can get a little piece of SF here - yes, they have Fernet!

Located at Sanctuary Resort, you can enjoy drinks inside the swanky lounge or even better - take your cocktails outside onto the secluded patio, get comfy by the fire pit or under a heat lamp and star gaze.

SWOON.
