Great for trail running--not so scrabbly that you need to worry about foot placement at all. I ran to the Taliesian lookout and was surprised how quickly I arrived. I ended up running back toward the trailhead and spurring around the Sunrise Loop (2 to 3 miles, I'd guess). My (phone's, granted) GPS indicated my total run to be 5.6 miles, which seemed accurate. Maybe signage indicating the hike to Taliesian and back as 6 miles is off? Or, maybe my phone's wonky and I'm a stronger runner than I thought!

I'll add: the Sunrise Loop spur I took was a lot more scrabbly and required thoughtful foot placement--mostly the southern leg of it.

If you have recommendations for 4 - 10 mile loops in Phoenix and especially in this part of town, please let me know!
