I am a Huge fan! I love a place where you can get some peanuts while you wait for your food. They use peanut oil to cook their food as well. 

This place is clean, friendly, and good food. What else can you ask for? 

I am a fan of In N out, I think they have fresh burgers too. BUT this place blows them out of the water. The burgers are cooked right there in front of you, the ingredients are always fresh and good, I love the sign telling you where their potatoes came from today. 

A simply menu that can be extraordinary. You can hand pick whatever you want on your burger at no extra charge. My choice is grilled onions bacon and cheese.
