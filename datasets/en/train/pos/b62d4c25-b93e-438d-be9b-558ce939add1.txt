So, a carnivore goes into veggie restaurant...

No, seriously, this is great stuff. I have a friend who's a veggie and loves Indian food, so when I noticed this place sandwiched between a hair salon and a pizza chain, I had to tell her. We checked it out tonight, and DAMN. The Gobi Manchurian is amazing, especially with the mint chutney. The spinach dosai is very good, but a bit dry (not that that stopped us from fork-fighting over the last bits). This unrepentant flesh-eater went away completely happy and didn't miss the meat at all. Think I'll be coming back at least once a week.
