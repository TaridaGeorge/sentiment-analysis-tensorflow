The staff was very welcoming and the food was fantastic.  I the spaghetti with Clams with the red sauce and came away very impressed.  The bruschetta was a tad on the bland side, but still good.  the main entrees we ordered were very very good though and the place had a nice ambiance even though it is in a shopping center.
