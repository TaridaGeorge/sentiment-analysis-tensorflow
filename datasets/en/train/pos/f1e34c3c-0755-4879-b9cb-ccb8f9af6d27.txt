For the price, you can't beat this place during the winter.  $75 (after tax, including range balls) during January, when everybody else in the area is charging $200?  Yes, please!

Everything was in great condition.  Greens rolled fast and true, and dead spots were nonexistent.  It's not the most interesting track, but it's got enough variety to keep it fun.  Really loved the back nine, particularly #11, #14, and #15.
