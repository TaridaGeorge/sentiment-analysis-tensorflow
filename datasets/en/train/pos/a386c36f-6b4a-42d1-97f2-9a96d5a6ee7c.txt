This store in my eyes is the Ralph's that I am used to in California. This is your one stop shop for a good amount of your daily needs. There is a gas station, pharmacy, bank, red box, bakery, florist, butcher all in this one location and the prices are amazing. The lines here are short which is a relief coming from California's line ridden grocery stores. There are four self check out registers and at least six assisted check out lines. Customer service is key at this location with a greeter at the front door and employees walking around trying to assist you in any way possible.
