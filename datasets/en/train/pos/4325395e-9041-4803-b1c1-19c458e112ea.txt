We had a fabulous experience at NOCA! We were promptly seated, service was extremely attentive, and the food was melt-in-your mouth fantastic, if I could give it three thumbs up, I would! ;-) 

My husband had Prime Hangar Steak and I had Salmon--the textures and flavors were exquisite and we enjoyed every bite of both. I am a dessert junkie and loved the addition of cotton candy as a "pre" dessert--it was delicious and fun. We got the homemade donuts with dipping sauces for dessert--yum, yum. Highly recommended!

Can't wait to go there again! Enjoy! :-)
