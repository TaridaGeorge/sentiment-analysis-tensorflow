i brought some visiting guests here for dinner one night to celebrate an early new year.

they are visitors from OC, so i knew it would be difficult to impress them... but with eddie v's, i was successful!

this place has great live music, a fantastic menu, impeccable service, and an overall fun and classy ambience.

we will be dining here again. i recommend trying the chilean sea bass, hong kong style and the truffle mac and cheese.

this is a phenomenal restaurant -- do yourself a favor and dine here!
