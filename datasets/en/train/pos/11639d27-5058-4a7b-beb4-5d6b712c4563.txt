I am not a huge fan of smoothie king as I am a total Jamba Juice girl, so the only reason that I give them 5 stars is because I was AMAZED by the customer service I received this morning. 

We went in there earlier this week, and I was casually chatting with my boss about not liking papaya etc while the lady was making my smoothie. This morning when we came in, the same lady was there and she remembered all of my comments from earlier in the week (even though I wasn't addressing them to her) and offered to make me a custom smoothie with mango juice instead of papaya and no dairy or protein! 

My custom smoothie turned out super yummy! I wish I knew her name so that I could suggest she get a promotion because she is truly an awesome employee!
