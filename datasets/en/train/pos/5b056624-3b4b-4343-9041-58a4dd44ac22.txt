I have never been to a restaurant like this before and I LOVE IT!

I had the sausage and sauteed onion pizza with a glass of snoqualmie Riesling. I've never really been a fan of thin crusted pizza's but this was absolutely amazing!! The prices were extremely fair and lovable. 

The ordering process was a little weird to me, as I've never experienced something quite like it before, You walk up to the counter, put your order in there (like a fast food place), pay then you walk over to the drink station and sit down and they bring you your meal. The service I received was fast and amazing! 

Now that I have experienced Sauce I will definitely be coming for more!
