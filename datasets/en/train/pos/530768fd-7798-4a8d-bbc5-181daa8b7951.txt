I have two Great Danes and only wish I had know about this place sooner. Now the hair and mess stays there and somebody else gets to mop up all the water on the floor. I love the constant flow of water/soap like a car wash where I can soap and scrub them all in one. It gets them way cleaner than I could ever do at home. They come home smelling great and hair free until they go out in the backyard a dig a hole and come back in the house with their faces covered in dirt. Oh well, we'll be back next week.
