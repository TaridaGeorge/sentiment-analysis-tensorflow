I have been here many times over the years. We came here 2 weeks ago, but It was time for another visit.  Stopped in to pick up an early dinner to go around 3:30pm.
Double cheese burger with Provolone and french fries.
 This is a grat place for a healthy Burger. They meat here is delivered fresh everyday.
High price for the burgers but, well worth it, because, the food is great!
This is better than what you can make at home.
Nice and clean inside, smells good, and looks nice.
We will come here again many times. My girlfriend does not even like Burgers, but she loves these.
