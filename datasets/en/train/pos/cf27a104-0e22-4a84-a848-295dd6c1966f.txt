I decided to check out this place with my wife. As we all know Gilbert is more of a quite place but this place got it all. I ordered Tomato Mozzarella as an app, and Mozzarella Chicken sandwich on Focaccia bread. Impressive presentation with balanced flavors and fresh ingredients. The servers all worked together to insure outstanding service. 
Well done Guys this is a 4G restaurant and way ahead of the game.Hands down, well done place.
