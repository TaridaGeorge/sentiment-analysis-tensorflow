This is the only place I like to buy a car from. The people are not like the usual idiot car dealers. 

I bought a car from them but after driving it for a few days I decided I didn't like it because it was really small. The had a 5 day return policy so I went and exchanged it and it was so easy. I still have the car I bought from them, and the next time I need a car I will go there.

I have also sold my car to them and it's also fast and easy.
