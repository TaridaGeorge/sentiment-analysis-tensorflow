What can I say? Like FRY's Electronics for homeowners!  I love this place and have trouble getting out for less than $100:)
The warranties ae great, but I'v never had to use one. I have bought : Large compressor, Circular Saw, Angle Cutting Tool, Dremel, Saber-saw, Drill, 3 AIR Nailers, and noone have failed.
Also buy tools, rubber gloves, my electronic shooting earmuffs, safety glasses, and many, many items for my garden such as hoses, splitters, rake, hoe, drip systems, etc.
GREAT DEALS!
