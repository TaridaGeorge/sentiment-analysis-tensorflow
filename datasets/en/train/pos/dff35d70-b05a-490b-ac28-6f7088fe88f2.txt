There are many trails here and I love that it's almost impossible to get lost, even with the loops.
It goes for miles, so it's really ideal for any length of a run or walk, with or without your dog, horse, or bike.

There are bathrooms off of Cave Creek, lots of parking, and 4 major access points- @ Cave Creek & Deer Valley, off Tatum between Beardsley & Union Hills, 56th St (haven't entered here) and Scottsdale Rd (haven't entered here either).

Beautiful scenery, mostly flat with a few small hills.

There are baseball and soccer fields too.

Also home to many, many events frequently going on. (Zombie Run!! Arizona Road Racers, youth sporting events, and more).

I always look forward to going back.
