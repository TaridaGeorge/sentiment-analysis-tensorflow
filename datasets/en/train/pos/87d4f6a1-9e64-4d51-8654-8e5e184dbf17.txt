We had a fabulous lunch here last Saturday. Perhaps it just happened to be the perfect combination of circumstance and mood, but our meal really hit the spot. After finishing a hike, we were ready to relax and enjoy a nice meal. We shared a roast beef sandwich, a red pepper and gouda soup, and a side of the mixed greens salad. The salad was quite possibly the best I have ever had. It had the perfect amount of salad dressing (I don't like it when it's drenched) and it had the perfect amount of stuff in it - amazing! We also had Mimosas (made with fresh squeezed orange juice!) and ended with the Chocolate Bouchon. If I lived in Phoenix, I would be here all the time!
