I've been in many presidential suites, few better than the one here.
Everything is superb.
Attention to detail, focused and sharp.
And the room itself?
Romantic with it's outdoor showers, making you feel almost naughty when showering.
And room service?
I enjoyed the eggs benedict, although it was somewhat cold.

Too bad they only give me till two o'clock to get this place cleaned and ready for inspection.
