FEZ is great anytime really, but after experiencing their weekend brunch, i must say, that this is probably one of the best deals you can get for the brunch scene.
The weekend brunch cocktail list is over the top (and no not the stallone arm wrestling movie either): mimosas, greyhounds, and bloody marys for $3!! My bloody mary was spicy, stiff and tall, with two green pimento olives and lemon & lime wedges. After two of them i was feeling pretty good!
The brunch menu is awesome, huge portions, delicious and varied selection of dishes, and ballpark, prices roughly of $10 or so.
FEZ is definitely a viable option for breakfast, and probably your best bet for brunch!
