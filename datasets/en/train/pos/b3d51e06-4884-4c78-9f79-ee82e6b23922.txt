The BF and I went last weekend for the first time after hearing great things about it (and after buying a 2 for 1 Groupon a while back).  We were not disappointed.  My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer because there is so much to see.  I really enjoyed "The Boarding School Experience".  Very interesting...but very sad.  Can't wait to go back!
