I have a secret.
I don't like greek food.  At all.  I hate olives, feta cheese, gyros, etc.

I brought my mom here for her birthday, and it was GREAT!

The entertainment was AWESOME and family friendly.
Everyone in the place was laughing and having a great time.  

My family very much enjoyed the greek food too.  

This is where everything birthday/special occasion should be celebrated.  Hands down.

OPA!
