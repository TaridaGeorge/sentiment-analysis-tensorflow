I ate here once a few years ago, and don't remember it well.  Since then, I've eaten at the bar, and attended events, but not a sit down dinner.  Last night was a great experience.  It was restaurant week, and we were a party of 14.  I was very impressed with both the menu and the service.  Our three course meal was great. We all shared a variety of appetizers, the borata cheese being my favorite.   I started with the carpaccio, had a pasta with carnitas, and finished with zepoles.  We had great wine, and it was a beautiful evening for sitting outside.  This restaurant has a great menu, but when the service is great too, it makes for an all around great experience.  I will be back for sure.
