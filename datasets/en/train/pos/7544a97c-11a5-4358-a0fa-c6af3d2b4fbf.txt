Lupe has been amazing helping me plan and re-plan my wedding flowers.  I am sure she must think I am a crazy bride but she is always patient and very understanding when I call or stop in with questions or concerns.  With all of the hectic things going on around me, I know Lupe at the Flower Shoppe has everything under control and this is an area I am simply not worried about!  I have found a florist for life!
