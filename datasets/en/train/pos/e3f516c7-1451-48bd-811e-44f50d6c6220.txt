My office is a short walk to Cafe Roma and I go at least 3 times a week. If you go during the lunch rush the line will look long, but it goes quickly. The Hawaiian pizza is my favorite slice and I'll usually get a side salad as well.  I hear the sandwiches are amazing as well. They get a bonus star for friendliness and customer service by the couple running the front.
