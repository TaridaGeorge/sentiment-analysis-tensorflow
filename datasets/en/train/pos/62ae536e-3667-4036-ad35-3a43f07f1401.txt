Wow! This place lives up to its reputation. And I can honestly say it has one of the best if not best dough and crust that I have ever had. Plus the ingredients just taste fresh. Most of the pizzas you order here will not have more than 3-4 toppings, so it is simplistic. But these are some very very delicious simplistic pizzas. 

My friends and I had the mozzarella and tomatoes then ordered the Margherita, Biancoverde, and the one with sausage (can't remember the name of this pizza). Every single one of the pizzas had the right amount of cheese and the combination was thoroughly entertaining my palate. 

Here's a tip: If you come for dinner here you will probably wait for over 1-2hours. But they are now open for lunch which means you can get there at 11 and get a seat right away!
