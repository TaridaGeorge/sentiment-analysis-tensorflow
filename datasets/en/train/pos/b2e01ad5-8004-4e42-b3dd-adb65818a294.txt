Great!  I had the zucchini blossoms stuffed with goat cheese, Nonni's Sunday chicken and the prickly pear sorbet.  The blossoms had been lightly breaded then fried yet had a very clean, yummy flavor.  I had to refrain from licking the bowl that had Nonni's boneless chicken thighs accompnied by toasted polenta triangles.  Dessert was the prickly pear sorbet which was heavenly light and accompanied by three different small cookies.  Service was excellent and we will return asap.
