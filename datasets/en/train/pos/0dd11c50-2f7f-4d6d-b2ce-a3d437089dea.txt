Last time ate here was 15 years ago. Sahara was still in it's original location on mill and University. I always remembered how this was one if the first authentic tasting restaurants in Tempe.

Proud to say that the food holds up to the test of time. I came from California bragging to my wife and kids that this place is the ultimate in middle eastern cuisine.  Bravo for Sahara. People in Arizona can thank them for raising the food palette in here.
 Be nice to yourself and make this place your destination!!!!!
