Since moving to Arizona, two years ago, we have eaten at Joe's many times.  We moved into a new house last year, and ran to Joe's to eat and break up the backbreaking.  My wife and I were both blown away by the food, and decided to make a trip back the next day for more.  Any time we have visitors, we always take them to Joe's, and almost always create new fans.

Some menu items of interest are the Ahi burger, the 4B (Barbeque bacon blue-cheese burger), and the garlic fries.  We have only been for breakfast twice, but the first time had the bacon and blue cheese pancakes.  I have never had a better breakfast.  The combination sounds weird, but the sweetness of the pancake and the syrup were an amazing contrast to the blue cheese and the salty bacon.
