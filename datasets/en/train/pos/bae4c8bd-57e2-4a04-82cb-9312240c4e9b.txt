This place was really terrific! Went for the first time this morning with a friend & we both thought it was probably the best diner experience you can have in this town. 

The country potatoes were the best I've had in a restaurant--not greasy with great flavor. Good quality bacon and the coffee is really something to talk about too! 

They give you a choice of cheese for your omelet--I thought that was pretty uptown for a diner! :-) 

The owner says he tries to source as much locally as he can which is also nice---support your local Farm Bureau! Speaking of the owner(s) they were there working their tails off greeting, serving & generally chatting up everyone. Super nice people! I couldn't be more impressed with the food, service, or overall experience.

This is now on my very short list of favorite places to eat.
