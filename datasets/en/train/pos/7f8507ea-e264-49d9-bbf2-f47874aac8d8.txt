Merc bar hits just the right pitch for me in Phoenix. Always starts out slow (we got there early for the real estate) and ends up kinda packed. Staff and music always good and you don't feel like you are in one of those ridiculous cirque du soleil type places in Scottsdale full of shiny, happy young republicans nor one of the downtown spots full of emo, salty, better than thou modified arts types that think they are in the East Village circa 1980. Ugh! I'll take Merc each and every time, Thanks!
