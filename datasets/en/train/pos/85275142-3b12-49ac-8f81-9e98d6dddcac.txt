I absolutely love Liberty Market! I have never had a bad meal and even my husband who is the pickiest eater in the world loves it here. The atmosphere is very simple and modern and very cute. It does get very crowded on the weekends but that just tells you that its good :) also the bathrooms are sooo cool!
