Finally! An amazing cheese pie! My fiance is from Long Island and we've been all around the Valley trying to find something that comes close to the delicious pizza of his past. They have some great wine and food specials and serve yummy gelato on site. Their pizza salads are really great as well. If you're in the area, definitely stop by this gem, they won't disappoint!
