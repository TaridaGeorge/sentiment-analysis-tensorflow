Great staff, so helpful and nice. Food was outstanding and the coffee price cannot be beat... 50 cents!! I would have to say the grilled cheese is one of the best I have had in a long time. This location is just like the Scottsdale Kierland location, but the space is about 3x bigger! Wonderful place to get breakfast or lunch.
