We came in to support DevourPhoenix and Waste Not, and ended up loving all 5 dishes and my drink. The osso bucco is to die for, the zucchinni cakes were amazing, the biscuits are great, and the dessert--the bacon smores--are surprisingly awesome. my AZ Farmland drink was excellent and a decent size.

our waiter was funny, always checking in, and he made great recommendations that he clearly knew about. we couldn't decide on two desserts, because we also wanted to try the cream cheese citrus ice cream, and instead got two completely different desserts. our waiter brought by a scoop of the ice cream at the very end which was a very kind surprise.
