Had dinner here tonight and so happy with the food, service and of course that there's finally one of these close to my work and home!

It's new and lovely but with all the wonderful Mediterranean food we've grown to expect and love from Pita Jungle. 

I had a delicious Strawberry Banana smoothie, a good sized portion of a spanakopita for my starter and wonderfully fresh falafel hot pita for my entree. I'd highly recommend a visit and many again. It was buzzing but the service was still attentive. Bravo!
