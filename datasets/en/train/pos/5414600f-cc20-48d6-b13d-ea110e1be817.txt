we used Moore and Son's carpet cleaning in June of this year.  Gary arrived on time, honored the price he quoted us, even after some stains proved more work to remove than he planned for.

We also had him clean our couch and were THRILLED with the results.

In addition, he gave us great tips on how to avoid those kinds of stains in the future (ie: don't use store bought carpet stain removers, just stick with good ol' vinegar, or clear water so the soap doesn't stick in the fibers and become like a magnet for further stain development.)
