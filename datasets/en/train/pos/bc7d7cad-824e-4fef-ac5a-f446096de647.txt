I love boba drinks but hate the word "boba". I always feel like an ape when I say that word. 
 
Anyways.

There was a period where I use to drink this stuff at least 3 times a week when I was living in San Francisco, so when I say I love something, I really do (or is it more like a creepy obsession?) So! When I found a boba place here I got excited, especially when I saw that they had green milk tea.

I can't vouch for all of their drinks, as I've only tried the green milk tea and avocado snow, but every time I have ordered them they have been super good.
