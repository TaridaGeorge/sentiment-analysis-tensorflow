I had such a fantastic time at Cibo.  The pizza is super and the ambiance is charming AND it won't break the bank.  Wood-fired gourmet type pizzas.  Get the antipasto plate!  Salads are good.  I will warn you that the wait for a big group may be epic during prime time.  The venue is a tiny cottage in an unlikely part of downtown Phoenix.   Really cute and fun.  I'll be back.
