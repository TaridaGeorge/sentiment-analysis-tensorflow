I would recommend this studio only if: you want to improve your overall well being, to control your trauma triggers,  improve your memory, your mood, your muscle tone, your skin and your flexibility. Being at the studio with Sharon, Ruby, Kim, the instructors and my friends just makes me happy. After class I feel like a person in control of myself. I actually joined yelp to put this message out here so others may also have a chance to experiance something wonderful like" happiness".
