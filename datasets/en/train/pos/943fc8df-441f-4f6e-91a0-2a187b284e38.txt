Just took friends from out of town this morning and had another fantastic breakfast.  Two of us enjoyed the Prosciutto and Roasted Roma Tomato Breakfast Sandwich.  Another had the Baked Pancakes and the last ordered the Prosciutto, Arugula and Goat Cheese Frittata.  We were all very pleased with the food.  The seasoned potatoes that accompanied the sandwich and frittata were delicious.  Jackie, the owner and chef, greeted us upon arriving and she really makes you feel welcome.  It's not the first time I've been and certainly won't be the last.  Our friends left full, satisfied and bemoaning the fact that they don't have anything as good or reasonably priced in Palm Springs for breakfast.
