By golly, I've found it!  After going to 4 Thai restaurants since I've moved to the Phoenix area (only 3 months ago), I've finally found my go-to spot!!! This place is close to school, clean, great food, great service and a great lunch special.  Also I'm a sucker for presentation and they go all out!  I had a great experience and they got me in and out on my short lunch break! YES!! :D
