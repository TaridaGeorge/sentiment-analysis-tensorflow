Wow, came here yesterday for breakfast since I was in the area and the place is cool.  It is a very good sized location and I thought the window to the business next door was very cool from the inside.  It is very 50's looking diner with a good size parking lot and the service was great also.  My waiter recommended trying the pancakes so I did and they were phenomenal.  I ordered the number 2 which comes with bacon, sausage, eggs, & pancakes.... the plate was just to much to finish but I had to eat all the pancakes because they were so darn good.  This place has a nice atmosphere and you feel very comfortable reading the newspaper and having a quiet breakfast.  I cant believe that the place has not been open for a year yet either.
