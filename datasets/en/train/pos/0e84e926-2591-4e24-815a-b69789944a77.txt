LOVED our experience here...went on NYE day for a fun lunch (I had to work that night so we celebrated during the day) but it was so freaking good!!!!!!!!! me and the BF shared the beet salad which was so good and you could tell everything was fresh.  BF got the briskett sandwich and I got the sliders-bother were over the top good and we couldn't get over their sweet potato chip things-not a fry but not a chip either but SOOOO good.  I would totoally recommend this place to anyone who appreciates food and loves a fun and different atmosphere....Enjoy!
