Co-workers introduced me to this amazing place and it is a MUST TRY if you live here or just visiting. Everything from the cookies to lemon squares to turkey sandwiches to the BEST grilled cheese on the planet are astounding. I bring all my friends and family here bc I absolutely love the people who work here as well as the food!!!!
