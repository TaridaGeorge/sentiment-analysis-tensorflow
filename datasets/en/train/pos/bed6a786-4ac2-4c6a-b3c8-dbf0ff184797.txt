We stayed at this resort for 4 days/3 nights to celebrate a friend's 50th birthday and I can't say enough about the service. Everyone was really friendly, willing to escort you wherever you wanted to go and the service (in the restaurants and poolside) was phenomenal. We stayed in a casita; the room was clean and the bathroom luxurious with a jacuzzi tub. The grounds were very well-maintained and had interesting artwork around the resort. If you get a chance, walk through the cactus garden; they must have over 50 varieties on display. We will definitely go back to this resort some day.
