It's been almost a year since I've visited Cherry Blossom and today I found myself close to it during lunch time. I sat at the counter and had some of the best sushi rolls and ramen anyone could ever ask for. My water was refilled every time it got close to empty, and when I asked for a box and check it was brought out promptly. I am sad it's such a far drive from home, the prices and quality of food are phenomenal.
