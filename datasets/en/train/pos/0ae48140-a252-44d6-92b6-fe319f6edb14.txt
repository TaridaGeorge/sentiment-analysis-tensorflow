In one brief visit, I found out everything I ever needed to know:

Samples galore, everything was delicious.
I went for cupcakes, and left with a red velvet cupcake and coconut cupcake, very fun looking and equally delicious, as well as blueberry banana bread. Not only will I be stalking tammie coe for this bread, I'm going to try to make a sub par copy at home, and I don't bake. It was amazing. 
I didn't find the prices to be ridiculous either. 2 cupcakes & a slice of bread were around $10.
My waistline is not shrinking, and for this place, I don't care!
