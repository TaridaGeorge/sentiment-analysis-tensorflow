Best sushi in the Phoenix area!  I originally heard about this place from a sushi chef at another restaurant.  I asked him where he went when he wanted sushi, and he said to Hiro!  The best thing about Hiro Sushi is that the average customer has a sophisticated palate, so they can offer all the exotic stuff nobody else has.  If it is your first time, sit at the far left of the sushi bar (that is where the owner, Hiro-san does his work).  Tell him you are "at his mercy" and see what he gives you!
