This is one of the VERY FEW downtown hot spots that are classy, helpful, kind, patient and fun places to be. This is such a great restaurant because they give you gourmet dishes and high class style for moderate prices. The staff is so amazing and I love it! Casual or not, business meeting or friends this is a wonderful environment to be in.
