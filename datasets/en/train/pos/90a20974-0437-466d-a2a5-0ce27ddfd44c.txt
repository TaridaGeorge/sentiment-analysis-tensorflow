Best steak experience ever!!!! This is definitely a splurge type place if you are lucky to be in a town that actually has one. Service got a little shaky towards the end of our meal but it was terribly busy, being that it was Saturday night on Valentine's day weekend. Five stars does this place the justice it deserves for both the ambiance and top notch food quality! Would do it all over again if I had the chance!
