What a great place that I can't believe we have driven past a hundred times and never visited. Great food ( I had the meatloaf ) and one of the best waitresses I've had the pleasure to meet. We were there 10/14 in the evening and really enjoyed ourselves. Menu is simple but has something for everyone. Indoor/ outdoor dining. Fun place.
