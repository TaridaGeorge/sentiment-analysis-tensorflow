Been here twice so far... awesome place.  First time, they were out of a few things, but we improvised and it was great.  Next time, I had the nutty avacado - - awesome.  Large plate of fresh greens, sprouts w/ some seasoning - and two fresh green crisp collards to wrap it in w/ the nut sauce and avacado - - yummm...  Many people do salads, but 99.9% of them are no where near fresh, pink ends, brown ends, no taste...  I love this place.  Plus all the herbs and teas, and GF, DF desserts... heaven.
