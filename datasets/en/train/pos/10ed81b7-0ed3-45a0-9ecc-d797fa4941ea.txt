A lovely drive up and a fantastic city view from the top of the mountain.  Great hiking trails.  The visitors center is excellent and even offers a super-easy 1/4 mile "hike" over flat ground to some real petroglyphs carved into the mountain rock a long long long time ago.  Great place to go exploring, to get away, and to bring out-of-towners!
