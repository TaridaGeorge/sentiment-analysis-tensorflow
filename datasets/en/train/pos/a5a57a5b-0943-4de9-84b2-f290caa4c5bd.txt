I was hanging out with my mom, and decided that it was time to get some waxing done, as I've seen this place before.  It's right next to the Safeway, and I finally had a chance to stop in and check the place out.

Upon entering, I was warmly greeted by a lady named Tracy.  She told me that she would be with me in just a few minutes.  

This salon is normal in a lot of different ways...They do nails, pedi's, mani's, waxing and a few other things as well.  I was really happy to see that her prices were fair, and shes got a very clean looking shop.

I plan on going here again, most likely for a Pedicure and a few other services, as she seems to have done quite a nice job.  Good hours, great location, and they speak good english too!  LOL.
