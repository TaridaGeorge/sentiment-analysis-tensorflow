Jose Roux was excellent. I was amazingly surprised! I was stuck in PHX airport for a few hours and wanted a bite to eat somewhere, where I could sit down with my hyper 2 year old. This was a great option, they had high chairs and comfortable seats for me, so I was happy! The food was good, not the best Mexican food I've ever had (I'm from Texas) but it definitely curbed the hunger for a few hours until I got home. It's a nice little area and definitely your best option when you're in that side of the airport. Definitely try it if you're there. Surprised at all the negative or low starred reviews.
