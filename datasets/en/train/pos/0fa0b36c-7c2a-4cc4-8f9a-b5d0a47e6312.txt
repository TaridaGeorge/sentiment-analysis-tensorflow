WE LOVE AS YOU WISH and have been going to this location for approximately ten years.

We were there today for 2 1/2 hours, and walked out feeling totally relaxed.  The staff is helpful, and they have hundreds of pottery pieces to choose from.  The paint selection is extensive, as well as items needed to finish your piece.

The best part . . . the memories created with family and friends!
