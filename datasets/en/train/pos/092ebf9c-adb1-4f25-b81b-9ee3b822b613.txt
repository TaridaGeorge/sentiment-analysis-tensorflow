Ok, so I've been back a few times now and all I can say is love, love, love this place! I can't think of a better way to start off the weekend especially when the weather's nice out.  The food is made fresh to order, good size portions and decently priced.  You can choose anything from made to order omelets, crepes, mixed BBQ plate with choices from shredded pork and cabbage to lamb shank, and wood fired pizza.  Top that off with mimosas on the patio...amazing!
