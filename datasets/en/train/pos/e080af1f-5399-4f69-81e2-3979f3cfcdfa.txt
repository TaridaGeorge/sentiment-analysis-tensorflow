Went here for takeout chicken today. Was VERY happy with the freshly fried chicken. I watched them take it out of the fryer and put it into my box. Even though I live a ways away it was still too hot to eat when I got home. Excellent seasoning, this is some of the best fried chicken I have ever had from a restaurant. AS other people have mentioned it is a tiny place so don't come here with a big group and expect to eat in but it's awesome for takeout.  It's a bit of a drive for me but I will definitely be back because it's worth it!
