awesome dinner here for my friends birthday!!  the bartender kris was great and showed off his mixing skills and flaming shots (delish) our server gibb was a blast, super fun and knew a ton about the menu so he didn't steer us wrong in what we ordered.  love the mac n cheese, chop salad, scallops and the short ribs...just the right amount of food for 3 of us to share.  can't wait to come back and we'll be sure to spread the word :)
