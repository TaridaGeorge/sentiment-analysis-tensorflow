My cousin said I needed to try this local place..boy was it good.  The spinach in my omelet was so fresh.  My brother and biscuits and gravy and it was very good..diff than Bob Evans sausauge gravy..tasted really fresh and like there was sage in it.  The home fries were not too greasy just perfect. Portions are so big we got to eat breakfast again later!  This place is really really small go early and if there is a wait make sure you sign your name outside the front door and take a seat and take in downtown Gilbert.
