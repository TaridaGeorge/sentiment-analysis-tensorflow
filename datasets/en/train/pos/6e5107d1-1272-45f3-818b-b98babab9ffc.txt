I own a carpet cleaning company and when I am busy or can't accommodate a customer I am always happy to refer them to Todd at Dunway Cleaning Service. Todd has his son work with him, his father, sometimes his brother. So you get were I am going with this, It is family owned/operated and on the occasion he has close friends work with him. Todd is heavily involved in his business. He has a truck mount steam cleaning system and does a great job. How do I know, cause he taught me. Keep up the Good Work Todd and Dunway!!!
