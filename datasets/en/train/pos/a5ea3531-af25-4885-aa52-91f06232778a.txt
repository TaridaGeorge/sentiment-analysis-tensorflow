I love Urban Kidz! It's fun and bright with cute clothes for girls and boys at reasonable prices!  I have two grandsons that are age 2 and 6 and it's so hard to find cute clothes for them!  Really!  All the clothes at Target look the same, and I'm definitely not going to spend $100 on a pair of jeans for a 2 yr old.  Urban Kidz is great!  Cute clothes, at reasonable prices.    They also have cute baby stuff too!!  (Note:  No more babies for me!)
