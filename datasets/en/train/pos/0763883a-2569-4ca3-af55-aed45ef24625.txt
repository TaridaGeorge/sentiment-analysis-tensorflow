OMG!!! that's what comes to mind when you taste the food here! Fresh, fast service, atmosphere is great, even the bathroom are cool!

I had the B-B-Q chicken pizza, which was to die for! Nice crispy crust, lots of chicken, w/green onions and of course B-B-Q sauce. The hubby had their bacon w/ blue cheese burger, which was equally as good. After walking the grounds for 1/2 hr to get our meal down, we ordered a chocolate shake.. yummy!!! This place is a real treat!
