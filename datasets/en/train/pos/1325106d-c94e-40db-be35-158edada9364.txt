When the weather is nice there is absolutely no better place for lunch!  The food trucks are one of the reasons my husband and I wanted to move downtown, and having them all in once place is nice! So many options, and everything is good, you really cant go wrong!
I recommend a luncha-rita from luncha libre, really great iced tea flavors!
