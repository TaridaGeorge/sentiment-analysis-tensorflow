Went here for a sunday brunch and the place was packed. After we were sat I heard the host say over an hour wait as they kept coming which was promising. I ordered the KKs for $13 and my wife had the Lo-Los for $11. We upgraded to white meat on the chicken for an additional $2 each but it worth every penny. I think this is the best fried chicken I've ever eaten, with excellent flavor down to the bone. The grits were tasty and the waffles had a hint of cinnamon. Definitely a good mixture as they compliment each other. The sweet iced-t was the kind I had when I was a kid while visiting the south, so good. Will definitely be going back.
