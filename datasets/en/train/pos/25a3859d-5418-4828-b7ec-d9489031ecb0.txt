All I have to say to Elliot my dog is "you want to go to Born to Run today?" and her tail wags and she heads for the car.  The people at Born to Run are what make this place a gem.  They are so friendly and make Elliot feel right at home as she enters the front door.  When she leaves at the end of the day, she waits for her treat and exits.  

Thanks to everyone at Born to Run for making my dog's day and wearing her out so she sleeps like a champ when she returns home :-)
