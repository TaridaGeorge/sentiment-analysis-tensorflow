I moved here 2 years ago from Philadelphia, where threading studios abound. When I got here I was nervous I wouldn't find anyone to keep up with my bushy brows. I tried another threading studio for a year-the woman was straight from India, so I just figured she knew her stuff. As time went by, I realized my brows were getting thinner and thinner...and scarier! That is when I left and found Bronze Boutique/BeautifEye Studios. Tori is great. She really listens to what you're looking for AND she delivers. My eye brows look great, I am almost back to normal.

If you've never been threaded, try it once. You'll be hooked!
