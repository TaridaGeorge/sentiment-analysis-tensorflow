This place was a huge surprise and a huge relief!

Being a foodie, and quite the fan of healthy food, this place definitely lives up to those expectations.  If you've ever been to San Francisco, then you'll definitely get that feel when you enter the cafe.

It's got a great atmosphere, and the menu is by far the best when it comes to serving healthy "organic" foods.  I know that many places in the valley claim to serve healthy food, but serving "all-natural" and locally farmed foods doesn't necessarily mean it's healthy.  People that are true foodie's know exactly what I mean.

I ordered the Dragon Bowl with quinoa and it was delicious.  I'm excited to try this place again.
