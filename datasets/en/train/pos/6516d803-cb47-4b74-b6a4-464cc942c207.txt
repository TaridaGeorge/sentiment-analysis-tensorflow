Our US Air flight home from Cancun was delayed which eventually resulted in an over night stay at the Marriot Hotel in Pheonix, AZ. I got on yelp to find some dinner. My requirements were: vegan friendly, open late and organic options. I hit the nail on the head with my choice. I highly advise La Bocca to anyone looking for a good meal. Possibly the best part about our dinner was our waiter Chris. He was very polite, extremely accommodating to my vegan diet and just an all around good server. I would come back to La Bocca again and again.
