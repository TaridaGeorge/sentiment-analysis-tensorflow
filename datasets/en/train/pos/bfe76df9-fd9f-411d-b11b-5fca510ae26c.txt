Jose Roux is your BEST food option if you're around the southwest gates. Between Jose Roux & Barfly, there is no need to eat crappy food at the Phoenix airport. Not only is Jose Roux's food fresh & good, it's incredibly well priced for airport food. I got the veggie taco plate  ($6 for 2 tacos, rice, & beans) and was so surprised and pleased with how good it was. The tortillas were delicious and are the thick corn style. The tacos had a nice layer of cheese, fresh veggies, and good salsa.
