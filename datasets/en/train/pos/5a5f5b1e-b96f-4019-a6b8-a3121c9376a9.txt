Great little hardware store with excellent service!

Unlike the big orange box stores, I have never failed to receive a friendly greeting when walking into this store and you can't walk through the store without being offered assistance, generally multiple times.

They will make sure you find exactly the parts you need and they'll help you as much or as little you need to find those parts. Plus, like the old-fashioned hardware stores I loved as a kid, they still sell lots of fun stuff such as hobbyist gear and some home and garden decorations!

Don't let the fact that it's at 19th Avenue and Indian School scare you off, this is a great place to take care of all your home improvement needs!
