I could almost walk to Fashion Square but prefer my dependable Fiesta! 
I enjoy that this place is never a hassle. Parking is easy, unlike Scottsdale or Chandler where half the battle is even finding A spot, let alone a close one. Since I am a curvy girl, I am fortunate to find Torrid, Lane Bryant and Macy's all in one spot. The Macy's there has a good selection of cute clothes in 14 and up and the staff is always helpful. The shoe selection is minimal at this Macy's but the mall has other stores with cute affordable selections.
Mesa does not have much to offer in the shopping world but this mall has always done me well!
