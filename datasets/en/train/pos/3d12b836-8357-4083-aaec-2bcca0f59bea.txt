I have been going to San Tan for over a year now and have always been happy with the service, food, and beer. This visit was no exception. In fact, the wait staff was so helpful and responsive. When we arrived they moved tables to accommodate our group of 35. Shawna and Martisse remembered our names throughout the evening even though all 30 plus of us moved from table to table. I cannot think of one instance where an order was messed up!

I will continue to go and recommend this establishment to everyone!
