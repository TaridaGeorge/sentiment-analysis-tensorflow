Woohoo!  This is definitely as good as it gets for farmers' market around here.  McClendon dominates with a large corner space, and the long lines to prove it.  Maya farm also has a good presence.  But there were also two other small growers this morning, one of which has really good looking heirloom tomatoes.  

The chocolate bread fromt he Phoenician hit my sweet spot straight on.  I also really liked the tomale stand with vegan option. Next time I'll try to check out the bbq man. 

Now this is something worth getting up early on a Saturday for.
