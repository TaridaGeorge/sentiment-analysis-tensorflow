Great Mediterranean! 

I've been going to Pita Jungle for as long as I can remember, and I cannot get enough of the place. You must have the Hummus here. It's second to none.  Make sure you order a second pita.  All the food is great.

The staff is a young artsy crowd if you get my drift. You kind of have the feeling that you're eating at a place in the Village in New York. Infact, the atmosphere is feels pretty artsy, too. That's actually pretty odd considering this location is in a run down shopping center just off of ASU's campus.
