Wood fired Pizzas & Pitchers of Craft Beer.

I recently had dinner at the Parlor with a big group of friends before going out to a concert at the Rhythm Room. The Parlor doesn't take reservations, but we were quickly seated at a six top directly across from the wood fired oven. The atmosphere was hip but casual. As a big group, it was easy to share everything from the pizzas to the pitchers of beer. The  favorites were the pitchers of Four Peaks Hop Knot,  and the sweet corn pizza. All the pizzas were a knockout, but it's the sweet corn pizza that keeps me awake at night. 

I'll absolutely go back to the Parlor.  Cheers.
