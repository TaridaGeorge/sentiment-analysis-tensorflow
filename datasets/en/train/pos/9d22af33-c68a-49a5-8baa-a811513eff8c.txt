Can I live here please? I've loved FLW since I was in like 5th grade or something and went on a school field trip and thought that wherever we were (some FLW building in Phoenix, I rack my brain trying to remember) was the coolest thing I'd ever seen.  

I've been to Taliesin West quite a few times, kinda want to go again.  I think I want to live there.
