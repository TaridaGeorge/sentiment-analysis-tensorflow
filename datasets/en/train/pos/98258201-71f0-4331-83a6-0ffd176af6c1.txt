After looking at my other reviews and seeing how they were only complaints, I figured I should add something about what's become my favorite restaurant in the valley.  Frasher's has the best filet I've ever had.  In the two times I've dined here, both times both my wife and I did the split plate on a large (which basically means you just get two of the smaller filets) and not once have we gotten a steak that wasn't absolutely delicious and cooked exactly medium-rare like we asked.  The place is a tad bit pricey, and I can't really speak towards anything else they have there (the toasted ravioli is decent, though the rest of the appetizer platter was boring), their mashed potatoes are delicious if you like garlic (which I do).
