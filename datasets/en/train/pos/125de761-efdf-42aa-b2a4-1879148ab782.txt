I am giving this place 5 stars not for the ambience, or outstanding food.. but for the price, service, menu selection, staff and overall. 

Mercers is a great place for a great selection of good food at great prices.  
Pork chops and cabbage
Rubens
Really good breakfasts
Good Coffee
Seafood 
and all your favorites. 

I have gone to eat there had a really good meal.. paid for a couple of people's meal at the same time without them knowing and still come out with change of $30
