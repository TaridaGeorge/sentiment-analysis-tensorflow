Went here for St. Patty's day and loved it! Absolutely beautiful outside, reminds me of Barcelona or Seville. The food is New American Cuisine! It was delicious. I ordered a house salad that was very fresh with chick peas, croutons, and a nice balsamic dressing. I had a veggie burger for my entree that did not fall apart like at some places. The veggie burger was very good as were my fries. They have wonderful desserts too. I was too stuffed to eat the dessert but did have a taste of what my friends ordered which  was some type of  cake with carmel. The service was excellent too. They were busy that night and they did a wonderful job at making me feel welcome. The decor inside is very fun too.
