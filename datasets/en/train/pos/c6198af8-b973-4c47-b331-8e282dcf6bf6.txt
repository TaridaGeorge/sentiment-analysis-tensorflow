A special place, as L and I had our first date here. We had a Middle Eastern Flight since I never had wine before from Turkey. L knew nothing about wine except riesling and 3 years later. She is a connoisseur. I like that it is hidden. I know they have signs directing people to the front door., The fun is knowing about a place that no one else knows about.
