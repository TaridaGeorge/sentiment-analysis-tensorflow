I had to give an update to my favorite bar.  It is now 5 stars!  Why you ask?  Well, I spent the better part of Sunday, my last day of a long vacation, here and it couldn't have been more enjoyable.  

A day drink was suggested and the Vig was the place to be apparently.  The place was packed inside and out.  Not a seat to be had outside.  There was a cool band playing cover songs.  The specials on Sunday are pretty sweet as well.  $3 Peronis, Margs, and half off bottles of wine.  Which if you don't finish your wine, they give you a nice little brown baggie to take it home in.  Ahhhh, the VIG.
