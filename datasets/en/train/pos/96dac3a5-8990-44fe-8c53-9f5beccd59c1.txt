I came to Chapman Mazda and met a very friendly staff.  I was presently surprised.  they were informative.  We met a sales representative  Lauren, she was informative and listened to our concerns, awesome. She was in training but you would not have known it.
Christiaan, wa so helpful.  We bought our new Mazda and could not have been more happy with the service.  I must say buying a car there was fun and our kids were included and had a great experience.
