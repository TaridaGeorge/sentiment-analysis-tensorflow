Finally, after months of wanting to try this place we stopped today for breakfast and I must say it was fantastic. They have a big menu, so I had a hard time choosing. While I really wanted to try the French toast or waffles, I also didn't want all the sugar and carbs ...so I opted for the veggie omlet, which came with harsh browns and a side of pancakes. I upgraded to blueberry pancakes. I felt the portions were huge, but appropriate for the price. Mine was excellent! Dave had the apple cinnamon baked pancake...which I had to try...and it was really good. Also, our service was excellent...I was in desperate need of coffee and she kept my cup filled. I will definitely be back to try some other specialty items.
