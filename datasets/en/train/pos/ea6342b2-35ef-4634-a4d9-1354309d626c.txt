Always a treat. Family owned and it's been the same people for as long as I can remember. Their food is tasty and is perfect for a quick bite or for watching any sporting event at the house. The pizza and wings special is delicious. Best way to order their pizza/wings is 'well-done'. Great sandwiches too. I've witnessed them cleaning every inch of the kitchen area on multiple occasions, even as far behind major appliances as they can go on a nightly basis.
