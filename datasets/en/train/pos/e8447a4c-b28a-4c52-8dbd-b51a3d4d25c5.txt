Shoe department only:
If you are going to women's shoes, go see Clint.
You won't be sad.
Clint knows:
How to fit big feet (ahem, my friend Kari)
How to find other shoes you might like and just brings them!
How to find shoes he doesn't have in stock
How different brands FIT and makes recos based on that
He actually recommends the shoes that he knows you'll love for a long time...which might be cheaper.  

Basically, Clint is the Best Shoe Guy Ever.  I've been to a LOT of Nordstrom shoe departments and Clint takes the cake.  I wish he was around at my local Nordstrom.
