I am going to have to disagree with the review below. I was here over the weekend and I thought the food and the service was excellent. 

  The waitress was very attentive to our needs. The manager/owner was very hospitable and checked in to make sure that everything was ok. I ordered a mixed meat platter that was ridiculously good.  I will definitely be back.
