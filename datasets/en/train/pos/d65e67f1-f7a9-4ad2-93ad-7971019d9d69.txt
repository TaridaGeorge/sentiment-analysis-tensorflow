We just left Big Daddy's BBQ and it was delicious - the best we ever had.  Price was great - atmosphere casual and they have a full bar for mixed drinks separate from the family eating area.  I had the baby back ribs and my husband had the brisket and bb ribs and we are very satisfied and will be going to them again.  Service was quick.  I hope they stay open for years to come.
