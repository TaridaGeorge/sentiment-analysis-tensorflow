Great place right in the middle of town.  All types of wood for any purpose.  This place has wood for smoking meat, wood for the fire pit, wood for camping, and wood for the fireplace.  I bought an outdoor fireplace and was tired of the crap they sell at QT and the like.  Found Berry Bros online, drove in, loaded the truck myself, done.  I will never buy wood anywhere else.
