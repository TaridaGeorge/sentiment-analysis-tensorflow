Ahh Pita Jungle, I wish you were closer. But if you were closer, I'd probably have no money...

Pita jungle is super, super yummy. The hummuses (humi?) are creamy and full-flavored. If you order the pita/hummus plate you can order 2 hummuses- try them all! Oh and try adding chicken on top of the hummus, it's ahmaaazing!

Their salads are also outrageously tasty and made with high quality ingredients.

The iced chai was bomb too! 

Definitely one of my food highlights while visiting ASU.

Good for:
Dates
Internship meetings
Sending parents when you need to clear the beer cans from you place
Chillin with friends!


The only things to watch out for is: If it's busy, it will be kinda loud (acoustics or something) and you get squished pretty close the the people at the table next to you. Still soo worth it.
