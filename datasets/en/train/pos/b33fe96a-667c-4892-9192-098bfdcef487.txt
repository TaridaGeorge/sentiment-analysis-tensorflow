My wife went was referred to Fitness Road about a month ago and finally went yesterday and purchased a pair of Vibram Fivefinger shoes. She was extremely impressed with the level of service she received. She wore the shoes around most of the day getting used to them and is excited to try them out on a hike this weekend! I'm sure I'll be in their shortly to get a pair myself!
