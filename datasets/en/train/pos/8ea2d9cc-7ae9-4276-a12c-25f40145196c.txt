My favorite place to grab a sandwich and wrap. You can't go wrong with either a sandwich one. .Hard to name a favorite item, since I've enjoyed them all.  

Items I enjoy most are the Humdinger (pastrami), Yahoo (roast beef) Dilly Club, Southwestern club and the Mexi, Caesar and Southwest Wraps

Sandwiches and wraps are $6.99 and served with a pickle and one side-(chips, cookie)

I really enjoy the Poore Bros chips served here, especially the bbq ranch flavor. The cookies are also pretty good.

This location is less crowded then the Dilly's location closer to the ASU campus.
