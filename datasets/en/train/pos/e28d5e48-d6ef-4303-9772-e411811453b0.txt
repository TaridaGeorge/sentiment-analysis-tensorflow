Herbs and Spices OH MY!!!

Every Spice, Herb, baking ingredient you can imagine is here and the quality is just superb! I will never waste my money at any other place on spices or herbs...because unless they are Penzey's they are a waste of money!

I personally love there Cumin, their extracts, Vanilla and Almond, and their many Cinnamon Choices, are the most amazing quality and are worth every penny. 

I look forward to every visit to the store so I can try a new item each time I go. I keep a list in my spice cabinet to make sure I never run out and so I never have to rush off to the grocery store for a spice while cooking...God forbid I run out of my Penzey's Spices!!
