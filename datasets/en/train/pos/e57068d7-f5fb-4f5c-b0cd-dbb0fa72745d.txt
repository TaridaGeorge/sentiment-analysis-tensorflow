Culinary bliss.  It's been a couple of years since I was last there so time might have embellished my experience to epic levels.  I've done a lot of steakhouses in the Valley (Ruth's, Donovan's, Durrant's, Flemings, etc...) but the Filet I had at Mastro's was in a completely different league.  It was like all of those other restaurants were toiling away in the minors compared to the major league taste that I experienced at Mastro's.  The steak literally melted in my mouth....literally!

The price is up there it is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for the true red-blooded soul who wants to experience what steak should taste like.
