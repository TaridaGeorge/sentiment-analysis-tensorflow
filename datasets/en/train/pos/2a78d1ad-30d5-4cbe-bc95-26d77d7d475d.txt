I wish this was closer to where I live.  I'd be there all the time.  I love that it's small and everything I've ordered has been great.  I love that it has it's own sensibility and it's not fancy it's just solid good food.  Maybe it's better that it's not closer otherwise I'd gain 50lbs QUICK. They have a decent beer selection. Finally a place that doesn't have patrons who are more concerned with what labels they're wearing who don't get that IKEA decorated restaurants are not COOL.
