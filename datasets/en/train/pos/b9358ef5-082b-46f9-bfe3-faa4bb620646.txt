Ocean Club, along with all the other restaurants in the Mastro's group, is as good as it gets.  While pricey, the service, decor, food and selection are all top notch.  I have eaten at all of the Mastro's restaurants several times and you just can't go wrong with any of their food.  However, I seem to always go towards the filet along with any of their delicious side dishes.  This time I tried the crab gnocchi and it was great.
