You guys at Mamma Mia rock! I stopped in the other day for the special and it was yummy! My how I missed your location since moving. I will definitely remember to call the next time we want pizza and not at the closer location. Their pizza was chewy...not at all like yours!

806 E Indian School Road is the best! And thanks for telling me that you can still deliver to our new place. FIVE STARS!
