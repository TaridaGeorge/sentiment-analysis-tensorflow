I have been going to Los Dos for the last 20-some years and I have only ever ordered one thing on the menu - the number 6 combination Machaca Burro. This is New Mexico cuisine and it is hot and tasty. A lot of people are turned off by the heat - so if you don't like hot, stay away.

NOTE: Their salsa is hands-down the best salsa I have ever experienced in a restaurant.

Any time I'm asked for a recommendation to a Mexican restaurant, this is the place I recommend. I have never had any customer service issues and the food has always been consistent in flavor. Now - keep in mind, I've only had one thing off their menu. Why, you might ask? Because when you have something that good , you can't imagine risking anything else. 

Los Dos Molinos - Go get some.
