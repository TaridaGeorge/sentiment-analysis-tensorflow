I had hoped to be able to eat here but we pulled up just as they were closing. I'm from New England and I love the foodie culture of Vermont, so I was looking forward to a reminder of home! They really scored big points though for bringing over a home made dog biscuit for my puppy while we were sitting outside eating at the restaurant next door. I hope to be able to get back to that area to support them in the future. Thanks for taking care of my pup!! :)
