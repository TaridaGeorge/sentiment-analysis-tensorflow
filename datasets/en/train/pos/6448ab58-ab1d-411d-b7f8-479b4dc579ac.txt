This is the very best facial experience!  The wonderful, elegant spa environment gives the sense it was built for each individual client.  Amanda (the owner) is committed to quality from the products to every step of service and experience.  I've paid for 5-star facials in every part of the country, and none compare to the facials at One Love Spa.  I recommend this spa to friends and family, and even clients.  My family now buys me gift certificates at One Love Spa!  I also recommend the treatment product lines available with Amanda  for all skin types.  And Amanda makes you feel like a star every time!  She also gives back to the community with various mentor programs, education and women's needs in our community.
