I've bought a few pieces here for myself and as gifts for family members.  I've gotten compliments from people about the jewelry I wear, and it's all thanks to Chief Dodge.  The turquoise is genuine, and so are there other stones, which is hard to find now-a-days among the foreign objects a lot of Old-Town Scottsdale carries. The service is also pretty friendly and patient and they don't pressure you into anything. If you're looking to buy authentic Native American jewelry, I'd say you won't be disappointed with this place.
