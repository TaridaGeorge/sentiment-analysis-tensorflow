God, how I love giant liquor stores like this, that allow me to make a six pack, buy a couple bottles of good chardonnay, and be set for the weekend.

Really, that's all you need to know about Total Wine. That, and getting out of the little mall/city of stores is a pain with all the traffic, but it's worth it.
