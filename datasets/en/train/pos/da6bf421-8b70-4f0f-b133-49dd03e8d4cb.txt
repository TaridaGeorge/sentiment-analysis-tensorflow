Incredible place to shop, even if you are not an outdoors man (girl).  Bass Pro shops have great customer service. I bought two sandals in AZ during a weekend trip.  Well, one of them turned out to be pretty uncomfortable. So I checked their website about returns and you can mail your item back to the store with a note and copy of receipt. They refunded the amount today. And left me a voicemail that they received the package. That is great service.
