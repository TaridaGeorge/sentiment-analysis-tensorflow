Unlike others, I don't take off a star for service unless it affects the quality of my food. People in the food industry are always in bad moods and I give them wiggle room.

Did anyone else know these guys deliver? Delivery charge is $1 if your order is under $15 bucks and free over that. They have a 5 mile delivery radius. 

Ordered two times here now - Pastrami delivered, NY Steak in store. Both were very good. 

The Pastrami gave me no surprises. The steak was not strips of steak but rather thinly shaved steak if you're wondering. 

The Pastrami took 25 minutes from call to doorstep delivery. It was still hot. 

Good quality subs, prices seem fair. Their bread tastes a little more "artisan" than Subway.
