What a great surprise. This little inconspicuous hole in the wall could be transported directly out of Tokyo. Polished concrete floors, single white bar, simple 2 seater tables and blue neon light to illuminate the white bar chairs. 
The menu not quite the Japanese fare one might be used to. No sushi, but great little creations like duck and wontons. The best part about this place must be the bar. A incredible Sake selection and infused vodka buffet. 
If you are into Sake or truly flavoured mixed drinks, the bar will be your heaven. I am glad I was recommended this place and actually stumbled into it. What a great find!
