We stopped into the Chandler location for dinner on a Monday evening and it was nice and quiet. I'm told on the weekends, there is a waiting list. We ordered a large pie and it was indeed pretty delicious.

The hostess was very friendly, staff was wonderful, and Frank was a great character! A true East Coaster. The decor was great! Definitely feels like you've left Arizona when you set foot inside.

If you're from back east or would like an experience without travelling far, Grimaldi's Pizzeria is definitely somewhere to try.
