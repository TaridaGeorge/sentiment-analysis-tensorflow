I have tried many yogurt places: pinkberry, yogurtland, yogurtini, yogurtology. Yogurtini has the best tasting flavors. I seriously tried like 10 of them today, just to re-affirm this fact. They have a very tasty no sugar added flavor, and a vegan flavor. The ones that include gluten are labeled. The calories are listed right there on the wall. They have ample condiments, and a rewards program. It's nice and clean. Gets pretty crowded, like all the other places. But the taste and texture of their yogurt is head and shoulders above the rest. The only other comparable place I have tried is yogurtology.
