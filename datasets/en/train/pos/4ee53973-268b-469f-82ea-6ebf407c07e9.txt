So I did a lot of reading about Bikram Yoga before attending my first class and it helped me select a studio that I felt comfortable with.  BYT is a wonderful studio.  Everyone is friendly and welcoming, especially for your first class.  They go out of their way to get to know you and you can tell they genuinely care. 

I received so much help before, during and after class that I can't say enough about this studio.  Everyone is happy to be there.  I love that they have racks out front to sanitize your mat when you leave and the bathroom and showers are stocked with any toiletry you could need.

If you're considering Bikram yoga you owe it to yourself to try them out.
