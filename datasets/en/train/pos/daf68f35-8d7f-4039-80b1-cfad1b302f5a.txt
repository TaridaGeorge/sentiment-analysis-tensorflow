I love TJs!  They have so many great products at fair prices (not Wal-Mart cheap, but fair and much better quality foods).  Nearly everything in the store is organic or, at least, a better choice than the usual junk you find at Safeway or Fry's.  Although I suppose it's possible, you'd have to look long and hard to find high fructose corn syrup or transfats here.  What you will find is a ton of great dry goods (TJs is my trail-mix supplier), a reliable house brand, a limited variety of affordable organic produce, great frozen goods with real ingredients rather than chemicals, tons of great snacks, protein powder, vitamins and supplements, great teas (I love their Earl Grey!), and their famous affordable wines.  

You'll spend more here than you would at Wal-Mart but way less than you would at Whole Foods and you'll feel a lot better.
