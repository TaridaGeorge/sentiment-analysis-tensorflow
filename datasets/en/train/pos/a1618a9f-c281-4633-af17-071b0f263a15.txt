If you like too drink but don't want a big bar tab this is the place to be. My boyfriend and I love to drink heavily when we go out and I was amazed at the bar tab when we left. I believe we drank about $75 worth of liquor and paid $30. The band on Fridays was good blues band and well worth the entertainment. 

We went back on Sunday to try there breakfast...I was amazed at the food you get for such a low price. A breakfast for two $13 including coffee and OJ. Our waitress Angie was delightful and very nice. I am a picky eater and cookie cutter places like Ihop and Denny's don't impress me with there over priced stale foods and horrible service. 

This place gets 2 thumbs up from me!
