I love this shopping area... or is it called a mall? I am new to AZ and I am not sure what they call their outdoor shopping areas. But anyway... this place is fantastic for walking around to enjoy the weather, finding great restaurants and SHOPPING (or window shopping). They have upscale stores here that are great to look around in and well as some small boutiques. It is across from Scottsdale Quater (more shopping) which is great. You can spend the entire day just walking around the 2 places. This is one of my go-to places to just enjoy the beautiful weather that Arizona has to offer.
