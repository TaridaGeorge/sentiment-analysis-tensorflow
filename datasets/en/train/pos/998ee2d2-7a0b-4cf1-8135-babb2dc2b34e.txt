I moved here last December and so far this is my favorite pizza spot.  I had the thin crust (whole wheat) chicken pesto pizza and it was amazing!!  I love pesto.  And there have been a couple occasions where my friends and I have gone just for the pazooki's!! I have tried many of the warm cookie w/ ice cream desserts in the past but nothing else compares to Oregano's Pazooki!!
One time my pizza came messed up and the staff was amazing about making up for it.
Warning if you are in a hurry save Oregano's for another time because there pizzas do take a long time but are well worth it.
