I learned about Pollo Sabroso on a New Times food blog and am soooo glad they reviewed it.  I rarely pass by the 16th St. and Jefferson intersection so I doubt I would have accidentally found this restaurant; but I will now make a point of heading that way just so I can eat at Pollo Sabroso again and again and again.

The chicken is perfection.  Marinated throughout and so tender.  The beans and rice are the best I've had.  The beans aren't re-fried and they are cooked just right.  The rice is flavorful and has a wonderful texture.  

I can't wait to go back for some more...and next time I'm getting the plantains on the side.
