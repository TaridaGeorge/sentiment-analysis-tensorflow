OZ has been having 2 for 1 drink specials until 8 pm everyday in December! YAY!

The Saturday before Christmas. My family is in San Francisco at 'The Dickens Festival' inside Cow Palace, without me. I was distraught being separate from them this holiday.

Low and behold! 

I walked into Oz and we had our own Dicken's Fest. I was so happy. My man even beat everyone in pool and won a $10 gift card to the bar :)

Men in speedos and scarves dancing on mini stages, $1 jello shots, free pizza if you show your c*ck...

Dicken's Fest!

Happy Holidays Yelpers!
