OH MY GOD THIS PLACE IS GORGEOUS!  

What is wrong with AZ that no one has yelped this place?  I LOVE it here.  I spent every morning as the sun was rising running on amazing slate rock and dirt trails, surrounded by cacti and rolling hills.  I could run here every day!  

Take Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd east to Via Linda.  Head east on Via Linda to 124th.  Head North east on 124th to the Lost Dog Wash Trail head to park.  If you follow Lost Dog Wash trail you end up at the Taliesin overlook with a view of all of Phoenix and Frank Lloyd Wright's house.
