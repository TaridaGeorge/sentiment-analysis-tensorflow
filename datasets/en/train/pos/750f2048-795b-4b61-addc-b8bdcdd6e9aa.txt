My dad was in assisted living for a temporary stay and I needed a rail installed in the shower quickly.  Stan and I set the entire thing up by texting (which I loved).  He came out the next day and was puntual, professional and efficient.  He charges a reasonable rate as well... would definately call him (or text) again.
