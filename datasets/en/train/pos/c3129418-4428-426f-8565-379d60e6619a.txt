No pressure, honest, laid back, personable salespeople!  I drove in from CA to buy a used TSX and they did as much as possible beforehand to make the transaction smooth and quick.  They also let me privately sell my old car on their premises (and even encouraged doing so) because they couldn't give me much on the trade.
