Love love this place!!! It's a cute little place connected to a super market. It's clean and busy!! Great customer service! Everyone is super friendly and attentive! The portions of the pho are huge but it is so delicious ! The broth is so so yummy ! We also get the egg rolls that are so good too! Who knew shrimp and sausage would taste good together!?!
