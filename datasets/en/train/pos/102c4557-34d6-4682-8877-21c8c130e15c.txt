Was looking for something for lunch today and went to Groupon now where I saw this place. I hesitated for a few minutes, as it's a few miles from my office, but went for it. 
SO GLAD.
I ordered the Reuben made with pastrami and it was AWESOME! Made with organic sauerkraut, dressing and swiss. Sandwiches come with a side so I ordered the mac and cheese, which costs a dollar extra. The mac and cheese was good, but I'd probably skip on it next time.
They say all their meat is organic, free range and antibiotic/hormone free, which I love to find! I will definitely go back!
