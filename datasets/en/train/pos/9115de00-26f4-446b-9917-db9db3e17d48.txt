From the instant we walked into this amazingly beautiful restaurant I was impressed by the ambience and friendliness of the staff. Our waiter, Patrick, helped make our superb meal even more enjoyable since he has an absolutely charming personality.

As a New Yorker, I often compare out of state restaurants to those in NYC - Cask 63 could hold its own anywhere in "The City;" and I wish it would since it's a long way to Arizona!

Bravo to the new owners!
