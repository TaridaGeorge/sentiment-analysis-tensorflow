ok one guy wrote he was upset sodas are 2.00 out of the machine guess what they are at the mall also.. Anyways love this place. yeah it does not have every store but look on the directory see if its a place you want to look at.  I drove an hour to go check it out and well worth it had alot of sales going on.  Coach did not have anything on the directory about having sales when i got there most of there stuff was on sale 40 to 50% off plus another 30% off.  with the stuff i bought at that one store total was over $600.00 with the sale i paid $213.00 well worth the trip right there. Other stores had sales going on also and had alot of stuff to pick from
