Best little gem ever! Within walking distance of my apartment, I easily go here once a week. If you check in on Frousquare it's 20% off your yogurt. Get a punch card. Tuesday is double punch day and Thursday is BOGO free.

I've never seen Frosted Animal Cookie froyo before but it was amazing! Very small shop but it makes up for it in toppings. The topping bar is laid out differently than what I'm used to so go all the way to the end for your chucnks of candy bars and what not.

My fav froyo in Tempe.
