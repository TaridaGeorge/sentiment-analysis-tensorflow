Dana, there is no other like Dana!  Even my kids ask to go visit her!   I have 4 children, 2 boys ages 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 and 2 girls ages 8 and 19 months.  Dana has been cutting their hair for quite some time. They all have a style of their own and have always been happy every time we leave. She has a great shop in Downtown Scottsdale, convenient and is very accomodating.  Highly recommended by this Mom and her children!!
