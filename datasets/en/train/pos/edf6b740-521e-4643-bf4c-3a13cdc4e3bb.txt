I stopped in for a quick iced peppermint mocha and was very impressed all around. The staff was extremely friendly and excited to chat about the business. This place is not your typical coffee shop. They have tons of space to meet up and relax. They are also an art gallery with some beautiful pieces to look at. Culture is a good way to describe this business because they are really bringing a unique culture and vibe to the downtown Phoenix area. I always excited to discover places like this and support them with my business. I encourage everyone to check this place out and keep it alive!!
