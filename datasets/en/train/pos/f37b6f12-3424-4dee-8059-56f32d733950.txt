I had treatment @ Novocur a year ago this August for lower back pain.  Prior to the treatment I constantly had to wear pain patches or take something for the pain on a daily basis.  I had three treatments and as of  today (almost a year later, I am pain free).  I would not hesitate recommending Novocur to anyone with pain issues.  Not only was it a positive experience, the treatment was pain free.  I was not put under any sedation and was able to walk out with no assistance.  If you are afraid of needles, I would recommend you giving them a call.
