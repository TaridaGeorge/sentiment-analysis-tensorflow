Been here 3 times in 1 month. Love their pho. The food serving/ price is real good considering their "small" bowls of soup are huge! Food is always fresh and doesn't take long to prepare but have been there with maybe 3 other tables of people around. One night a friend & I didn't realize that they were closing soon but one of the employees stayed late. I had the Beef ball pho and the spicy beef vermicelli from here and this mango tea slush dessert (don't remember the name) and love it. I recommend to others!
