Just had Pizza People last night and it was beyond my expectations.  It's not just a good food truck, it's some of the best pizza I've had in Phoenix (and I'm a pizza snob).  I can't wait to have it again!   Everything about it was perfect...especially the crust and sauce! Good job guys and keep up the good work.
