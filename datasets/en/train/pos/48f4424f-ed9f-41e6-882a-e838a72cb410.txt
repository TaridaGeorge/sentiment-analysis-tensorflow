This place is the best in town! I get whatever soup they have when I come here, and it never disappoints. They give meaning to what true hospitality looks like. The staff is friendly and personable from the bartender to the bus boys; they treat you like family. This is a hard trait to maintain when one runs such a high quality restaurant, but they manage to have such a great balance without it feeling stuffy. I would recommend this place for large parties, catering, or for a great happy hour. I promise you won't be disappointed.
