first off, i love that my sister goes on vacation to arizona all the time, and she always brings back a random assortment of cookies. i also love that these can be ordered online and shipped. not that i dont want my sister to vacation. i just like that there are easier way to get the cookies to my house.

i think my favorites are the pink cloud (with the almond extract), the banana chocolate chip, and the chocolate star paradise.

and i love the website, i like seeing pictures of fresh cookies from a birds eye view.
