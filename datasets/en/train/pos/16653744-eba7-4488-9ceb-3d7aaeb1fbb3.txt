I will give this place 5 stars because it has a variety of food but healthy.  The burgers are excellent and you can "build your own".  I love the Cobb salad.  The staff is always attentive and accommodating.  The restaurant even allowed my dog on the patio this summer during and outdoor luncheon with my friends.  I wish we had more places like this where costs minimal compared to quality.  WE HAVE NEVER HAD A MEAL WE DIDN'T LIKE.  (bison and Kobe beef on the menu)
