This place is an absolute oasis in a sea of corporate breakfast spots in my neighborhood! The service is great, the food is fantastic and the prices can't be beat! 

Today I had the corned beef hash, two eggs over easy, bacon and toast....it was perfect in every way! Filled me up for around $8 (including the 5 cups of coffee I must've drank)!

Debating on going back again tomorrow.....
