Great ambiance - small, quaint, cozy feel. Great for couples. Fabulous crab dishes - loved the crab dip app and the open faced crab cake sandwich was amazing. And save room for dessert - best creme brulee in Phoenix and the bread pudding was great too. And incredibly yummy sangria! All around great experience - food, service & ambiance all get an A+.
