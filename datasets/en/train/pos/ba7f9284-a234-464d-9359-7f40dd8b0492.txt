We were able to get a last minute rervation for four at 7:00... had to move it to 7:15, and half the party didn't show until 7:30 - no problem.  They were very accomodating.  The service was also very friendly and attentive.  

The menu is very creative, and presentation was beautiful.  I had the "what's in this" steak - basically sirloin strips wrapped in mashed potatoes, covered in parmesean cheese and baked - outstanding!  Others had halibut and scallops, nobody was complaining.  

Very comfortable and delicious food - I would go back.
