I completely disagree with the price range... the lunch special was perfectly portioned and only cost $7.

I had the red curry with chicken, thai hot. It was the perfect level of spice and flavor. The homemade ice cream with fried banana is the perfect afternoon treat.

Everyone in our group had a great experience and enjoyed what they ordered.
