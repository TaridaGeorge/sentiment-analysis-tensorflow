Best cheap meal in town...or is it cheapest best meal? Whichever it was delicious for the whole $4.35 it cost me- and that was including a large pepsi. I have a fondness for pork & cilantro anyway but the pickled veggies and the bite of jalapeno made it even better. I don't mind the cash only policy as it does keep prices down. I'll be back!
