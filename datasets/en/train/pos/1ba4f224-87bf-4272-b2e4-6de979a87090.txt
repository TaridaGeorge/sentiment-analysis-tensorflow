This is my absolute favorite Thai place in the Phoenix area; I just cannot get enough of Thai Elephant. The red curry is like heaven in a bowl! It has affordable prices and great selections. I like that you can have a quick meal if you are in a hurry and not shell out a ton a of money. Lunch there is amazing, as it includes soup and a spring roll. In Tempe and surrounding areas, this is the only way to eat Thai!
