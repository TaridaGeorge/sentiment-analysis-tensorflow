Sat at the bar and had absolutely wonderful service. Boy does that make such a difference. Friendly and knowledgable without being intrusive. 

 We did happy hour. I had a flight of their house beers. Really liked their Hefeweizen; crisp and tasty. 

We had the wings buffalo style M with blue cheese sub for ranch. My wife didn't like them saying they were soggy. I thought they were ok but rather scrawny. They need larger ramekins to dip in too. 

I had the 5 meat deep dish and I was astonished how good it was. Really thick with the meat. 

Again bartenders Edith and Corey were outstanding. If we lived near by I would come back just for their service.
