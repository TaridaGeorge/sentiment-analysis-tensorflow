Oh my goodness, what I wouldn't do for a few of (what I call turds)...their carmel roll candies with walnuts about now. I haven't had any candy (per say) for about a year. I have lost 80lbs... but with what sacrifice? Cerreta Candies! I love them... but I wish they were easier to find in stores. They are not in most stores, you can mostly find Brach's and to me, this is like eating wax, after eating Cerrreta's....
