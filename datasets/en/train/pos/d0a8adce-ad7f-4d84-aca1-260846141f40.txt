When HRC was on Camelback, we frequented the bar for happy hour.  During that time, we befriended the bartenders, who are still there  They create a neighborhood feel to this international chain.  Phoenix HRC is different than the other ones I've been to because of this.  When they moved downtown we continued to frequent the bar.  Number 1 reason to drive downtown for happy hour - the bartenders Javier and Eddie.  They have incredible memories and pick up the conversation you ended with the last time you were there, and that could have been 8 months ago.  They are quick with the drinks and with their wit. 

The food is ok and over-priced, but that comes with the HRC name.  We have found the entire staff to be friendly and accommodating.  A neighborhood HRC bar...hmmmm.  Sure feels like it.
