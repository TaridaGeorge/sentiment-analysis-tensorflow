Stunning, gorgeous, heavenly!  I have a new-found like for the desert...if it's going to be at a place like this.

Impeccable, friendly service, extremely accommodating.  Excellently appointed rooms.  There was a giant tub in my room that I didn't even jump in (why???).  There were nice smells everywhere.

I was here for a wedding and had an amazing view of the mountain behind the hotel....very pretty at both dusk and dawn.

This place is both peaceful and cozy.  The beds were super comfy.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a relaxing and care-free getaway....you won't have to do a damn thing but get there.
