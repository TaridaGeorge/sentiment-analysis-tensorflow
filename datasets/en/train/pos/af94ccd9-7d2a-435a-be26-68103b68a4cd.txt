I love this place!

I got the $5.99 Gyro Special (Gyro, fries and a drink) and my husband got the $15 Grill Mix (Salad, soup, two kabobs and a sausage). The food was delicious and fairly priced, and the service was great! The chef and server were a father-and-son team, and I appreciate family businesses. 

We'll definitely come back! My husband wants to try a hookah pipe next time.
