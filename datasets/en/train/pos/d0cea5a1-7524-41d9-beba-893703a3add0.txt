I've only tried their chicago style pizza.  IT IS GOOD!  I am not FROM Chicago but I have been there and had chicago style pizza from several popular restaurants there.  Nothing is ever exactly the same as the city it originated from, but this is dang good pizza!  I recommend the meat lovers toppings. The cheese they use is top quality and the sauce tastes homemade.  I am trying to get a pic of the pizza to put on but we always forget and start eating before taking it!
