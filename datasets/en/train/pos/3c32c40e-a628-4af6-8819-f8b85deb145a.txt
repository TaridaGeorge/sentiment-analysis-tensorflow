Zinburger proved to be everything it's cracked up to be and then some!  No wonder it wins awards for Best Burgers! The meat was flavorful & cooked to perfection and the brioche bun was amazing.  The wait-staff was very attentive and helpful.  The overall experience was 5-star.  I had the Samburger and my wife had the Zinburger and both were outstanding although we agreed the Zinburger was slightly tastier with its braised onions.

We got there at 11:30 AM to beat the lunch crowd but the place was already packed, so pick your spots.  If you think it might be too far to go for a burger or that $10 is too expensive, think again...it's worth the drive and the money.
