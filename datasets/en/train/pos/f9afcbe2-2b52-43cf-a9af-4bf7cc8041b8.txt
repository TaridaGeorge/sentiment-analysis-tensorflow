I love Coach.
Stylish and trendy without spending an obscene amount of money on a bag. Sure they are still a bit more pricey than a purse at Target, but you are paying for name. The sales associates are really nice and won't hesitate talking to you. I only have a few things from Coach because usually I can't justify spending to much money to accessories, but anything you buy here you can use forever. A coach bag will probably never go out of style.
