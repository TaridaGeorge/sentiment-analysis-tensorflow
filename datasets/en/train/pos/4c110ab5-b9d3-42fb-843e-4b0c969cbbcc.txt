My running group and I love Luci's after a long run. This morning I ordered the KRABBY PANTS OMELETTE which was delicious but holy hell full of oil and calories. I didn't eat the potatoes that came with it. I did eat the little ramekin of fresh fruit that came with it. This meal was like 750 calories. I'm glad I ate it earlier in the day, I have the rest of the day to burn some of that off.
