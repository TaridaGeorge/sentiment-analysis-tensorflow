Not much I can add to all the reviews already written so I'll keep this short.  

We were looking to have lunch after going to the science museum with the kids and my handy dandy yelp app lead us here.   Loved the space! No pizza at lunch, just paninis with the same ingredients as on the pizzas. They don't have a kids menu but my kids are fine ordering from adult menus with some adaptations, of course, and our requests were honored with no problems. We all loved our sandwiches!

We are big fans of crepes so of course we had to have dessert.  The kids got the crepe with the vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce which they devoured. My husband and I got the crepe with nutella & mascarpone --- absolute perfection!  Do yourself a favor and get a crepe, you won't regret it!!
