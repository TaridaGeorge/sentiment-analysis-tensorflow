We've just started working with Sorin. Our pool maintenance person was not performing a good job and we had on-going problems. We had two different pool companies come and evaluate the pool. Finally, I called Sorin and in the course of a Saturday morning, he solved all of our on-going issues. 
Needless to say, we have hired him as our full-time pool guy...
