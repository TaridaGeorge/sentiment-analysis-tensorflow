I lived in Coronado for several years and my family and I frequented this place a lot. The owners know my dad pretty well, and they are always super friendly to my brother and I. They have a pretty decent wine selection now, since the neighborhood began to show interest in it. They carry all the norms as far as snacks go, but then they have their selection of foods you might need but don't want to go all the way to the grocery store to get. They also have hot pickles that I crave on a regular basis. 

I don't live in the neighborhood anymore so I don't come here as often, but for the locals it's a must. Or even if you're in the area.....
