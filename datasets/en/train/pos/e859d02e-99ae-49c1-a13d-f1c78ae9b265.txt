THIS IS NOT YOUR AVERAGE PIZZA. 

If you have never had a Spinatos Pizza you need to try this place. You will be very impressed. 

Great Service! 

Great Food! 

Great Desserts! 

We have been coming here for a while now and cannot get enough of this place, They have a great tasting pie. We usually get a Hawaiian and once you put the first piece in your mouth you cant stop eating it. I highly recommend this place for your next stop. They have 4 locations and all family owned and operated. I have ate a lot of pizza over my time and this the best hands down. 

Also try their desserts they were created by the owners wife and are a great compliment to the end of a great meal. 

Once you eat at Spinato's you become like family. MMM GOOD!
