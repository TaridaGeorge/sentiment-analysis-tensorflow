Went to Flemings to try the Happy Hour. We have always enjoyed the food and our experience when we go to the restaurant. The bar was completely filled and the "overflow" outside was too hot to sit in. We were on the waitlist and after 10 min or so, the hostess offerred to seat us in the dining room. Our server was Steph and she was wonderful! She made suggestions to try unique appetizers and hit a home run! The sweet chili calamari and Beef Carpaccio were fabulous. We shared a hamburger and it was really good. We had the house cabernet and it was great. So in the end our bill was minimal ($6.00 each item) and we still had a fabulous experience at Flemings!
Will definately go back and ask for Steph as our server!
