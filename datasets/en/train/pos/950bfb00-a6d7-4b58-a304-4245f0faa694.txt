Love Streets of New York.  It's one of my favorite pizza places in the Valley.  I had an awesome first date here on 2/1, which led to four more dates with Aubrey.

'And Aubrey was her name.  A not so very ordinary girl or name.'  Like the Bread song, I met Aubrey two weeks before Valentine's Day.  Ironically, our conversation online was mediocre.  Like an idiot, I told her, 'I don't think we'd be a good match.'  Talking more, I suggested a date going to a Haiti fundraiser dinner at Streets of New York.  My attitude was nothing to lose, probably an average date and great pizza.  Our date well exceeded expectations.  We clicked on everything and stayed over two hours.

I'll always associate this location of Streets of New York with this date.
