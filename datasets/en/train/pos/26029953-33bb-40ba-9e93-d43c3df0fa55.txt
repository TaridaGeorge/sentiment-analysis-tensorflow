Little shout out to Lori and the floral department staff. 

I needed some special order flowers that were in season but not a common item any store carried. I called and spoke to Lori and she told me that she could get them in for me.

The day I picked them  up a very nice girl in the floral dept. helped me out. The flowers were amazing! I will for sure be going back here for floral needs!
