I usually like to try new places but I crave the Champon soup at this place. Yes, I've tried the other dishes but I always order the same thing. it's fantastic on a cold night or any night for that matter.  It is too big to finish and is packed with seafood, noodles, and a savory broth. Try it if you like seafood. The calamari (fried) and the steamed clams are also delicious.
