By far my favorite restaurant at an airport. And I've been to plenty of airports (and plenty of airport restaurants). This place is worth the bumpy ride to Phoenix in the dead of summer (114 degrees, anyone?) ;). The customer service here is top notch, and the cookies are SO delicious! I recommend the chocolate chip and/or the snickerdoodle. They often have deals on the cookies where you can BOGO. I also highly recommend their broccoli cheddar soup. It's so yummy! Thanks, Paradise :)!
