Why does everyone hate chains? They are chains because their food is tasty and their menu works. I'm sorry if it's not owned by vagrant bohemians. I'm one of the masses!

My friend, who shall remain nameless for obvious reasons, works here and she makes fun of me for wanting to eat there. She makes fun of me for thinking it tastes good. 

Everything I've ever had there is very good. Avacodo eggrolls make me smile.
