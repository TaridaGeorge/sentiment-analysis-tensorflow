I am honestly quite baffled by a few reviews on here!  I have been going to Switch for a while now and I go regularly.  I love their unique soups and the fact that they now carry gluten free buns for your enjoyment (and I am sick of eating "lettuce wraps" at other places because I have to eat gluten free)  There is an additional charge for the gf bun but it is very, very good!

Love the hummus plate and they always sub cukes for me (gf)........yum!  The weekends are dangerous with the HUGE carafes for $3!  OMG........get a DD already!  Their brunch items are excellent and the quiche is made with a potato crust so, again, I can eat it!  Thank you Switch!  I bring friends here all the time and they always make us happy.
