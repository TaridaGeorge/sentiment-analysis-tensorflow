Absolutely the best pancakes ever!!!  A rare gem indeed for the struggling Ahwatukee area.  Quality of their ingredients seems to be their greatest strength.  The Applewood smoked bacon was cooked to perfection.  Not greasy and I savored every bite.  Nice open feel to the dining area, with an adjoining take-out counter and outdoor dining for when our weather cools down.  The service was friendly and attentive.  My new fav breakfast spot in AZ...
