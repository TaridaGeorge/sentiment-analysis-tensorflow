The pizza is great, menu says Chicago style.  They use plenty of cheese and the crust is perfectly thick and fluffy.  The italian sausage is chunky and flavorful.  The chicken wings are also great, they use Frank's Red Hot sauce.  Lunch is a great deal with two slices and a drink for $5, they also offer salads for lunch, although I've never partaken.  The only drawback is is the cramped strip mall feel of the restaurant.  However, I love eating their pizza, when I'm not on a health kick.
