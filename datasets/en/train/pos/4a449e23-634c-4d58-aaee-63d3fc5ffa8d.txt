I LOVE Events by First Rose and have been a satisifed customer for over 15 years. I have done 3 weddings with them and lots of other special occassions. 

My daughter just got married and Andrea did the flowers. My daughter cried when she saw her beautiful bouquet. Everything was better than I hoped for. When I sat down with Andrea I asked her for her recommendations because she is the expert. 

I'm sorry if others had bad experiences but I never have. Trust their judgement and you will get quality work, beautiful flowers and a good rate. I wouldn't go anywhere else.
