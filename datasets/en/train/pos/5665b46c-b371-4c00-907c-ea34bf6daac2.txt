The most friendly service, beautiful waitresses, and the food was amazing. We were in n out in less then 30 min! Prompt to service. Food was made fast and tasted delicious. I got the hawk-eye egg white omelet and it was very filling! My buddy's got the skillet and they couldn't even finish it! Everything amazing and tasty. WILL come back when i am back in Arizona.
