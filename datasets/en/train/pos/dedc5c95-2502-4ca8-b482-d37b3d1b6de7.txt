I went back and tried a suggestion that I was told do...

Apparently, if you are in a rush and not planning on to stay any longer then 5min the valet guys will allow you to park at the curb. I quickly went in, grabbed my ice coffee and left with no hassle. I was with my friend (Manny G.) and he thought the coffee trip to Royal was prettttty cool..idk why but he liked it. +1!

I am pretty sure its not something the valet guys will allow if its happening on a busy day or rush, so if you time it right the Royal coffee shop could just pull it off to be a "quasi-drive thru cafe" ya?  maybe..nevertheless its a sit down coffee place, and it will and should stay that way...
