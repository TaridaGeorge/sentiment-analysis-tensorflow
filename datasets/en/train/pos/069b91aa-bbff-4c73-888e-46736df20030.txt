I can't believe I haven't tried a Pita Jungle sooner and I can't wait to go back!

The atmosphere was fantastic. Sprinkled with local art on the wall, the place was bright and welcoming. The restaurant was clean, neatly laid out, and fresh.

The food was AMAZING! Is there another word for amazing? Because that doesn't do it justice. Unbelievable, hit the spot, fresh, super, fantastic. I ordered the honey glazed chicken pizza and will never think of another pizza the same way.

The value was great. For $22, we had an excellent meal with great service in a wonderful location.

GO TO PITA JUNGLE! You won't regret it.
