Damn! This stadium is straight up legit! The stadium is beautiful and you have so much lawn space to spread out and enjoy the game!

They have an insane amount of options for food and drink so you're bound to find something you like. And after you enjoy a couple margs or beers at the game, you can hop on over to Old Town to continue the fun!
