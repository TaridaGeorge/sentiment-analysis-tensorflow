This place was fantastic. Great yogurt & topping selections. Affordable prices. Helpful staff. Modern and clean decor. This was my first self serve yogurt experience and I will be back. One thing I especially liked is that by each yogurt flavor they have the amount of calories and fat listed by it.  I will be back when I'm on that side of town!
