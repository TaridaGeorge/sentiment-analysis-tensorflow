This is an "old school" style Chinese restaurant.

I've only been here for lunch, but the food is GREAT!  There is always a generous lunch special, but anything you order will be delicious.  I started going here in 1990, and the food is as good today as it was back then.

The service is efficient and fast.  The flavors are fresh, and the food is fresh.  This is one of the most consistent restaurants out there.  

They have the real freshly made tempura shrimp that almost no one serves anymore.
