This is what Sprouts wishes it was. They have better products, IMO. Their prices are on par with Sprouts. A big difference is Sunflower employs fit, good looking people. This may sound weird, but I'm the type of guy who won't visit a fat doctor. Doesn't sit well with me. Sprouts and Sunflower bill themselves as a "health food store". I expect to see slender, pretty people staffed at a health food store, not the old fat people they have at Sprouts.
