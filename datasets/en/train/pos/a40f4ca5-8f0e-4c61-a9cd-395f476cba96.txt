This place is my NEW FAVORITE place to dine in Phoenix. The food is delicious and guilt-free. The staff at Seasons 52 guarantee that every meal is under 500 Calories... I'm sold!

The whole menu changes four times per year... with the seasons... ;) and there is a side menu that changes every week.... hence the "52." 

I had scallops with asparagus. They were perfectly cooked and I knew I could eat the whole meal without reservation because it was within my daily caloric intake :) But then again we had to get an appetizer (their cheese breads are like flat pizzas) and dessert!

This is now THE place I recommend to out of town guests and to the boyfriend for date night.
