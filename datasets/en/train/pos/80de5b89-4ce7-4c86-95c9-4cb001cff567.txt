I first experienced Rita's Water Ice during my travels to Philly and I was so excited to learn that they are here in the valley. I love their tropical flavors and during this hot summer it is a very refreshing treat. Their custard is head and shoulders the best that I have ever had. The kids that work behind the counter are always friendly and professional. 
Glad that they are not closer because I would be there everyday  instead of once or twice a week that I am there now..
