Postino is the go to favorite for the Arcadia crowd. If you have good friends bring them and enjoy the ambiance. On a beautiful sunny day the doors of the old post office are open ,creating a breezy inviting atmosphere. 
Begin your meal with the plate; an assortment of goodies all piled onto a cheese board. Next enjoy the brie and prosciutto sandwich with fig spread. Pair it with a $5 glass of Prosecco or a big bold Cab and you have yourself a relaxing and enjoyable day with buddies. You can't beat it! 
After lunch you can even walk next door to LGO and shop for goodies! Gifts, Children's books, Candles, deserts by Tammie Coe, and wine!
