I LOVE Pure Salon! It's so great being able to get salon services without all the chemicals and harsh products.  I had come here for a Vegan/Organic pedicure before and was completely happy with my service so decided to come back and check it out for my hair.  I had a cut and color by Tara and she did an awesome job!  Loved everything about the service, Tara is great and my new favorite hair dresser!  I will definitely be returning when those nasty grays appear again. :-)
