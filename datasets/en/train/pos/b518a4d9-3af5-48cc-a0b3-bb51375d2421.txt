I decided to visit, persuaded by all the yelp reviews. This was my first time attending this facility.

I was immediately confronted to see if I needed help sitting or with a menu. 

To make a long story short, all the positive Yelp reviews are spot on.

I had the Spicy Veggie Asiago and I nearly creamed myself with joy.  

I am a picky m*ther fu*ker when it comes to my food, but I was very pleased in every aspect.
