My review is qualified in that I only had the sliders at the lunch kiosk (in Fashion Square Mall) - and did not have a true sit down meal here.  But, those sliders were SUBLIME!  They were perfect little burgers.  Service at the kiosk was also amazing, and the bathrooms are easily some of the nicest I've seen (and let's face it, this totally factors into the rating a restaurant gets)!  The staff were also universally beautiful (as in Playboy Playmate hot).  I would not hesitate to go here again, as I would not hesitate to recommend it!  Next time I am in Scottsdale, I will go there again for sure.
