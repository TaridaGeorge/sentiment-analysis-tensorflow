Chaka Chaka I love you!!!  I love hearing about fellow comics having some ambition and following a dream other than...comedy.  Charles started this place not too long ago and except for the porn place next door, it's great!  I think the neighborhood made for some good people-watching, too.
Had the jerk chicken sandwich and the garlic fries.  I devoured both.  Well, I went with 3 other women in comedy and we all devoured our lunches.
The server was super-friendly and prompt.  Even told him our orders and none of them got mixed up.
There are only a few options on the menu, but I think it really works for Chaka Chaka.
I mean, with a name like that, how can you go wrong???
Oh, and get the brownie.  GET THE BROWNIE.
