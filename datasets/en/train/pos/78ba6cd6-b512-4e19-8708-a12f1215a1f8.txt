Cindy did an amazing job on my nails. I told her how sensitive my nails are and she was gentle. The pedicure stations are the cleanest I have ever experienced with an added plastic liner in the tubs. The spa was clean, the music was soothing, and the staff didn't speak in their native language to each other (which drives me crazy). I would recommend this spa!
