Excellent food across the menu, which changes seasonally.  Excellent service, too.  We eat there a lot because of the flavorful food choices, the attentive service and the dog friendly patio!  

The new steak tacos and the new fish tacos are amazing.  You get 3 tacos per plate so you definitely get your money's worth.  We've been to BLD a dozen or more times and consider it our favorite east valley eatery.
