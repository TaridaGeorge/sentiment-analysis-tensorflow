Cool restaurant with a great happy hour.

Tried the windsor burger which was cooked well on a delicious bun and a pitcher of beer ($5 during happy hour, ya you heard it right, $5 freaking dollars). Awesome place to hang out and grab a drink. Wish it wasnt valet parking bc i dont like others driving my baby
