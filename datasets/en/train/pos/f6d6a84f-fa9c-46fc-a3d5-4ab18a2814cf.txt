Love this place! The hubby and I are fans of businesses that stress local and/or organic fare. We have been very happy with the service and food quality every time we've visited. On our last visit, I inquired about the cordalitos on the espresso bar menu and we were given a complimentary order to try. If you order tea, you get an entire tea service complete with your own little teapot. A great place to try, and saves you from standing in line at The Farmhouse next door.
