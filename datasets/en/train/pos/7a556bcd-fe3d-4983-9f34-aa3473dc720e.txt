After a ASU home game win.. My very happy bf ordered up a Chicago style pizza from Spinatos.. THIS pizza rocks the valley.. enuf said.. perfect crust texture.. and just the right amount of toppings.. & every week since then.. I beg him to order it when Im over... The small is enough for he and I.. Get your sauce for the side... and yum!
