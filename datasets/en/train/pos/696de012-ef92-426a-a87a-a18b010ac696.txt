I have never made a purchase at this particular store, but have had alterations and pressing done. Wow, these people are so nice and so kind. Their easy going atmosphere is so relaxing and they love to just chat and talk about the little things in life. I do feel special in this store. I am there about once a week for pressing of my pants which they do complimentary if they are a product of their empire!!! Love that about them! Just a great store, great location, and great employees!
