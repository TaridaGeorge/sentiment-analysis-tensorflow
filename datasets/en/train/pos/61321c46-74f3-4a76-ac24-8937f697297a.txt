OMG!!!!  I was told about this place by a friend and I had to try it!  I went with a friend of mine and we got the chorizo egg and potato sandwich and the jerk chicken sandwich!  I was in heaven for those few minutes that I was eating it!  We also had the garlic fries and how could you not love those! Everything was made to order so when we got it...it was hot and fresh...this place is not for those on a diet...but it is so worth the calories and splurge!  The price is so excellent!  You would definitely say this is urban dining at its finest!  I love this place...it is not in the best area but that is ok!  I am willing to make the drive for this deliciousness!!!!!!!!!!!
