Health nut or not go check it out . There's not another place in all the kingdom that's better....well this local kingdom, anyway!
It's got a lot to offer and is very clean, safe and well run with professional staff readily willing to offer a hand or lend an ear if needed.
Even though there is a lot to do on the inside, the outdoors is also very welcoming. Check their loaded schedule and they'll fit you in. Overall it's a great value, don't miss out!
