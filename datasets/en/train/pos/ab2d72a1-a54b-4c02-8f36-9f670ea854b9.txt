I love Wong's Place. I always have. How I never wrote a review about it before, I have no idea! I've been going here for around 10 years and have never been disappointed. Despite living in South Phoenix, I still make a point to come to Tempe from time to time just to visit Wong's Place. It's well worth the drive.

As to what to eat here, well... everything! My personal favorites are the Wong Jo and House Special chicken dishes, but I've had nearly everything on the menu and loved all of it.

Also, like Nader said, get the blue menu!
