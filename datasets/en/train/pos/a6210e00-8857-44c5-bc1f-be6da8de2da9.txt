As I said in my "quick tip" this place is AMAZING!!! Dell, Vanessa, and the quiet guy in the back were so nice, friendly and accommodating. We arrived minutes before closing and the treated us as if it were 2:00 in the afternoon. I have never had BBQ that tasted so DELICIOUS!! How about Texas BBQ House - San Francisco...then I won't have to travel so far.
