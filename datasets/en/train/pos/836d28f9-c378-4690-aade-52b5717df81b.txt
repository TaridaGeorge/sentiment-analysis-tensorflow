We used to frequent Ticoz often but, for no real reason, it had fallen off of our radar.  When we saw the Groupon we thought it would be a good time to go back.

The food was fantastic and the service was perfect.  We started off with the Trio appetizer and it was hard to decide which of the dips we liked the best.  I had the Mac and Cheese, my husband had the Sweet Corn Tamales.  Both excellent and the portions were so generous, I actually took half of my meal home.  Our waiter checked in often but was not  overbearing and he made of point of keeping or drink glasses full.

Great food and service.  We will definitely be back.
