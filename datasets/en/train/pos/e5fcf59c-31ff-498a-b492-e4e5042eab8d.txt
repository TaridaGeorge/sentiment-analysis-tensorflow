BEST GELATO EVER.  

SEA SALT CARAMEL + CHOCOLATE and you're talking a possible rival to Urban Cookies.  I don't say things like this lightly.  

Have you ever tasted cold?? O' come on!  It's comments like that that will keep baskin robbins / cold stone  on the "this is the shiz-nit!" list but keep places as awesome as Paciugo on the "my tastebuds are too retarded to enjoy something good, so I won't go here" list.  The mob cries for it's bland crappy ice cream and flocks to places like Dariy Queen to get it's fix.  What a shame (though I can appreciate the business aspect) that the Walmart's of ice cream get top billing while the Apple's of ice cream get the wiener in the bum. (insert gay joke here)

Damn I loved this place.
