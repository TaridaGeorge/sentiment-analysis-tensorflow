Just came here for a sendoff brunch with the parents, and I am sad that Switch will no longer be in my city.  Their brunch menu is short, but has a good variety.  I had the crustless quiche, which was a little heavy on the cream sauce, but too good to stop eating.  Their tomato soup was a good addition on a cold day.  I am just sad that it took me this long to come for brunch!
