Grazie has some really delicious pizza, and its Italian wine offerings are top notch for most price ranges.

They also have an incredible dessert called "Dolce Della Casa" which is a semi-salty calzone stuffed with banana and drizzled with a hazelnut chocolate sauce.

Their wine tastings are also really great: for $25 you can get a bunch of great appetizers.  We tasted 8 wines (I had never tasted any of these) during the last one, and I really liked 6 of them.
