I bought the best pair of pants @ New York and Company, but they were made for a Mammoth Supermodel (the were sold of the ones for "normal" women). Anywho, I took these pants in to Brother's because my husband said they were good and THEY ARE AMAZING!!! The pants were done in 15 MINUTES and when I looked at the hem, it was the BEST I'VE EVER SEEN!!! THIS PLACE IS WORTH THE MONEY!$!
