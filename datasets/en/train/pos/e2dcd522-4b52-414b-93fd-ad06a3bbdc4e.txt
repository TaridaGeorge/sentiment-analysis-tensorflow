My brother works right around there and he invited me for lunch there. He told me to get the roast beef sandwich. I usually don't eat red meat but oh my god! This was the best sandwich I have ever had in my life. I'm 38 so I've had a few sandwiches in my time. There is a sauce on the sandwich that has horse radish in it that just makes the sandwich. That along with the bread and everything else on it. I just took my wife there and she felt the same way I did about the place. If you are hungry....do yourself a favor and go to the Urban Picnic and order the ROAST BEEF SANDWICH. You won't be sorry.
