First heard of this restaurant in Houston a few weeks ago.  Absolutely perfect.  Almost too good.  Found out there was one in Phoenix, AZ, where I live.  Tried it, expecting it not to be as good, since the Gulf is well known for its seafood, and Phoenix is not.  We received the exact level of quality in food and service.  Highly recommend this Restaurant
