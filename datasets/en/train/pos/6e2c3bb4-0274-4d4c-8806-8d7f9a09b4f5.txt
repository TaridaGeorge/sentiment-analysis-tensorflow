I have been here perhaps 10 times in the last year and have had varying experiences. The first time I must say was great but several of my experiences thereafter were mediocre. Tonight the food was phenominal! Service was kind of what i expect at any sushi place, friendly but not over the top. I do believe sitting at the sushi bar is the way to go. The chef is awesome and i love the fact he put a couple of kids in their place when they hit the bar for their "sake bombs"! Hands down the best sushi in the area. Love this place!
