Best chinese food in Mesa. My family has brought me here since I was an infant, and I am happy to say nothing has changed, not even the atmosphere! The food is awesome, I suggest the happy platter for 2 for an amazing appeteizer, and get a mai tai while you're at it. The service is perfect, never having to wait long for a refill, and also make sure you try the mustard. It will make the hairs in your nose stand up. I love the dark atmosphere, kind of like a dive bar of chinese restaurants, but never dirty. A great neighborhood chinese restaurant, and my favorite! Think of it as something you may see in the movie Big Trouble in Little China, but with customers.
