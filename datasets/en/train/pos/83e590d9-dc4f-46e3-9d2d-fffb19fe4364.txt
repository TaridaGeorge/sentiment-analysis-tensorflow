We went and have a wonderful dinner.  We liked everything about the restaurant.  Upon arrival, there was a line up, but fortunately I called ahead and we were immediately seated -:) - The appetizer Lobster Spinach Queso was amazing !, The waiter was really patient with us, he brought us a few tasters until we found what we liked, then we ordered our bottle, and the salads great too !..   The steaks... WOW, each one of the 3 of us had it cooked to perfection.  If I was to say anything, upon entry, it was loud...the music a touch too much so... but when we were seated in the pit, the ceiling was so high, the sound was not overwhelming at all. My husband is a pretty picky steak eater.. and he'd definetely go back !  Joyce H.
