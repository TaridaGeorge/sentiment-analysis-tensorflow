This is one of the best "feel good" restaurants in Phoenix.  Great for either a relaxing dinner by yourself, a romantic date night for two, or fun for a group of friends.  The patio with the intimate tables, circular fire pit and trees full of lights is the perfect setting for Timo's great food and wines.  On our visit a couple nights ago, we again had the specialty of Short Ribs Tajine:  boneless braised beef short ribs, fresh ginger, preserved lemon, braised vegetables, oven brown potatoes, served in a Moroccan tajine.  When you order this, everyone else wants to know what you have.  All in all it was a very enjoyable evening, with a special thanks to Sam, Emily and Amy.
