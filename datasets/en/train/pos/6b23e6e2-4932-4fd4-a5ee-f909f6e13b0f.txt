I'm a pizza snob admitting that there is very good "Chicago" style pizza out here in Arizona.  I thought only New York style pizza could be tasty, but this place knows what it's doing.  The price on their lunch specials, seriously? Salad, slice, and a drink for $4.25.  I eat lunch there all the time; you can't beat the quality for the price.  This is one my favorite places for pizza and wings, whether it be lunch or dinner.  Everything taste fresher, and of a higher quality than compared to the chains.  Staff is always friendly and does a good job.
