I've been going to AAB&C since they were at 7th Street and Camelback next to that bar/grill (Hanratty's I think it is).  Alan is by far the nicest guy.  And what a memory!!  I went there many times in the past and stopped collecting for a few years.  When I eventually did come back, Alan was right there with a handshake and saying "Mike, how've you been?"  I couldn't believe he remembered me!!  
But all the people there are awesome.  Like others have said, they leave you alone unless you need something.  Then they're all over the question.  It's perfect!
