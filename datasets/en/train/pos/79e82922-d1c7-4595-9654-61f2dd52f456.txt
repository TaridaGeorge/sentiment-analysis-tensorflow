I have to give credit to Luci's Market for introducing me (and M.R. Designs & Gifts) to this product line. Once I tasted them, I immediately began to stock the Vegetas chips and salsa for my premium gift baskets. Our clients love the products and they look fantastic in the arrangements. My favorite product is the Sweet Potato Corn Tortilla Chips; the chips are sturdy, flavorful and go oh so well with my favorite dip...guacamole.
