I had the brilliant idea of bringing cookies to Thanksgiving dinner at the in-laws this year instead of pie like last year...this was my second time ordering, first time at their new location on 7th Street. I was not disappointed - from their super friendly and efficient service to their clean and nifty shop, I know the cookies are fantastic, even though it's best I stay away from wheat. I'm positive their Pumpkin Pecan cookies will be a bigger hit than last year's pie.
