If you want a coffee house that makes coffee like its their own personal artwork, this is the place.  Great service, great atmosphere and most importantly, great coffee that is made how it is supposed to be made.

on the comments about the .50 credit card charges...obviously these people have no clue how expensive it is to have a credit card machine and how much each transaction costs.  It is hard for mom and pop shops to survive in the world of greed lusting chains.
