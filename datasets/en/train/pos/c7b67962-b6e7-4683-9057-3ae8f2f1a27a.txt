So, where do you go to get great, fresh roasted gourmet coffee beans?  At the grocery store, right?  NOT!!!!  Just stop in this little place and see what you'd be missing.  Seems like mostly wholesale, but they've got an "outlet" they called it.  Lots of fresh roasted coffee and coffee stuff.  
           Don't drink tea much myself, but I recognized the tea label from a few restaurants in town I frequent like Pita Jungle and Sauce.  You tea lovers would love this place!  
           I found this place literally by following my nose.  I must have been down wind when I was at the intersection of Scottsdale and Thunderbird roads.  Went east a bit, next to the airport runway.
