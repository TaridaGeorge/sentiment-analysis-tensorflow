What a fantastic experience! Elements in a store that others should model 
My therapist, Kurt, was extremely knowledgable and thorough with my massage. He knew how to apply the right pressure and even referred to my energy level, which was something I'd never heard from a massage person.
Chocolate on the pillow was a nice touch. The lobby is gorgeous and made me feel relaxed and at home, as did the massage room.
