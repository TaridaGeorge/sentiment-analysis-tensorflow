One of my comfort food venue ... especially when craving for the spicy kick and savory sensation .... 

This is probably my most frequent visit thai restaurant in the valley ... the food qualify is pretty good ... some of the dishes are very authentic (I used to live with a Thai family for years)  like their spicy eggplant, Basil stir fry, clear noodle salad and Tom yum (lemon grass soup) ....    However, not too much into their curry though, a bit of the sweet side for my taste but overall the food qualify is probably among the top 5 I have tried in the valley ....   and the price is very reasonable 

A side note, their spice level is from 1 to 5 .... I think it is of American standard , so 5 is just about what I call spicy ... nothing crazy suicidal
