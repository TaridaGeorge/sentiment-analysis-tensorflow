Love this place- there's a vibe here that's just fun and vibrant.  And I am addicted to their bruschetta and their antipasto plate.  
How good is this place?  Some days, I get physical cravings for their bruschetta and I just have to have some- or when I am having a bad day- you guessed it- having some of their bruschettas makes me feel better.
I've had bruschetta at other restaurants but none compared to the ones from Postino.  I think when they spread that topping on those yummy bread, they are thinking good cheer and loving thoughts- how else can you explain the addictive qualities of toppings placed on top of pieces of bread?
Love this place and I' would go back again and again.
