I'm a big fan. They are super nice there an definitely make you feel welcome!  I got the chicken fried rice and I will tell you, it was the best I've ever had hands down. So good and fresh. If I wasn't so full I would have gotten more. Their edamame was super big and fresh as well and I wasn't sure I could finish it. Of course I did. The whole office loved their food and we will definitely be ordering there again
