Every now and then I obsess over certain things- food, shoes, clothing, songs, etc...  and now I'm totally obsessed with the cheese fries at the NEW Zing's!  I don't usually like real cheese on my fries, but the wonderful lady chef thoughtfully perfected the cheese by melting real cheddar into their awesome mac n cheese sauce.  So it's very flavorful and actually quite dangerously good.  And did I mention they're just $3? Love, love, love!
