Great coffee, the baristas are SO incredibly nice and friendly.  Seriously so nice.  They've usually got a steady line in the mornings (I usually go only in the mornings so can't speak about the other times of day) but they get you through quickly.  Also, after 10 drinks you get one free.  When I went to redeem my latest free drink the baristas were so awesome and acutally cheered and shouted "FREE".

Hooray for Dutch Brothers!!
