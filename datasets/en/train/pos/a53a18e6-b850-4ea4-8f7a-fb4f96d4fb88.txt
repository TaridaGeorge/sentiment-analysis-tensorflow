After my trip from Paris, I was dying for some macarons. Of course, where in the heck could you get them in the middle of Arizona?! Did some googling and found Essence :) It is a small quaint restaurant and with limited opening hours. I decided to stop by for lunch and was very impressed. There were many vegetarian options, soups, salads, sandwiches, and their desserts are to die for. Of course, you can't compare a French macaron to an American one, but this one sure tops the list as yummy and flavorful. The filling is light and the outside doesn't crack easily. My favorite one is the pumpkin flavored one. 
I also had their mozarella grilled cheese sandwich and their berry iced tea.  Very tasty, light, and my whole meal (including dessert) was under $12.00, 

Needless to say, I love this place.
