Ok, I've been to this place probably ten times.  And most of the choices we're so-so... but recently, I was introduced to their orange creamsicle.  It has two levels of deliciousness, and every time I try one it blows my mind.  It's like the top level has flash frozen fresh squeezed orange juice on it, and the bottom level is the perfect blend of creamy orange goodness.  It's without question, hands down, the best popsicle I've ever put in my mouth.  Go try one!!
