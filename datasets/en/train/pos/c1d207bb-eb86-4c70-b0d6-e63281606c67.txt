Have visited a few places from "Diners Drive-In and Dives" recommendation and haven't been thrilled with the outcome.  Not so with this place.  Pizza is outrageously good...super light crust and excellent ingredients.  The bruschetta is also worth a try. The place is really tiny so if you're going on a Friday or Saturday night or during busy lunch hour - be prepared to wait.  Even if you live on the east end of town, this is worth the drive!
