One of the best burger places in the East Valley.  SO many choices of meat to use(grass fed, kobe, bison, etc), buns to put it on, and even more topping choices!  My standard choice is a kobe burger, medium-rare, w/fried egg, bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, pickle, hot peppers, ketchup and mustard....with fries on the side.

This is definitely a "sit down and dig in" kind of place...so don't expect to walk in and order a cheeseburger and walk out.

Nice place, with seating inside and outside...and the place is actually "blue" with blue lighting when you walk in.  Staff is always very welcoming, and service is consistent.

This is probably the most visited burger joint I go to.
