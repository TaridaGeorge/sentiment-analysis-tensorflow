What Andreoli's lacks in pretentiousness, it makes up in excellent food. The reviewer who said "amazing" was spot on. I visit whenever I am in Scottsdale, stopping by for lunch or just a cappuccino and pastry. I also like to pick up a sandwich for my plane ride home; I have worked my way through half of the sandwich menu so far and loved each and every one.

The staff are great. They are friendly and helpful and have great recommendations. And there is always a soccer game on the TV.
