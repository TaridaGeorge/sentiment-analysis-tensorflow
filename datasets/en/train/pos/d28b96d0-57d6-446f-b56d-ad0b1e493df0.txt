I've been going to Flo's for years.  Chinese food can be hit or miss.  We decided to give it a try one day when she had her old resturant across the street from where she is now.  The food was awesome.  It didn't take long before word caught on and she had to open a bigger place.    Her food at this location is excellent (although I've tried some of her resurants and they are not as good) and she is usually there working.  Lunch menu is a great value and so is happy hour.  It is always busy, so go early.  Never had a bad meal or experience.  The only negative, it gets very loud in the dining room.
