Being over on this side of town I was looking at places to eat this caught my eye on yelp. The burger was great, the bacon hot and crunchy and above all the fries were amazing. If I lived on this side of town I would eat there often. The selection sodas is overwhelming because they were so many. I had a cream soda. It was really good.
