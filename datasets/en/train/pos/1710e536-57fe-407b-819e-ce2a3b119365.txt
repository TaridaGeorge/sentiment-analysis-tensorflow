How many people can seriously say they love going to their dentist? I CAN!!! Dr. Brittain and his amazing staff are tops! They are friendly, very well organized (great follow-up and reminder calls!), tell you everything that they are doing, recommend, and don't recommend. For example, when I asked about whitening my teeth for my wedding, they didn't sell me something way over my budget, the recommended something that worked for me. AND they sent me a Thank You card for sending a referral to their practice. Not just a form letter or something, a hand written, thoughtful note! Old school and awesome!
