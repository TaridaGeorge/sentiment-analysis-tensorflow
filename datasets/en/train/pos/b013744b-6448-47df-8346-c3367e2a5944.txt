Love this place b/c it reminds me of the amazing Vietnamese I could get in L.A.  I've been searching for it since I left and I have finally found the noodles, bbq beef, eggroll, cilantro and fish sauce combo I fell in love with the first time I had Vietnamese.  I can't say I've tried anything else on the menu b/c it's so dang good, I can't stray.  Since I was there two years ago, they've thrown a little money into the decor and it's turning out to be a pretty cute joint.  They also started doing fancy green teas, hot and cold and have made some menu additions that look tempting.  It's right next to the movie theatre and I go there any time I'm on that side of town.  I wish I lived closer.
