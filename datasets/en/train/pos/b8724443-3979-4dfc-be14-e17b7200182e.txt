This place is the only place I will go in the valley to get a oil change.  I live 25 minutes away and I don't mind supporting this locally owned lube shop.

The prices are fair and competitive.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  Here is the most important part of this place..... you ready?  drumroll.......  This place is honest.  They will not try to sell you a service you do not need.  They will not charge you a arm and a leg for a part.  You need an air filter?  You are going to get the air filter almost the same price you would pay at Checkers.

Feel free to spark up a conversation with the owner Gene while you wait, he has lots of stories and will make the time go quicker.
