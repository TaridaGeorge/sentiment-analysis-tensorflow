Phoenix's Japanese Friendship Garden is one of the most beautiful places in the city.  Pick a cool weekend and go enjoy youself.  The park is lush and green with a walking path and areas to sit and look out over the pond.

You can buy a cup of koi food in the gift shop, then sit at the water's edge and feed those big guys.  Fish lips ahoy!

Admission is only $3, and free on First Friday evenings.

(For anyone who may have been to the Japanese garden in San Diego's Balboa Park, our Japanese garden kicks it's ass!)
