It's been awhile since my last review and I'm still giving 5 stars! 

I like to come her for lunch and sit at the sushi bar because I'm usually solo plus It's fun to watch all the sushi being made.

I like that Richard (owner/sushi chef) remembered me even though I hadn't been here in awhile. 

My favorite things to order are still the Tempura Shrimp Roll, Tuna, Avocado and Cucumber Roll with Sesame Seeds, Spicy Scallop Roll and on my last visit I ordered a California Roll with Asparagus and it was divine. 

By far the freshest, tastiest and most generously sized sushi I have ever had.
 I highly recommend checking it our for lunch because they also have some pretty affordable lunch combos.
