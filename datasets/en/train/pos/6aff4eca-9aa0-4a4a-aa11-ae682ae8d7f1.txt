What's not to love about Whole foods ? and who doesn't get excited reading the circular ? 

Fresh organic produce ,plenty of Gluten free ,Grass fed beef, fish, Cheeses,great frozen food section. Organic cleansers and detergents,lotions ,soaps  ..They pretty much have it all .
You have questions ...they have answers.

*Helpful hint* - Your fella can pop a squat and have a glass of red or a beer while you shop ( that will keep you both out of the bakery section which is filled with super yummy's)  

This is where i shop and i love it here ,very clean store ,great service ( they can and will do special orders for you ) 

You know the deal ...This whole foods location rocks !
