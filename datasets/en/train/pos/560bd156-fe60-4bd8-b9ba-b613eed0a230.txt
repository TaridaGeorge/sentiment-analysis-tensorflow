HOLY FUCK! I now have THREE favorite Phoenix pizza places! 

With pizza I'm all about the sauce, and this is the shizz! Yeah it's sweet, like really sweet but I freakin' LOVE it! It's soooooooooo good that I don't even want a topping,  just cheese and that fabulous sauce! This maybe my new favorite pizza but it's such a tough call. 

For the record ... the best in Phoenix (for me) ... in no particular order.

Pizza A Metro (pepperoni) 
Spinato's (cheese) 
Cibo (Diavola which is the best topping I've ever had on a pizza)

All three just rock my world, man do I LOVE Spinato's!
