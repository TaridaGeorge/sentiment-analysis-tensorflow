After our second time eating here, I was inspired to write a review. Both times my husband and I have been greeted by friendly hosts, given fast and attentive service, and had delicious food. Our waitress this last time was so friendly, very helpful with the menu, and thorough in checking back, etc. We got the edamame appetizer and it was simply divine. Add all this to the atmosphere, lively music, and overall ambience... and I would say hands down this is the best restaurant in the Tempe Marketplace.
