They do it right and the hype is true.  This is not the spot for the world famous pizza which you hear about (although you can get it here at night).  That's another restaurant owned by the same people.  This restaurant is simple and classic.  It's super fresh and everything is made by hand.  

I spoke with the owner and he has a machine that grinds his own flour and everything.  If you like authentic Italian food this is a must stop.  Everything you order will make you so effing delighted you won't be able to see straight.  If the owner is there talk to him about food.  He will bring you things to try.  He's happy you are happy about his food....and that makes eating a pleasure.
