Wow- what a choice.  We each selected the two meat lunch platter.  Between us we sampled Georgia chopped pork, pork spareribs, and roasted chicken.   The pork spareribs were our favorite.  Five sauces to choose from range from the original to Devil's Spit (hottest) to Georgia Mustard/Vinegar (my favorite)  Interesting items on dinner menu include platters for 2 for $19.95 and a slider platter featuring their various meats.  If you go, be sure to try the Georgia Mustard sauce.  It's a blend of vinegar and mustard and reminded me of my 2-week visit to Raleigh-Durham.
