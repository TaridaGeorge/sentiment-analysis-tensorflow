On a Saturday afternoon my friend and I found this wonderful place! It is so unique! This is a must see space! Clothing seems to be the specialty as well as an artful presence - All the clothing is really well priced -- I will be back for more shopping! The owners are so great to talk to, they make you feel so at home. It is more than a store, you have to see for yourself!
