Great service, great atmosphere and awesome food. 

Server gave us great suggestions... really opened my eyes to tequila.
Loved the feel of the place and it was packed on a Tuesday night. 
Food was timely but not rushed. 

ALL in ALL a very good experience, you can tell this place is very well managed.
