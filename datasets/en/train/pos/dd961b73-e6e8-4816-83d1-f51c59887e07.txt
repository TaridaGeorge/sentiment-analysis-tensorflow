"Three Perfect Days" is a great article series by United Hemispheres magazine.  They do "Three Perfect Days" in cities they fly into and Phoenix was reviewed and highlighted...

But they missed Fashion Square Mall.

Wedged in from 5-8pm on a Friday night in Scottsdale
5pm Happy Hour at Kona.  Watch the post work crowd roll in from the valet line as they unwind from their 30 hour work week.
545pm Stroll over to brewery while keeping your tab open at Kona
630pm Socialize at "Z Tejas" and tease the trios visiting from Mesa
715pm close the tab at Kona and then walk the mall to sober up

SF has the cheesie triangle but Fashion Square has its own triangle right by the valet stand.

Next time, when my friends come in, I'm pre-partying at Fashion Square "triangle" before W, 6 and SB (skye bar)
