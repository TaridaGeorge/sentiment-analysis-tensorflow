I LOVE this place.  This really is one of my favorite spots for dinner in Kierland.  The food is always reliable and every entree I have ever had has always been good. My husband and I both had the baked ziti.  Very flavorful and delicious pasta dish.  They do a great job with presentation and staff is always very attentive.  I prefer the outside seating in the restaurant. Defintely gets an "A plus" in my book.
