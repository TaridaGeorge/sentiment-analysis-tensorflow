J'adore ça!

This Paris-inspired coffeehouse-bistro-boulangerie is tres charming!  When I sauntered in, I instantly felt like I was teleported to France.

The woman at the cashier was amiable and exuded a warm vibe.  She even sat herself next to me while we had a light tête-à-tête about Paris.

Now the food.  Oh. My. God.  Mere words would not do justice to elucidate the tantalizing ecstasy that my taste buds experienced.  My taste buds pirouetted as I masticated their gluten-free, wheat crepes with goat cheese and spinach with a side of salad.  When my teeth sank into their raspberry and cheesecake tart, my buds burst into song.   "This tastes EXACTLY like the tart I had in Paris," was my first thought.

Believe me when I say I will be back very soon.
