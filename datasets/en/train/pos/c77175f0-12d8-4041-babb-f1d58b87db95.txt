Let me tell you something. I. Love. Target. Especially this location! It's the only Super Target (translation: with grocery) in the area. I don't shop so much in the grocery department, but it's fantastic when I need a few extra things and don't have to make an extra stop. The whole store is always neat, clean and organized. But what is so great about this Target, you ask? It is NEVER busy. I dreadedly visited the weekend before Christmas, and was absolutely shocked. There was NO line. None! Nada! Target has my heart forever.
