I am a huge Suns fan but my review is about the fundraising options that the Suns have to offer as well as their back-office staff.

First and foremost, talk about a professional, classy organization. Whether you have fundraising experience or are a total novice, the staff treats you like you are the only group they are working with. My contact is Kyle Pottinger and he is always a gentleman. No matter what questions I have, he always answers them promptly and never makes me feel like I'm bothering him. 

The fundraising process is easy and the tickets practically sell themselves because who doesn't want the chance to purchase discounted tickets? 

The process is easy and the rewards can be lucrative depending on the target audience you are working with. The Suns will treat you professionally and courteously. You won't be disappointed.
