Stopped into Frost after the movies at San Tan Mall it's on Painted Sky Drive next to Brio, Wow what awesome gelato!  Cannot wait to go back.  Very cool place with a great vibe, the staff was so friendly and kind.  They even gave us waters because it was brutally hot out and I just really am happy to see a gelato shop at our mall.  We had espresso flavor, they explained to us that all ingredients are flown in from Italy and have fewer calories than regular ice cream, I don't even care about the calories I just want MORE - I hope they do well at San Tan and are around a long long time I really can't wait to try more flavors.
