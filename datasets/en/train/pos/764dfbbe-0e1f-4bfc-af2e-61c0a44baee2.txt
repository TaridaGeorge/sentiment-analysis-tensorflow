I fell in love with Sens ! We went for our anniversary and the food and service were excellent! Yelpers are right... the sugar cane is sooo good! We tried Hongkong wonton (spicy and sour,.. great combination in chili soy), mint duck salad (refreshing and tender meat, perfect). We ordered 4 dishes for the two of us and it is more than enough. the last one we ordered is a crispy chicken with special rub (only that week they have), they are excellent! The server, Kelton, was super helpful, he asked us if this is your first time and he gave us a lot of good recommendation. I would definitely come again. It is great for a date,..
