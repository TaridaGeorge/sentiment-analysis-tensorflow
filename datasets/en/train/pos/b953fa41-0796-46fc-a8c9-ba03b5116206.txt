This Whataburger is my favorite!  The employees are friendly and I feel like a person, not a number when I drive through.   

The burgers are tasty with the perfect amount of mustard, the large soda comes in a styrofoam cup and stays cold for hours and the fries are not too salty.  You cant ask much more from all American fast food!  

Oh yeah and they have biscuits and Gravy for Breakfast.
