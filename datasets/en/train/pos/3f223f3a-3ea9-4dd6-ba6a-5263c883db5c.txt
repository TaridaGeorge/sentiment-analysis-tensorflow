Thank you Dr. Lindsey! I will be a bride in about a week and was horrified to wake up to a ruptured blood vessel in my eye.  Concerned for my eyes as a diabetic and unsure if I was really ok (and if my pictures were going to turn out ok or not) I was able to get a quick appointment and after being examined was assured I was going to be just fine and that I was already in the healing stage.   I am so relieved and so grateful to be seen so quickly.   Thank you Valley Eye Care for taking some of the stress out of this crazy week!  It's amazing how much more relaxed I am after being examined - I just had to say Thanks!
