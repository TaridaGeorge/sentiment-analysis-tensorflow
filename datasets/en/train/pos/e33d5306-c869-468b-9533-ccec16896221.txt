Where to start?  Let's try here: 
- the family who runs the shop are amazingly friendly and helpful.  LOVE THEM
- the food is great and unique - you probably haven't had anything like it, and you need to change that
- I don't know what a beaver has to do with anything, but he's cute so who cares
- Don't let the weird plaza scare you, the place is great, and you should definitely eat in to get the full experience (crazy how good the food is becoming in this weird plaza - Ted's, Papaya, wow!)

I recommend you get over to Beaver Choice now so you can say "Remember when they were in that little location over on..."
