Hiked this little baby and when I reached the top, I felt like I accomplished something.  What a great feeling!  Constant elevation change going up then scrambling over boulders~ lunch never tasted so good when sitting on top of Flat Iron.  
After lunch~ take the challenge and hike the additional 15 minutes and go all the way to the top!
And don't forget to take in the breath taking scenery!!
