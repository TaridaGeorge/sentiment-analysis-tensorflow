Casey Moore's is definately one of my favorite places to go in Tempe. The enviroment is very laid back and the people there are awesome! The food is great as well. I would recommend the calamari rings and their clam chowder. They also have an awesome selection of drinks, including my favorite Snake Bite =)....

I would recommend this bar to anyone and everyone who has not been there before. You will love it!
