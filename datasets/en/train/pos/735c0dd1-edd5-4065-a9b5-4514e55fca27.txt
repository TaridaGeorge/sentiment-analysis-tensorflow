Go on Sunday and get the Yorkshire Roast Beef. I also highly recommend the Scotch Eggs. This place has the best British fare I've had in a long time (since the King's Head Pub in Santa Monica and not including when I lived in England). It's a little pricey, but we shared the Scotch Eggs & Yorkshire Roast Beef and topped the entire meal off with some bread pudding and after all was said and done, we were well stuffed and paid around $30 for the meal with tip. The decor is certainly "Quintessentially British", although I was slightly affronted by the lack of Manchester United paraphanelia (there was some, but I saw quite a few more scarves for Liverpool, oh well, the food made up for it).
