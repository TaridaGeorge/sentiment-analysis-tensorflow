We were in town on business and went to Ruth's Chris on Camelback.

Ruth's Chris has a gluten free menu and their service is top notch.  The food was out of this world. Everything from the steaks (melts in your mouth) to the sides and the salads and the desserts. Fantastic! These chefs did not miss a beat and neither did the servers. 

I recommend ordering from the Ruth's classics on the menu. One set price and comes with salad, entree (I had filet and shrimp) sides and dessert. (several gluten free dessert options that were delicious!)

What a wonderful culinary experience!!
