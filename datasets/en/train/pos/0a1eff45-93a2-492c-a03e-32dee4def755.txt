Mesa's best kept secret, LJ's is a family owned pizza joint with I swear to you, the best pizza I've ever had, EVER.  And I know my pizza.  Seems simple I guess but they do it right and I'm not sure I can really explain it.  Regular to thinnish crust, not overbearing on sauce...  Dont go to LJs for the ambiance, theres not much to be had, but the service is good and you absolutely cant go wrong with the endless pizza and salad lunch buffet for around $8.  My favorite is 'shroom, but for you daredevil pizza eaters, look for tens of odd topping combinations including the pasta pizza.  If you HAVE to be in Mesa, you HAVE to be at LJ's.
