This place is amazing! The food is spectacular,the service is five star, and we love the  d√©cor! If you don't at least give this place a try, you'll never know what your missing. Eric was a great Server, and the manager took care of us as well. A must try! Seriously! We'll be back, again and again. Thanks White Chocolate Grill!
