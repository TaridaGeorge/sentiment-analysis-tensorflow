I can't believe I made it through ASU without discovering this gem of a restaurant. This place is amazing. Aside from not accepting plastic forms of payment (the only drawback), this place is now on my lunch rotation. On the first trip I tried the BBQ chicken and the crunchy chicken, both very good. Can't wait to go back for more. It has very limited seating so plan on taking your food to go or avoid the lunch time rush.
