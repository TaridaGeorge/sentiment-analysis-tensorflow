this is where i go for bbq in phx!!!

my family loves going here.  we have gone in small and large groups.  they are very accommodating.  even with reservations it takes awhile to be seated.  eventhough there is a lot of seating this restaurant is always busy.  they even have private rooms.  the restaurant is very nice inside and the customers are even dress real nice.  looks kinda weird seeing folks dress professional in a bbq joint.  if busy the parking kinda sucks.

the food is awesome!  everything that my family has tried as been awesome.  the corn bread and honey butter is delicious!  the ribs, steak, chicken, grilled salmon, salads, fries, it's all good!

the servers seem to do a great job and never had one problem.  great job!

i hope you enjoy this place because i do!
