this is by far my favorite pizza restaurant.  We have never once had a bad experience here, and the food is always amazing.  They do have a full bar, with a tv in that area.  The outdoor seating is very nice and overlooks a man-made pond.  The service is always very quick, and the pizza tastes amazingly fresh.  We have been here 10+ times and absolutly love it.  If you want my suggestion for a topping, try the meatball.  We normally do Meatball, peppers, onions....its literally perfect, the sprinkle some of the garlic powder on it (you have to ask for the garlic powder)
