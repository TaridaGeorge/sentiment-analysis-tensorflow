HAPPY BIRTHDAY Scramble !  as always , another great breakfast and served with a smile !   and even better , it was 50% off  this morning !  The staff is top of the scale when it comes to customer service , and run by a "WORKING " Manager.... great to see !  food is always FRESH and done just the way I like it every time.  Glad You are here in the Valley of the Sun , right where you belong !
