Really enjoy going to the drive-in with friends or its an easy date to take the baby on because he can be loud in the car, or better yet sleep. We usually pack the soda cooler go to relax.

Everyone around here is usually relaxed and just looking to have a good time. People will bring lawn chairs or blankets as well.

They have a children's arcade and jump castle for kids who just aren't into the movie you are watching.

I really hope they do not close this place. It may be a relic but I still enjoy going..
