We are hardcore foodies from Los Angeles who have eaten in some of the best restaurants in the world and are just plain crazy about good food.  Considering that I live in a city that has world's largest Thai population outside of Thailand and eat quite a bit of Thai food, I am very hard to impress.  So with that, I have now eaten at Tum Nak Thai twice and have been impressed both times.  This is really well done and seriously tasty Thai cooking.  Mesa, you have no idea how lucky you are.   Phoenix foodies, you would do well to head here!
