We've been going to Michelina's for 8 years now. It's our favorite romantic date night spot. The food is unbelievable. The owner/chef is always in the house, but the main host is very sweet and attentive. Excellent service here. I can't even start to tell you what to try. Everything I've had is good, starting with the appetizers all the way to dessert. I love the Caprese, the chicken Marsala, and chicken parmigiana. It's all good. They have a pretty extensive wine list as well, including some very reasonable offerings price wise. Surprise your date with this fabulous spot. You won't be disappointed.
