Always one of my favorite places to eat.  If you dont like crowded places, try their restaurant at Dobson and Guadalupe...more space same great selection.  Here's another suggestion:  Throw a Pasty Party.   They do catering as well.  We had a great party with two of each flavor of pasties.
Great fun!
