My friends, family, and I have been here many times, and I have to say the food is really excellent, and more importantly super authentic. They have both a true Chinese menu for real foodies and a more typical menu for those who prefer American Chinese food. You'll find that their selection is far beyond what you would typically find on a Chinese menu. 

In all honesty the place does give off a "hole in the wall" feeling, and the really outdated decor doesn't help. So if your looking for an upscale posh environment, this isn't the place, but if you're looking for some real Chinese then this is it! I recommend the beef fried rice and whole fried fish!
