Probably my favorite place ever to eat. Everything I have had off the menu here is just top notch. My favorite is the two meat plate with pulled pork and hot links. They have classic baked Mac n cheese with the crust on top, and their baked beans are just like my grandma used to make. They even brew their own root beer and cream soda, which is fantastic! While it's a cafeteria style dining room, it also has a lot of charm, bringing to mind a 1950s farmhouse. Nice outdoor area with lots of big trees for shade too.
