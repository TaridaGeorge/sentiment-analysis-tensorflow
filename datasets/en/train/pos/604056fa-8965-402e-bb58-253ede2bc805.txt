OMG !!! This place is incredible. If they don't have it, then it's not made anymore. They have all your favorite candies from the good old days! Even Jordan Almonds arranged in bins by color. Every Jelly Belly flavor. Even Freshen-Up gum- remember the one that squirted that liquid in your mouth when you bite into it?! And Pop-Rocks !!
Crazy prices if you buy large sizes. I bought a 5 lb bag of Boston Baked Beans for $15. They charge $8-10 a lb in the candy store in the mall and on Coronado. This place is so close to me I'm gonna gain 20 lbs :(
