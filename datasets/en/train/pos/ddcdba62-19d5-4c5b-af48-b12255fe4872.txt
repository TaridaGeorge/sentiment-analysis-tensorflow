Came here after we couldn't get waited on at another place nearby.  Best decision ever.  The beers good, everyone knows that, but the food is good too.  They were super busy but the bartender took time to chat with us & we never wanted for anything.  Great old building too.  My friends mom worked there when it was valley nat'l bank, a long time ago!
