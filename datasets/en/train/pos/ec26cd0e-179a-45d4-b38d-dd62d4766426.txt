Living in Phoenix, there are very few really good bbq spots, Honey Bears is an exception. Honey Bears is one of the best bbq restaurants that you will find in Arizona.

Honey Bears cooks Tennessee style bbq which is a sweet/tangy flavor. I'd say that the highlights of the menu are the ribs and pulled pork sandwich. 

Their meat choices are pork, beef, chicken, and hot links. They also have a couple side dishes that are worth trying, the "cowbro beans" and potato salad.

Honey Bear's gets five stars for cooking up some of the best bbq in Arizona at a reasonable price.
