I love this place.. Bars everywhere to sit at... Combination rolls for 6 dollars.. Really friendly waiters... We had pearl bottle rockets, (shrimp, scallion, crm cheese with peach dip sauce), whoop bass(crab,cucumber,seabass,avacado,orange),sunsetstrip(yellowtail,cucumber,crmcheese,salmon) eclectic but divine... Wash it down with great cocktails from the rockin Outside bar!! See you there
