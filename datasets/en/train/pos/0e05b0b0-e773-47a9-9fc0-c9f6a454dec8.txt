Terrific restaurant all the way around.  The food is amazing and our service was completely top notch.  We went with a large group for a Saturday lunch and they generously gave us our own room with clearly one of their best servers.  We were made to feel right at home and had a wonderful time.  I followed others recommendations and had the pork nachos and ordered the Fuego Pasta with shrimp for my wife. Both were delicious.  The only negative was listening to my wife give me a had time for actually finishing the huge plate of nacho.  I think the chips were homemade as they were light, crispy, and very tasty.  Can't wait to go back!
