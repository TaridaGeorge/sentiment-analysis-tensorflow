Wow! I've never been a huge froyo fan...UNTIL NOW. This place truly has it all: it's inviting, has a fantastic selection of tasty, healthy flavors, it's clean, they're friendly and helpful, and the prices are just right, at 39 cents/oz. I will definitely be back, and bring a date, friends, family, etc. I have been to Mojo, Yogurtini, and some others in the Phoenix area, and I have to say Zoyo takes the cake...batter, that is. Thanks, Zoyo!
