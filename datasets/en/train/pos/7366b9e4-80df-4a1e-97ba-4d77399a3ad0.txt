This is some of the best pizza in Phoenix.  I have tried some of the others like Pizzeria Bianco but I still prefer Grimaldi's.  Its not that I don't like the other places but there is something about that coal fired oven that gives the pizza just an amazing taste and texture that a wood fired oven just can't do.  I agree with with some that the service could be better.  It's not bad, it just could be better.  I forgive them though because I really like their pizza.  Usual we get a white pizza with ham on it and then I get a side of pizza sauce for me (my wife does not like any pizza sauce).  Yummy, Yummy.
