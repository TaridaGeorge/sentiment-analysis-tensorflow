This is my VERY first "build your own yogurt place" and I must admit that I LOVE it!!!!!

I got four different types of yogurt: oreo, vanilla bean, raspberry, and a "tart" one with sprinkles and all sorts of other goodies.... it was soooo delicious.

Plus we had a 1/2 off coupon.  I don't think it gets much better than that!!!!
