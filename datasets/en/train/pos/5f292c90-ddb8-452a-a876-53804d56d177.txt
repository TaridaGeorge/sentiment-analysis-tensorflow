We have been taking our dog, Cholla, to Pinnacle Peak Animal Hospital since we "found" her, back in 2005.  The tech staff is wonderful - Cholla loves Patrick (Probably mostly for the treats.).  I have always found the staff and Doctors (We have seen Dr. Dawson, Dr. Stevenson, and lately Dr. Izumi) to be professional, caring for animals, and provide good answers and treatment explanations to the "parents" of their patients.  I also appreciate the fact the Doctors and Staff don't push "extra" services on you (i.e. Teeth Cleaning) unless you inquire, or they really feel there is an issue.  Thank you.
