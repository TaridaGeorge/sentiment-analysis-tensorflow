Great addition to downtown chandler. We made a reservation for 6:45pm on a friday and we were seated immediately. Service was great. Waitress was full of information about all the dishes and was super helpful with suggestions about what we should order and how we could alter some dishes. 

For appetizers we split the Spicy Thai Lettuce wraps &  the stuffed chicken wings. They were both delish, and the spice level was just right on the lettuce wraps and the stuffed chicken wings were unique, tasty & excellent presentation on both. 

For dinner two of us had the pad thai with chicken & tofu - I loved it. THe other orderded the Grilled Halibut and everything was delicious!

I'm super excited to have finally found excellent thai food in chandler/the east valley. I look forward to going back!
