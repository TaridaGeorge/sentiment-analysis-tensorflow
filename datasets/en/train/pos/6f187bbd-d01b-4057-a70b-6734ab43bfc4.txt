Always a great meal at Tottie's.  Probably one of the better appointed Thai restaurants you'll ever eat at.  The Pad Se Ew is always tasty.  WATCH OUT for their spice levels.  Even when you specify medium spicy, the kitchen staff gets heavy handed.  Err on the lower side of the spicy scale if you don't want your lips to catch fire.  The Tottie rolls were creative...egg rolls served with fresh lettuce, mint, and cilantro so you could pick the herbs and roll them up into the lettuce.  Loved that.  This was our 2nd time here and it's always a good choice.
