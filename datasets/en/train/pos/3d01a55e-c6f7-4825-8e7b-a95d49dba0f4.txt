My wife and I own Hawaiian Experience Spa in the same center as this Pita Jungle and have found this to be a life saver. We try to eat healthy even when working long hours and Pita Jungle is where we go. Today we had lunch and dinner there! The service is great and everything we have had has been excellent. Today we had the Chipolte Chicken Lavosh Pizza. For $9.49 it was enough for us both.

We also order from Pita Jungle at the spa for our date night treatments which include dinner. We try to get only the best for our clients and Pita Jungle is our #1 choice.
