Incredible dinner and experience.  I organized a buddy's bachelor party dinner here for 10 guys.  We pre-arranged to have 6 bottles of Duckhorn Decoy set aside with their events staff, they were very helpful.  We started out with the seafood tower, it was an awesomely big tower of lobster, crab, shrimp, and oysters -- all were outstanding.  To start, I had the warm spinach salad.  For main course, I had the bone-in filet cooked medium rare, it was one of the top 5 steaks i've ever had.  We got the mac & cheese and garlic mashed patatoes, both were good but second to the steak.  It was Friday night and very busy, cool atmosphere.  Would go back for sure if in Scottsdale again.
