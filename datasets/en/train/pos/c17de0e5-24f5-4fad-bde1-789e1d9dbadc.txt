I was headed to the Firehouse for firebreathing Show and a great dj but dropped in Rice Paper to burn some time and have a drink. I ended up staying at Rice Paper till almost midnight hanging out with the owners Lan and Hue who are extraordinary funny sisters I will call Hue Hollywood from here on out! Service is perfect, feels like family, food is dead on, I ordered the shaking beef, which was Cubes of Filet Mignon sauteed in this super " I could die for this sauce" with a nice plate of steamed rice with a  side with grilled zucchini. Hue also makes a mean Grey Goose with a splash of Pineapple!!!!! "Picture her splashing pinneaplle juice many times here" I also ordered the traditional Summer Rolls, they were heavenly. I can't wait to go back !!!
