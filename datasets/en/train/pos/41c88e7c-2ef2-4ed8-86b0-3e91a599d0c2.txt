I am not a huge Teriyaki fan and this place was coming up as a sushi place on Yelp for a while now but was always closed. As most of you know, there are barely any sushi places down town so when I was home for the week last week I finally had the chance to head out to this place.

I wasn't disappointed that there was barely any sushi, I decided to go with the beef teriyaki instead. Holy smokes! Super yum! I haven't had teriyaki that was this good, ever!.

I will go back more and more and stuff myself silly. Love it.

I highly recommend it.
