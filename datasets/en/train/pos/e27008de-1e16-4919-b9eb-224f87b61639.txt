Howard was one of three contractors I had bid for replacement of my direct vent water heater in the home I own. His rates were the most reasonable. He always answers his phone. He is straight to the point and won't give you the runaround. His prices are good. His son came out and did the job. They pointed out in a diplomatic fashion some of the errors made in the original plumbing of the home and corrected them without an additional charge (it was an elbow that was installed backwards). 
I just called him for a potential wash basin in my garage and again, he was helpful.
