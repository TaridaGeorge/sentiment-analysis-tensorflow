The best 'cool' place in Snottsdale!!! Kind of a dive bar but still totally popular. I just miss the ping-pong table. They must have ditched that for more table and bar space, which I guess is understandable but still. Anyway I love going there whenever. AND... it's one of the few Scottsdale places that serves (consistently) generous mixed drinks, if you know what I mean!!!!! And it never fails that I bump into great friends!
