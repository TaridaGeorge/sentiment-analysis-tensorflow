This is our fave frozen yogurt place.  It reminds me of the 1st froyo places that sprung up in the 80's.  The yogurt is not the sickly sweet kind you find at most places around the valley.  The flavors change daily and the prices are super good.  They even have a 1/2 size for the littlest customer.  Its a 15 minute drive for us - but we make it!
