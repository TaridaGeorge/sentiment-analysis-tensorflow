I so wish this restaurant was in Southern California!  We came to Scottsdale with our gymnastics team and had our team dinner here for 50 people.  Sally, the owner, and Nick, our waiter, were so friendly, professional and classy.  The food was outstanding, the service exceptional, and it was a perfect event.  Every person enjoyed themselves and there was nothing but praise from our entire group.  Sally went above and beyond to make sure our entire group was satisfied, and we were!
