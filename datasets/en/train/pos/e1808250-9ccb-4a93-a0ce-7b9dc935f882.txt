We have dined at Eva's for lunch and dinner, including a birthday party group of nine.  The ambiance is really nice here.  Service was excellent.  The menu offers an excellent variety.  Complimentary chips with salsa and bean dip are presented almost immediately when one is seated and are readily replenished if needed.  All food that our groups ordered was considered above average.  Our birthday celebrant was treated to a complimentary fried ice cream dessert (with several spoons graciously provided) along with a robust song sang by the waiter staff.  It's a great place for a business lunch, dinner party, or celebration.
