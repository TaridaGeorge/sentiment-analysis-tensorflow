Amazing food, ultra cozy atmosphere, and a huge patio (a little too cold for the patio tonight). The owner operators are obviously passionate about great food and great cocktails.

I had the Scallops and she tried the Pork... both done to perfection. Try the creamed corn with jalapenos for a side!!!

The menu is simple yet diverse (steak, chicken, pork, shrimp, scallops and fish), and they also offer nightly specials if you burn through the menu too quickly. Highly recommended for a romantic dinner... I will be back to try lunch next time I'm in the area.

This gem is off a side street near 7th and Bethany, and in a courtyard off of that street... Good luck finding it :) 

*Thanks goes to Groupon for helping me find this place...
