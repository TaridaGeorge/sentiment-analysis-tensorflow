Mikes way is the best way. Great service. Join the sub club.

I have never been a big fan of sub sandwiches but this is the best sub sandwich restaurant I have found in the valley. The service is always fast and friendly no matter how busy they are. I love that they don't have the pre-sliced meat like Subway and the bread is much better quality. They always have coupons in the Val-Pak and if you sign up you get electronic coupons as well.

Hey! If the firefighters eat here, it must be good!
