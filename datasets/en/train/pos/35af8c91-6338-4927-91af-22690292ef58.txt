I go here for breakfast and i usually end up with a sandwich.  All sandwiches here are great and filling with the side.  Breads are freshly baked right there.  I have had breakfast here and the bagel egg sandwiches are pretty darn good.  Can be kinda cramped inside with a full house on weekends but the service is so quick I'm usually on the road before someones rug rat starts bumping into me.
