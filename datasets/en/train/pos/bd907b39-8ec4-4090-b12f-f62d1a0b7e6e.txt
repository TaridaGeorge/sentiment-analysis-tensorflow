If you're looking for that exotic item...this is THE place.  It's huge!!!  It has everything your heart can desire.  I loooooove this place!
Monster selection:  cheap produce prices and really fresh produce, too.
Bought some salmon from there I had to cut into 4 oz. pieces when I got home.  Since I won't buy any fish from China, the salmon was from some other country like Chile (I just can't remember), but was fresh and delicious even after freezing and thawing.
This place is so worth the trip--just to see what other countries offer if nothing else.  Seems, too, like every country that exports food goods to us is represented, also, almost--especially if they are Asian or South American or even some European.
This is a great place, and I'd hate to see you miss the experience of shopping there even just one.  Go here!
