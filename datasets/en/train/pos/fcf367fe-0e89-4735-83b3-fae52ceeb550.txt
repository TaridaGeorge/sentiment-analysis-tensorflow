Aaron of Paramount Plumbing is awesome!  I came home to my laundry room flooded and panicked.  Called Aaron and he was out in about an hour.  He was friendly, efficient and had my laundry room back to normal in less than 45 minutes.  The rates are reasonable as well, not what I expected for emergency service. Also, two week guarantee, first time that has ever been offered right away.   He will be the plumber I call from now on.
