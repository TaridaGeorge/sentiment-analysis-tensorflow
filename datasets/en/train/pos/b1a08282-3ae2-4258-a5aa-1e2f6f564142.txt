9/24/2012 Reservation for 6:30 PM. No problem. Wine by the half liter. Salad is very fresh with a light creamy Italian dressing. Poached salmon with risotto was very good although risotto contained a little too much liquid. Chicken picatta was excellent with tangy lemon caper sauce. (Just right consistency) Chicken portion was ample.Plenty of capers. Tiramisu was great, creamy and good chocolate flavor. Will go again and recommend to any one with taste for Italian food. Priced are reasonable . Service is responsive and timely with no attitudes.
