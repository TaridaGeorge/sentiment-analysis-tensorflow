After scouring high and low for the perfect bike, I finally found it here. Aside from the good price they gave me, the service was really great. A guy named Adam helped me out and he was really friendly and knowledgeable about all the question I had to throw at him.

Overall, they have a pretty wide selection of bikes which is nice to see because every bike store in Phoenix seems to only sell beach cruiser types or mountain bikes. As far as accessories go, you can find pretty much anything you're looking for here from locks to a horn for your handle bar. Another great reason to buy from here is that if you get a bike, you get one free tune-up whenever you want to come back in.

Come here for the perfect bike, perfect service, and perfect selection of what they have to offer.
