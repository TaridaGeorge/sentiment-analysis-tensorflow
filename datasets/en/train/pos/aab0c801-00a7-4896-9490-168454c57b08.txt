Great coffee + occasional live music + wine bar + fun art and style = 5 stars!

Urban bean really increases my love for Phoenix. If you come at the right time, just sitting with your coffee and enjoying the ambiance is very euphoric.

YOU MUST TRY:
1. The wine bar
2. Joyous almond smash
3. Smash me s'more
4. Dark chocolate mocha smash
