Loved the Margherita Pizza. Simple yet so delicious.  
Crazy thing though...my favorite thing there was the Bruschetta.  Had the "3-way."  Oh, the freshness of those tomatoes!   Unbelievable. Lots of basil. So good.  The bean brushcetta came in 2nd.

We didn't really save room for dessert but shared some strawberry crepes anyway-or at least tried to.   The kids went in for the kill and it was gone in about 2.5 seconds.  Have to say though, I enjoyed my one bite thoroughly.
