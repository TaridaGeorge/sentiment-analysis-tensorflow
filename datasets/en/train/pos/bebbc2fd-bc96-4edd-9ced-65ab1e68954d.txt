Stinkweeds is the real deal record shop! Local, indie, underground, staff that knows its biz. Great store and I am sad that there is only one location left. Hopefiully, it can stay around in these days of music purchasing being an afterthought to the download. 

Nothing quite like hanging in a record shop checking out stuff and listening to the picks of the clerk.
