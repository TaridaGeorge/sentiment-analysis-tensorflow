This has become a firm favorite - great indoor and outdoor space.  The back patio is awesome when you bring your dog.  The food never disappoints - bring your appetite  - the portions are huge !  If you like beer, you can try the samples before you get your pint.  I love the cheese plate - such a variety, and then the popcorn on the plate is a cool alternative to chips.  It is all really filling and comes out beautifully presented.  my partner likes the fish tacos they have.  We have had their salads too.  Whatever you have it is all good.  Good food, good atmosphere - what more do you want !
