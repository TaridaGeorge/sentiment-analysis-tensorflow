So I finally made it to the Miracle Mile Deli - after hearing so many things!!
We turned a meeting into a lunch meeting....and closed the deal.
The parking lot was full outside...so I hesitated because if I have to wait in line for food....its not happening!!
But once inside, it resembled a glorified cafeteria with plenty of seating YAY!! When it comes to deli you can't be a snob to decor - my true test is a pastrami and corned beef sandwich and they clearly received the thumbs up! While they only had potato knishes.....their selection of other goodies made up for it. I will be back. =0)
