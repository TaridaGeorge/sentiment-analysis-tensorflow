If you love brick oven pizza, this place has some of the best I've ever had.  We were visiting Phoenix and read reviews on this place and decided to try it.  It's a quaint Italian restaurant run my an Italian that offers many Italian classics.  If I ever find myself in the area I would definitely eat there again.
