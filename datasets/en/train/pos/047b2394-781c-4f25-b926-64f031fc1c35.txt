This place ruled. I enjoyed some of the veggie spring rolls to start. They were not too hot, not too cold... just right. After that it was the thai fried rice with tofu. It was nice and spicy and I added a bit of the chili sauce to give it some more zest. For dessert, I had the mango with sticky rice, which was fantastic. It was a large size portion and it was fresh and tasty. I highly recommend this place.
