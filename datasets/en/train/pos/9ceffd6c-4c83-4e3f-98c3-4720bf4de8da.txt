I am PICKY when it comes to my nails....  usually have them done for a special occasion then, get them off as quick as I can! Well, after seeing Lynn for a full set for Christmas... I ... AM... HOOKED!!!!

She did such a FANTASTIC job. I am going in for a fill!!! 

Looks like after all these years, I finally found a GOOD NAIL TECH!!!!
