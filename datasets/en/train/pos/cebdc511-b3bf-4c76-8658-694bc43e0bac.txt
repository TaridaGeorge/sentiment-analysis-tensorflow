This place is like a breath of fresh air tucked away in the land of Agritopia of Gilbert. I love this place mainly for its:

1. Picnic tables outside
2. Its a perfect place to take an informal date, kids night out, or solo
3. The menu has some variety although the burgers are its main staple
4. Its got a coffee shop, bistro right next door. It's a completely different yet the same vibe. The younger folk generally hang out here. Great coffee.
5. They appreciate our country's VETS! On Vet appreciation night :-)
