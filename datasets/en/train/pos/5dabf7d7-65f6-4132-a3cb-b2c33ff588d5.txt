My family is from Northern part of Thailand, therefore I was happy just by that AND they have STICKY RICE!  And I've been to many Thai restaurants around town, and I judge them by how the prepare Thai Steak Salad..THE BEST IN TOWN!!!  Of course with Sticky rice!  

Yes, the service can be slow at times, but it's authentic people, and home made! Its not supposed to be a buffet or quick service, enjoy the food....enjoy the friends and family you're dining with....huge tables-it's awesome....enjoy the experience, enjoy the fact it's not a chain restaurant, or made by American standards, it's Thai..spicy and uber tasty hotness..... enjoy the fact it's in central Phoenix!!!
