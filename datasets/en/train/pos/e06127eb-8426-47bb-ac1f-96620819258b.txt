This place is dangerous....

Cheap....excuse me, *affordable* price wise, everything Ive bought here has stood up so the quality is good as well. i love that everythings color coordinated, it makes it so much easier to find specific things. I had an exchange and a return from my last purchase, and the staff was super nice and even helped me search the entire store for a specific bracelet.
