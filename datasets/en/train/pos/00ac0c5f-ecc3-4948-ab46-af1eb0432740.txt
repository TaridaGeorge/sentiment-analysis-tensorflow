This is fun, Alaskan, wood-lodge style eatery located in the same complex as the Chandler Mall.

amazingly, for being so close to the mall, you get some pretty good seafood for a really good price.

they have a full bar, compete with HH specials, though i don't recall being very impressed with the choices.
