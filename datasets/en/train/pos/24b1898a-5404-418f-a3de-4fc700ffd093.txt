This dude claims he "steals souls for a living" and is "the best photographer". In the world. Ever.

I promise--there is nothing at all vain, hacky, narcissistic, overpriced or arrogant, whatsosever, about Tyson Crosby or his work.

Phoenix should consider itself fortunate to be home to such a phenomenally over-talented, artistic genius.  Big art cities like NYC, Chicago and LA would never be able to fully appreciate the photographic brilliance of the one, the only, the premier best photographer in the world-Tyson Crosby.

Humble, poetic and unpretentious as he may be, I can't argue with him. The fist time I saw a Tyson Crosbie image, I j!zzed in my pants. Really, his work is that good. For real. No joke. I'm serious. Totally serious.  I love his work so much, I want to marry a Tyson Crosby print.

Where is the button for 5 million stars?!!!
