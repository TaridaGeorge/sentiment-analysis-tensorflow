Needed a quick bite in Scottsdale so I used the Yelp app and swung by this place.  I was a little taken aback by the location but once we got inside, it was nothing but goodness.  We had the pizza hoagie with potato salad.  Amazing.  The potato salad was nice and tangy with no celery, just the way I like it.  The pizza hoagie came with a generous amount of cheese and delicious tomato sauce.

Staff was super friendly and helpful.  Definitely a keeper.
