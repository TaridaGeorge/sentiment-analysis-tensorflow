Absolutely loved the whole dining experience! Interesting, unique food and fantastic service. You will know exactly what you are eating, because they describe what is in each dish to a tea. They addressed us each as "mr and mrs" and even had a hand written thank you in our valeted vehicle, with bottles of water and a small box of chocolates!! Really? That's above and beyond! I would recommend this to someone who is willing to try something new, and enjoys fine dining with top notch service!
