OMG YUM! My friends and I are on a mission to find some of the best breakfast joints in Phoenix and this one is phenomenal! I love the pancakes and the omlets! The fresh squeezed orange juice is a must for first time diners! The decor is cheesy and the service is ok but I loved the food and cannot wait to go back and try something else!
