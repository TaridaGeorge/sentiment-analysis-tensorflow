LOVE this coffee shop. What a perfect pairing being located in the market (another place I like to visit as often as possible). The coffee is wonderful and the service is always fast and friendly. The baked goods they offer change regular (read: super fresh) and are always so tempting. Great place to work too, unless it's a Saturday morning, because then it's packed (understandably). If you like coffee, this is a must-try.
