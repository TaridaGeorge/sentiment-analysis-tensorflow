The ONLY place in the valley where I'm actually willing to wait more than 25 minutes for breakfast, and that includes Mat's and Over Easy.  This place has heaping, savory excellence on every plate.  I've tried a lot of dishes here, but there's none like the pork omelet on the "Specials" board.  Diet conscious should bring a family of 4 to share a single plate with (5 if you want to share a cinnamon bun after the meal ;) ). Everything I've had here has been simply down-home, Incredibly delicious!  The service is friendly, fast and expert at handling the massive turnover. The whole family LOVES this place.
