I love this place! They have some of the freshest fish and a very wide selection. On any given night I can buy just what I need for dinner for 2, with leftovers, for around $10! The produce is of great quality and I can't seem to get enough of the pea shoots, amazing flavor to compliment anything from fish, chicken salads and soups. The staff is helpful and friendly, always smiling, I like that. Yesterday I bought a bundle of asparagus, 8 Japanese eggplants, 4 beefsteak tomatoes, a bag of enoki mushrooms, strawberries, grapes, garlic, a bell pepper, red lettuce and a bundle of green onions for $10.21. That is a savings of almost $10 off if I would have bought all that at a large chain supermarket. Mmm time to go make lunch!
