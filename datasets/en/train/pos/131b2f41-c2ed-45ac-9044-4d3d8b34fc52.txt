Great Pie with an atmosphere made for kicking back and enjoying a beer or three.  I've never had a bad meal here, and I think the Desert Ridge location is the best one of these around.  I haven't eaten at any of the other ones, but I can't find a bad thing to say about this establishment and its pizza so it must be the best one.  Whether you have a friend in town that you want to let in on the secret that Phoenix has some of the best pizza anywhere, or just going out with your buddies for the night, this place will never do you wrong.
