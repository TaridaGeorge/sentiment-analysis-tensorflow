We originally went to Press Coffee to try the much talked about 'cold-brew' a.k.a. Toddy Coffee.  It was absolutely amazing.  No bitter edge~  just smooth, smooth, great taste.  Steve (owner) was very charming and an amazing host.  He seems to have a great rapport with all his clients and knows them on a first name basis.  Experienced barista with personality, comfortable atmosphere and good food.  The CHAI is excellent too.  Definitely stop in to visit this amazing business.
