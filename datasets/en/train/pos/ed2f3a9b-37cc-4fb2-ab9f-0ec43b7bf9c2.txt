I've been a patient of Dr Lienau's since I was six years old!  I usually don't care who my primary care physician is, but when it comes to my dentist, there's no way in heck I would switch.  I even referred a co-worker to him recently!  

He's very honest, upfront, and has such a great support staff.  Colleen is the NICEST receptionist!  One of the hygienists has been there for years (I forgot her name!!) and is also a very friendly woman.

I definitely recommend Dr Lienau!
