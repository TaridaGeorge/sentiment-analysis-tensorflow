There's really nothing more I can say that hasn't already been said. The pizza offerings are all original and tasty like nobody's business especially with one of the great bottles of wine that they offer. The antipasti plate and caprese salad are fantastic too. We lucked out last week and walked right in on a Monday and were seated (four of us at 6:00pm) immediately. They apparently just started opening on Mondays and I don't think word is out yet. If you want to go and don't want to wait four hours (while getting sloshed at Bar Bianco next door) go on a Monday before word gets out.
