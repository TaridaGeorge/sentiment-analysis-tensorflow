I LOVED this place! Really authentic Chinese Food! Every one is giving bad reviews to this place because of the delivery service but no one is giving a fair review of this place's food!! 

It's hard to find good Chinese food in Arizona where Asians are 1% of the population. It takes me an hour to drive here, but I am SOO coming back for the food! 

If you are a fan of good Chinese food, you should try this place too and NOT judge this place based on bad delivery reviews.
