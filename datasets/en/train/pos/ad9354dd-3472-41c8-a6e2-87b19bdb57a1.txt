Perhaps it's because it's a Thursday and it isn't very crowded, but this Old Navy is REALLY well maintained! Everything on the tables is folded and sorted...not typical of a clothing retailer these days. 

Added bonus: we were greeted several times throughout the store...not just when we entered.

All-in-all, probably the best Old Navy I've been in...though, the true test would be to come during peak shopping time.
