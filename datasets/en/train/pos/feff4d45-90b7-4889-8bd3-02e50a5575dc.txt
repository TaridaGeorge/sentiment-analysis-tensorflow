I went here for the first time last weekend for lunch and was pleasantly surprised at the selection of sandwiches and drinks available.  We also got a meat & cheese tray to sample some of the varieties they carry in store.  I was also so happy to see that they carry many local wines, such as my favorite, Stronghold!

But be advised, this is definitely a spot for the adventurous eater.  There are a lot of unique ingredients so if you are looking for just a normal sandwich, this is not the place to get it.
