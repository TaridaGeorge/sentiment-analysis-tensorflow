i went back for more yesterday.. happy i did.

dr ben did two fillings yesterday. they were both quite deep. one was worse than the other. he was confident the deeper one would take as a cavity but of course, couldn't say for certain. he hopes, i hope. (it is amazing he recommended cavities for the deeper one, because the cost difference is huge and i'm paying out of pocket).

i trust his experience and judgment. and i am grateful he isn't looking to line his pockets.

so far, so good. no temperature sensitivity. no major throbbing.

i am so happy i found this dentist.
