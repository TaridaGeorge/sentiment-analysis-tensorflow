I go here once a month or so, usually on the spur of the moment and they can usually fit me in within a few minutes, even on the weekends.  

I originally thought they just massaged feet, I was surprised that they do your whole body.  I don't like the who naked on the massage table thing, and at this place you wear regular clothes and you are in a nice, comfortable chair.  They usually ask me about the pressure and if I am good periodically throughout the massage, too.

I describe it to people as like a ninja-massage, because they are quick and efficient and before you know it, you're ready to go.

This location is nice and clean and quiet, too.
