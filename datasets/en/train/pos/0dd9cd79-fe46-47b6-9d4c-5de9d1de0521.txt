Unique, fresh and damn good. 

Unique, they are called Steakenburger, they combine a good burger with a good cheese steak. Nuff said 

Fresh, The bun...oh the buns. Fresh local bakery, sliced when ordered, light and spongy. I am a bun kinda guy. 

Damn good, The two slices of cheese, the two thin patties and the cheese steak fixins, all wrapped in "the bun" The beef was fresh, Thin but fresh, not frozen. Served with skin on huge steak frys.... damn good. 

I too wanted a second burger, but opted for 31 flavor for dessert instead.
