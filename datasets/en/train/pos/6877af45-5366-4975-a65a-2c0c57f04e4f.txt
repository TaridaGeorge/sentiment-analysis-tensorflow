Better than Dragon Island! You will not find better crab puffs. This IS the best place you can find for inexpensive Chinese food. Great on price, even better on flavor. Will be back time and time again. WILL NOT FIND A BETTER LUNCH SPECIAL!! My favorites include chicken chow mein, Kung pow chicken, Mongolian beef, beef with broccoli, the BEST teriyaki chicken, sesame chicken and their sweet and sour dishes. We first discovered them years ago at their Peoria location. Couldn't review a better place!
