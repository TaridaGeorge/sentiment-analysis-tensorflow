I LOVE this place! The staff is incredible and so knowledgeable -- not to mention they are actually from Italy. It's definitely a special-occasion place though -- not for the everyday unless you're made of cashola. Great atmosphere, great food. Also you can sign up for their e-mails which tell you about upcoming wine tastings, special menus, etc. Four thumbs up (two from me, two from hubby).
