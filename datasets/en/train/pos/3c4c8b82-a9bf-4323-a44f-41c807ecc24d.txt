I've been taking my son to the newborn (free) swim classes for the past 1.5 months.  Our instructor is Ed and he does a great job explaining which skills/development milestones each activity is working on.  I'm interested in continuing our son's classes but feel the $75 a month for 4 classes is a little pricey, especially because kids this young are pretty fickle and some classes they just don't want to cooperate.  Several of the other parents in the older (paid) classes highly recommend the school and their child's progress.  Maybe I'm just being frugal because I've been assured by other parents that the classes are a good value for the money.
