A great Legion Post, excellent reasonable food, very congenial members, always make you feel welcome. Always a pleasure to come here. The menu is great, there is music, special events, and terrific cocktail prices. A top notch American Legion Post!
Their chef is terrific! Can't beat the steak sandwich, the Reuben, the fries, the soups, for lunch. In fact I have never had a bad meal here. It may not be haute cuisine but the friendliness the reasonable prices and the very nice patio, by the way, make this an A1 Post!!!
