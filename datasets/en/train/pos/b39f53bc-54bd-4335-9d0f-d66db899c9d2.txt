Turn It On Electric are pro's. One of the things I look for in any tradesman is neat work. I don't like sloppy wiring, crooked wall switches or little bits of wire all over the place. These guys make sure the job is complete. On top of that they are really knowledgeable and want to do it right. I had Chad take a look at my breaker box which was making some weird noises. There were things in there not done right from years ago, loose connections and code violations. I could have had a fire. Now I have peace of mind that the whole thing has been checked and it's done right.
