Love you. Really do. Love you even more because I can't have you.  Because I live in Chi-town and you live in Scottsdale.  Darn you.

I ate here three times. In two days. Yep.  That amazingly good.

Iced tea is the bomb. I loved it. They have great flavors.
Protein shakes are delish.  Hence the name of the place.  Rockin' to say the least.
Breakfast salad was so good, I now crave it.  Sucks to crave something so far away.
Quinoa oatmeal was also wonderful and healthy and tasty.

Basically, I think you are nuts if you don't like this place. I'm super jeals of all of the peeps that live out there that can eat at D'lish whenever they want.  As for people crabbin' about the price?  It's independent.  It's different. It's got a great vibe.  And the food is tasty.  Eat and hush up and enjoy.
