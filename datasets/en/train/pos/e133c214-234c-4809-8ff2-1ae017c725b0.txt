Mushroom Cheesesteak with provolone & mayo, a bag of Wise chips, and a Coke.

Doesn't that sound appetizing?  I pretty much get the same thing every single time I come here.

They make my cheesesteak EXACTLY they way I prefer my cheesesteak sandwich.  

Call in your order before driving there if you are impatient.  Either way, it's worth the wait.
