Love Zinc!  I get my Parisian fix here.  The French cuisine is top of the line, and the waiters are on their game.  The ambiance evokes a true bistro in Paris, complete with the bar in the front of the house.  The soups, salads, and entrees are all wonderfully prepared and presented.  I have had only the best at Zinc Bistro!
