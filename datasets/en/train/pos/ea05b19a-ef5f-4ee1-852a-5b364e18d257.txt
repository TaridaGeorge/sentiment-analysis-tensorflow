Resonable prices for drinks that are well poured. The one bartender with the glasses is really nice and always remember my boyfriend's name. They make the best White Russians. The jukebox always has something everyone can enjoy (might I suggest Wreeckless Eric's "Whole Wide World"?) Great for people watching. It gets crowded on Friday nights (A-DOY!) though, so if you don't like crowds or standing up when you drink, I'd avoid the peak hours. I like you, Shady's. You're a helluva dive bar.
