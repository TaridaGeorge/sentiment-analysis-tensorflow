I gave it 5 stars but it's a perfect 10! I have ignored this place since it opened although I am at Brio next door weekly. A co-worker gave me a gift certificate so went there after dinner and skipped Brio's rich desserts. Fell in love with the place after the first sample. The young staff is VERY patient and indulged me with all the samples I wanted. I now go every Saturday and get enough to take home for the week. I'm on a diet so I ration it out - it's my one indulgence but half the calories of ice cream. 

On Saturday night there was a line out the door. The place is small so it gets a bit crowded but worth it!
