A hotel stay a few years back introduced me to Lather...imagine my surprise to actually discover a store. 

I picked up a great baby gift and several of their candles as well. 

I love their candles. I gave a few as gifts which were enjoyed and I love my lavender one.  I also bought a lavender oatmeal bar of soap that I loved as well!  Definitely a place I would frequent and recommend.

They said if you bring in you prior bag or container for recycling you get a small discount..bonus!
