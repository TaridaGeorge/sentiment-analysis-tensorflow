This place is one of a kind. There is a huge outside patio that you can smoke on (and it is air conditioned) there are stripper poles to play and FREE POOL! 

The Billet Bar is laid back and there are beautiful, sassy ladies behind the bar. The bartenders are great they remember a face and always make me feel welcome.
