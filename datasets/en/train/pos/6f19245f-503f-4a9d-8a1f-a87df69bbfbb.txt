I discovered good ole' Spinato's a few years back and I completely fell in love!  

I usually opt to have the "oh so delicious" Baked Spaghetti Calzone.  I only get the petite size because that alone is HUGE.  It is cooked to perfection with a sweet tasting Italian sauce.  

This is one place, I usually like to introduce to people!  I've got to spread the word on the great mom and pop food places!
