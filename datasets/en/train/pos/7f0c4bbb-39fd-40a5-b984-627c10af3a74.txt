Jodi did the flowers for my wedding in February 2012. She was incredibly fun to work with and made some helpful suggestions that actually wound up saving us money. She delivered the flowers to the resort exactly when she said she would and they were stunning. My bridesmaids were thrilled with their bouquets, the moms loved the wrist corsages and the guys were satisfied with the boutinierres (simple white roses). My bouquet of picasso lillies was absolutely amazing and I still smile when I think about them. You really can't go wrong using Jodi for your wedding flowers!
