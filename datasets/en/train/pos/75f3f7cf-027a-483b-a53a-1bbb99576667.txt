Just left a little while ago. I believe the guy helping me name was steve. But totally awesome dude!! This place is great and has alternatives to brand cigars. Picked up a pardon and montecristo alt.... $ 3.00 &$ 2.75 a stick. Not too shabby! will find out from the hubby how they smoke.   :) will return again for sure!
