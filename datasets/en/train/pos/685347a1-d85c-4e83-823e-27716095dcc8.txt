Thanks Yelper's for your comments because I had to check this place out.  I'm so glad we did.  We went this evening for Karaoke with some friends and we all had a great time.  First time in a long time that I've stayed until almost closing.  

The bartenders were great, drink prices were average but the customers are what made the bar rock the most.  By the end of the night we knew some of the patrons names.  Found out we had missed their BBQ they had earlier in the evening.  

Neighborhood bars rock!  They made some awesome margaritas and had the cleanest bathrooms I've ever seen.
