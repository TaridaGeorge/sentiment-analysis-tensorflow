Why go anywhere else for a greasy burger and onion rings.  Be sure and ask Spyros, the owner: "Does the vegetarian burger have meat on it?"  He has a good sense of humor.  Great burgers, cool place, I just wish they had a liquor license and more seating to watch the crowds at the counter.  It's more entertaining than watching people at Disneyland or the bus station, I'm not sure which...  Delicious and owned by good people.
