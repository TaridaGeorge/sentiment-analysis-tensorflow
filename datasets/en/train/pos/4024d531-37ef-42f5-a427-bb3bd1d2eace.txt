Why write review on another Costco?  Well because this one trumps the rest of them in the Phoenix market when it comes to service.  

This Costco has the best service.  Everyone is always friendly and accommodating, including the folks behind the returns desk.  No "roll of the eyes" here when you return something.  

Another note on this Costco, is they seem to be more a weekend store, so do your shopping during the weekdays to beat the crowds.  Don't procrastinate when thinking about buying something here that is seasonal. They don't stay in stock very long especially after the weekends.
