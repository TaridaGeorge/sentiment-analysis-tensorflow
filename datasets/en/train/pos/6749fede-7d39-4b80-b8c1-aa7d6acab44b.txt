I heard about this place a few months ago on the radio while at work. So i decided to pay a visit. It was pretty easy to find the CD's i wanted, a few they didn't have but i was super happy about the ones they did have! They have a bunch of funny/unique toys, accessories.
The employees are friendly and fun to talk to. And everything is super cheap! Best part about this place. I could go to Best Buy and spend $20 on a new CD, or come here and spend $25 on 6 used but not damaged CD's.
This place is awesome and I'd recommend it to anyone.
