A friend recommended St Francis and I'm glad we listened.  What a great place.  Our server Amanda K. was so helpful, personable and knowledgeable I asked her how long she'd been working there expecting to hear a lengthy number.  I was shocked to find out 3 weeks!  This gal knew the menu and just what to recommend.  Within moments she had us hooked on trying more courses than we normally eat.  She was marvelous and made the evening just a little more fun.  The food was outstanding.  Taste, presentation and selection were unbelievable.  Lack of parking was the only down side.  This will be a place we frequent.
