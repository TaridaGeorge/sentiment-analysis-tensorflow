Even at 7 cents an ounce more than what I'm used to paying at my neighborhood Yogurtland, this particular location in Scottsdale made me so happy.

Believe it or not, one of the reasons I chose to stay at the Firesky Resort for my mini-vacation was due to its proximity to Yogurtland - Only 0.3 miles!

Anyway, I had a lot of not-so-great food experiences in Scottsdale but Yogurtland made it all better.  This location has surprisingly fresh toppings.  I hate it when raspberries are mashed up, cheesecake pieces are stuck together, and yogurt chips are mixed with white chocolate chips.  Not the case here. This location is immaculate and very organized.

If Yogurtland were a man, I'd marry him.
