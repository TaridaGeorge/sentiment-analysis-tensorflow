SO much fun on a Saturday night. There is such an awesomely diverse crowd here--"cowboys", true-western folk, young pretty girls, old loving couples, 20-something preppy boys, etc. It seems as though everybody comes here for a good time.

The Rusty Spur is pretty small--so be prepared to feel crowded. But if you don't mind that, give it a try--fun music, fun dancing, fun night!!
