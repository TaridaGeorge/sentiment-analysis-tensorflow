I love you FEZ! If I wasn't married I might just move in with you. This place has "it" down. They have the wow factor and keep it going. The menu is diverse and has some really different items that are fantastic! They are vegetarian friendly, too. I love going out and having options. Happy hour is stellar (both food and drink specials- 2 for one or major discounts). We fill up on appetizers usually. We've always had great service and the waitstaff are FUNNY! 
This is a very "gay friendly" restaurant, but you always will find a diverse crowd here. Priced as it should be, great ambiance and clean. 
The dining room can feel a bit cramped at times, so I recommend the loungy area to the back, the bar, or patio. 
Thanks Fez, you have never let me down.
