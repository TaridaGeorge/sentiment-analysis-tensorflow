I have been going here for years! I love the owner, he always greets us by name! That is hard to find in a city of this size. The food is AWESOME! I mean I drive at least once a week to eat here and I don't live nearby. There are tons of other gyros places between me and this place and I will not stop at any of them. Don't get this one confused with Chicago Gyros at 59th and 101 in the FRY's shopping center. Not the same one or owners. Their food is bad, THIS one is the bomb!
