My husband and I drove out there from San Diego for our anniversary trip. He grew up in Scottsdale so he enjoyed showing me around.  The hotel was very nice and up to date.  The pool area is fun too and the drinks at the pool are good.  The staff treated us very well.  I defintely recommend it, but just beware that it is a drive to Scottsdale or Phoenix.
