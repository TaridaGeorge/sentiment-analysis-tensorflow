We have been here a few times since it has opened. It of course is a nice clean new store that is easy to navigate. The folks here are helpful and are more than willing to stock what you need if they do not yet have it. The prices are in line with the rest of these kinds of stores. The location is now the closest to our home so they will see a lot of us as we love to spend money on things for our home that we do not need. 

You might miss this store as it is behind the new McDonalds on Estrella Parkway.
