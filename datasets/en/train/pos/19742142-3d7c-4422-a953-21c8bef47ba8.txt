Excellent coffee shop. I'm a particular fan of the Caramel Mocha, as well as the fantastic breakfast burrito. Great ambiance, extremely friendly people, and always good music being played, whether it's live or recorded. Check out the open mic night on Thursdays and the various artists they feature on many Fridays. My favorite coffee shop in the area, bar none!
