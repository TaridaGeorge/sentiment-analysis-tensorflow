What a cool neighborhood burger joint! I don't know why anyone who lives anywhere near here would ever go to a fast food chain. The food at Shortys is so good and the prices are perfect (you can get very full for under six bucks!). On top of that they are owned and operated by some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet from right in the neighborhood. Last of all is the atmosphere, you know you're in an all-American hot rod hang out before you even walk in the door because there is always a beautiful car parked outside. Chevrolets, Roadsters, Wagons, you name it and you'll have a chance to see it on any given day at Shotys Sliders & Steak Burgers.
