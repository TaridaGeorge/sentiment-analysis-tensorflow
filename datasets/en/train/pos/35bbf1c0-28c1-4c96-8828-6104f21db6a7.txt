Local love at its finest. This place...wow... seriously. What else can i say. pleease make your way here and enjoy a little stroll along the beatifully decorated paths and alleys. The garden will teach you so much about trees and plants and other beauty secrets of the desert. it is a non profit place and you can even get if for free if you get a pass at any of the libraries in the valley. 

Brind your date, bring your kids, this place is soooo nice. we live in the desert and this little oasis can teach us all a thing or two about the environment here... that is if you care about the environment.. (which i really hope you do)

have fun and be safe
