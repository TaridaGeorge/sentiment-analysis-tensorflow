This is my weekly shopping place.. amidst loads of blue hair and a tight fit for this big bear I have to say I just love this place! My weekly food budget is usually around 50 bucks (it's just the 2 of us and we eat out way to much) and I always leave with loads of yummy items! I'd spend twice this at Wild Oats quite easily. 

There are some checkers there that are very easy on the eyes! Always a plus in my book!! Each week holds many surprises for me and our menu.. always look forward to shopping here!!
