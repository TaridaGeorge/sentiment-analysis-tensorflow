I ate at St. Francis last night with some friends.  We tried five of the appetizers, including some kind of fried potato fingers, a pizza thing with figs and prosciutto, a fresh salad, some green beans, a cucumber and tomato mix... I thought I was in heaven.  The fresh baked bread was great too.  

Then came the entrees!  I had the roast chicken.  Some got the pork chop, and burger.  Everything was seasoned to perfection.  We also tried several of the desserts.  My favorite was some kind of caramel-date cake.  Sounds funny, but it was really really good. 

 The service was outstanding, attentive, genuine, not overbearing. Atmosphere is wonderful.  Although it's busy, I was never neglected.  I can't wait to go there again.
