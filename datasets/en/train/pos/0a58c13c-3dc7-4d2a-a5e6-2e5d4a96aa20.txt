I love(d) Sunflower Market!
I had to write this because I am heartbroken that they turned into a SPROUTS! :(

I will miss their deli, and their varying sales from Sprouts! I loved their house brand too! Whether it was nut butter, juice, or chips, never had a complaint.
Great customer service, and I liked how the store was organized. Very easy to find what you're looking for. 
Loved the selection of checkout stand items too. Normally I can't be bothered to notice but there was always a new flavor of Emergen-C packs, or a yummy looking organic local lip balm. 

RIP Sunflower, you will be missed!!
