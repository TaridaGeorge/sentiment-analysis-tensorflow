This is definitely right up there with the top BBQ places in the valley. I ordered the pork loin, which generally isn't the kind of thing I'd judge a barbecue place for, but this was absolutely delicious. The cream corn and banana pudding was pretty good as well.

I'm really looking forward to making it out to that side of town again, to try the brisket and the rest of the menu.
