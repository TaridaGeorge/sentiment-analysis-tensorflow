this is by far my favorite bar in the valley.  the beer is fabulous and they have a fantastic late night menu and drink specials. i love that i can order food until 1am.  we always sit at the bar and have great service, but i can't attest to the service in the rest of the restaurant.   the patio is a great spot to sit and people-watch and relax.
