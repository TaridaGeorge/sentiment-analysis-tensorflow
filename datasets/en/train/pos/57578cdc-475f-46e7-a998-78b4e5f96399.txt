Tried this place for a little change of pace because I was getting bored w my usual go-to salon. I was so happy I went! For 23 dollars I got a great pedicure that included a free hand/arm rub, what?! I was so relaxed. You don't see much for free these days. I wish I had more time because I saw a pedicure on the menu for 28 that included a 45 minute massage, how do they do this!? Will be back. I noticed they have pictures on each desk of the different ways to file nails so you just point to what you want yours to look like, genious! They give discounts for paying cash, and if you make an apt you save 10%, also gave me a coupon for 5 dollars off next time. Found my new nail salon!!
