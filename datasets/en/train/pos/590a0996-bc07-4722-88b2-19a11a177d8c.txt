Most definitely a breath  of fresh air for the area.  New comfy seating, new screens, all digital and best of all none of those annoying Harkins commercials before the previews.

Even better is the wine and beer bar in the center.

Now for the really good news.   Several smaller 30 to 36 seat screens with really comfy seats with food and beer/wine service for only a two buck premium.  In the rear is a one way mirror and private screening area for small groups that want to party.

Hope the concept works out for renewal of the Pavillion coupled with the new Talking Stick Spring Training Facility.
