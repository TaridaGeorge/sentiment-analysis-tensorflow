Truly a slice of heaven....

I was hungry, hadn't had lunch, and quickly popped into Mamma Mia's for a slice.  

It's unfathomable that something so delicious could be so inexpensive.  An enormous slice of NY style pizza for $1.50, plus a quarter per topping.  I was in a mushroom mood, and it was just fabulous.

The sauce and crust are so good -- and it's got just the right amount of cheese -- enough that gives you the "cheese stretchies" that you want, but without impeding the flavors of the toppings and sauce.

I haven't tried their sandwiches or pasta yet -- but I plan on it.

The people working there are also super friendly.

The only thing that is a bummer is that it's pretty small, so don't plan on bringing a big group.  Otherwise, I just can't say enough good things about their pizza!
