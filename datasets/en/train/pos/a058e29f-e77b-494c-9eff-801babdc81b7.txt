Can't believe I never reviewed this particular B Dubs! Being right across the street from my work, I spent many lunch hours here eating Buffalitos or wings, playing trivia and catching up on the previous night's games.  Quite a few Sundays as well since I'm a Bears fan, and my girlfriend loves the Steelers, so we had to end up somewhere we could both catch our games.

Love the Buffalitos! They are tacos, except with grilled chicken and your favorite wing sauce! I usually went with hot, but you almost couldn't go wrong with any flavor.  Served with chips and salsa, it made a great lunch when you didn't feel like gettin messy with the wings.

Now that I have moved to the Chicago area, I'm really gonna miss this place.  Good thing there are B Dubs all over around here as well!
