Oh my god. My heart just melts for this place. Just the best customer service from these ppl... The guy and girl who take our orders always remember what it is we order down to the garnish we always request. They have great pad Thai, chicken pang curry to die for, and yummy house fried rice!  The best Thai food place, and the best little ppl running that joint.
