Been here 4 times and everytime I've enjoyed what I've had. Very local and fresh, kind of a hipster type of place. Local art on the wall, wait staff seems stoned, and the mango tea, is addictive. PESTO PIZZA add chicken is the BOMB!!! Do not come here with out ordering the cilantro/jalapeno hummus......orgasmic!!! I would pay big money for that receipe!!!
