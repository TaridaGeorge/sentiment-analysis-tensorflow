First time customer and i was completely wowed! First the place is very nice and inviting. I had a cut and shave which ran me $45 and was completely worth every penny. The lady that did it took her time and ensured that I was satisfied with the harcut. For he shave (ive had shaves before but nothing like this). She once again took her time and trimmed my goatee then did the shave and she kept feeling to make sure my face was smooth all over. The warm towels (3 of them I think at different times) felt very soothing as did the massage with the after shave lotion... Gotta love the shoulder and neck massage plus the shampoo and style... I left feeling like a million bucks. Will definitely go back and they have a customer for life!
