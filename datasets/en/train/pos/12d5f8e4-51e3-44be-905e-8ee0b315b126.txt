Rockfish is one of the many restaurants near the Chandler Mall.  I'd have to say it's one of the better ones in the sea of chain restaurants that is Chandler.  It has a kind of fishing lodge feel to it.

I love the Mexican Shrimp Martini for an appetizer and the Po Boy (shrimp of course) for a main meal.  

I never go to Rockfish for dinner on a Friday or Saturday night.  It's packed and you have to wait FOREVER.  If you are lucky you snag a place at the bar and eat from the menu.  

They have a nice outdoor area too that would be great in the wintertime.  Big fireplace
