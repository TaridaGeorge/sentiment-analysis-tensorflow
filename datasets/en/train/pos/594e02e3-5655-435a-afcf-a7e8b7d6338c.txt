I stopped in today on my lunch break and had an amazing $10 manicure with Tracy. This salon is right next to Sprouts and opened two months ago. I will definitely be a repeat customer. I am going back tonight for a pedicure with a hot stone massage for only $18. Great price, great location, great service. VERY impressed!
