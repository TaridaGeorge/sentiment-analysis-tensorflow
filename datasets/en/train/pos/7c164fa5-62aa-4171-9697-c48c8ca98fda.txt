I love it here this is my favorite local place to stay, very clean rooms and staff goes out of there way to take care of your needs, casino is on par with most Arizona casinos, do love cafe 87 for liver and onions over all kinda pricier for room cost and there is a fifteen dollar resort fee added on to rate
