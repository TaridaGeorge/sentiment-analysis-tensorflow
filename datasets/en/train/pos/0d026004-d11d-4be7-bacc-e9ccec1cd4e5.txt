What a great find.  We enjoyed our evening last night (Mardi Gras)  - everything was perfect.  The appetizer Shrimp Tacos are to die for - outstanding cocktails and a small but perfect choice of wines.  Then came the FILET... heavenly.  All of this in a cozy downtown atmosphere.  Worth every penny (and I spent less of them then expected!)
