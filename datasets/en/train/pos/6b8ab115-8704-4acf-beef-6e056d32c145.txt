I came here with three friends, and we should have made a reservation! I think we waited about 40 minutes because we wanted a table outside. It was worth the wait. The place has a great atmosphere and a large patio in the back.  The back patio has a lot of trees, nice lighting, candles, and a fireplace. 

This place is a little on the expensive side, but all of us enjoyed our food and it is worth it for the ambiance. I had the Howie Burger, which is a gourmet burger with gruyere (which is a cheese), caramelized onions, and Dijon sauce. It was delicious! The hostess and server were both friendly. The server even asked us if we wanted separate checks, which was refreshing and made things easy! I will definitely be back.
