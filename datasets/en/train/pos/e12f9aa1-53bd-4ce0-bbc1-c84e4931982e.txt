Not sure where to begin with this place, but I'm soon moving from Tempe and I'll be missing this place as much as anywhere else. Every Pasty I've had is delicious, and I am particular to the Cajun Chicken. My wife always gets the Veggie Cottage Pie, and swears by it.

The atmosphere is fantastic for a casual dinner and drinks with wife, sig other, or friends. Has a decent import selection for drinks (not large, but well ranged). The wait staff is always friendly. My first return trip to Tempe will lend itself to a trip or two here. One of the few unique and home grown places in Tempe that are worth a visit.
