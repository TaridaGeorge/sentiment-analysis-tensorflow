This place was excellent!! The food was delish! I had the skirt steak salad and would order it again. The service was good, especially considering we had a group of 20. 
The drinks were good, bartender knew what they were doing. 

The place has a fun atmosphere to it.

I'll definatly be coming back next time I'm in Arizona.
