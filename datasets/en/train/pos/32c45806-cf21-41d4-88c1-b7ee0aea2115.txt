Best Pho I've ever had, hands down.  I won't pretend to be a Pho connoisseur but I do know good food when I taste it.  I've only been here a handful of times but I've noticed with every visit, I crave it a little more thereafter.  In fact, I'm craving it now and it's only 8 a.m.  I once heard that in Vietnam they actually eat Pho for brunch...

One of the greatest things about Pho Thanh is the build it yourself spring rolls!  It comes with a stack of rice paper, a bowl of water for dipping, a plate of meat and a massive mound of greens, limes and vegetables.  Throw it in, roll it up and dip it in fish or soy sauce, oh so good!

Can't wait to go back!!!
