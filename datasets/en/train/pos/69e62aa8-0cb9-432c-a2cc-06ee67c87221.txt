BBQ is offered on weekends - AMAZING food.  I can't say enough.  We have had several items on the bbq menu, and everything was awesome.  Homemade style, quality ingredients, large portions, great great flavor all around.  I'm so glad to have discovered this place! Thanks Laveen Cash Mob for bringing it to my attention.  

The owner Mary also has ice cream, clothing, and other items, in addition to the standard water and ice.  Her water goes through multiple reverse osmosis filters - it's a quality system.  I'll be going back again and again.

My review got filtered?  I don't really know what that means, but anyway, this place is wonderful.  I hope she gets enough business to stick around for a really long time.
