Marriott's have their pristine reputation for a reason. I learned this after receiving a facial at their Spa a few months ago. My aesthetician, Melanie, had healing hands. She was very in-tune with my needs as a guest, and made sure to explain in fine detail the procedures of the treatment, and how it was beneficial for my skin. The music was soothing, the lavender aroma sensational, and accommodations from the staff never-ending. I can't wait to visit the Spa again soon. Although the treatments are a little expensive, it is certainly worth it. Make sure to book your appointments with Melanie, she is fantastic!
