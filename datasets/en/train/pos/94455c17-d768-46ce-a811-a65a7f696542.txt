We had bough a groupon for this place and wow it was such a great buy! I went with my husband and we were both amazed at the food, atmosphere and great service. 

Darius was our server and made everything great! He was very knowledgeable and created a laid back atmosphere to enjoy a romantic evening out.

Both of our dishes were delish, I had the Linguini Lucina (linguini and calamari) and he had the Pork Saltimbocca (pork prosciutto and cream cheese with penne pasta) 

I cant wait to return and would recommend any one to try it out :)
