Great food, great service, great ambiance! Had the signature Indulge Burger--- I cannot stop thinking about it.  The meat was fresh, the bun was delicious and the sauce---yum! My Husband had a turkey burger. He is such a picky eater and he loved it. So many options on the menu and the food tastes so fresh.  Service was great; the staff was very attentive. Have been back three times in one week.  Very affordable for the quality and quantity. A must try!
