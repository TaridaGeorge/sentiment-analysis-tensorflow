Great place to purchase kitchen gadgets. They have EVERYTHING here. Things I can't find at Ikea, Cost Plus, Target, etc. can always turn up at Sur La Table. There is a myth that things here are overpriced, and that is bunk. If you compare the same item at SLT and say Target, they will be about the same, thing is SLT really only carries high end products, whereas at other places you can pay a lower price by purchasing off-brand crap.

Great selection of Shun knives (they have other brands too but I'm partial to Shun.)
