Had water damage at my new office this past summer during one of our big rainstorms.  I called AZ Hydropro and within 3 hours they were there working on a Saturday no less.  We had around 800-1000sq ft of water damage including seepage 3 feet up the dry wall, and within 72 hours the floors and walls were bone dry.  Best of all you couldn't even tell they had been there.  Truly amazing customer service and quality.  Would highly recommend them to anyone!
