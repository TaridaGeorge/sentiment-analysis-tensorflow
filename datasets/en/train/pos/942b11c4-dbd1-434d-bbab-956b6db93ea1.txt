Based on this previous review I called Cheshire Cat and talked to the owner Paul about a termite track I found.  He gave me a free tip to help see if they were new or old and they were old.

However I said come on out anyways and take a look.
He looked and found a new tube nearby and showed me a LIVE termite hiding in a mud-tube.  Yes... I'll take that treatment now...

Paul came out and did the treatment as advertised.
He was polite, clean, knowledgeable and fast.

Recommended highly.
