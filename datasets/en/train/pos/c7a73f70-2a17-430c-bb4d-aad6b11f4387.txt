Ok, you know you love a place when you've been there twice in one week.  The first time I went I got the Fresh Island Green Salad and Fried Imperial Rolls.  The second time: the Curry Apple Tofu and the Fried Imperial Rolls.  (As you can tell I adore the rolls!)  What I love about this place is that they give a generous amount of food AND it's good!  A lot of veggie places go a little too far with the "portion control" lol!  The presentation is thoughtful and creative.  The man who takes your order is friendly and playful too.  This place definitely is an instant fave :)
