I'm torn with this place because i love it so much but dislike it for certain things so I'm going to stay positive because the things i don't like can be a personal thing about the music they allow in there 

it has a HELL a lot of beers 
it has a grand selection of wine 
it has no food, but who need food when you've eatn before going to the LOST LEAF 
the music is a hit and miss 
some days a very kool unique style and other days not good 

and i think this is why i sometimes have a problem with the music is because with all the great local musicians out in phoenix it should be easier to play this place but it isn't...
