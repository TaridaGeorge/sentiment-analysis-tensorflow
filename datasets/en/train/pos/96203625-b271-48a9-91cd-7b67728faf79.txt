I will admit that this place looks like a place to avoid on the outside. The inside, however, is adorable! I love the dragon decorations above the booths and the lights.

The food is very reasonably priced. The line takes some time if there are people in front of you, but it is definitely worth the wait. There is not a ton to chose from on the buffet, but it sure beats all of the other chinese buffets in Phoenix (But is probably a lot worse for you if you care about that). I highly recommend it if you are a fan of chinese buffets!
