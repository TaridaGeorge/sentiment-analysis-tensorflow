Downtown Scottsdale is one of the few areas in the Phoenix area that lends itself well to walking. And every Thursday evening from 7-9 pm for the past 30 years (except on Thanksgivings), that's exactly what art-lovers in Scottsdale have been doing. Walking. 

The over 100 art galleries along Main St., Marshall Way, and throughout Old Town participate, many with artist receptions, hosing one giant, informal open house. Several times during the year, look for special themed Art Walks with live music and entertainment.

The perfect way to get out and see Scottsdale!
