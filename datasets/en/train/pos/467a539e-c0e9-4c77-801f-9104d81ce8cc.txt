Wow, I usually don't completely disagree with all the other reviews but I had a totally different experience in here.

Shopping for a washer/dryer/fridge for a new house...had already been to depot to compare prices and stopped at the best buy across the street from this lowe's to compare there too.   Best buy has probably the worst service on the planet, so I pretty much just made notes on models and prices from there but didn't get any good information only spoke to one guy there who had no knowledge of really anything..

Went across the street to this lowes and was helped by Henry.  He was really top notch, very knowledgeable and helpful.  Since the prices were inline and they had a labor day sale period going on I bought all three appliances on the spot here.
