I'm not a big fan of sushi and never really wanted to try it, but after I had eaten here I'm a huge fan. The sushi was amazing and everything tasted great. The price is a little much but it is totally worth it. The atmosphere is good and the place is totally clean. Everyone is super friendly. Overall a great place to eat.
