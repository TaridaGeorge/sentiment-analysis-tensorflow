Oh I'm in love and I didn't even try the pizza.

The fam and I ate here for my brother's birthday last week. I remember walking in and thinking I wasn't really in the mood for pasta..then a plate of italian flat bread was placed in front of me and the rest of the night was a complete blur. 
All I remember was drinking wine, eating bread, drinking wine, antipasto salad, ooo calamari fritti! more wine, delicious chicken special,more wine, tiramisu. All fabulous, all scrumptious. I want to eat here every day, and I want that chicken thing I ate. But I can't remember what it was called. Sorry. 
I will be back.
