Took my boyfriend here for lunch as we were 'on our own' for lunch on my recent visit. I had the Turkey Breast & Brie and he had the Grilled Turkey Pastrami. I must admit when I saw his sandwich I was jealous and unsure of mine, but alas - they were both delicious! 

Well, actually I never got to taste his because he didn't share, but it looked amazing and he didn't speak much so we'll say that he agrees. 

We were here at an off-peak time on a Friday so it wasn't crowded and the wait wasn't very long to get our food. I think it's a great gourmet sandwich place with bakery items and coffee which is a great  alternative to fast food and the couple of restaurants in the center.  I'm sure the locals who work in the area frequent it often!
