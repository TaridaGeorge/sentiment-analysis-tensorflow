RC without a doubt is the best steakhouse I have ever been to.   I have dined at over ten of their locations.    Never let down, always the best from start to finish.  The steaks are served on a 500 degree plate and the taste  is unbelievable.   The prices are high, but the whole experience is worth it.   Staff is super friendly,  my only complaint is,  I don't get to go as much as we used to.
