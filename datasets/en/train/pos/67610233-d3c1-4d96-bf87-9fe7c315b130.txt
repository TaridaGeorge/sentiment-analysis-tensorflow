Camus is a cute little trendy bar/restaurant located in the Clarendon hotel.  I came here for a business lunch awhile ago and really enjoyed it.  We were one of two tables though, so service was top notch.  Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and was able to answer any and all questions we had.

The chef even came out to say a hello, which I found to be impressive.  The calamari app was excellent and my dish of mushroom gnocchi was amazing. I definitely recommend this place!
