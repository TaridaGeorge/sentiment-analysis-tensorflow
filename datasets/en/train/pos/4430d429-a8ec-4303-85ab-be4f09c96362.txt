I love Tempe Marketplace and frequent it regularly.  It has many dining, shopping, and entertainment options.  It is an outdoor mall and in the summer there are misters and in the winter heat lamps and a large fire pit.  It has stores that are usually only found in malls such as Tilly's, American Eagle, and Victoria's Secret, but also freestanding stores such as Target, Best Buy, and Ulta.  There are a large variety of restaurants and a Harkin's Movie Theater as well.  It is a great place to hang out with friends and see the local night life!
