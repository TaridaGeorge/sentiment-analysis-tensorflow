I've been into Whitey's Auto Repair twice recently, and both times they were extremely helpful and very fairly priced. The only downside is the place is often crowded, but I'm not surprised considering how good their customer service is.  As a single young woman, I often hate dealing with mechanics since I always feel like I'm about to get screwed, but I definitely didn't have to worry about that with these guys.  It was a great feeling, and I'd recommend them to anyone.
