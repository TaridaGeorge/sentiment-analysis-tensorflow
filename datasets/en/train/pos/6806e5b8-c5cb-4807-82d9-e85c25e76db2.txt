OMG!  This is hands down the best pho in Phoenix.  Better than Maxim, better than Da Vang by far!  The portions are huge (take note staff of Central King Eggroll in Avondale, send someone down here so you can see how it SHOULD be done!!)

The large Pho with filet mignon is melt in your mouth.  The broth is heavenly and they give you TONS of basil, cilantro and lime.

I had to pinch myself when I first ate here, I swore I was eating in the Westminster/Garden Grove, CA area.  

This place is a MUST for all pho-addicts!
