ATC brings professional theater to Tucson and Phoenix!  We are so fortunate to have such a wonderful organization at our finger tips.  I have seen several shows and have never been disappointed.  Most recently I saw [title of show].  I think that it was my favorite thus far.  I was even fortunate to go on a night that included an opportunity to speak with the writers.  I love that they offer extras like that.  They seem to have lots of educational opportunities.
