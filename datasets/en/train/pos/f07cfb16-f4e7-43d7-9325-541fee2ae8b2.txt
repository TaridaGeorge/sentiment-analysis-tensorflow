Absolutely amazing!! I have nothing bad to say about this place. Everything is fresh and local, and the service is fantastic! Outdoor seating is lovely too.

I ordered the tacos. They were YUMMY! My friends ordered the salads, which they claimed were amazing and just as yummy as my tacos. 

Make sure to get a pitcher of the sangria as well. Some of the best sangria I've had.

MUST GO.
