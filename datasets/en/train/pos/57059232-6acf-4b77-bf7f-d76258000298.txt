I do most of my grocery shopping at the Pinnacle Peak/Pima AJ's, but occassionally shop at the store on FLW and TPP. There are differences between the stores. The Pinnacle Peak store opened before the FLW store, and doesn't have the darker wood feel (which is OK with me). The butchers at the Pinnacle Peak store do a better job of cutting meat the way I like it. They also regularly carry heirloom tomatos, while the FLW store oddly does not. But they do have stogies!
