Unfortunately, I've had to take my son here a couple of times.  Once for a scorpion sting and the other two for stitches.  Everytime we were checked in and seen promptly.  The staff has always been friendly and always had cute ways of making my son comfortable considering the circumstances.  This is a far better option than a typical ER or Urgent Care!
