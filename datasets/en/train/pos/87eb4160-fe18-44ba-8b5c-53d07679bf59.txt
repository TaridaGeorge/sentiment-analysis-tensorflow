Went back to Berge again for some service and once again they did an amazing job! Christian helped me in the service department and let me know all of my options before performing any work. These guys really are great! You do pay more for having work done at the dealership than an independent shop but that is expected especially when you drive a foreign car and I wouldn't go anywhere else for major servicing with my Volkswagen.
