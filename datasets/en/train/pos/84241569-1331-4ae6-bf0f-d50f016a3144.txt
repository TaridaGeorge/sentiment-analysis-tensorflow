5 stars for making gluttony feel so damn good

Apparently the holiday dinner was not enough food for me because I woke up the next morning and felt the need to over-eat again. Naturally, I went to soup-plantation. 

When I got there, I saw that they had misspelled soup plantation, and was a bit distressed. Upon entry though, I saw that everything was as it should be. 

Where else can I get awesome buffet style food at prices that any good ol' pre-diabetic overeating and underpaid american can appreciate? 

Ceaser salad? yummy.
Pasta? Splendid
Pizza? Fucktastically addicting
Stomach? Distended
Me? Happy as a cow (pun intended)

Another perfect meal at the soup plantation AKA sweet tomatoes.
