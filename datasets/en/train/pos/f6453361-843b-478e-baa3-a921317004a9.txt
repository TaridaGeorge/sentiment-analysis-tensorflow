Soooo this location is even better than the one in Superstition Springs. They also have a play place, which is pretty cool. I ordered the deluxe chicken and it was simply amazing. Fantastic service as well. I ordered and set my stuff down and within a couple minutes my food was brought out to me with a smile. Very polite staff, and delicious food.... what more could one ask for? I totally wish Chick-fil-A would sell thier Chick-fil-A sauce by the bottle cuz it's sooo good
