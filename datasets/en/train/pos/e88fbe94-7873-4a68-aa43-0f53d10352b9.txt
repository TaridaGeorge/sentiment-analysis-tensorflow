I travel for work and eat out almost everyday of my life (since 2003) ... and I asked myself, "What the heck is a pasty... and am I even pronouncing it right?" Well I have eaten here maybe 6 or so times and have come to love the pasty. The Pilgrim is my favorite, it's like Thanksgiving dinner rolled into a little hot pocket. The staff is typically college students with plenty of tattoos and piercings, and the service is so-so, but the food is awesome! Go.
