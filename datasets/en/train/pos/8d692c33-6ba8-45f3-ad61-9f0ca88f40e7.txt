Phoenix Dermatology is awesome.  The entire clinic is run very well.  The receptionists are always very friendly and personable, and they always make sure things are running correctly and taking care of any business with insurance.   They are also super friendly on the phone when calling with questions or scheduling appointments. Wait time in the office is also short.

Dr. Darren West is also a great doctor - he's super friendly and spends a fair amount of time with you to make sure you know exactly what your treatment entails.  I never felt like I was being rushed so he could see another patient.  

And when it's time to leave, the front desk has all the paperwork ready for you!
