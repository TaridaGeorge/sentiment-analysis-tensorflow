Stumbled upon this place while on a break at the ASU Downtown campus. It's so hard to find a place to settle in and hang out for a while without the entire valley knowing your secret. 

I ordered a decaf honey vanilla latte. delish! i wish i loved tea. the service setup looks delightful! 

cash only. good luck parking. don't bother me if my headphones are in. :)
