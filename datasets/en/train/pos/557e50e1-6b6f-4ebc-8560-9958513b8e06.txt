Took our little mop in to be clipped and groomed and was amazed at the popularity and level of service. 

Staff were very friendly and knowledgeable.  They did a fantastic job, see for yourself at the before/after pictures on yelp.   Each of the dogs waiting to be picked up looked primed and ready for display.  

I was amazed at the number of dogs being dropped off they all seemed to be known by the staff and long time customers.  

Our little bundle of joy was clean, clipped and ready to go.  We will be back.
