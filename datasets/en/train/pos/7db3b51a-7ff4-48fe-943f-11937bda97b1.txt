Ok...I've always liked Bloom, but now I remember why!  We took two out of town relatives there for dinner on Saturday night and they couldn't stop talking about the place.  To be fair, dinner was quite tasty - we enjoyed the calamari appetizer and the shrimp with garlic spaetzle.  For dinnner, their market fish was absolutely amazing.  

I almost always use this place with out of town visitors - it is quiet enough to hear everyone, but not so stuffy that you can't be yourself.  

Our server was fantastic as well!  I can't say enough good stuff about this place!
