Wow!  So fun!  if you can't find a gift for a gal pal HERE you can't find it anywhere!  I wandered in looking for a Grad gift.  Found that, PLUS a gift for a wedding and a new Mom!  Bling and handpainted stemware and fun chatchke"s. Price range is whatever you are willing to spend - I was super happy with my selection and stayed IN budget  I LOVE this place.  My new to-to for gifts!  Check it out or it will be gone!
