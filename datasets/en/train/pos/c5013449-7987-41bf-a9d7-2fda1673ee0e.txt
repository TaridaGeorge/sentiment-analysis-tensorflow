I've done business with other places in the past but never again. These guys here are honest and fair. We're having several things done right now and it brings a comforting feeling to feel I am dealing with honest people. I will update with details when we get the car back.

UPDATE: jeep is back and running great! Doug is a very fair and friendly guy. Thank you for all you did to help us. He went above and beyond. That's an awesome feeling! Hopefully, we won't need him before our oil needs to be changed again, but if we do, this is where we'll go!
