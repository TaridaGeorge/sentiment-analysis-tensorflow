We got there around 530pm on saturday and there was no wait. by 6pm, the line was out the door and probably an hour wait. so we got really lucky this time. we split a fried tofu (yum!) then i ordered the beef udon soup (very hardy and filling) and the g/f had the seafood noodles (fresh and no fishy at all) washed it down with some nigori. total was like $45. pricing was reasonable especially since it was enough soup for both of us to have the next day for lunch. food was terrific. would go back and would recommend!
