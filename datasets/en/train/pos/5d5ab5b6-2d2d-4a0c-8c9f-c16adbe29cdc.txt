Karsen's Grill is the greatest little joint in Scottsdale.  Fabulous burgers, great sandwiches and surprisingly good salads.  It's really small, but you'll feet like an old-timer on your first visit.  Very pleasant staff.   I used to live live in Scottsdale and was a regular customer.  I miss Karsen's Grill!
