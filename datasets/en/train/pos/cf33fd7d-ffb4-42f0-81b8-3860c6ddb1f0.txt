What is there to say about this place that hasn't already been said? Well first off, they need to bring the spicy beef Pattie's back!!! Seriously!

The Tilapia Pattie is fantastic. Plantain Avocado spring rolls are good as well. Festivals are great as well, but save them for a desert.

Jerk chicken and shrimp? Its a staple here. Get it, its good. Spicy so "Watch your mouth!" 

Escovitch Fish can't be beat for a downtown fish dish. Its runner up for best sleeper dish on the menu.

And....the award for best sleeper of the menu.....

Brown stew chicken! Come get some! It is a fantastic "total" dish. Expect to see an empty plate when you are done. The entire dish is delightful. 

The only downer: The BYOB seems a little steep if drinking individual beers...but I guess that just means bring a six pack at a time...hah...
