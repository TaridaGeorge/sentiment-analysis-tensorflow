I have been training with Jason for two years now. I have only the highest compliments for his personal training abilities and his studio. The gym is located in a home in an upscale Scottsdale neighborhood. I love the gym because it has all of the equipment you would ever need in a one-on-one, quiet and relaxed environment. Jason is extremely friendly and takes the time to individualize a training program that matches one's specific goals. I have seen tremendous gains as a result of Jason's consistent and dedicated training regimen. I cannot emphasize enough what a positive, likable and knowledgeable guy he is. Also, his personal training fee is a fraction of what I have paid for through the years at other gyms. I would highly recommend Jason as a personal trainer to anyone who wants results and personalized attention in a quiet, relaxed and professional environment.
