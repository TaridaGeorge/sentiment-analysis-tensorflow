This is my new favorite place!  You will love their ramen. My favorite is the Republic Ramen which is spicy but addicting as well. The Miso Ramen is great  if you don't like spicy and the Tonkotsu Ramen is delicious if you like a more sweet milky flavored broth. You can add whatever vegetables and extras you want to. The gyoza is great but I prefer mine steamed and they are able to accommodate that if you request it. The staff couldn't be more friendly. The service is fast. Don't miss out on the Boba tea. I get the Thai milk tea with boba, it is perfect. I am so happy this place exists.
