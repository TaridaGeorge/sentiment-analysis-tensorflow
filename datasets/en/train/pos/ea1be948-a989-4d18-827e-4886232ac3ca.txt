I chose this Dr. Wyatt for two reasons.

1) reviews on yelp said it was great
2) it's very close to my house

And I'm so glad that I did.  I had my second appointment today, and while having some dental work done, I was able to watch Dumb and Dumber.  You just can't beat that.  Period.

Oh, and they had a lisitng of more that 50 movies to choose from.  Kind of like karaoke.  And I was numb enough to not feed a darn thing.  Very pleasant.. yes!  Pleasant experience for a dentist appointment.
