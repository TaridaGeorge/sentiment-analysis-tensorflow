Went for a lunch for a friend's birthday. It was my first time here and I loved it. I had the sweet potato fries which came with a maple syrup dipping sauce - amazing! I also had the thai chicken pizza - this was sooo good. Love the crunchy crust.

Our waiter took very good care of us and when he noticed my Australian accent he introduced me to their server who was also Australian. It was really nice to chat with her and I appreciated that personal touch.

We also got a delicious chocolate souffl√© to share for my friend's birthday. Came with a happy birthday message written on the plate in cocoa - nice touch.

All in all a great experience and delicious food. I'll be back!
