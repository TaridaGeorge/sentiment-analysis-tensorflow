I love winter in Phoenix. The cold, the rain, the clouds -- I LOVE CLOUDY DAYS.

I don't like what winter brings with it, though -- Uggs.
Seriously, girls, you looking fucking ridiculous. It's 55 outside and you're wearing huge furry boots. If you tried that shit somewhere up north when it was 55 degrees, you'd get laughed out of town.

I get it. You think they look cool and you're dying to wear them. But you know what? You live in Arizona. You don't get to wear huge, fuzzy boots. Get over it.
