Let me start this by saying, Every single sushi restaurant I have been to in Phoenix SUCKS! The rice doesnt stick, the rolls fall apart and they are BLAND!
My Suggestion: Cherry Blossom Roll & Sweet Thang!

Our waitress was VERY helpful! She told us her favorites and any house specials immediatly! We ordered and watched our rolls being made on the T.V. behind the chef's. My daughter got a kick out of that!! 

It is a small establishment but it does allow the owner to be more in tuned with the customers. He walks arounds, greets all customers and even takes orders if the place is busy. He learned it was our first time and made sure we were pleased with EVERYTHING! We also got to try the Fried Cheesecake with Chocolate Sauce...talk about Super YUMMY!

Amazing food! 
Amazing Service! 
Inexpensive!
