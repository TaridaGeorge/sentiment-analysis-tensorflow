Still 5 stars.  Grimaldi's defines customer service.  This is a place that cares about their customers and they bend over backwards to make sure you know they care.  I've been going here for years and I've NEVER had a bad experience.  It's not just the service, but the awesome pizza that keeps me coming back.
