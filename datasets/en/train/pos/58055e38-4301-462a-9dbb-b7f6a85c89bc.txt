Oh Cracker Barrel I am so upset at how close I live to you! I think it's cute to see the older folks sitting outside on the rocking chairs and playing with their awesome oversize checkers. The little store inside is wonderfully nostalgic and a great distraction for when you're super hungry and waiting. I love getting their pot roast dinner, as for breakfast their pancakes are amazing! They give you a hot bottle of syrup and don't forget to ask for some apple butter!
