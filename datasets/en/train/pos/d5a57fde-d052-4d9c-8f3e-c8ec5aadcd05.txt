This is probably the nicest course I've ever played on.  The 9th hole pin placement was really something and almost impossible, and that made it fun.  The views are amazing, and the greens are as lush as I've ever seen.  Would not have guessed they'd be that green in AZ.  I would definitely play this course again!
