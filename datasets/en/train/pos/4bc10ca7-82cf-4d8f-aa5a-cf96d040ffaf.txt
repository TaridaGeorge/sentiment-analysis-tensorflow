Midtown Grill is the perfect addition to the new scene on Upper King. Great food, great hours... open till 2:00 AM! and a fun low-key environment that everyone will enjoy!  Be sure to check out the back patio, perfect for warm summer nights or a cool lowcountry evening with friends! Chef James' food is incredible, try the boiled peanut hummus!
A must do for locals and tourists alike!
