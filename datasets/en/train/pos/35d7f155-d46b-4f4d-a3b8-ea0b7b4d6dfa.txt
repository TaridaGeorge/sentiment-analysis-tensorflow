I ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place! Their Lebanese Chicken is the best thing on the menu, that has me hooked on them! The salad is always fresh, the chicken cooked to perfection--never too dry or overcooked, the pita is always fresh, and best of all, GREAT customer service--the owner is the sweetest person you will ever meet! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place, and don't mind paying what I pay for great food and service!!
