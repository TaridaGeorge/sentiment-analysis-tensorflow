My favorite frozen yogurt in Scottsdale. Plenty of flavors to choose from, so the challenge is to choose which one of the several you want to get, not which one do I really want (unless you are into mixing it up!). Good, fresh toppings and cool, biodegradable spoons. I just hope my Hello Kitty spoons (limited time only, and that time has passed) don't degrade. Sure, the interior is a ripoff of pinkberry, but what matters, the yogurt, is good stuff.
