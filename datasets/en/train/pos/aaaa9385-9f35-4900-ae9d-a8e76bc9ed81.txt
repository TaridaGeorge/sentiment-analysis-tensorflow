Traveling all the way from New York, and experiencing the INSANE lines at "Starbuck's" in the "BIG APPLE," this location is fabulous in both service, quality of my Soy Frapp, and out within a reasonable amount of time...not sure what the rush was for one particular reviewer in Arizona; however, I've received nothing but quick, cordial service with a smile each time this entire week early morning! Love it!  He wouldn't make it in NY Starbuck's that's for sure!! Haa! Haa! I tip my hat off to the friendly staff at this location! Thank you and I will be back soon!
