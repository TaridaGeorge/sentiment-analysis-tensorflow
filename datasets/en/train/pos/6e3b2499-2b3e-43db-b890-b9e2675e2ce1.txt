So happy to discover this wonderful restaurant. We ate lunch today and both enjoyed a terrific Pad Thai and the Jalepeno Curry. The perfect amount of heat. The lunch special came with soup or salad so we tried one of each and they were both attention getters - I would have been content to eat just the soup - it was that good! The service was spot on too - very friendly and they even opened the door for us. We will be back and I encourage you to give it a try.
