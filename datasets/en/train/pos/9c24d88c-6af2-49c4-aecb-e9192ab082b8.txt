We have had lunch here a few times recently and it's been wonderful.  Food reminds me of Italy and the service is super.  I love their lasagna but everything we've tried has been outstanding.  The waiters know their menu and food which is a plus.  Even the bread basket was yum, simple but delicious.  The patio is charming and has a good feel, you don't realize the parking lot is just beyond.
