Amazing!! Dr Roach is A+++++. Got on the ground and totally interacted with my boy, never felt rushed. She was over the top informative!! Prices are honest and extremely fair~~ Didnt ever try to sell, just informed. Small town Dr mentality, I  mean that whole heartily  genuine and nice!! The way a Dr should be! She is definitely doing what she LOVES and it shows.
