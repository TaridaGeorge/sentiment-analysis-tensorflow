Not a bad thing about this place. Well, maybe the location is a bit lacking  on views but the food, prices and people are amazing! The Panini's (all 7 of them) are crispy, melty cheesy and full of flavor. The salads are fresh and fill you up and the lunch special #1 of a sandwich and a piece of chocolate cake? How can you resist!  We work close by and go here often.
