BEST wine cafe in Phoenix! No exaggeration. Their 11am-5pm happy hour everyday is unbeatable. Their wine selection is great and if you don't like something, they take it back and help try and suggest something that might be better. The Bruschetta is damn good too. Jenny is the server I always try to get because she is so damn sweet! There is no place like Postino Central.
