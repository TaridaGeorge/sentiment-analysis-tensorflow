I woke up to a soaked carpet. Kevin quickly found the leak was under the slab. When I then found that my HOA covered slab leaks with their own plumber, Kevin gracefully backed out.

I called him back later for a separate problem - a kitchen drain leak; it was quickly fixed by him.

He is knowledgeable, polite, and prompt. Highly recommended.
