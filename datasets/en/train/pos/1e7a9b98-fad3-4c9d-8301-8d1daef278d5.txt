I heart Ruby Tuesday.  I really do.  

It seems like a Chili's or TGIFriday's but it's SO much better that that.  They have an extensive Burger list and all that I have tried were amazing.

I wish that I lived closer to one...or maybe not because then I would go there all of the time.

Also, kudos to them for offering endless fries..not that i have ever been hungry enough to take them up on that...
