I worked out many deals over the years with local dealerships. Some where good, some where bad. I'm not exaggerating when I say Acura of Tempe was the most pleasant experience I ever had! I worked out a deal with Acura of Tempe Internet Sales Manager, Keith Baize. Emailed him about the car I was interested in, he responded right away. We worked out the numbers, he found few extra incentives from Acura and offered me a deal I could not refuse. We even got the financing part done online, so when I came down to Tempe all I had to do was sign few papers and I was out the door in 15 minutes! Keith made the entire process fast, easy, and he never put any pressure or asked for more that he could give. Would strongly recommend!
