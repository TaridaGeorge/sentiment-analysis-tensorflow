I don't give 5 stars.  But tis place gets it because of the consistency in food, service and atmosphere.

Its  very rare place, with pain-in-the-#$% parking.  But there's not much they do about that, especially during ASU football games.

So, last night dined there with 3 80-plus year olds and my wife.  Remarkably, we ate outside because of the ubiquitous heater coverage.

The outstanding food elements were the mussels in chorizo cream sauce and the pumpkin cheesecake.

This is a fit-for-foodies place with a fairly priced wine list that has a pretty deep bench for a smaller place.

Request a table on the patio.  

Nothing to criticize here.  Its one of the Valley's lesser known gems.  Put it on the list and remember the mussels.
