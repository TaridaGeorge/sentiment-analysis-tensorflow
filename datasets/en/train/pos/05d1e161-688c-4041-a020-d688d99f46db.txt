Hi Everybody,

Just a follow-up to my previous review. I'm officially blown away.

Within 24 hours of my posting that review, I got a note from the WCG apologizing for the experience and asking me to come back in. They sent over a gift card and we trucked on over.

I'm happy to say that everything positive from my last review, and the burgers were back to normal. "Normal" meaning "excellent," of course. 

I've never *ever* noted a restaurant performing like this, both in terms of customer service and follow-up, and in terms of their taking ownership of a problem. Of course, it helps a lot that the problem was completely resolved when we went back. :-)

This is my go-to place when I have out of town guests, and it's still our go-to place when we're looking for a quiet wind-down. Kudos!
