Pier 83 is the perfect place to go on a rainy night! Their clam chowder is better than any I have ever tasted and that includes some Alaskan restaurants that boasted having the best in the world. It's thick and creamy as you would expect, but they also know that people want some substance to their soups and so you'll also find nice silver dollar sized chunks of potatoes in your cup ($3.50/cup during Monday Madness) But who wants just a cup of this delicious goodness?! I suggest living a little and going for the sourdough bread bowl. If chowder's not your thing, you can't go wrong with anything else on the menu. Want something on the lighter side? The clam strips are tasty and their side salads are made with beautiful green leaf lettuce rather than iceberg.
