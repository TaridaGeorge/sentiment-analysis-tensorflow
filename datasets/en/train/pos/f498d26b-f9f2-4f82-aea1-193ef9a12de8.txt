The 5 star rating is in comparison to other fast food joints (i.e. Mickey D's, Burger King, J-Box ect. NOT sit-down joints... I would take a Four Peaks burger over I&O any day!)

I usually get grilled cheese with frilled onions, but I have had many a burger here. Fries are really good, but they do not age well, often becoming a little nasty on the ride home (202&Rural to Rural and Apache, not a long drive). Best staff in fast food, best food in fast food. Best burger in the world? Please, go to a real burger joint for that title, not fast food!
