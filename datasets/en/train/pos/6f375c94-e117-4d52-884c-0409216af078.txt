This bakery brought me back to my childhood with one wiff of their delicious pastries and cookies. The fresh cannoli was creamy and the shell melted in my mouth. There were so many delicious choices, but had an old favorite, sfogiatelle. My husband had the chai tea cupcake with lavender frosting. He said the flavors were amazing, one of the best cupcakes he's ever had! We've tried cupcakes from Whole Foods, but why pay $5 for a cupcake when you can get one that's even better for $2.50. They have fresh baked rolls and bread on the weekend. Can't wait for the holidays to try all my holiday favorites. The owner is generous and a sweet lady. Her love and passion shines through her offerings. Her smile could light a city block. Don't miss out on this gem. True Italian bakery, yum!
