My super favorite place for iced teas in the valley. I say this because the teas are loose-leaf and brewed when ordered. There is no packets of tea lying around. 

Also I get a large32oz  pomegranate-green iced tea for only $2.50 compared to that one well know "coffee" place where I can't even get a Venti for that price.
