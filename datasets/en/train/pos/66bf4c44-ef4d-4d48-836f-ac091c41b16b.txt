After reviewing Yelp comments, my husband & I visited last week. We had an amazing dining experience. Service was excellent, cocktails yummy and food delicious. We had lamb shank, babyback ribs (both were fall off the bone) and sides. Green chile mac & cheese was amazing and the roasted asparagus was cooked perfectly. Can't wait to revisit next spring training!!
