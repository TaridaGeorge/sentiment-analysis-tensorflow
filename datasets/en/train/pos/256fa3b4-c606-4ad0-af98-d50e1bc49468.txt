I finally got the chance to eat at Sens for the first time and loved every single dish we ordered which totaled nine plus rice. The Hong Kong dumplings and flat rice were our favorites. Chef Johnny even comes to each table to make sure that you are enjoying your food. Every time I return to Phoenix I will make sure to sample more dishes at this wonderful establishment. Good job Chef!
