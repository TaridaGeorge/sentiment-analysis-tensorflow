I've eaten at PoaF plenty of times, sometimes multiple times in a week, and it is always great each visit. Hands down one of the best BBQ joints i have ever had, and i lived in Georgia for a little while. Going to head there this week to pick up a couple bottles of their BBQ sauce for some homemade fathers day ribs!
