I can sum up Durant's in four statements:

1.  Great steak.
2.  Stiff drinks.
3.  Awesome service.
4.  Relaxing atmosphere.

I come here when I want something very specific.  When I want a slab of meat cooked perfectly to gorge myself on while a perfectly prepared drink sits at my elbow that is so good my liver actually rejoices at its slow and painful demise, both served to me by polite and professional staff in an atmosphere that reminds me of a cross between some 1920's cigar club and a plush VIP room in Vegas, I go to Durant's.

Period.
