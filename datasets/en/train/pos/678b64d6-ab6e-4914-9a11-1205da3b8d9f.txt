What can say? Believe the hype! This mom and pop gem is truly a destination for serenity and great food. Like many others I went with the "Mornin Cristo". It was equally balanced in sweetness and savoryness. I had my egg over-easy  to make it a little more richer. The Spicy Orange Marmalade compliments it perfectly; for those who don't like a sweet and spicy kick you can also eat it with regular syrup. The coffee was smooth and velvety , I didn't even have to use sugar. The service was friendly but not overly bearing. I ate in the courtyard facing the water fountain it was so peaceful. The prices are so low and didn't feel the need to use the 10% check-in offer through Yelp. I will definitely go back here again.
