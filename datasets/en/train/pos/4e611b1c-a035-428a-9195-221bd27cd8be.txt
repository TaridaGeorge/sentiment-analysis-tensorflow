Could Aveda get any better?

They don't test on animals, use organic ingredients and have some of the absolute best hair, skin and body products ever. 

My favorites are the rosemary mint shampoo and conditioner and the clove shampoo and conditioner. They're all really awesome.  Their styling products all work really well and smell great and I think their entire line is priced pretty reasonably for how fantastic the products are.

If you haven't tried Aveda, it's high time you do.  Paying a few bucks more for their products is completely worth it!
