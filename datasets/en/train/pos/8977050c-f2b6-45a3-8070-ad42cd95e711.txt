I have been going for many years and I simply adore BenOra. They treat me so well here. usually I go on Saturdays and I have had the same woman every time. She actually remembers me. Today I went during the week and had another technician just as nice. She was most respectful, gentle, and treated me with the up-most dignity. In today's medical environment of crassness, and impersonal services this is a wonderful jewel in the rough place to go for all your woman's diagnostic needs.
