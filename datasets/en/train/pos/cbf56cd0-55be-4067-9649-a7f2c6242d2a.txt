I've dined here about 20 times and I'm convinced you can't go wrong with any choice: salad, pizza, sandwich, pasta, etc... 
Portions are very generous and moderately price (not included the pizza)
Wait staff has always been great and the atmosphere is unmatched in the phoenix area.
Wine menu is a little weak but you don't go there for the wine.
Plan ahead because the wait can be lengthy.  Forget about calling in an order at 5 on a Sunday, it'll be 2 hours minimum.  Chicken Ceasar Pasta Salad togo is my fav, and at 5.89$ you can't beat that!
