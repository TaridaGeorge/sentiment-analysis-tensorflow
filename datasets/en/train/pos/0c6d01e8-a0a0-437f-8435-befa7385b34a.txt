So, I happened into this Radio Shack because I was next door at the Walmart trying to return something and buy a few other electronics and I about committed a felony out of frustration. All those people are nuts, customers and staff alike. 

Anyways..... I walked over to this Radio Shack, and not only was a greeted by several people with a smile and hello, they helped me find what I was looking for quickly, AND the most important, they left me alone when I wanted to wonder around the store on my own. 

Love this place I will be back again!
