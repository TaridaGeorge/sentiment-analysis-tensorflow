I am part Italian...so my husband and I have a VERY difficult time finding a restaurant that meets my expectations. So far this is the only one I will go back to. I was impressed that you could order a $48 pasta dish...but my husband and I ordered off the regular menu (not the specials). The chef does know his pasta and sauce! I ordered the Mare Y Monte (Land and Sea) pasta with shrimp. It had the quality ingredients, and no complaints on using FRESH tomato...this is what pasta sauce should be made with. My husband had clams and pasta....the pasta was Lovely! 
Yes there was opera inside (beautiful), we chose to sit on the patio (a tad bit noisy because of street traffic). 
The food and patrons may not be in my tax bracket....but I am willing to try it again (once I save up my change!)
