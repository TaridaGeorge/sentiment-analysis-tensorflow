Simply the best health club... maybe in America?  Certainly competes with the best of NYC or LA.  Too pricey for me.  My friend gives me all her guest passes so I can poach the club on occasion.  Tons of great classes, a beautiful space, the most luxurious locker room (more like a spa) that I have ever been in. High tech equipment (the cardio machine have individual little tv screens). Full indoor basketball court.  The club hosts happy hours with free food and discounted wine...  if you take advantage of everything the club has to offer, I think it is well worth the money.  Truly more like a country club for gym people than a gym.
