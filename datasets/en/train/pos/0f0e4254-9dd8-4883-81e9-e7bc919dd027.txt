I love them!!! All of the employees there know my kids' names, and they have only been going for 3 weeks, 1 day a week.  They are  all excellent with kids and have a lot of patients.  My kids have improved even in those three lessons.  I was a competative swimmer for years, and a Red Cross certified lifeguard, so I know about swimming.  They have amaizing techniques.  I saw a little boy, about 3 years old, who's first lesson was today.  The minute he got in the pool he was screaming bloody murder, the instructor was able to calm him and had him playing in the water in a 30 minute lesson.  Customer service is awsome too!  Prices are very fare. I think all children should have swim lessons.  Everyday I see a child who drowned in the family pool on the news.
