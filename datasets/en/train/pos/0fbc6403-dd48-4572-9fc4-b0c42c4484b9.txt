as you pass this whataburger you take a look at the restaurant and think how could the food be any good?  lol.

well, the food is freakin awesome!  i decided to visit when i saw a national chain hamburger ranking on yahoo and saw whataburger in the top 3.  so i came.

i love all their burgers!  no joke.  the fries are so dang good.  not sure if this is good but the fries and drink come as a large.  crazy i know but when food is this good i don't mind.

the service is above average when compared to other burger chains.  i know most whataburgers do not look appealing but give this place a shot.

enjoy.
