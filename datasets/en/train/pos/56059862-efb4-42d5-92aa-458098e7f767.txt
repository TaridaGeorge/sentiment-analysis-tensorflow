I've been here a few times and everytime it is excellent. The owners are very friendly and helpful. My favorite sandwich is the deluxe club. The thick cut bacon really makes the sandwich. You can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches salads or crepes. All the portions are very large plus the special on yelp doesn't hurt either For saving some money.
