Excellent all around!

The only bad thing I have to say about this place, is it is quite large.  I felt like I was in Vegas with the amount of walking we had to do just to get from our room to the lobby!  And the weekend we were there- it was impossible to find a spot at one of the main pools were there weren't 100 kids splashing around (or a pool chair).  Luckily, we found a small pool that was another footbool field on the other side of the building:)

The service was absolutely top-notch, and the facilities were exceptional.  I highly recommend!
