I had an amazing visit here today, Tom in the bike repair shop is totally awesome! He helped me out with parts for my bike seat, a new seat stem clamp and I returned a seat I bought 3.5 years ago that been sitting in my garage damaged. I got a full store credit for it on my membership! Who does this?!?!? I also found out about the garage sale this weekend for members only. Best loyalty program I ever paid for! A true pleasure!
