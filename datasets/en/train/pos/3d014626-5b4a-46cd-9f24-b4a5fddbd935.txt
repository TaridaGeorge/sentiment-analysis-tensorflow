Great place.  Worth the drive if you live far away, plus the owner is sweet and funny- she'll remember you after just a couple of visits. But be prepared, because she likes to give you a hard time!

You can bring your own wine here, which is great.  The food is reasonably priced and excellent.  I love, love, love the garlic green beans.  They're so good, spicy and flavorful- get them for sure!  I also like the tofu and veggies, pad thai and the seafood noodle soup. 

It's not your everyday restaurant, and that's what I like about it.  The flavors are unexpected, making the food a treat for anyone unaccustomed to it.  And it's a charming place to go on a date or spend some time with friends.
