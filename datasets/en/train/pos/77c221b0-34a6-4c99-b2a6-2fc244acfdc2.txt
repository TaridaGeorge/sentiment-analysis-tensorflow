YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!

Oh. My. Lord.
Best Thai Food in Phoenix.

Erawan=no.
Pink Pepper=only when I'm starving
Touch of Thai=anytime. any day.

I'm obsessed with Thai food. The best I've had was in California but now that I'm here, I go for Touch of Thai. Wowsa.
The Pad Thai and Pad See Ew is incredible.

The servers are very nice.
It can get busy but seriously, it's worth any wait.

MAN! I WANT SOME RIGHT NOW!!!
