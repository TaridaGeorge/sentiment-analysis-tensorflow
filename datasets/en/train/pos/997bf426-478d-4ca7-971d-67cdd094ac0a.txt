A simple and inexpensive place with tasty hot dogs, corn dogs and hamburgers. All the ingredients are imported from Buffalo and upstate New York. It reminds me of barbeques in the backyard while growing up. Thanks Spiro for bringing some New York magic to Arizona. All that's missing is Genesee Cream Ale.
