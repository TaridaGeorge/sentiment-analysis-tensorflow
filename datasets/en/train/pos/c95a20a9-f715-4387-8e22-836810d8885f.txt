I love this place.  Best Thai restaurant in Phoenix....even better than the Thai I have had since moving to the Bay Area a few years ago.  When we come back to the Valley...a trip to Siamese Kitchen is a must.

I used to work close by and would eat lunch there frequently.  My wife would drive across town...I think she was more into the food than hanging out with me.  The food was always fresh, delicious and incredibly flavorful.  

The prices are great, the quality is great and the two ladies who run the place are great.
