Kind of shocked at the reviews beneath me. Been going here since I moved to Gilbert ~2 years ago and have 0 complaints. The guys here have been extremely honest and even helped me save a buck or two when getting my oil changed!  They have never tried to upsell or tell me to purchase anything I don't need. Hey, and don't let me forget to mention their free car wash after they do my oil change. Total time it takes them from start to finish: tops 15 minutes!
