I used to be a Stabuck's addict. Seriously, addicted...no more... 
I went to Dutch Brothers a short time after they opened in this location, and have only been to Starbuck's twice since (and only because there wasn't a Dutch Brothers around... 
YUMMY coffee drinks and THE BEST customer service (barista's) around! You won't find donuts and egg dishes here but if you want amazing coffee drinks, go to Dutch Brothers! 
My summertime drink is the Freeze which is perfect for summer coffee-drinking! And, the lattes in the winter are wonderful and very tasty! No bitter taste like the competition and absolutely wonderful service! Wish there were more around, but it's worth the drive!
