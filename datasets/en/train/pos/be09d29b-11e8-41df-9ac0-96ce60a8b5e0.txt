Seriously one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have. I've tried almost everything on their menu and have never been disappointed (even with their vegetarian sandwich!) Try the White Widow with BBQ sauce and pickles. And the snacks are awesome! 

A bit pricey for a sandwich shop but definitely worth it.
