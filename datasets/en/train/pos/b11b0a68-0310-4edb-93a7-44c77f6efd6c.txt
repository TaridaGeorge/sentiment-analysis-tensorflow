A good, reliable, honest plumber?!  You bet!  We needed two toilets repaired, Roger came the same day, quoted us a reasonable price, explained what he needed to do and why and even showed us the parts that were bad.  He was fast, respectful and just plain good to work with.  I couldn't ask for better service.  If you need plumbing work, call Rocket Rooter!!
