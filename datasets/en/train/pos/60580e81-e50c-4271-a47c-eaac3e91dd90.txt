Came in with my kids, clean and modern looking location.

Large German pub menu selection, with wide and varied beer and soda selection.  We each went for a Brat - Duck, Turkey, Lamb - all were excellent.  Kids loved it

The only ding I would give - SERVICE WAS SLOW.

I will be back and would recommend to others!
