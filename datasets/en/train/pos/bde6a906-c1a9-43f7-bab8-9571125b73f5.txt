I absolutely LOVE Bandera!  I've never had a bad meal from the this place and the service is always great.  My favorite thing to order (which is actually not on the menu) is the BBQ Beef Ribs, they are AMAZING!  Cooked to perfection so they just fall off the bone.  Also, you have to try the side of Mac & Cheese, you wont regret it, I promise.

The prices here are not bad either... dinner for two will run you about $100 with tip.  It's a great place to take a date.
