Even though this is a chain and we tend to support local indies,  my family loves it here and we will keep going back. 
The service is always spot-on and the ambience is always pretty quiet and pleasant.
I suggest the asiago spaghetti with chicken and artichokes or the turkey sandwich.  I've tried most menu items and have never been disappointed.
For dessert, you must try the bread pudding.  I've found myself trying to replicate it at home to no avail.  
We've also had Mimi's "To Go" family dinners. They've been a god-send on busy nights and we usually have leftovers the next day.  Also, their holiday meals are SUPER-CHEAP, usually around $80 and those easily feed 6-8 people.  I'm a Mimi's holiday meal convert now.
