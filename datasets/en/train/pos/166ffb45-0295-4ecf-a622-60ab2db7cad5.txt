Last time I had this amazing sandwich, it had everything I love Prussciuto with Pesto and Brie with Jam??--I was in heaven. And that Bread! That glorious Ciabatta--crunchy but not too crunchy....And that Wine! What a treat. As always there isn't much seating inside, so they try to put some outside, too bad the summer is nigh and will render this place of little use...the parking is not that great so they have a free valet, but even then they run out of room. Still worth going though just to enjoy the breezes with the people who like wine--My kind of people.
