I am writing this as I am sitting getting a pedicure. I've been coming to this nail salon at least once a month since I was 17. (7 years now) The people are friendly, and professional. It doesn't matter who I get, because they are all awesome! I am never disappointed. At just $20, there is no better way to spend your money.
