i have been here many times and never been disappointed. i have tried most of their pizzas, appetizers and salads and am completely satisfied with the consistent quality and deliciousness of absolutely everything.

the duck pizza is back on the menu (though changed slightly) so get it while you can.  makes a nice pairing with the pumpkin porter, which is also only available seasonally.

this is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. there is never a bad time to go to the parlor - perfect for every occasion!

(it's kind of hard to see the first time around - look for the neon sign on a nondescript concrete wall)
