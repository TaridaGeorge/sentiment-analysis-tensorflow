Why is this place so hidden!?  I totally dig this place.  Order 5 or more sushi plates and its half off! Yeah you heard me right starting NOW NOW NOW!!! Go Go Go!!!  Kampai!!! Besides the cheap price I thought the Sushi itself was pretty good; then again I'm no sushi snob a-har a-har a-har...(is Tsunami really a sushi roll?) :)  Our service was pretty good -- she was attentive and you know what, I really appreciate the traditional Kimono she was wearing. I love it!  Moreover, the decor was awesome!  Japanese art and traditional murals that give this place a homey feel.  All that is left is to take off my shoes and put on some zori sandals. - Enjoy!
