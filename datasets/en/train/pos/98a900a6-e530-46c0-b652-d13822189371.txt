Echo Coffee is GREAT great!  They are really friendly and they know their coffee.

My espresso drink was flawless in it's execution.  FLAWLESS flawless!

I loved the atmosphere.  Modern and sleek but warm and welcoming at the same time.

The pastries looked great but I resisted the urge to purchase one...then my mocha arrived with a dainty little shortbread cookie alongside-it was delicious. 

Echo Coffee roasts their own beans on site-a hallmark of a true coffeehouse.  EXCELLENT! Excellent.
