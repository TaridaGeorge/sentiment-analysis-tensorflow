Date night with the boyfriend. Service is amazing. The drinks are unique, fun and go down too fast. The menu is eclectic and includes... pork belly bacon. It doesn't get better than pork belly bacon. He had the short ribs and you could taste the coffee in the rub, it was heavenly. Parsnips accompanied his meat and they were also so good. I had the scallops and they were out of this world. I could have happily ordered another plate of scallops and childishly licked my plate clean! A must in Scottsdale.
