LOVER of this place. seriously, such a great place. Drinks do take awhile but they are worth it. Awesome cappuccinos and the best reason ever to come here, COCONUT & ALMOND MILK. I try to avoid dairy at all costs (and soy) and besides Whole Foods & The Center Bistro no coffee places ever have coconut or almond options. They also have a delicious dark chocolate sauce, yum! 
The ambiance is unbeatable, so friendly- couches, newspapers, magazines, best place to spend an afternoon or evening. And on top of all of that, they are non profit! Definitely check this gem out :)
