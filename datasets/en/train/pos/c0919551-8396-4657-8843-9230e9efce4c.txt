Once again i must sing the praises of  Target. They are so great and friendly in this store. I absolutely love the Pharmacy! They have the absolute best people working here.                             I do not even live any where near this Target.                                         But, i will drive all the way here to get all my  prescriptions filled.  They are always willing to help you, answer any questions, The Pharmacists are all great, but Dan is so wonderful. He will even come out on to the floor to help you find what you are looking for, an answer questions about Vitamins.  One of the many reasons i love Target!
