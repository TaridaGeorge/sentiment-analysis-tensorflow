Can't say enough good things about Meikle Moving. It was my first time paying for movers and they came highly recommended from a friend. The cost was very reasonable, the two movers that came to get my furniture were prompt, speedy, and very careful.

The only negative (and it really isn't a negative about them) was when their truck broke down on the way to my new place. They stopped the clock and transferred everything to a new van and everything progressed quickly after that.

I'll definitely use them the next time I move.
