I love the ambiance in this little cafe! I felt like I had stepped back in time or atleast that time slowed down a little bit. Everything was fresh and delicious! I had my favorite breakfast of country fried steak. OMG the gravy was amazing! My husband had the pork chops and eggs... They eeeeee juicy and it was a huuuge portion! This place is so good for the price... I'll definately be going back! I can see why it was packed on a Sunday morning!
