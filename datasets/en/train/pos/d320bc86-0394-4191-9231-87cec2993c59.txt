great jukebox, great staff and always a friendly enviroment. They can turn a well shot into the most amazing drink you can imagine, just have to ask nicely =) I love to play pool and luckily for me the table is usually open and if not a quarter on the table usually sends the players back to the bar. For sure my favorite bar in phoenix.
