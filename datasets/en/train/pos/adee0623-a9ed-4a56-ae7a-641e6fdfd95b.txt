This is one of the best companies that I have ever contacted. They were very knowledgeable about the part I needed and even checked to see if there was anything I could do to correct the issue before I purchased the part. Even though they repair appliances they offered to walk me through the process over the phone while I replaced the part myself. If I ever need to repair another appliance, I know they will be the first ones I call.
