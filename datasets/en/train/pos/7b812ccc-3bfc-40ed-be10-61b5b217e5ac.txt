Totally loved it!  It's so quaint and charming.  I have been to some of the best hotels in the world, and this place rocks!  Here we go:
-charming and professional.  Not uptight like the Ritz Cartlon.  Very, very personable staff
-amazing food and will do special meals like vegan and gluten free.  Breakfast served at 6AM and coffee bar open.  So nice to be served early as some hotels have client wait till 7AM
-wonderful conceirge who helped me w local restaurants and hiking 
-amazing spa.  It's like you have the place to yourself and the staff knows what they are doing
-really nice gym w great equipment
-little nocks and crannies of fireplaces, fountains and outdoor spaces.  I want my house to look and feel like this!

I hope I get back to Phoenix just to stay here again.
