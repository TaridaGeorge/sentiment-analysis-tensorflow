This place is a diamond in the rough.  It's located in a small strip mall tucked away in a corner.  But, it is well worth the effort to eat there.  The atmosphere is so nice, clean, with cloth tablecloths, perfect.  The food is absolutely wonderful!   The vegetables are as fresh as you can get them the gyro's are great and the greek salad is perfect.  Don't let the Greek fool you, the shrimp, chicken, sauces, pastas are to die for.  You gotta try it.  You will be back.  (The owners are charmers).
