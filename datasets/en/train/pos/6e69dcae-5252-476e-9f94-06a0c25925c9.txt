Fuego Bistro is hands down one of the best restaurants in Arizona. I was incredibly lucky to have them cater my wedding this past weekend. I had all of my guests coming up to me raving that it was not only the best wedding food they had ever had, but some of the best food they had ever had. 

Jeff Ward creates an amazing experience for all of his guests. His attention to detail, and the care he puts into everything he does is evident. Kevin, also makes an incredible effort. 

If you haven't gone, you are missing out. The Coke Cola braised short ribs are a MUST.
