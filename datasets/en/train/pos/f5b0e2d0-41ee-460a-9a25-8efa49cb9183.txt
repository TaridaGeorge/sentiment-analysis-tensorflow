I went to Jo-Ann yesterday in hopes of finding a nice lace trim for my wedding invitations. There was a good selection to choose from, but they didn't have the quantity that I needed.

Whitney, a sales associate in the cutting department, helped me to place a special order for the remaining lace trim that I needed. The deal on the lace trim was already good, but to make it even better, Whitney went out of her way to let me know that I could download an app on my phone to access the current coupons that Joa-Ann had for the week. Whitney saved me 40% on my lace!

The staff was very friendly--I wish I would have gone to Jo-Ann sooner!
