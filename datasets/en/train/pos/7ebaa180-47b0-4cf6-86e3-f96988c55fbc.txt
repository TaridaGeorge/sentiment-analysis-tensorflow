I completed a tri-facta over the weekend.   Ate at all three of Joe's eating establishments.    If you have not eaten at Joe's Farm Grill; you are in for a real treat.    The onion rings are great; had ahi tuna sandwich [great]; the food is well above average and it is a great place to eat outside and enjoy the country; not much of that left in the Valley.     I highly recommend you visit Joe's the next time you are hungry for some good food at very reasonable prices.
