cibo are my big guns. 

if i'm going to cheer someone up or celebrate something epic, this is where i'm taking them.

there is a decent wine list, all of the food is interesting and delicious, the atmosphere is lovely. 

i love bringing people here for the first time. they are usually so excited to find a place so unique and delicious.
