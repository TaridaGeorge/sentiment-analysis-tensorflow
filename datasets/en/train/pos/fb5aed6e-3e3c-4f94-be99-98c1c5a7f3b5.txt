I've been here about three times and it is on my places to go list for when I visit Chandler.  The first time I decided I should get the Redfish Plate because I figured it oughta be good since they are named after it.  It was not a disappointment, in fact was one of the best fish dinners I ever remember having.    I don't remember what I got the other times but know I enjoyed it.  I like the decor and if I remember right, they gave me some Mardi Gras necklaces I still have.  I will definitely go back next trip there.
