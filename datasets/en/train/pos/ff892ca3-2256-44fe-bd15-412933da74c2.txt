I've only been here a couple of times, but it's not because I don't love it, it's because there is always a line and I don't feel like waiting!! This place is a classic  "small town" diner with a classic look and classic food. The portions are huge. The staff is friendly. The space is confined.

If you can get a table before you gnaw your own arm off, you won't regret coming here. I wish they had more diners like this around the Valley. I could eat here everyday if I had to...and I wasn't afraid of weighing 700lbs.

An interesting tidbit - United Airlines has named this little diner one of the top 25 things to do while in Arizona. That's what got me in the door. The experience, feel and food kept me coming back!
