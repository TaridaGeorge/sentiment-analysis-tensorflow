why are people complaining about it not being healthy??? any other restaurant that serves veg food serves ultra healthy food. Green is filling a niche- vegan food that's not uber healthy. vegan food that you can take omnivores to HAPPILY. they've made no secret about what their food is like, you folks are idiots to come on here & give them a low rating cause a veg restaurant that makes no secret of having delicious, albeit not uber-healthy food actually has DELICIOUS, ALBEIT NOT UBER-HEALTHY food. seriously, idiots.
