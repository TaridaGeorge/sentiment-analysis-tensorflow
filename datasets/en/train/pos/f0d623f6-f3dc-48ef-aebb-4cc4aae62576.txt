Alex is irreplaceable. I have been going to Alex since 2007. At that time I had highlights, low lights, base color, my own roots for shades of color, and lots of long hair! I was tired of the maintenance and wanted to go back to my natural color. She was able to take all that mess and match my color to my roots perfectly. Whether it was a trim or a change up, I always left feeling like it was exactly what I wanted. She is full circle fantastic. Her salon is warm, earthy, and has great energy - quite like her. I will be a lifetime client for as long as she continues her passion!
