Oregano's, Oregano's, what would we do without you? You are worth the long waits to get a table! You have hosted softball meetings in high school, family parties and 21st birthdays! I love you! 
Picasso salad and Italian gold wings are amongst my favorites. For not being big on pizza, I could probably eat half a large thin crust myself. With their ranch of course, so good. I have been here several dozen times, probably more than I should have! Food is always great and I have not ordered anything I have not enjoyed! Staff is always friendly, so friendly in fact I wanna smack one of the 10 people that will say bye to you as you leave this restaurant. Well worth it, and if you want to avoid the wait, take out is equally delicious!
