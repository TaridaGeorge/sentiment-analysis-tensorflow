I came in here today for the first time at this location. I had to philly chicken pita and they made it spicy for me by request. The pita was bomb with tons of flavor. I had some pita chips on the side, definitely puts any fries I've had in the past to shame. 

Another thing I liked is that the whole place was Live and packed with people, who were on lunch break and just relaxing enjoying the weather outside in the patio area. The service is great, and I like the vibe 

I Would Def come back again !
