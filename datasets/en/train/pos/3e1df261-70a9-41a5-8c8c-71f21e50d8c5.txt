This is an awesome restaurant.  The food is great and the relaxed atmosphere is very inviting.  The ladies behind the counter are a lot of fun and I have never been disappointed with the quality of the food.  It's the best place in town I know of for soup, salad and sandwiches and even the chocolate chip cookies are fantastic.  Enjoy!
