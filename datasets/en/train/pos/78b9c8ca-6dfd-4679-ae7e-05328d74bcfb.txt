I'm not a big fan of handing out the 5s, but this is worth it. Was there for a business meeting, and thus wasn't worried about the tab. The hosts provided a fixed menu, which included a choice of NY strip steak/fish...I had the steak...not sure I'll ever want to have another one. The food was perfect, the appetizers/salads/desserts just as good. The service for our group was impeccable and they added some nice touches with fresh bread (right out of the oven) and a few tasters, courtesy of the chef. 

Would highly recommend if you're willing to go into a hotel to eat. If you are on site anyways it's a must visit. I believe it's the only 5 star restaurant as of now in AZ.
