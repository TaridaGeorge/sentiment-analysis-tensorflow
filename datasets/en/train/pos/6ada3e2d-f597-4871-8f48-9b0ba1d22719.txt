Dotties has to be the best place in town for breakfast. Homemade buttermilk bread is toasted and served  with a lot of the egg dishes. I love the muffins and coffee cakes too, not overly sweet The smoked whiskey-fennel sausage with a spinach mushroom scramble - now we are talking!
The french toast is made with that homemade bread they make there in the restaurant
You won't be disappointed with whatever it is you pick
