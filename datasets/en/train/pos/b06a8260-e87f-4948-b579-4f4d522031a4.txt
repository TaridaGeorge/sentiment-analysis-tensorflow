Fantastic Thai food....My husband and I had lunch there today, service was fast and efficient. We had were seated and had our beverages very quickly. Try the ice coffee all I can say is it is addictive and so delicious.  I had the barbeque chicken and my husband had a beef dish with asparagus both were excellent we also ordered a #74 which we took home with us. The portions were large and we will be going back very soon for to try more of there menu.
