I just found my go-to delivery pizza! As if I didn't already love Little Chicago Pizza enough, I decided to give its Chicago Beef Pizza a try. 

If you grew up near Chicago, and love Italian Beef, then this is your pizza! The thin crust pie is topped with Italian Beef, Sweet Peppers, Onions, and Giardiniera. It's literally the sandwich with cheese and tomato sauce instead of au jus. The small 12" is just $13.25. I was only planning on having half and saving the rest for later. Instead, I ate the whole thing while watching football. 

Da Bears are playing this Thursday night. If I don't go out to watch the game, I may be ordering this again.
