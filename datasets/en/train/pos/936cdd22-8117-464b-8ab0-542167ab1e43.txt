Went to Dr. Ray after a root canal nightmare with severe pain. They got me in as soon as I called. The x-rays looked okay, but he referred me to an endodontist to get to the real root of the problem. He didnt try to fix it himself and cost me more pain and money. He also spent a lot of time with me and was sympathetic. For the exam and x-rays it was $30 which you can't find anywhere. I will definitely be going back when I need other dentistry work.
