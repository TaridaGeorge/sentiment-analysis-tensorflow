Hands down, this is my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. Their coffee is amazing, as well as their crepes! I have to stop here everytime I go downtown. The employees are always very friendly, and I love their cute latte art! JoBot is located in a quaint little building with adorable vintage funiture and wood floors.
