I needed a 5th wheel hitch installed in my GMC 2500HD.  My neighbor referred me to these guys after having them install a Pullrite Superglide in his truck.  I had them install a Pullrite Superglide, as well, with the removable rails.  I dropped my truck off in the morning and got it back in the afternoon (which is about how long it takes to install this hitch).  When I picked up my truck they went over how to use the hitch, maintenance, etc and if I ever had any questions they told me to call them.  Good service.  Hitch has been working great.  I'd use them again.
