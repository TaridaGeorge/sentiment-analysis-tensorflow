This place is great!
Food and service is both top notch.
I couldn't believe that this palce wasn't packed, but it was a week night and towards the end of evening.

Had just flown in from business trip to Mexico City and I enjoyed this place more than anything there...

Not from Phoenix but love Mexican food and this was one of the best. Will go next time in town.
