I love this spot. It is my most favorite pho spot, possibly in the entire US, definitely in Phoenix. The service is terrible, but I expected that. I think only culturally American spots would even consider service an important quality in a good restaurant. This place focuses on the food. It's all about the delicious (and surprisingly inexpensive) food.
