My friends and I joke that the Pad Thai has crack in it. But that might be the case. I have yet to try a Pad Thai dish that surpasses the one at Thai Basil. I literally eat here once a week (or more) and the portions are large enough to take home to have another meal later. Consistently delicious! Vegan/vegetarian friendly :).
