Love! 

Cibo is a place I have been wanting to go to for ages, and after getting lost and missing an event downtown, I decided to treat myself to dinner here. It was a nice night and the patio was poppin', but I decided to sit inside. I had their dessert blossom tea and decided on the diavola pizza. It was really good, one of the top pizzas I've had. I was in a rush but decided to get the banana nutella crepe which was a delicious mistake. Service was good. There was a mistake on my bill but the staff worked to quickly fix it. No doubt I'll be back.
