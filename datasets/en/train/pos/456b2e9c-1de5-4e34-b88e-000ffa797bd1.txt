If I'm not the first person to review a place, I usually try to add something to the to sum total of review knowledge provided. I'm not sure I'm actually doing that right now, but I really want to add my two cents about Butterfield's.

The menu is extensive, covering the ambit of breakfast food. I have trouble ordering as there are many things that look appetizing, but even when sticking with the basics, i.e. scrambled eggs, hashbrowns and pancakes, I leave smiling and full. The service has always been good and the food has always appeared quickly after ordering.

If you find yourself looking for "a breakfast place" this should be your destination.
