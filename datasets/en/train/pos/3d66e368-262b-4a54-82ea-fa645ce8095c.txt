My wife and I found this place last night. We were delighted to find such good energy in a very authentic place. The drinks were spectacular as were the scallops rice and dessert. Service a bit slow but professional. And we enjoyed lingering there with our rum drinks. I think some other reviews a bit unfair based on our experience. We will return soon.
