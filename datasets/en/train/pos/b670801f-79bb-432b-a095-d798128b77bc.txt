I'm a pretty regular client of this eatery, and it's always good. 

Chef Holly offers plenty of good, solid Southwest fare as well as some more innovative plates. The calamari is outstanding, as are the huge dinner salads. The staff are friendly and efficient. The drink specials are tough to resist. All of the food is worth trying. Do yourself a favor and drop in on the weekend for their brunch. The huevos rancheros are to die for.

Take  the screechy, adolescent rant left by a certain reviewer with a large grain of salt...it smells of personal vendetta and a need for attention.
