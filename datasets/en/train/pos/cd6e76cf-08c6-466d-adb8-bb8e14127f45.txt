okay so i'm totally biased, but i love this store. what really makes it so great? the ladies that work there. :) they are just so pleasant...and you know i've spent too much time there because they all know me by name. it's horrible! i use to frequent the store so often on tuesday evenings that they almost expected to see me!! 

my mom purchased my bernina machine from here back in 2005 as a wedding present and i've been going back for supplies and fabric ever since. it's a small store, but their selection of fabrics is really good. they always have new stuff in and they are all so helpful and friendly. i've taken a handful of classes too and i've had so much fun. the store just carries high quality items and the staff is very knowledgeable of the products.
