LOVED Zoyo!!  I have been a fan of frozen yogurt since the only place to get yogurt was from either the grocery store or TCBY.  Now with all these yogurt places popping up it, I have been noticing a ton of 'impostors' if you will.  But Zoyo is not one of them!  One of my biggest frozen yogurt tests is texture, and Zoyo's texture is perfect a creamy.  Very nice, open location.  The staff was very friendly and they have punch cards :) !  Very excited to have a neighborhood frozen yogurt place, and even more excited that it is Zoyo!!!
