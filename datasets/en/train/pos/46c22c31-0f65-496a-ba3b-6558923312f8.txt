I love gyros and this is my favorite place to get them. I have yet to find anyplace that even comes close when it comes to quality and quantity, especially for the price. The people who work there are very friendly and chat me up like they recognize me regardless of whether or not they really do. They always get my order right and they have me in and out very quickly. I go here every chance I get, even if it means travelling across town since I live on the extreme west side.
