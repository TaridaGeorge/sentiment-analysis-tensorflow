Asian Cafe Express rocks and is the best Chinese food in the Phoenix area.

I've never seen a more extensive menu, with pages and pages full of options. The food is always outstanding and everything I've had there has been really good. The serving sizes are also large and the prices are very low, great value at Asian Cafe Express.

I love the spicy chicken!

Great food, fast and friendly service, very large menu, and reasonable prices, gives Asian Cafe Express five stars.
