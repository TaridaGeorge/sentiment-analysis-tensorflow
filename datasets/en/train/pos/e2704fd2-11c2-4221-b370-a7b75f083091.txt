happy hour lattes are the gift that keep on giving. and the gifts of love, joy, peace, warmth and happiness and energy...and? idk i'm exaggerating. 

i've never had a more delicious latte and i'm finding that it's making me a bit high maintenance. i'm the most unsnobby coffee person but maybe i will be one now? the rest of the weekend, evertime i'd get any form of coffee, i'd be like 'it definitely doesn't compare to what i had at cartel'. 

which is why i am going to hold off on my review of echo because i am currently insanely biased and unable to give them a fair shot compared to cartel 

who is this coffee snob? jk, i'll still go to town on a folgers anyday.
