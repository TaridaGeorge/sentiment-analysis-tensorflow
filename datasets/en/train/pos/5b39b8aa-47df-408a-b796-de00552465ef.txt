Whether I want a salad or pasta or steak, I can always find something great at 5th & Wine. The bartender always suggests the right wine. There is even a room for private parties. My friend hosted a birthday party there and it was just intimate enough so we felt like we were very special. Great spicy fries - I crave them at times!
