Came here based on other reviews. Was leary at first but glad I went through. Awesome staff, very friendly, helpful, and imformative. Asked lots of questions to make sure I understood. Short wait times and again very friendly and professional. Been here twice already and wouldn't hesitate to go again for any needs. Oh and they have a Pharmacy on site and prices about the same as if I went to walmart or walgreens.
