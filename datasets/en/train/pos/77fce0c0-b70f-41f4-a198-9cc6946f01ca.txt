Very much appreciate the new space with bathrooms and room to move. And also happy that the food quality was not impacted the slightest. The wait makes it all the better. And that strawberry lemonade?! Whoo, tasty. Just lighten up on the ice! But for those who are looking for veggie options, they have a lil' bit, particularly the standard omelet with cheese. Would like to see a bit more variety without the meat. Otherwise great work.
