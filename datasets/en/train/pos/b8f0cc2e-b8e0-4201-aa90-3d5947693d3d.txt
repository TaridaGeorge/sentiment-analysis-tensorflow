Love this place! Small mom and pop shop with fresh home made food at amazingly low prices! The owners are really great and it almost feels like you're going to eat at your grandparents house with all the love put into the food. 

Service is a little slow just because there are only 2 of them but it never seems to matter because the food is always great and served to you with a big smile! Oh and they will give you a cup for water at no charge...how many places will let you drink for free!
