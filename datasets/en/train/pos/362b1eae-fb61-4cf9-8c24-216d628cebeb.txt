I had a Groupon ... following the requirements to use.  After having read some of the readers' comments, I was a little apprehensive to even say I had a Groupon.  OMG ... I have never tasted such phoenominal food  from white bean brushetta, lamb, roasted beets and saut√©ed spinach.  I drove 60 miles to the establishment, but will be back very, very soon.  Andy and his daughter were charming, honest and have worked so hard to make this my favorite restaurant in the Valley.
