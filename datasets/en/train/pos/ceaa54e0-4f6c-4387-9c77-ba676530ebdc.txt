Taylor's has such a refreshing cafe menu. I've been for breakfast far more often than lunch. I hope to try dinner soon b/c I think they feature live jazz on Wednesday nights. 

I've never ever had a bad meal. In fact, I always have a hard time deciding. Some highlights in my opinion are the huevos rancheros, eggs Benedict (with a choice of meat), waffles & the Mexican omelet. 

I never liked Bloody Marys until I had one at Taylor's! I tried a friend's once and have been hooked ever since! But if you want a less intoxicating beverage, try the iced chai latte. Careful, its so good you'll be ordering another before you know it! 

Bon Appetite!
