Mmmmm... Greek frys anyone?!? I didn't even know what I was missing out on! And the vibe in this place is fantastic, everyone is super friendly. I went in for a to go order and was asked 4 different times if I had been helped or if I could be helped. I was also complimented 3 times while I was there, which is always a plus! lol! The prices were just right. 5 bucks for a humongous to go box of greek frys sounds right up my alley! I need those greek nachos now. I have dreams about them. Too bad they are so far from my house. But I am willing to drive...
