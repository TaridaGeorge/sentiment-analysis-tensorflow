Absolutely amazing...if you are feeling generous..try "Chef's special" for $98 or $128. I tried several incredible dishes that I wouldn't have if I had just ordered from the menu. I was taken care of really well..tried 8-9 types of dishes followed by an amazing line-up of dessert. I could hardly walk after eating for ~3 hours. AMAZING EXPERIENCE.
