Chompies is fabu.  They have a huge menu and their breakfast items are so good, I've never even been able to venture over to lunch.
If you're wondering, I always get the veggie omelette (hold the mushrooms and scallions) and a bagel with jalapeno cream cheese. 
The server will bring you out a plate of cucumbers and pickles right when you sit down and they're usually fast to take orders and bring out your food. 
Be sure to check out the mural painted on the wall while you're there. There is a man holding a knife and if a diner is positioned just right underneath him, it looks as if he's about to be shanked.
Word to the wise: if you come on a weekend morning, be prepared for at least a 30 minute wait.
