I really wish Va Bene was closer.  The happy hour is amazing (try the eggplant dish!) with great specials on food and drinks.  I've had the vodka sauce pasta, and that was pretty tasty, but mainly I stick to the appetizers and drink specials.  Luckily, they have happy hour 5 days a week!  The crowd is a bit older and they have karaoke after happy hour.  If you're a 40something on the prowl, watch out!  Otherwise, come earlier, or sit in the dining room to avoid the cougars.
