Love this place. Have been coming here regularly for the last few months. Even though I am not a vegan/vegetarian anymore, I still love the food. I usually order the Mongolian with crispy tofu and brown rice, but have also had a couple of other menu items that have all been good. Their french fries are TO DIE FOR. Seriously... it's the kind of thing you have sexy food dreams about.

The staff are always pleasant and helpful, and the space is always clean and welcoming. I will continue to come back here for sure.
