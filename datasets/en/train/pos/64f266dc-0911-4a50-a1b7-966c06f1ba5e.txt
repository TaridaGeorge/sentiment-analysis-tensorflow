Like others on here I am happy with this park.  We've been there four times now with our pup on Saturday or Sunday late morning.... Even with 20+ dogs it never feels crowded.  The parents all seem friendly enough.  We haven't had an run ins with badly behaved dogs.  All has been smooth.  I really like the walking path around the perimeter.
