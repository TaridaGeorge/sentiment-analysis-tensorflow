Had a great time at happy hour this week. Had the sparkling sake, always a good choice. Awesome specialty martinis, but I went with my fav of sparkling sake. It was Tuna Tuesday and I had the poke tuna roll, which was awesome. Also tried the beef tacos which were beyond amazing with a bit of pineapple on top, yummers. Would definitely recommend this place for happy hour or anytime. Great bartenders, awesome atmosphere, and just a cool spot to hang!
