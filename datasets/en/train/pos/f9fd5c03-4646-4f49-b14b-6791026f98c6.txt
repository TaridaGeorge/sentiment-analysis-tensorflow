I frequently dine at Market Bistro about twice a week. I LOVE the "Build Your Own" salads. The ingredients are ALWAYS super fresh, and the value is beyond compare... especially for the area it is in North Scottsdale.

Often time I will be in the Kierland or Scottsdale Quarter area, and given the vast choice of restaurants in the vicinity, I will almost ALWAYS choose to make the 3 minute car ride over to Market Bistro. The food is almost always better... and ALWAYS cheaper for what you get. 

Things to try... you won't be sorry... the Cuban Sandwich, the BBQ TriTip Steak Sandwich, and the Southwest Corn Chowder! ALL AMAZING!

They have some wine, and bottled beer.
