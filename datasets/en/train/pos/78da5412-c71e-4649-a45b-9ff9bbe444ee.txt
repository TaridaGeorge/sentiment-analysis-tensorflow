Who cares if I've been there 3 times in 3 days, I LOVE this place!  My waiter "LaLo" or something like that, is as delicious as the food!  But that's another review...Lalo had me at "no problem, if you don't like your salad, I'll bring you something else."  That my friends, is the kind of service you get there!  I had a salad and didn't love it, so he brought me a salad I loved, and he did it with a smile!  When we returned on day 3, he greets us and says "nice to see you again."  OH, did I mention the food is sooooo good, you are going to want to move down the street just so you can walk there for all your meals.  Get in your car NOW!!!
