It was my first time at Royal Thai Grill. As we walk in the owner greet us right away. My favorite Thai dish is Kra Proa Kai so I had to try it here. I am HAPPY to say it was EXCEPTIONAL! We also order Papaya salad and it was GREAT! We went there around 1:30 and we were the only customer there. So we got the best service and full attention from the owner. Really GREAT guy. It's a bit far for me to travel but I definately be back soon!
