Great music, beer selection is solid...oh, almost forgot, the reason we went was to watch a movie--theatre area is cool.  I would give this place six stars if it was an option because the owner served us drinks during the movie on a Sunday night. 
My one piece of advice--go to the Filmbar...you'll be glad you did.  You can then stop droning on about how downtown Phx has no place cool to go.
 For all you newbies to downtown Phx--Filmbar for drinks and a movie, Lost Leaf for after movie drink, saunter over to Carly's for dinner (and a drink) and then to Sidebar for a nightcap.  You can thank me later when your date tells you that was one of their top five dates of all time.
