Wow! What a great place! Went on Sunday , Labor Day weekend, and it was busy, lively , and full of character. if someone told me there is a better place for enjoying a great selection of beer,  I would be very skeptical.  The micro brewery selection is incredible! After a long night of enjoying many of our favorite places along the light rail, we stopped in to try some beers. Jeannie isn't a beer drinker, but thoroughly enjoyed her on tap wine! Our beers were tasty and the spam sliders were the perfect late night snack . Count us in as fans!
