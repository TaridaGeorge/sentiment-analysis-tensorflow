As far as chain pizza restaurants go, this one takes the cake.  My husband and I dine at this location at least twice a month and we order the same thing every time, 14 " thin crust pizza with cheese, pepperoni and mushroom (which I crave), 2 side salads with ranch and our beers of choice.  The night waiter there now recognizes us and seats us at "our table," and always remembers our drinks.  Their new menu is AWESOME, the new thin crust pizza is some of the best we've eaten anywhere!  It's super thin and cracker crispy, lots of toppings and flavor.  We can always count on Streets to be a quick in/out, tasty dinner option at the end of the day. Yum!
