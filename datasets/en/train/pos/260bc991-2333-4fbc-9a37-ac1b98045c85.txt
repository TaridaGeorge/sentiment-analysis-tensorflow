I love this spot.  Since you pay per ounce, you can enjoy a tiny taste, or you can pound a gallon of 'gurt.  I've always gotten my fill and never spent more than $4.

The toppings selection is excellent and the yogurt flavors are good (their seasonal Pumpkin Spice w/ cheesecake chunks is my current favorite).  They recently scaled back their hours a bit :( but I hope that gets reversed as 44 Monroe finishes filling up, Concord Eastridge builds their apartments, and CityScape puts apartments on its hotel.
