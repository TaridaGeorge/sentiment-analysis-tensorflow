You should only venture to Lolo's if you are looking to eat the best fried chicken EVER!  Seriously! I though I though I had died and gone to heaven.  The waffles were also enjoyable as were the grits and mac and cheese but oh man you've got to try this chicken!
 
My friends and I went on a Tuesday night around 5 and walked right in.
