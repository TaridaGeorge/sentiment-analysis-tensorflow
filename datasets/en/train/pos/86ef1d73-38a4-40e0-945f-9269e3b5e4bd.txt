This is my family's favorite little place to go for dinner. They have the BEST soft, warm pita and we always get the hummus/tzatziki split for the three of us. My 4 yr old son loves the chicken souvlaki and my husband and I either split the Spartan Club (YUMMY!!!!) or the white fish dinner. I love the little side Greek salad that comes on the side because everything is cut up nice and small into bite-sized pieces. And I love the tropical tea, too.

The very best thing though is the service. The girls are all so sweet!
