I enjoy it here every single time I come!

Service is always friendly and quick!

Usually when you order orange juice, it comes in a tiny cup.  Here you get a nice large glass of it!

And the pancakes are a must every single time!  Their syrup is always served warm, and it's the best syrup you can find!
