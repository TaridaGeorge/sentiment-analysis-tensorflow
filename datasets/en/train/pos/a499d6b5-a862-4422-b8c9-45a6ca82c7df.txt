This is, so far, the best buffet I've been to here in Arizona. So many amazingly good items, from soups such as the tasty egg flower and the ambrosial New England clam chowder, to entrees such as juicy brisket, grilled salmon and veggies, fish and freshly fried potato chips, delectable potstickers, and much more. There were so many superb dishes so I tried to get only a small portion of each item, to make room for some of the desserts. And what an array of desserts it was: fantastic bread pudding, different kinds of fruit pies, cheesecakes, gelatos, sorbets, and more. The contemporary design of the dining area, the very comfortable booths, and the very efficient and very friendly service also helped to make dining here with my yelp friends Rand H., Jeromy H., Mike C., and Robyn N. a truly memorable experience.
