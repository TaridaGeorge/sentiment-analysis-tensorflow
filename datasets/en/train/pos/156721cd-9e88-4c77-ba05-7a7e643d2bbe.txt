Yet another happy Yelper! ! I took in my Dell Dinosaur Laptop because it would no longer boot up. They diagnosed it free of charge and charged me a reasonable (and discounted) price to resurrect it and added RAM memory as well. As you can already see, this is THE place to take your sick and dying laptops so they can get a new lease in  life.
