Holy crapola... went here tonight with some friends and it was so friggin good.  Seriously, the best food I've had since moving to Phoenix 18 months ago.  I had the cheese tortellini with the tomato cream sauce.  Then we shared tiramisu for dessert with a coffee.  The wait was long, but who cares!  Once we were seated with were treated to a long and luxurious meal.
