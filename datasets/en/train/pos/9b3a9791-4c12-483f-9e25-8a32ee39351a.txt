I walked in and 45 minutes later walked out with a brand new Arizona drivers license. In California this would have taken 5 hours without an appointment and 2 1/2 with one. People who complain about the DMV clearly either haven't been in a while or have never experienced the hell of other states.

Great job Arizona - one of the few government services you get right!
