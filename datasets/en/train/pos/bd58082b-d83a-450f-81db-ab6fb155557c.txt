As the current Taylor Duchess ( which may last 2minutes or less ) I just requested the owners add to the menu the best tasting custom made omelet not listed on the menu at current....It's egg-chedcheese-onion-ham... That's it...That's all! Better tasting than the top 5-6 others I've tried!! A MUST TRY!!!! Hey, why not title this, "The Duchess!" Mmmmm!!!!
