My friend and I went in for the first time because we got a Groupon and wanted to check it out. I love cupcakes and consider myself picky...but this place far exceeded my expectations. The decor was so cute and clean. I am surprised to read other reviews about bad service because we were treated very well. The guy who helped us was funny and very knowledgeable about the cakes as he was the baker.
