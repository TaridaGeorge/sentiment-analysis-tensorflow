I might live here this summer. Definitely a place you can grab a beer after spending the day poolside.

I loved seeing some of the old school Scottsdale guys here having a beer on a Saturday. 

Next time - up top! Hopefully I can maneuver the stairs after a beverage or two....

Thanks to Julia T for introducing us to a great new (to us) spot!
