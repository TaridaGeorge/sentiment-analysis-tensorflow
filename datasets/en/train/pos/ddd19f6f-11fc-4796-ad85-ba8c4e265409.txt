I love this place. Why? Because they seem to be open every time that I want a hot dog. Every time.

I get their special, it's a hot dog with tomatoes, onions, beans (and normally mayo but I don't get the mayo). I then sauce it up with Tapitio hot sauce and dig in. Fantastic!

This cart is clean and always well patronized. So if you're up late and want a great meal, head over here.
