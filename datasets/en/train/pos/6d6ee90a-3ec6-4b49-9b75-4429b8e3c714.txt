This is my #1 take-out restaurant. I call in my order, give my phone number, and they know it's me. It's quick and easy. I have take-out menu at my house and order my dinner for the evening. Most times it only take 15 minutes, therefore by the time I order, I get in my car to travel to Pei Wei. I get out of my car (they have a location where you can park in if you are grabbing and going). In the end, I come home, have a nice dinner! I even have leftovers too! Out of all I said, remember it's quick and easy!
