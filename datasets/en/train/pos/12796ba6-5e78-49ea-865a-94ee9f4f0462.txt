This place is awesome! I love it. The wait staff is very casual about everything (don't go if you are in a rush). The hot tea that they serve you is my favorite! The "meat" and "seafood" dishes could really make you worry that you are eating meat. The stuffed tomatoes are delicious as well as the sweet and sour pork, I also really liked the lemon grass fish. I took a friend who was a Janeist (VERY strict diet!), and he wouldn't believe that it wasn't meat, lol.
