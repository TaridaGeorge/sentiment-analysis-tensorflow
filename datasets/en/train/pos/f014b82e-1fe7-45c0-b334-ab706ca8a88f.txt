Like every other TJ's, the staff is superb!  Can't find something?  They'll check in the back and bring you a few of that item.  If they're out, they'll suggest something new but similar to try (many times making you a convert).  Looking for a wine you fell in love with at a different TJ's across the country?  They'll order it for you...with a smile and a joke to boot.

Check out the website for a sampling of great recipes and a copy of the seasonal Fearless Flyer which highlights new and featured products.

I will never, ever live in a place without a TJ's!
