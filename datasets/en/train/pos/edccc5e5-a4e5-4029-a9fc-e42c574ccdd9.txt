We had a great time on Southwest Airlines last week. We flew up to Vegs for 4 days. Even though it was a short trip, it was a good one.
 The first flight we had was from Phoenix to Las Vegas. We were lucky enough to get on a 737 800 aircraft. The windows were clean and big, the plane was clean and the service was nice. Happy Flight attendents and a quick and fun flight. 
 Our flight back on Monday night was delayed, (but hey sometimes that happens). The crew did the best they could and it still a quick and very nice flight home. The terminal in Phoenix is really nice. Lots of shops and places to eat  and drink as well.
