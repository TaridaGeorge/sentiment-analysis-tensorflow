This is one of the best places in Phoenix!!  Our crew has eaten their every other day.  Try the #5 spice wow what good food.  The place is a little small but the service is great and the food is delivered super fast. Their lunch specials are well priced and you just enough, well enough even for a fat guy who loves their food. Give it a try and you will not be disapointed..
