Most of my friends know, this place is my Cheers! 

The staff has always been wonderful - once they chatted it up with my mother about Irish music, that was years ago and she still talks about it. It does not take long for the staff to remember your name and introduce themselves to your guests - everyone is your friend at Rosie's! 

The food is also great - I really like the Sheppard's Pie!

PS, they have Wi-Fi. A happy hour beer while finishing up some work - nothing could be better!
