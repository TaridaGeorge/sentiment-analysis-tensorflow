I Absolutely, 100% LOVE LEMY NAILS!!! It is the only place in valley where I am consistantly happy with the way my nails look after they are done. My nails last so long that I only have to get them done once every 3-4 weeks! IMPRESSIVE!!! I happily drive 30+ miles to have my nails done at THE BEST NAIL PLACE IN ARIZONA!!!
