We had our wedding here on Saturday. It was awesome. Sandra the coordinator was amazing and I knew that she would take care of everything. It was beautiful and was better than I imagined! I would highly recommended Wild Horse Pass Resort and Spa for a wedding.

They gave us a bridal ready room which was so nice! We had an awesome staff helping us and the food was to die for! 

We got tons of compliments.
