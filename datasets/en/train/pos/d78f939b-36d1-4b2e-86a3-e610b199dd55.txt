Could there be a better Italian restaurant for lunch in the valley, no! Meatballz is fantastic. I've had just about everything on their menu and it's all excellent. From the salads to the outstanding pasta you can't go wrong eating here. 

The owner, Robert, is always mingling with the customers making sure everything is to their liking. The service is fast and the food is reasonably priced. I only wish they were open for dinner.
