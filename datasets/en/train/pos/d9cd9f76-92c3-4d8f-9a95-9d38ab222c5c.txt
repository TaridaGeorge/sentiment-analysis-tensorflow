This place is the best seafood market i have ever been too! Hands down the freshest I've ever seen. From the live fish to crawling crabs they have it all. Thank god the prices are so cheap, since the economy is so bad I'm thankful that i found this store. Imagine finding everything you need for any kind of oriental dish to Indian foods all under one roof. The variety of fruits and vegetables are unheard of. I've never seen so many different exotic fruits in my life. I recommend everybody who hasn't been here stop by and check out what I've experienced and i promise you won't be disappointed. PROMISE!!!!
