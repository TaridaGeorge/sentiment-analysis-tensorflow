Hmmmm....Let's see. Pay $9.50 to see a movie when it first comes out or wait a bit and see it for $3.00 at a nice comfortable clean theater with plenty of restrooms, friendly people and hot popcorn. Pollack Tempe Cinema is as good as it gets. If you like going "out" to the movies this is the place to go. I even drive over from Mesa for a night out. Plenty of great restaurants nearby too!
