Though I can't speak as to the spa side, this place is almost worthy of being called the perfect gym. 

The facilities are clean and the staff is always available and friendly, yet it's kept enough of a secret that it's almost never crowded. It is hidden inside the Pointe Hilton Squak Peak Resort but gym memberships are available to the public at surprisingly reasonable rates. 

Members are given access to a heated pool, steam room, sauna, in addition to an entire gamut of classes at the workout facility. 

If I still lived in this neighborhood, this would undoubtedly still be my gym of choice.
