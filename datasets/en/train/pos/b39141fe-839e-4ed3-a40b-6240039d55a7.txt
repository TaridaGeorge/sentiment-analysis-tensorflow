I wouldn't change anything about Casey's -- I love it all: the open air, the door guys, the servers, even the bartender who takes out his love for Michael Jackson on patrons every Sunday night.  (Also, there's a special place in my heart reserved for any bar that serves potato skins with ranch after 12 AM.)  I have a serious soft spot for everything about this place.
