This is now my new Subway store of choice. I had been using the Subway at 2095 N. Alma School for years but when I went there yesterday for my free 6" Veteran's Day sandwich I was refused. I have spread the word to a lot of veterans in my neighborhood that were really indignant about the Alma School store doing that.
