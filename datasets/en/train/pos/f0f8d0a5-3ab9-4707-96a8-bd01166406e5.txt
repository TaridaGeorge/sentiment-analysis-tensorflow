We are fortunate enough to enjoy Bandera's at least once a year when we visit Scottsdale/Phoenix area.  This place does everything right!  Food is exceptional and priced reasonably.  The service is the best!  Friendly, patient, informative, and attentive.  My husband had the prime rib....delicious.  We usually have the chicken but chose to explore different items this round.  I had the Butternut squash with chicken enchilada.  Probably would not order that again, but the accompanying fresh, chilled, vegetable escabeche was worth it!  The skillet cornbread is a must every time you go!  Had the banana cream pie, a new twist on this....crust was graham cracker with walnuts, the center was a lovely custard, and fresh sliced bananas topped it with whip cream and caramel drizzled over the top.  Yummy!
