John Hill at Space Massage Studio is so gifted. He truly knows how the body works and why it stops working or hurts. I went to John with some pretty bad neck pain and he relieved it quickly and without it having to hurt while he did it.

The studio is beautiful, easy to find and peaceful. John's manner is gentle and present. He is so unhurried and professional!

All in all, this was an amazing experience. I also consider myself a bit of a massage perfectionist because I have had many in my life (one year I went on a weekly basis) and also because as a yoga instructor I understand body therapies and movement to a fairly good degree.

John is truly a healer.
