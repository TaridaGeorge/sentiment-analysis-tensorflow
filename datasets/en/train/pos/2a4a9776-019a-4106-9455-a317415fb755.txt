This place is fantastic and cheap compared to big box stores.  Careful, though, of the Coscto effect: you walk in there with intention to buy one thing but end up with a whole cart of stuff for your pets. :) Very friendly staff.  We will be back for all of our needs.  Just went today to buy puppy post-surgery no chew collar.  They had a wide selection at greatly reduced prices.
