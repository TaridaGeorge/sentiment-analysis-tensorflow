Setting:  Dimly lit, nice for dates.  Very clean.  There is another room for bigger parties.  Nice bar for just to hang out and watch a game.

Food:  Yum!!!  Had the steamed Maine lobster.  For less than $20 it was very very good!  Meaty too.  They give you the whole lobster, complete with thick juicy claws.  Oh, and the Greek salad was very very good as well.  Highly recommended for big groups.  Finally, the fondeaux is also very tasty.  Although it's a bit think on the cheese.  But hey, if you like cheese, this is the appetizer for ya.

Service:  Awesome folks, we had a cool waitress.  So sorry we made you take pictures of us and you almost fell off the table!  :(  But she was a great sport.  Very helpful, very nice.
