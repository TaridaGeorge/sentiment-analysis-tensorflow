next stop: scottsdale. you may think that I rate too many 5-star ratings, but if they deserve them, then I'm not holding back.

jaw-dropping hotel. I mean this place is huge, but in a really really nice way. any place with towel-covered beds next to the pool is fine by me. and the pool area here is amazing. 

they throw this mtv spring break sunday all day pool party every sunday with a DJ and an over-21 rule. the rooms are solid (could use better TV's). 

I really liked the outdoor mister-covered bar. what better place to sit and watch HDTV at night, but at the fairmont in the middle of the arizona desert.
