A MUST, every time I go to Scottsdale! 
The best "Mashed Potatoes" you have ever tasted. I haven't figured out what is chopped up in them, but they are heavenly!
The rib and chicken combo is our perennial favorite to share. It is alot of food for the money! The ribs just fall off the bones, they are so tender and nice!
Yes,  the cornbread is spectacular.  I LOVE this place!
