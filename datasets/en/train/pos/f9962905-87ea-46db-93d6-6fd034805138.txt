I've never had a bad experience at White Chocolate. I've been here countless times, and the food and service has always been top notch. I don't think I've even had a "pretty good" meal here; it's always "very good."

Here's something I recently discovered: the Guacamole here is amazing. Who knew!? It's not even a Mexican restaurant!

My current favorite dish is the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich. Mmm! But, like I said above, I've never had a bad meal here. Forays onto other parts of the menu have always yielded tasty results.

I'm a fan. I will undoubtedly be back.
