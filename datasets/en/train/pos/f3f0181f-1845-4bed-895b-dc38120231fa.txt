The food is simply the best around for Hawaiian food in the valley.  The atmosphere is great and Jay the owner is one of the nicest guys I've ever come across. He's always there to greet you and make sure everything came out ok and that you like your food.  Prices are average but you get a lot of food - you're not walking out of there hungry!
