I like to enjoy there  garlic pepper chicken, I order it medium and it is plenty hot enough for me. I generally go there for lunch when I am in town on business , the lunch meal comes with a salad & egg roll. The salad dressing is a homemade Thai Vinaigrette . This place gets crowded from about 11:45-12:30pm, so just allow yourself enough time or get your meal to go.
