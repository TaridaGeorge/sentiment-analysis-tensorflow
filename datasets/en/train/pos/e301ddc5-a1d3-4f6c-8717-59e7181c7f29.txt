WOW. I was here for a wedding this past Saturday night and and let me tell you it was very nice. The wedding ceremony was small and was held outside in a cute area that was quite hard to find but the staff were very helpful and friendly for someone that was very lost. 

After the ceremony, we walked over to our private area for the cocktail hour before the dinner. Again another nice area and it was the perfect size for this very small and very cozy wedding. The dinner was buffet style and was very good. My favorite dish were these steak medallions with risotto. I actually went back for a little more because it was so good. YUM! Needless to say I had a great time at the wedding and the Sheraton Wild Horse really did a great job making my friends day extra special!
