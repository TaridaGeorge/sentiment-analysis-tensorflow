Finally, a fierce competitor in the Phoenix food truck frenzy! 

Pizza People make an awesome pizza!  Very impressed with their selection of toppings- you don't do dairy, they offer daiya cheese.  Don't do wheat, they have gluten free dough.  Everything is made to order and fresh.  No sitting under a heat lamp for hours- what a concept and it is delicious.

The owners are very helpful if it is your first visit.  They have great energy, the concept has great energy and experience is good energy.  (Which is very important while digesting.)

I will be returning soon!
