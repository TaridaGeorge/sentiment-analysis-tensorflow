After our team yoga class we had our staff meeting at Drip this week. Gina is totally awesome, and they were super accomodating. Matt at Sutra Midtown Yoga (next door to Drip) let them know we'd be over afterwards and they had tables and chairs pulled together in the semi private space in the north part of their place.

Gina is dynamic and attentive, and the food was was especially enjoyable. Matt had talked up the NY egg sandwich and it didn't disappoint- I had mine with an over hard egg, Boar's Head bacon and tomato. The home fries were some of the best I've had. If you're in the neighborhood and looking to support a cool local place (and you should be), stop in and check out Drip!
