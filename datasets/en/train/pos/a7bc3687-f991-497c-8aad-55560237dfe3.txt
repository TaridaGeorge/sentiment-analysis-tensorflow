This has to be my favorite bookstore/store in Arizona. No Im not a book worm but when you are there it makes you want to be. Its great for kids, readers, and trinket shoppers. One thing that i found and do find is what a store will do to solve an issue or whatever sets them apart from the rest and for a book store they have done just that. I was searching for The Little Prince in hardback the clerk apologized for not having it and then ordered it! what can you say to that. I have been loyal ever since.
