Bottles everywhere are brimming over with lightning. Blind squirrels near and far are dining on lavish feasts of nuts. 

Dallas G. picked a lunch spot and it was amazing. I've been to the cornish pasty co before but not for a couple of years, and this time it was sublime. They have this pasty (essentially a mini calzone lookin' dealy with different innards) called the royale with cheese. Filled with burger, onions, fries, and such and served with 1000 island or whatever other goo you should like. Sublime. 

It seems small but is filling, and our waitress is a lovable little thing, too. Hells yeah. 

If I were a little more stuck up I might deduct one star for the ramshackle looking fellow in the chiefs hat who is running around doing various tasks--this is a food place, after all--but I'm not. 5 stars.
