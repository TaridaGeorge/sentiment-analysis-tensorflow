Amazing chocolates!  I have tried many brands of chocolates over the years. 
I received the Holiday Red Hat Box as a gift.  These chocolates are presented beautifully!  They are fresh and creamy and so delicious!  In my opinion these outshine Godiva, Ghiradelli, Sees, Fannie May, and many others.  They are pricey but are perfect for that special occasion or gift.  Such a delightful gift to receive!
