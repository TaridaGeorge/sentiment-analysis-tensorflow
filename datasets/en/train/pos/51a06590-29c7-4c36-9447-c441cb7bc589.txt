This place is really good. I went twice with a friend and with my parents. Both times, I had lobster; it's amazing to see how the waitress handles the lobster for you; she was really good at it.
Drinks are nice, decoration is good.
We just went without reservation and got seated right away.
It's a little small, so better not to go with big crowd.
