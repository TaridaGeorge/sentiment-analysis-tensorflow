i love this place.

The vibe is clean, contemporary and casual.  

The menu is varied. High quality salads, pastas, pizzas and gyros - something for everyone. 

I enjoy the appetizers the most.  The clams with butter/wine sauce & caprese are unforgettable.

The patio is a hidden gem.  It is spacious and comfortable.  Plenty of seating, a fireplace, misters, a pass-thorough bar and most impressive:  spectacular views of the mountains.  This patio is going to be the best thing going once cool weather strikes Phoenix.

Their beer and wine selection is totally sufficient and the wait staff is friendly and attentive.  

Fabulous portion sizes, very fair prices.  You can't go wrong here.
