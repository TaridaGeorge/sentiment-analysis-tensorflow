Oh my gosh I have died and gone to heaven. Why I hadn't been in to an Ikea before today is beyond me. My eyes literally popped out of my head. Pretty colors and even prettier prices. I got wine glasses, a couple frames, hangers, plates, and dish towels and spent $20. I also bought their famous Swedish meatballs, cinnamon rolls, and these marshmallow chocolate thingies. I definitely will be coming here next time I move into a new apartment. If you haven't shimmied into an Ikea yet you are definitely missing out. It's amazing.
