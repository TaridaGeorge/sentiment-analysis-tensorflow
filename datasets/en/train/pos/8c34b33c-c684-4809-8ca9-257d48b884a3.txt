Turned a friend on to this place a couple of weeks ago. 

We had the Ethio Strictly Vegan Combo.

We picked:

Shuro Watt
Dubba
Kik Alitcha
Misir Watt
Kik Misir Watt

....and also we had the Vegan Falafel Salad which was very fresh, and the presentation was a work of art. Kudos to who put it together.

Almost seemed a shame to eat it! 

The server was prompt, very friendly, and extremely helpful when it came to choosing what we wanted to combo up.

I would not hesitate to come here again and would totally recommend this place to all my grass munching friends.
