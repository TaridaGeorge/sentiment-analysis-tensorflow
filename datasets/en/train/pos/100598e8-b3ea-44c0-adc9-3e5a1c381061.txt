What can I say, my kid loves this place!  Zoyo changes their flavors often which is great, except when you find a flavor you love, like Pistacio, and it disappears out of their line up.  Overall, best froyo we've had over other places in the valley.  Great selection of toppings to compliment the flavors too.  And, if you're watching the waistline, they have sugar free as well as gluten free options.  

And, if you're a regular like us, consider getting a punch card.  Buy 10, get the 11th free.  I decline to say how many punch cards we've gone through!
