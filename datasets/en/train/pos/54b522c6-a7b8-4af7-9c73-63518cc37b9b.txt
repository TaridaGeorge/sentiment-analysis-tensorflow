I hadn't been bowling in at least 15 years. Looking for something fun to do with the fam, I decided to bring my husband and kids to McRay Plaza Lanes. We had a blast! The employees were super nice, the place was clean, the snack bar was good and the prices were reasonable. They even had great music playing. We loved it so much we went back 4 days later. I highly recommend this place.
