This is Arizona's Disneyland. For real.

I absolutely LOVEEEE this place! And the bison burgers here are to DIE FOR. Mmm, bison. I'm not all that into hunting and guns and boats and what not, but my boyfriend is and he loves to come here. I mostly just look at the dead animals and look cute while he foams at the mouth. As long as he buys me a bison burger, I'm stay here as long as he wants.
