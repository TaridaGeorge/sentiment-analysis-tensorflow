I love Stupid Cupid. It is right next to the light rail, and in a great location. Owner Rob used to run Smelly Dog two doors down.

Rob has shopped the nation for unique goodies to put into his store. There is also a huge emphasis on buying local. Besides candles (which they have a great selection of), there is handmade glass jewelry, great home decor items (I've snapped up several picture frames), Vases, wood carved platters, and depending on season- live orchids. All unique, all original, the low prices! (I actually told him he should raise some of his prices. (I know, I know- but they were unbelievably low!)

I really wanted Fig candles not to long ago- so he ordered two different kinds! (As for the other poster)- if Campfire sent will sell- talk to him- he'll probably track it down for you.
