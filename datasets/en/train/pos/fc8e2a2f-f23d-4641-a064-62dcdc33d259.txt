This resort is a great place to relax. One of the quietest resorts I've stayed at. It's right down the street from my house and is a great place to stay if your AC ever goes out! The staff is polite and the amenities are great as well. 

**Try 'A Different Pointe of View' --the restaurant at the top of the hill, GREAT views of the city and an all around beautiful place for a couple or a group of people who want a classy place to eat or have a few drinks. The last few times I've been there they were cigar friendly on the outside patio.
