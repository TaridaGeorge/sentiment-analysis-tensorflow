Julie is a doll! I stopped by a week ago for a impromptu manicure and was impressed with her kindness and technique.

Goveias is the best nail salon I've been to, and having lived in Scottsdale, I've been to many. They are true professionals and treat you like you're in a hotel spa - the service and technicians do not compare to any other nail salon.  

A quick Shellac manicure will cost about $30 and it's well worth it! I went today and have already booked my next appointment.
