History. That's what makes this roller rink unlike any other.  From the staff to the locals, this place was hopin' on Friday night.  

The rink itself was very clean - looks like they take pride is keeping it that way too!  Choice of "regular" rental skates or roller blades - both of which seem to be maintained.

The snack bar attendant was nice and helpful, as well.    Food was what we expected - pizza, pretzels, sodas and Icees.  

Kiddos had a great time, which makes me very happy.   Would we go back? Yep - probably will.

See you there? Hope so!
