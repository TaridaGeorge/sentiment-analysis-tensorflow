So fun. I sat about 2nd row on the south side. So fun. Great View, saw everybody. I was near the putting green and the exit ramp so all the players went by there, weather was beautiful. A couple people got thrown out sitting around us, so its not a free for all zone where you can yell, show up drunk in your pajamas at 10am with 12 ASU buddies, well you can, but by 1230, they were gone. Anyway, it was so fun and it was the first time I sat there.
