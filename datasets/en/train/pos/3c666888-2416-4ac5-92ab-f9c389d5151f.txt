A wonderful new option for lunch in Scottsdale!
I stopped in on their second day open and my experience was flawless. It was a Thursday and the special was Italian Beef with Au Jus. I had to try it. I ordered the half size for ($4.25) and it was plenty.
It arrived piping hot with melted mozzarella on really great Italian bread. The Jus was the best I've had outside of my ma's kitchen and the sandwich was perfection. The beef was so tender with no bits of fat.
The restaurant is small and clean. The owners are the real deal. They were making sure everything was just right. 

I am so excited to have this wonderful option for lunch with a great price point ($4.25 - $9.95) and amazing food. They have daily specials that are awesome.
