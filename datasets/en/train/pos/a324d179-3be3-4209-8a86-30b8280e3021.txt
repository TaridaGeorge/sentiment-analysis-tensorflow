I took a VW Vanagon here for an inspection and repair estimate, and this shop is a rare gem!

Bill is a Vanagon driver himself, and that says a lot. He uses his Westy for camping, so he knows what his clients are going to need.

In the previous week, he had 16 Vanagons in the shop at once - it's a fact that Bill is  the local Phoenix authority on the matter (the other German shops call HIM when they are stuck). 

He was extremely knowledgeable and patient with me. Took the time to explain everything, and show what he was talking about. His prices were fair, and he had the connections to do the things that he doesn't do (machine shop, tire shop, etc).

You can bet that I will continue to return here for all things Vanagon!
