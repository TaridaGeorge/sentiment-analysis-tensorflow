There's something about the smell as you walk in the door.  Its the wonderful smell of the smoker.   This smell will haunt you all day.  Its soooo delicious. 

This is about the only place I eat meat at, Pork On A Fork is a great little hidden place near just opposite Deer Valley Airport.  The food is fantastic, the meat is so tender, moist, not fatty and the smoked tasted is fantastic.  

Their sauces really compliment the meats and sweet potato fries! I wonder if they will ever jar up the sauce... but i am sure it wouldn't be the same without the tender juicy smoked meats.   

One of these days I would like to try the salmon, i am sure thats great. 

HEY THEY HAVE LOOOOOOADS of seating space now!! plenty of room. Fast service, friendly staff GREAT FOOD!.
