Shady's is the polar opposite of the kind of bars you will find in Scottsdale.   It's dark.  It's small.  It has no theme, no slick decor. It's kind of like the basement of your parents' house, complete with random furniture.  There is a porch for smokers. There are pool tables and a rotating Budweiser sign.  I recognize that some people will probably hate Shady's.  It is a dive bar and its lack of both polish and cache effectively filters out the typical Scottsdale bar crowd AND the Phoenix hipsters.  In other words, the crowd is generally low-key, friendly and non-pretentious.   Works for me.
