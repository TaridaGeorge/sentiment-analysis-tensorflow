Good God, finally! you can actually taste the fact that everything here is organic. That might sound strange, but you can. The salad was divine and perfectly dressed. Even the whipped cream on my pecan pie was scratch with a taste of vanilla and cinnamon. The bread served just barely before the meal was warm, soft & dense on the inside, crusty outside. this place is perfection and, not cheap, but we only go once a year, so there you go.
