Oh. My. God.

This place has THE BEST ribs I've ever had. I really popped in here on a whim and was blown away by the food. I went on a Sunday and got $10 off the sharing platter. This place has the nicest cornbread muffins too, but really everything is delicious. I went to grab the half-rack of ribs and the bones just fell out of the meat. At the half-way point I had to stop myself because I'd end up pigging out. I got the rest to go but honestly this was the best cue I had in all of the USA.
