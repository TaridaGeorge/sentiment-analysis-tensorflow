BEST RESTAURANT IN ARIZONA.
My favorite is the No Harm Chicken Parm. GET IT. You'll die and go to food heaven.
My favorite side dish is the Tahini Cole Slaw. FREAKING DELICIOUS.
Not only is every single item on the menu perfect so far, but the service is incredible. The staff is patient and helpful......darling people working there.
Thank god there's a new location in Phoenix. I'm going every weekend.

Not a joke.
