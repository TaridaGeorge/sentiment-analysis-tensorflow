My favorite local cafe!  So much personality!  It has that whole industrial, arty urban chic vibe going on.  Cool local art on the walls.  Always great music on (sometimes a little loud, so if you're easily distracted or trying to chat don't sit right under the speakers).  Amazing home-baked tasty little goodies -- something different every day!  Usually with vegan alternatives, and at least one reasonably healthy choice, including fresh fruit.  Just had their no-bake chocolate-peanut butter-oatmeal cookies -- which were seriously yum!  Still my favorite is the ciabatta-style toasted bread with real butter and Nutella alongside one of their perfect soy lattes...- heaven!  And yes, they do roast their own coffee beans here, so if you come in during roasting time, you may leave smelling like freshly roasted coffee!
