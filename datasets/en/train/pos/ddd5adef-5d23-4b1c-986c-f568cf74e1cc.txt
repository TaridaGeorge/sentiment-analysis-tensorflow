We stopped by after the Yelp Elite Event at Radio Milano (and about a dozen others had the same idea).  This was my first experience with Gelato, and it was great!  The portion size was just right, and it was fairly reasonably priced.  I'll be back soon enough, and maybe I'll get a little more adventurous in my flavor selection than mint chocolate...
