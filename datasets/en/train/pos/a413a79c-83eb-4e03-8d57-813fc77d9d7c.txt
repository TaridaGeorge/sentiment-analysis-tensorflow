(NOTE: Follow the signs to the zoo.  The parking lot is right next to the zoo's parking lot))  

I love exploring new things.  This hole in the rock isn't something you see every day.  We enjoyed walking up.  I'm currently pregnant and it was pretty easy for me to "hike" up.  It only took about 5 minutes to get to the top.  There isn't any strenuous climbing involved. We went on a late Monday morning and there wasn't anyone there.  Afterwards, we went to the zoo to freshen up and walk around some more.
