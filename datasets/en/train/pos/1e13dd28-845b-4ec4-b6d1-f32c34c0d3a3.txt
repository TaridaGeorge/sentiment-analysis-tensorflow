This is my new favorite spot! The pizza and wings here are amazing. The wings are super crispy with a nice flavorful sauce. I would recommend the hot ones, because the medium is lacking a bit of heat. The pizza is also to die for. The cheese is very fresh and all of the toppings are very fresh. The sangria is soooo good too. It really does rival postinos. If the weather is nice, sit on the patio. Finally, the prices are extremely reasonable. A large pizza is only $12. My husband couldn't believe it when I told him!
