Someone recommended that I take my recently purchased work pants here for alterations, and I am glad I did. It's in the shopping center at the corner of FLW and Via Linda...right next to The Good Egg. She is really friendly and hemmed 5 pairs of pants in about a week. The price was very reasonable and fair - $86 all in, including pressing (so it's basically like they got hemmed and dry cleaned). She was courteous with all patrons and was even honest enough to tell me not to bother getting one pair hemmed because it simply wouldn't look good...that was VERY much appreciated. Thank you for not taking on business just for the sake of it.

I will definitely come back for alterations in the future. I am happy to have found someone I can trust.
