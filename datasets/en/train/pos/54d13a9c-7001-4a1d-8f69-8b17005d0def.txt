After a lot of research my husband decided to go to Hotrod Tattoo for his first tattoo.  I'm so glad we found Matt Mooneyham.  He has a great shop that is not only immaculate but has a friendly vibe soon as you walk in. My husband gave him his design idea and Matt nailed it.  My husband is so happy with his tattoo it looks ever better than expected, it's healing so well and now we both can't wait to go back so he can get a 2nd and I can get one there too :)
