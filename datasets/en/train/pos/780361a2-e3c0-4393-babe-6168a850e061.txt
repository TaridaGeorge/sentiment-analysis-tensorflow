To be honest, I was really surprised at how awesome this place was. As with all things, with low expectations comes pleasant surprise. The place has great views of Scottsdale. It has a modern comfortable atmosphere and not dark or dank like most steak houses. My wife and ordered the shrimp salad, corn ravioli, prime rib, and chocolate cake. 

Since we're not total pigs, we split each of the plates. The chef was nice enough to split each of the orders without me asking them to do so. Plus there was no random share charge. Each of the courses was excellent. 

Make sure to put this in the queue if you're in Scottsdale.
