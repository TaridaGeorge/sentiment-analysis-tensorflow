Pita Jungle makes me so happy, I usually do a little dance while I enjoy their food. I have never had a bad meal at either location, though I prefer the one on Indian School. My favorites include red lentil soup, tiki marsala, chicken pita or lavosh, and the lentil salad is amazing. Great staff to boot. It is a perfect place for dinner if you need a quick restaurant on your way to a play or concert.
