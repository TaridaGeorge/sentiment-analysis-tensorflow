My very very favorite hike in the valley!!!! I love flat iron!!! The scenery and theme of this trail change quite a bit making it super fun to climb up it.  You probably should be a little bit experienced to hike this trail in decent shape.  Also, make sure you bring enough water.  I bring 70-100 fl oz in my camelback and that's enough.
