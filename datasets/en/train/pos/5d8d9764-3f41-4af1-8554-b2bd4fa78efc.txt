There happy hour can not be beat!!  For $5 per item you get fine dining, quality food.  Every bite was better than the last!  Not to mention the best service!  All there kitchen staff & the bar tender have been there since the place opened, 6 years ago!  To me, that is a sign of happy employees.  And when the staff is happy... the customers are happy.  We can't wait to go back!
