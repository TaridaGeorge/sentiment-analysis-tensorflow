After seeing this place on a ton of top ice cream places in the US, I finally got to try it out when I was in Scottsdale for a meeting.  Luckily when I got there, there was no one else in line so I didn't feel as guilty trying out all these different flavors.  I settled on the salted butter caramel and asked for the complimentary sea salt topping.  I was expecting the normal white crystals or flakes, but it turned out to be this awesome black sea salt!  I would definitely come back here if I were ever in town, but alas, I live 2,600 miles away.
