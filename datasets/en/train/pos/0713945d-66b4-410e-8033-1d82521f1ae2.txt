Li's Bowl has become the neighborhood favorite of my husband and me.  We both LOVE their teriyaki pork and I LOVE their california rolls.  Their prices are very reasonable and they are always very friendly.  The one thing that we had that isn't so great is the egg rolls but finding a really good egg roll has eluded us for a very long time.  If anyone has any suggestions please let me know!!  Anyway, I highly recommend Li's Bowl for large portions at a very good price with a smile!!
