Fabulous family owned cafe within the Scottsdale Spectrum office complex on Scottsdale Rd. between Indian Bend and Lincoln. They opened this location about 8 years ago and they know all of their customers by name! Even after your first visit, they will remember you and know your name! I don't know how they do it!  I love their breakfast, they make the bacon perfect and crispy! Lunch specials vary by day and always consistently good. Mary Ellen bakes the most amazing cupcakes and cookies and coffee cakes. I have so many favorite cupcakes, but two of my all time faves are her red velvet, melts in your mouth and the newly created peanut butter chocolate. Has half a mini reeces peanut butter cup on top...mmmmm! Please stop in and support your local business! You will be so glad you did! I always leave there laughing!
