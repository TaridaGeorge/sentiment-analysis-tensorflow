After shopping up a storm at Designer Studio Boutique & Tailoring and inducting Denise into our family - she recommended the Rumbi Island Grill. Considering it was just at the other side of the parking lot we were easy game. My sisters, Mom, and I walked into the place to check out the menu and were pleasantly surprised - there was a lot of healthy and delicious looking options to choose from. 

I went for the Voodoo chicken salad and was so impressed and thought it was absolutely delicious! The chicken was moist and flavorful, the sauce was tasty and not overdone. It was a filling yet light meal. 

The place was very clean and comfortable and the perfect break between shopping trips!
