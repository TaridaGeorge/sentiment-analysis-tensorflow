This place is tiny, but its a tiny delicious gem! 
The owner greeted us and was very friendly. We chatted with him and the chefs as they were making our food. 

We ordered the waffles with brei and grapes along with the veggie benedict and both my husband and I were shocked by how good the food tasted. 
Everything was made from scratch and you can tell this food is quality. 
I was so full by the time we left, but sad at the same time because my taste buds wanted more! 

Delicious.
