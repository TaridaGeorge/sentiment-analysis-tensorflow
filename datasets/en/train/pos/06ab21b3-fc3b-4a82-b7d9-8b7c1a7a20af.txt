Yes!  It's twice as pricey as Gold's or LA Fitness... but it's twice as awesome!  You get what you pay for at Lifetime.  As someone who goes to the gym over my lunch break, I couldn't ask for anything more from a gym.  It's the little things; you don't need to bring a towel, soap, a locker key or lunch!  The caf√© has a nice selection of healthy meals for breakfast, lunch, kids and even smoothies and the nutrition facts are on the menu.   As a vegetarian, there are several options for me to choose from.   The equipment from the cardio machines to the pool is well maintained and the staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  After being spoiled with Lifetime for over 3 years, I honestly could never switch gyms, call me a snob ... I don't care!
