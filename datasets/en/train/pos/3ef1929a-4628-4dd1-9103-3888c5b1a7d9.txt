I had the most spectacular toffee nut frappe! Seriously, I was in caffeine heaven. I think they gave me a large by mistake, but I didn't mind. My friend ordered a tea and that was really good as well. I have been here a couple of times and will definitely continue to go back. The service is good and the drinks are consistently excellent!
