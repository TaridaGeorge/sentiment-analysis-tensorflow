PERFECT! The food was amazing, very flavorful and light on grease (though we didn't really order anything too greasy to start with). 

We had the chorizo burrito and eggs benidict. There wasn't much to the burrito, it was all chorizo very filling and cooked perftctly. It's easy to mess up chorizo but this was done just like my mothers.

The eggs benidict was even better. The holandaise was lemony and creamy, really light. Eggs poached perfrctly. So good, I secretly wished I had ordered them myself.

The waitresses were very attentive and friendly. The prices were really favorable as well.
