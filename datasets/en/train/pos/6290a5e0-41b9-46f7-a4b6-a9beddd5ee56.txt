I am never in Scottsdale, ever. But this one time, I was on my way to my friends' house in Scottsdale when I was feenin for my espresso and  remembered that one of the coolest dudes I know (Don S.) raved about this place. 

Dude was right. This spot takes the cake for flavor. Plus the lighing through the windows and the ambiance was on point. 

I was pleased that they happily made a chocolate milk for the tiny. 

I can't wait to come back and try some other things off the menu. Perhaps sometime for breakfast!
