Great place. A Friend at work suggested it and I was surprised at how excited my fellow foodie got about chicken strips. I mean they are just chicken strips right? WRONG! I was amazed by the quality of the chicken. Thin layer of breading and really high quality chicken cooked in clean canola. The owner operator is super friendly and cool, always takes a minute to sts. To be honest he could use some counter help.
