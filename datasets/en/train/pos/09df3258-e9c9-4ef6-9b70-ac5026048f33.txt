iStore, what can I say. This Place ROCKS! Thinking of purchasing an new MAC or other apple product?These people are only about top level service and are staffed with remarkable educated and friendly people. My favorites are Josh "mr apple tech man" himself, Vicky who teaches classes for the apple products, Corey who is apple savvy, bill who is a remarkable salesperson (they will always make you feel welcome) and the owner Rich is also a great guy to work with. They offer free classes and technical support for the MAC and more that will blow you away.
