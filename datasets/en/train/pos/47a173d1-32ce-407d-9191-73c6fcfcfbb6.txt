Since I moved to Tempe I have had no luck finding a regular place for a haircut.  One place in Mesa closed after two visits, one place charged me $17 and the other place never opens on time.  After waiting for 30 minutes I pulled out the droid and searched for another barbershop and opted to try Ray's.  Glad I did.

I'm not hard to please.  My cuts are always simple buzz cuts.  Ray's had a lot more to offer in terms of atmosphere.  The barbers were nice and the locals hanging out waiting for their services made the trip worthwhile.  We talked about baseball, the weather and local Mexican food joints.  Ray's ASU Barber Shop is one of those places that make going to the barber a cultural experience.  I will be going here from now on.
