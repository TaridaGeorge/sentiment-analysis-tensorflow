If you like South Indian - this is the PLACE. 

For those of you who are worried about the bad health dept rating from last year - they fixed their problems and have had all inspections rated gold or silver since then.

The lunch buffet is great - delicious South Indian vegetarian cuisine.

Dinner is fantastic, too. One of the best South Indian places I have been to - including in NYC and California. Fiancee unit who has been to Tamil Nadu state in India says the food is very authentic.
