Love this theater.  It is conveniently located off Loop 101, they have the best pre-show entertainment with their First Look, they have the most comfortable stadium style seating, concessions selection is great, & the staff is helpful and friendly.  The stadium style seating is very important when you're short.  I have never had a viewing issue at any AMC Theater. =)
