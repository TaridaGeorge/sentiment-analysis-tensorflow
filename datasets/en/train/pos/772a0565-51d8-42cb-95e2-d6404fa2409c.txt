Great food, quick service and a clean restaurant. I run a tight schedule and never wait very long for my food even when they are busy. Flavorful and consistant will keep me returning for more. Highly recommend Arizona Frybread. They are not in Buckeye anymore but in Avondale on Western between Litchfield Rd. and Central. Right next to the post office.
