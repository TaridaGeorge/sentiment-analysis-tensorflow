I love Jamba Juice. I can't afford to pay $5.00 for breakfast everyday, but when I can I come here. I love the Banana Berry Smoothie and (I don't remember what it's called) it's a concoction of strawberries, bananas, peanut butter, and granola. 
 Juan is working everytime I go in. He's always friendly, fast, and helpful. That kind of consistency is what keeps me going back to this Jamba, I have like 4 others to choose from between my house and work, but I continue to go here!
