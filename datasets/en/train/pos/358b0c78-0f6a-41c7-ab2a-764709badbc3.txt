I have on occasion brushed up my tennis skills at this club and have also had my daughter enrolled in their tennis camps. The tennis lessons can range from beginner to advanced, group sessions and private. Although we have only used this club for tennis lessons I liked that there was a lot of space on the grounds - 16 night lit courts!!! And those courts have seen some love!!
I have really enjoyed their array of Junior Programs available for my daughter - and all of their choices for summer sessions - and they make up for the fact that its around 115 degrees out there!! Its the only place where my daughter really felt seriously challenged in a sport....so I take that as a thumbs up!
