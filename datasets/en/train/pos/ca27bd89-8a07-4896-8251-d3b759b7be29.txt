I found this place by accident almost a year ago, doctor's office was nearby and I was early, so I stopped in for lunch. The Blue Tortilla Enchiladas are absolutely amazing, seriously, the BEST enchiladas I've had since, forever. 

9 months later, I'm back in town for awhile and staying not too far, so I stopped in. Free Wi-Fi, CHECK! I've been sitting at the bar, with a power source, for every day of the past 2 weeks and I love this place. 

The staff is fantastic. Nicole is, by far, by favorite bartender, but you have Anthony, Jared, Lindsey, Susan....the staff is freaking fantastic. 

The ambiance is bloody fantastic and I feel comfortable here whether I'm on a date, or by myself at the bar, or meeting up with some girlfriends. 

DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE, IT'S FANTASTIC! I LOVE IT!!
