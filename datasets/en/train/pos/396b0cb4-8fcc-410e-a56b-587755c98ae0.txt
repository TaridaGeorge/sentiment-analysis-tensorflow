I love this place! the drinks are nice and stout and are definitely not watered down. somehow I always show up on thursdays so i get the special which is the prime rib (rare). the steak is very good but at first i  questioned it not coming with au jus but don't worry it doesn't need it, it is that good. the bruschetta is the best i've had in phoenix the cheese is outstanding and the tomatoes very flavorful. i've already been here quite a few times and i seem to never get tired of it.
