Liberty Market never disappoints. I decided to plan a lunch at Liberty Market for my moms group and much to my surprise 25 moms with 25 babies rsvp'd. I called ahead and got in touch with Kiersten who graciously agreed to accommodate our group. Although they don't take reservations, they did reserve two big tables for us. They also made a "stroller parking" sign outside for us. As always, the food and the staff were great!
