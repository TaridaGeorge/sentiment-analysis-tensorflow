I love good pizza, really love good pizza. And Cibo has the best that I have ever had. They have your choice of white or red pizzas - they have this white pizza with italian meats that is addicting. Their salads are delicious too and you can't beat their desserts with Nutella. I enjoy Cibo because their ingredients are so fresh and everything is simple but amazing in taste. Their staff is always so friendly - you can really tell they enjoy working for this place and serving the food - they are truly excited about it. This place I'm a fan of and a definite regular.
