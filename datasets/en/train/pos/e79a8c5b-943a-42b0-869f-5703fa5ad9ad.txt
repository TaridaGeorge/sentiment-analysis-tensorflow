I made an appointment for a Saturday and an inspector showed up right on time. Inspected the house and explained how termites travel and destroy. He found areas of termites I hadn't even seen. A quote was given with several options and an appointment was made with my convenience in mind. The technician showed up on time and was done treating my house in a couple hours. I called on the phone to pay the bill. Everything has gone great and I'd recommend this company for your termite problems.
