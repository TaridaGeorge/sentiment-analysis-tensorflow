One of the hidden jewels of AZ - Pho Mesa is the only place so far that i've found that has decent Pho. Its in a little strip mall beside a massage place that always has ambulances parked outside. 
The soup comes in a decent sized bowl and you get a choice of noodles. We always ask for glass noodles. With the soup comes a plate of sprouts, basil, cilantro, and some fresh lime to squeeze in your soup. 
Overall, a good find for those of you missing your normal pho place.
