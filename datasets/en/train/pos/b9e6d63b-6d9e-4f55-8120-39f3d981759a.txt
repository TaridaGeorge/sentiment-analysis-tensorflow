First time today!  What was I thinking and why did I wait so long to head down here?  Seriously, $16.99 (with coupon) for a hand wash of SUV, glass cleaned, mats cleaned, vacuum and tire dressing!  It was busy, hot and the wait was long, but totally worth it!  I usually wash and detail my vehicles myself, but just couldn't get to it this weekend.  Anytime I can't wash my own vehicles, I'm bringing them to Los Olivos.  And, the employees are so nice...bonus!
