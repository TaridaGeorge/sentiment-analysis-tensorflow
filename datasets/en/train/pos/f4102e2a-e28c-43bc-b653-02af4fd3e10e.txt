A Hidden Gem! This store is nothing fancy, but they can do anything and everything any other jewelry store can for a lot less money. You receive personalized service most important of all they are honest. A few years ago, I went to this store to put a ring on consignment. I was told that I could get $800.00 for it. I was pleased with that amount, so I left the ring. The next day "Russ" called to say that he had an appraiser  friend look at my ring and that he could actually get me $1,200.00 for it!!! How often does something like that happen? I would have been happy with $800.00 and never known any different. These are the kind of people you want to do business with! Stop in and see Nancy and Russ soon.
