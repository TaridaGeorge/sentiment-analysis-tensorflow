Definitely one of the better Goodwills in the valley.  They have pretty good stuff, but it's a big store, so it's not cramped like some Goodwills that I've been in.  The employees are helpful and don't have an attitude.  The best part of this store is the clothes, bags/purses, and random bags of stuff in the back.  If you're looking for household items or kids' toys, then go to the 'burbs...they have better stuff out there.
