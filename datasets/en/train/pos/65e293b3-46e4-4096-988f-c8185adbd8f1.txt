Sushi Ken is a family-run sushi place in Ahwatukee. They have an extensive menu, good prices, and the food is always great. It can be crowded, with a wait depending on when you arrive. If you're interested in something different, I recommend the "Dynamite" dish. It's very flavorful, but not too spicy.
