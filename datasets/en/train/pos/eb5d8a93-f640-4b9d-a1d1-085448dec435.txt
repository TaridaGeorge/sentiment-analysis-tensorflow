LOVE this theater, It is reasonably priced and has good food and great service. The seats are comfortable when you get the recliners not the red seats. I did feel the seats were too close to eachother and the first time I went I was a lil distracted by the constant movement. But you get use to it and are able to focus. The lounge/bar area is nice and staff is very helpful and friendly.
