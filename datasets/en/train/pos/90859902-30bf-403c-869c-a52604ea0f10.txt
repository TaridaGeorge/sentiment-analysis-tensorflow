Made my first visit today to redeem a coupon had.  This is a cozy little family run business with a friendly staff and great service. They serve up some pretty darn delicious food too!  The spices were very unique and very tastey.  

 I live nearby and definitely think this has become one of my favorite mom&pop places in the area.  I got the tofu jerk,  and my friend got the chicken jerk. We both walked away with very high ratings of our experience and will be returning to try some new dishes soon.
