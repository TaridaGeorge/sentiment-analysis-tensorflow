As good as it gets.  As advertised.  Perfection.
The Caprese was heavenly- mozzarela is dreamy, interesting with phenomenal and untypical texture.
The draft beer was totally refreshing and satisfying.
The sonny boy pizza was killing.  I was not crazy about the overly smokey fennel sausage.   The crust was a work of art both in look and flavor.  Light, crispy, wet/dry in all the right ways with the perfect flavor based in simplicity.  
I thank these people for a pure undisappointing experience.
