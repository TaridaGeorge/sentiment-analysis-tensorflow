Why are you not staying here? The room was very clean. The amenities are great. Free cocktail party. Breakfast cooked and the pool is comfy. The rate is great and if you book on their site breakfast is included. The staff is very friendly and the owner walks around and mingles at the cocktail party. I will be staying again. Oh, I forgot to mention, there is Jaxon's restaraunt on the premises! Good stuff all around.
