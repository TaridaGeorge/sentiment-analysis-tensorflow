We needed to replace the tint that the dealer had applied to our 2011 Toureg.  Len's price was much lower than the dealer and other shops in Scottsdale, near the airport.  He also has several brands and qualities of tint to chose from.   More importantly, the customer service and workmanship was first rate.  I would definitely come back, next time we buy a car, and definitely recommend Len's Tint Wizard shop for anyone looking for these services.
