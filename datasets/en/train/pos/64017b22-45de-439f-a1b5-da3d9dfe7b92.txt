this is my favorite sushi place in the phoenix / scottsdale metropolitan
area.  all the sushi fish are extremely fresh and made expertly with just the right amount of rice and wasabi.  
the sushi rice is also perfect, the best i've had in phoenix with the exception of the now defunct seasaw.
toro is to die for, sea urchin is sweet and delicate.  sweet shrimp is succulent and juicy.  the specials always change, but are always consistently unique and excellent.  
service is always friendly and warm.
on top of that, the prices are reasonable. 
 hiro can't be beat for really good, fresh, reasonably priced sushi.
