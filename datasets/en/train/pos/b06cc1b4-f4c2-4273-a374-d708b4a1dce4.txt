This Fry's makes me feel like I am at the Ritz Carlton's of grocery stores.  I feel this place is nicer than AJ's Fine Foods.  It's the same stuff and the same prices as other Fry's just in "palace" mode.  

Really clean, lots of variety.  Great deli, bakery, meat, seafood sections.  They even make their own sushi.  A rainbow roll is only $7 which is nice.  The wine selection is phenomenal.  They even have someone to help you.

The employees are friendly and helpful which I find hard to come by these days.  I have 5 markets in a 2 mile radius and I've decided to drive 10 miles out of my way to come here.  Kudos!
