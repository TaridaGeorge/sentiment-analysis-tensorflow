This is by far the nicest, cleanest, and best stocked Savers on the face of the planet.  Ok, well, maybe not the face of the planet, but it sure as hell beats the Savers on 35th Ave & Bell in tweakerville and the one on 27th Ave & Bethany in well... you know whereland.  

Higher end items donated by hoity toity Scottsdalians who probably either never used them or used them once?  Hellz to the yeah!!!  What's not to love?

LOL at the person who wouldn't think to question the price on the Cabbage Patch dolls.  I have never seen Savers price a toy that high... EVER!  I would bet that it was a typo.
