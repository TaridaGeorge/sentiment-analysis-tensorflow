By far the BEST HAPPY HOUR in Scottsdale. I was in Scottsdale for 2 weeks for training a couple months ago and came here a few times.  The people that work here have spunk! This place has a very laid back and fun atmosphere, gives you a break from the rest of Snobsdale. The happy hour food prices and drink prices are unbeatable. I recommend this place for anyone looking for a good time and great prices.
