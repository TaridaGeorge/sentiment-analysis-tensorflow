La Bocca is top notch if you are looking for great, authentic style pizza with a classy, urban vibe. Their pizza margherita is the CLOSEST pizza I have found to that of actual Italy and all of their pizza is VERY fresh and they use amazing ingredients. Try their white wine sangria, it is the best I have found in the valley. Also, try getting the tables with couches, it gives your dinner a nice atmosphere. I would definately go out here with friends or on a date.
