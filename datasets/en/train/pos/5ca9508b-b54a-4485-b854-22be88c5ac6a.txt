How do they make the pastry so English!? It's true, just one bite can transport you back to Blighty. I don't go for thre silly pasties (Chicken Tikka, Jalapeno etc) but instead opt for the Shepherds Pie or Lamb and Mint. I come here for one reason, nostaligic English comfort food and my god they deliver. The mushy peas are out of a can but that fine I like them too!
If I lived nearer I fear for my liver as I would sit around all afternoon drinking the draft 1664 ... tempting but scary!
This place is straight out of the top drawer but I have to ask what's taking them so long to open the second location on Dobson (or thereabouts)?
