I have required PT for my right knee, left knee and back. I have osteoarthritis and had a torn  meniscus(my recent surgery). I have received EXCELLENT care each time I have had to go for PT.  I am convinced that Patrick and his staff are miracle workers. They are very thorough , very caring and very patient.  These are truly helpful people, God Bless Them.  This staff gives of themselves and they do what they must in order to make me more independent, well balanced and pain free.  I am VERY grateful to them( Patrick, Josh and John {the latter person was there for 8 weeks only}  and recommend them without any hesitation or doubt . This is a top notch place !!!
