I suffer from severe PTSD from a horrendous root canal at age 12. I have panic attacks for routine cleanings and spending time in the dentist's chair for 'work' causes me sleepless nights before hand and even canceled appointments out of fear. 

When I explained my issue to Dr. Ramsey, he was very understanding and took time to ensure that I was 'comfortably numb' from the anesthetic before doing anything. He even paused frequently when he could tell that I was getting a 'panic attack'... I was able to deep breathe and calm myself down. 

I had absolutely NO pain in the 3 hours I spent in the chair today. 

Do yourself a favor, make the drive to his office. We live over 20 miles away and I will always go here.
