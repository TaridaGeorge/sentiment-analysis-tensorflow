This place is great. I love the staff, they are so friendly and willing to help. I did not expect we could find such a good place for hanging out with friends. They also provide foods, I love the noodles and I think it tastes better than most restaurant in Arizona. The sits are very comfortable and the rooms are very clean and neat. Musics are  pretty up-to-date and the quality is great. The only con I would say it's the bathroom, last time we have to fight for the priority to use the bathroom, which is not a big problem. When you sing you do not need to go to restroom that often.
