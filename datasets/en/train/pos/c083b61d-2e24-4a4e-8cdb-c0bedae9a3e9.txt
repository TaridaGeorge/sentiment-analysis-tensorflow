FANTASTIC Teppan Steak and Sushi.

There isn't much more that I can say that others haven't. This place is clean and friendly, good atmosphere, the prices are...well...sushi prices.

The Teppan table is a show in itself, the steak and calamari are both outstanding, but the sushi bar is wonderful as well.

Order yourself a sake bomber and a Tempura roll--best sushi roll on any menu I have ever had. It is essentially a Philly roll that has been tempura battered and flash fried, then drizzled with a sweet soy sauce. The thing is practically a dessert, you must try it.
