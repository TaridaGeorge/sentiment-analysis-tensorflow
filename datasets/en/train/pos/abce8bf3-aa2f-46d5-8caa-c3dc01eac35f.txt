I hate that when I visit Scottsdale, I have two pizza places I HAVE to go to in a mile radius - Oregano's and here

I went to the original in Brooklyn, and I must say I am very impressed with how similar the pizza is in AZ and Brooklyn - you wouldn't expect a chain to expand that far west and retain its qualities. 

Great pizza, great salad, awesome restaurant - see you in March!
