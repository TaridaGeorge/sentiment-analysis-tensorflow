I am one of six kids and my family grew up doing gymnastics at Arizona Sunrays and I can honestly say that it made me the person I am today!  I would highly recommend gymnastics to any parent.  It is a sport that you HAVE to get your kids involved with because it is going to help them in every other aspect of their life.  Three of us received full ride scholarships to division one colleges across the country!  Including both of the major universities in Arizona!  

My nieces and nephews are now in gymnastics and I can't wait until I have kids to bring them back to Sunrays!!
