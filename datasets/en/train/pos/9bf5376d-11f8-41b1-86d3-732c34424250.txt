When I get the privilege of "dinner anywhere I want" from the hubby, this Melting Pot is at the top of my list!  Sophisticated, intimate, romantic atmosphere and attentive staff.  The cheese and chocolate fondues are delicious and the "dippables" are of the highest quality.  The whole experience is decadent and worth every penny.  And yes, bring lots and lots of pennies.  It's expensive.
