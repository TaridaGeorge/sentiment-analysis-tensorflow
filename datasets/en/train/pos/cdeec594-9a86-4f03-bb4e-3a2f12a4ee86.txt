When we remodeled our home three years ago, the contractor we used was an idiot. He has wired a number of things incorrectly in our home. I knew Chad trhough a few business groups. I called Turn It On Electric and he sent some real pros over. They diagnosed rapidly the confusing wiring in my home, made the repairs quickly and locked up when they left.

I have since used their company a number of times and they have always been responsive and fair.

Thanks Chad!
