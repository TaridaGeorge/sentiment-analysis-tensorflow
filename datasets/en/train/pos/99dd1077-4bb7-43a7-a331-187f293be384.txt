Durant's totally hit the spot when my girlfriend and I craved some fine dining. She had been to this place a few times before and raved about it. So I finally made the trip to Phoenix along with her (she was on business) and had a great meal at Durant's. It really is a wonderful restaurant. Fine service, great presentation, nice and large bar area with every spirit you could imagine, mood lighting, lively atmosphere, free AND valet parking, centrally located. Are these enough reasons to try it?

I had grilled swordfish and mashed potatoes. Very yummy! Girlfriend got grilled bacon-wrapped scallops. Those were the best. I could have eaten 10 of them. The leftovers were even good the next day. 

Drinks were strong but pricey. The dish of celery, carrots and radishes on rock salt and ice were a nice touch too. 

Definitely worth the price.
