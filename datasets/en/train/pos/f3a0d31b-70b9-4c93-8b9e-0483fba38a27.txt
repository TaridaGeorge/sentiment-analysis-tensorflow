My arm and shoulder was hurting real bad on Saturday, I called AZ Mobile Massage and Kristin agreed to come to my home the very next day (Sunday).  OMG! It hurt so good! After an hour massage, I felt so much relief, that I was able to trim all of the bushes in my yard. I have had many massages in the past, but this was the first in my own home and I LIKE It.
