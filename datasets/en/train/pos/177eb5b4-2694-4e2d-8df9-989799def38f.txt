I went to Sleepy Dog for the first time last night. Not only was the beer amazing (Wet Snout Milk Stout nomnom), but the atmosphere was so unusually intruiguing. There isn't a kitchen; however, if you ask for a menu they give you a binder of all the places that deliver food to the bar. So, while you're sitting around drinking locally brewed beer with your friends, the pizza guy comes! Its like hanging out at home. 

Love it.
