It is so rare, to me, to find a Mexican restaurant that has Posole on their menu.  Then, when you do find one, it usually falls short of my expectations as my Father-in-Law use to make the most wonderful Pork Posole stew.  The Red Chile Pork Posole is absolutely delicious - hearty, smokey flavors, spice and aroma... it's all spot on delicious.  My tummy could not be happier!  

My husband LOVES the Carne Adovada, the Smoked Pork Tamale, and the shredded beef enchilada with the smokey red sauce - what can I say he is a meat-a-saurus - but he is also pretty picky and even he was impressed.  

We're already recommending it to everyone who comes to visit that feels like having a delicious Mexican meal.
