The rating distribution graph tells you a lot about this place.  Lots of folks love it, lots hate it.  I love it partly because so many hate it.  Was my regular bar for years when I lived in Scottsdale.  Miss hangin' out there.  Good place to watch football, oversized portions of greasy bar food, random tackiness (in decor, activities, and staff behavior), and good selection of draft beer (go ahead, get the personal pitcher).  I love it, but YMMV.
