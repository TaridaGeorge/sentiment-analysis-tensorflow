AMAZING barbecue! This little hole-in-the-wall is as real as it gets. Meaty, smoky pork ribs served piping hot and slathered in a perfect barbecue sauce, crispy fried okra and pickles, juicy and flavorful fried chicken, and delicious corn -- smoked, for an interesting earthy flavor, or deep fried, for an unusual indulgence. The service is friendly and the cost affordable. 

This stuff was so good that I had to smuggle some on the plane home for my fiance. If you're down for some authentic, homestyle barbecue, ditch the pretentious mass-produced ribs at your local chain restaurant and head to Stacy's. This is serious barbecue!
