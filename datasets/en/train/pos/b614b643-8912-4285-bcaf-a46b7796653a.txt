Loved this place!  We went there last night and it was fantastic!  Similar to other reviewers, we experienced very friendly and personable staff who knew their menu, wines, and beers very well.

Menu items we loved: the spicy broccoli with crispy onions and the leek/cheese/fried egg dish.  We also ordered the smoked trout salad and the fried green tomatoes which were also delicious!  The chef uses very creative techniques and ingredients to make this a fantastic dining experience!

Highly recommended!
