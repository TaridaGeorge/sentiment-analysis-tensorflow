I am new to hiking but I have to say after hiking this mountain I really enjoy the excercise. The trails are well maintained and easy to follow. But the trail is still far from walking a paved road which is a good thing. Ther is great veiws from every trail I have walked. There is different difficultys for different types of kikers. plenty of parking and restrooms at the bottom. there are many places to picnic and also I have seem places to have fires although I have not looked in to how or if anyone can use these places but I look forward to finding out. When I find out I will write more when I find out!
