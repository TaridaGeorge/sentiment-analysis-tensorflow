I just finished their ducelle burger special. Oh man was it delicious. There was a hint of wasabi that really made the burger outstanding. I love how fez puts the right mix of interesting ingrediants in to their burgers. Really is so unique. Can't wait to try another one of their specialty burgers. And our server Lauren was so sweet. Thanks fez!
