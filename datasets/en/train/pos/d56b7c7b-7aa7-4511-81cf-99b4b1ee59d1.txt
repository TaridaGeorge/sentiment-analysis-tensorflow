Kevin was very thorough when he did the inspection of the house we are considering buying.  He took many photos and went over everything with us in detail.  He took extra time to answer all of our questions and gave us his cell phone number in case we had any further questions.  He even stopped by to check on some repairs that the seller was to make when he was in the area.  Thanks for everything Kevin.
