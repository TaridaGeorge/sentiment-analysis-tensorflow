Love this little bar!  Have to confess th at my wonderful wife was the designated driver tonight and just rolled my oput of the car!

Great time & great little event organizized by Donald and/or MIchael.  Always great fun to spend  time with other yelpers and loosen up1.

I can tel thAat my review is not up to teh usual standards but durnk reviewing is a new take on  a review too right?

So greaty \ service and strong drinks here and I am frankly surprised at the low cost of getting snockerd at B rackin's !
