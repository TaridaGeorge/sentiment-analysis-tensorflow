I went back for lunch the other day, great food! I had the tuna melt and side salad. I love tuna melts, and I was a little hesitant about leaving the bacon on it as it comes, I'm more of a bacon with my eggs kinda girl.  But I decided maybe the chef knows best, and I'm glad I did! It was so tasty, and the foccacia bread was incredible. The salad had a good mixture with a nice light dressing, and the service was great. I'll definitely be back when I'm in the area. By the way, I also heard other diners raving about the quiche, so I might try that upon my return.
