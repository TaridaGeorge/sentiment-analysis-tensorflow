We just moved here last November, and one of our beloved kitties got a UTI.  Being new, we didn't know where to take him, but I'd been to a Banfield in Denver, and was really happy.

We were definitely not disappointed. Friendly staff greeted us, and even though we got there a bit early, we were put in a room quickly.  

The doctor was nice, understanding, and didn't push all sorts of medical procedures on us like some vets do.  He gave us multiple solutions we could try, and let us pick which one we wanted to try.  With the antibiotics, new food and an extra litter box, Jasper was feeling better in no time.

Plus they called two days later to check how he was feeling. They definitely showed us that they cared for animals and weren't just in it for a buck.
