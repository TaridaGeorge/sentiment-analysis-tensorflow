There is nothing better in life than Teakwoods.

Service is AMAZING! For a "throw your peanuts on the floor" type of bar, their food is outstanding! BBQ Chicken lavosh with muenster cheese, cheese curds, wings, salads...everything is amazing and fresh! They have great breakfast and bloody mary specials too.

The service is also superb! 

Plus $2.00 Rolling Rocks all day every day. You can't beat it. 

I am officially in love with Teakwoods.
