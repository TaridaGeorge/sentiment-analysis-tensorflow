Jessica is wonderful and does excellent work. I go to her for Brazilian, eyebrow and lip waxes and she always does a great job. Plus she makes you feel comfortable and it's not awkward. I've also had a spray tan done by her once or twice and I can honestly say she does a better job than the other custom airbrush place I've gone to in Old Town.
