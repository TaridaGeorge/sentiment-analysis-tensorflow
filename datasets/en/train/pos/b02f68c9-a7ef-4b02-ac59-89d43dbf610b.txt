I have become a regular of this fabulous dog coiffure.  The staff there is so friendly and helpful.  When you walk in you think you are in a bakery because of the fresh home made doggy treats they just took out of the oven!  They have a great supply of brushes and shampoos  it makes washing my dog actually a fun experience.  I love the blow dryers!  I have a golden and he sheds soooooo bad, so the dryers get out all that under neath hair that you never get out at home.  It is stellar clean too!   The store also have groomers who will do the work  and some awesome pet supplies and organic food.  It is a bit of a drive for me but totally worth the it!!
