As someone who loves sushi rice, but not the raw fish that usually accompanies it, this place is perfect. When we came in, the manager described it as the Chipotle of sushi, and with the affordable prices of PeiWei. While I thought it was kind of strange to describe this place in terms of nearby restaurants, it really is an accurate description.  

The rolls are a decent size and quite filling. I'm a big guy but two rolls filled me up easily.  I got a brown rice, mango, cucumber, and asparagus roll, and a white rice, avocado, spinach, and tofu skin roll. Both were delicious and only $4 each for 10 pieces.  

This place is my new favorite place in all of Phoenix. Can't wait to go back.
