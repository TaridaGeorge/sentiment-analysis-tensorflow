I have been to the Wild Thaiger several times and I decided I should write a review because it is such a great restaurant. I went for lunch this time and the service was great. Although it was slightly loud, the food more than made up for it. Started out with lettuce wraps and ended with pad Thai. It was amazing! Very tasty :)
