Oh, Pane Bianco, there was I time when I visited you twice a week...  There is something wonderful to be said about knowing you can just order the Market Sandwich and never be disappointed.

Now, I live in NY, the food capital of America, and I have yet to find a place with such wonderful people and delicious food.  I miss Bianco's bread on the daily, and there is a little piece of me that hates New York for not capitalizing on the joy that is Pane Bianco's mayo-less tuna sandwich.

But when I'm back for Christmas, I'll be there at least five times.  No lie.
