Costco kind of reminds me of a Las Vegas casino.  When you are in there, time ceases to exist.  You have no concept of how long you have spent meandering up and down each and every aisle, gawking at all of the amazing stuff.  When you finally leave, you stumble out into the parking lot a bit dazed.  Where else can you buy wine (woo hoo they have Conundrum!), a TV, designer denim, dog treats, gas and outdoor lighting all in one place?  Add to that the free samples and their gigantic slices of pizza and you have a recipe for time suckage the size of the Bermuda Triangle.  Yep, I love it.
