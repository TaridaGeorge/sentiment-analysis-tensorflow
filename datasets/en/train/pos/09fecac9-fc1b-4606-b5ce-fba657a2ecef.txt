This little farmers market is pretty solid. Fresh, local produce that beats the hell out of anything you can get at the grocery store. The tomatoes they sell actually taste like tomatoes! Their fruit is much better as well and the the kicker...wait for it....Freshly roasted Hatch green chilies! They also have a peach orchard out back. You can pick your own or buy them in the shop when they're in season. Just a great, all around local farmer's market. You need to check it out.
