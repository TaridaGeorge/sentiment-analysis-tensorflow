My tenant locked herself out of her bedroom, and I found out my key was lost. It was already 7:00 pm, and most of the locksmith were only open from 8:00 am - 5:00 pm. How convenient. 

I found Mr. Lockout; they operate 24 hours a day, so I gave them a call. Within 30 minutes they showed up at house and open the door. 

I was glad that my tenant didn't have to sleep on the couch for the night to wait for those locksmith that only available from 8-5. 

Strongly recommended Mr Lockout.
