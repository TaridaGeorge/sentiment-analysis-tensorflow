Maggies Pita Palace has the best hummus in the state. It's always fresh and tastes amazing. They cook the pitas right in front of you. The prices are fair and the staff is really friendly. They always remember me and exactly what I want. 

Not just their hummus but their greek salads and falafels are wonderful too. The portions are big enough that me and my boyfriend (who likes to eat) can share a platter and both be satisfied. 

Give them your business!! Why rot in a jungle when you can relax in a palace? ;}

THIS is how Greek and Mediterranean food should be done!
