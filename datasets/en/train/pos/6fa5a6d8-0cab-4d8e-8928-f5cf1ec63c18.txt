Really like this place, would go more often if they had affordable wine prices. But when you pay $10 for a pizza (which is great) it is hard to pay $25 for a bottle wine. Really should look into more affordable wine prices, all the other pizza places do, Dino's Italian & Greek, la piazza in Glendale, they all have under $20 for some bottles of thier wines.I highly recommend Sal's!!
