My family and I love this little joint. The orange chicken is OUT OF THIS WORLD as well as the Garlic Sauce with Chicken. Tonight we tried the orange shrimp and we once again were delighted. The shrimp were big and plentiful.

Whenever we want to eat out, we always go here or pick up. I recommend going to the restaurant to order food because they will cook it fast and fresh!

Great sushi as well.
