I went to Molli Cody's Hair Salon to follow a a hairdresser who moved there. Her name is Ali Knight!

She is fantastic! She does great full, all over color, great blow-dry's and straightening, great with bangs, etc.

She is excellent and so this salon deserves a great review!

The prices are resonable and the job is first class! I always get compliments the minute I step out of the salon.

I have thick curly/wavy hair and I change my color at the very least once or twice a year.
