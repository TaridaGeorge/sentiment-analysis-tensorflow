My friend saw the spot on TV for Kelly's with the chef plating a few dishes and he wanted to go try it out....stopped in around 2pm on a Wed...service was exceptional, I forget her name, but she was knowledgeable, friendly, helpful (sounds like the Girl Scout oath) but she was all that and payed attention to details, like replacing dirty forks!

Food was phenomal !! We tried quite a bit off the menu (thanks to corporate Amex) and the stand outs were the 4 meat burger, duck sandwich, chicken sandwich, housemade pickles, chickpea fries, and the watermelon salad.

Hands down probably the best burger I have had in town!!  Hat's off to the chef's and managers!!

Will be back on a Friday night to hang at the bar!
