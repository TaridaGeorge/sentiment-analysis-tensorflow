Our favorite dive Chinese restaurant.  Whenever we are back in Phx we go here.  Why?

1.  The best crab puffs on the planet
2.  The best fried rice that we have ever had!
3.  Sweet and sour sauce that they make on site, SOOO good.
4.  Never had anything that wasn't really good, really hot, and portions are extremely generous.

Can I transport this place back to Jacksonville???  We are sorely in need of decent Chinese food.
