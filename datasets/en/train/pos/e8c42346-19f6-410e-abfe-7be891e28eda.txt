I took Vincenssa, my 2006 Mustang, to Airpark Auto Spa for her very first ever detail.  I decided to spoil her, every lady deserves to be spoiled, and get her the $300 detail.  It was worth every penny and Ryan did an amazing job!  Not only was she shiny and looking like new, but the engine sparkled and looked cleaner than when I bought her!.  He replaced my floor pads and was able to get a salad dressing oil stain out of my seat.  I thought that spot would be there forever!  I also had trim on my door that had faded from the sun and he was able to remove those which made the car look even better.  The new car smell even lingered after a week.   I will be going back for sure.
