Had a great dinner at Streets of New York with my family, this is a small neighborhood restaurant that pleasantly surprised all of us. Everything that we ordered was fantastic.  It made me wish that I had one in CA.  Our waitress "Ginger" was the best she took care of us from beginning to end. She went out of her way to make a fresh pot of coffee for our desserts.  I'll be back again and again
