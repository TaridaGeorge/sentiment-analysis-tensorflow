Cash only.   We went here for lunch and were not disappointed.   The food was amazing as was the service.   The menu was rather limited but everything on it sounded amazing.  The chef/waiter/owner did an excellent job of providing excellent service and amazing food.  He suggested some slight variations to the dish I ordered and I could not have been more pleased.   The mac and cheese side dish was the best I have ever had.  I will definitely go back next time I am in town.
