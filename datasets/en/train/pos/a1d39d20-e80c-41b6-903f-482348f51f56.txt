I was fortunate to have a good friend take me to this little gem of a place last Sunday.  When we arrived around 12 the place was packed with a decently long wait.  This didn't realy bother me because it likely meant that the place was legit.  I never see a chinese restaurant with a wait.  Also large asian population of patrons which is also a good sign.  This was only the second time I had experienced dim sum.  It was an awesome experience and everything I had was soooo good, even though most of what I put into my mouth I had no idea what I was eating.  Didn't care.  This place is fantastic and I can't wait to come back and try more things or even their takeout menu.  Most authentic chinese food I've found in AZ thus far.
