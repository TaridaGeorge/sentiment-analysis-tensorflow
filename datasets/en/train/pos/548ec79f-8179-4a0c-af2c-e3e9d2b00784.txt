I love this bar.  It's divey, dirty and delicious.  The patrons range from demure to delightful to demented.  I always meet someone new and interesting every time I go there.  All the staff are awesome and low key.  This is a good place to just chill out and relax in.  Not your typical meat market.  The Jukebox has some good tunes, the drinks are stiff and the pool is free.  They also have live music which is always a plus in my book.  And a nice little smoking room off the main bar area and I haven't been 86'd yet!
