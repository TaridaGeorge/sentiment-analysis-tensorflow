Read about this place on Yelp before we headed out to Mesa for a long weekend. Decided to stop in based on the reviews. Glad we did. Super nice server...she was very fun. Food was awesome. We had the Calamari steak appetizer (not on the menu) on special with a sweet and spicy glaze. I had the spooning rellenos, which were fabulous and VERY filling. House margarita was good. Everyone is right....don't let the outside of the place (not impressive at ALL) stop you from going in. It's quaint, casual and the food was delicious. This will definitely be a regular stop when we're in Arizona.
