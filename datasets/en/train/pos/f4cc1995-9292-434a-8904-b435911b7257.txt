As someone who is in a hotel weekly, this was my first time in an Aloft and unquestionably one of the best experiences I've had at a hotel.  First and foremost, the place is immaculate.  I mean positively spotless.  Housekeeping was amazing, and even common areas like the gym were kept to the same standard.  I paid about $100/night and for that I got: great helpful service, free internet, no-bs pricing on things like a bottle of soda (same as you would pay at a convenience store), and overall just a great quiet hotel.  Doesn't hurt that there is a Starbucks and an In-and-Out Burger across the street, but on a scale of 10, this was an 11.
