I compeltely disagree with the negative reviews some people gave Stir Fry Paradise.  I love this place.  It is a local, family owned restaurant and we have always found the staff to be extremely friendly.  The owners actually used to own Lai Lai's Mongolian BBQ in Glendale but sold that place and bought this one.  We followed the family to their new restaurant since we were so happy with how they ran the previous one.  The price is not expensive for all you can eat and the quality of veggies, meats and noodles are excellent.  The atmosphere is low key and definitely a dive feel but I prefer that.
