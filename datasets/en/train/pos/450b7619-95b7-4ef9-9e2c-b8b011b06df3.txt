Amazing sandwiches.  The croissants are the best, buttery & flaky, yum! Cash only, but not much, you can easily get a meal for under $10. One of their turkey & cheese croissants is enough to fill me up. A little loud at lunch time, but still fast and good. Plentiful outdoor seating too (with misters the summer heat). Two thumbs up!
