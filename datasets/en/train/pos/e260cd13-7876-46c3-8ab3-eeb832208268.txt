Whenever we go to Zinc's, it seems like we have a good time.  Zinc's transports us to Paris, the noise, the smells, the flavors, it's all there!

We have tried and enjoyed the Onion Soup (a must), the Prime Flat Iron Steak Salad, Dungeness Crab, Grilled Curry Chicken, Zinc Bacon Bleu Burger along with some of the Fruit de Mer.  I could go on but everything is really very good.  Just go, enjoy!
