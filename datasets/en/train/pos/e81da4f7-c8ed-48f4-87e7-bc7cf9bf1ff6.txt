This is a nice lounge/bar to hang, super nice views, beautiful atmosphere and just an all around classy place.  It is on the 14th floor and when they open up the outside portion when weather permits it has great views and the fresh air feels awesome.  If you want to impress a business client or just have a quiet date night with the spouse I would recommend this place.  Plus smoking is not allowed unless you are outside on the balcony....thank god because the casino floor is awfully strong with the smoke smell.
