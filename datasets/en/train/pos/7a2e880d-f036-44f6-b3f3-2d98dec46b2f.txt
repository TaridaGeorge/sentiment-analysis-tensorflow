This place is one of Arcadia's treasures.  The wine selection is amazing here but it would be nothing without the educated, considerate, polite and helpful employees.  i have never had a bad night at this establishment.  My favorite night to go is on Tuesday's because they have the best deal in town-a board of Bruschetta (4) and a bottle of wine from their special menu for $20.  Plus if you don't finish the bottle-you can bag it and take it home!
My favorite Bruschetta are the roasted peppers w goat Cheese, the Apple and Fig and the Prosciutto and Mascarpone one...Mmmmmmm Delish!
If you haven't been in yet and you love to lounge, drink wine and listed to good music-GO HERE.
