Delicious barbecue, we had 4 meats platter that we split with three people.  The pulled chicken is amazing, the brisket tender and juicy, the ribs succulent and flavorful, best barbecue around.  The sides were delicious as well, mac & cheese was great, mashed potatoes did not disappoint, ranch beans aren't anything special but they tasted good.  

Service was great, waiter was attentive to our needs and accommodated a last minute switch after already putting in the order. Atmosphere is good, not too noisy/quiet, the lighting could be improved though, a single bulb above the table barely allows you to see what you are eating, though the food wasn't there long enough to be seen:)

Highly recommended to someone looking for great barbecue ribs, chicken, brisket, etc.
