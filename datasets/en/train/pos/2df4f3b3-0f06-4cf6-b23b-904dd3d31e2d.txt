My kids took me to Tarbells for my birthday.     It was not my first time...in fact I am a regular.     One might assume menu fatigue or something like that.    One would be wrong.

Each dish we tried was phenomenal.   Fish of the day...lobster basil risotto...scotch beef.        I think Tarbells is better than ever under Chef Steven's culinary leadership.     The service is friendly and competent.      Every experience there is wonderful.

Tarbell's is my favorite restaurant.     It should be yours.
