Stopped by for lunch today and loved it. Quick, attentive service, and the food was excellent. I had the sushi lunch with a salad added. Simple salad and the dressing is sooo yummy - just perfect. Spicy Tuna Sushi was the best I ever had. Hubby chose the tempura and a salmon and avocado sashimi - he thought it was spectacular. I am sure we will be there again and again in the future - what a find!
