I am not vegan, nor do I imagine I would ever do that to myself.

I have witnessed enough of my friends pretending they enjoy dehydrated kale "chips" or pretending to salivate over squished cashews with agave nectar (ok ok... so the cashew stuff is awesome... but whatever...)

BUT. This place has food that tastes good.  And for me, that's why I eat out. I want stuff that tastes good, and I am particularly thrilled, when said food is stuff I cannot make. 

As I would never have the patience nor diligence to come up with trying to make food without meat taste GOOD this place wins... and I mean WINS.

Delicious.  And then you can leave the restaurant pretending like you did something good for the environment... like you didn't kill a cow today. Even though you probably will, at In-n-out... for dinner. :-P
