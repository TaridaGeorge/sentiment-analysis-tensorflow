This place is so cool!
Organic Hummus, fresh Ezekiel Bread, loads of locally grown organic produce. There is some more esoteric stuff there- like infused olive oils from Queen Creek Olive Mill and organic  "Millet" crackers if you're so inclined.
It's just so cool buying produce grown straight from Arizona soil. This also takes place EVERY Friday on the greens in front of the Mesa Amphitheater.
