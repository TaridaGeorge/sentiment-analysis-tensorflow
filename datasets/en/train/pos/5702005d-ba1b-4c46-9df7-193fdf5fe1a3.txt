If you're looking for good, fast, cheap pizza, this is the place.  Not a typical pizza joint.  Its the Noodles and Company of the pizza world.  Pick one of their main creations or make your own.  Pasta and salads as well.  Personally a much better bang-for-your-buck then CPK.  Great place to take the family in a pinch or whenever.  Recommended by friends last time they were in Scottsdale - and I can see why.
