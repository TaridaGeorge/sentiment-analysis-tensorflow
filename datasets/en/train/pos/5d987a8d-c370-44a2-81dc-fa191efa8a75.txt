My search for an adult kick scooter brought me to the Arrowhead Towne Center Mall in Glendale, where I finally found the elusive item after a long search in different sporting goods stores. The mall was a delight, but that's for another review. The Dick's Sporting Goods store in this mall was really huge, very brightly lit, well stocked with a lot more items than I see in most sporting goods stores, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I immediately found the item I was looking for, but had to stay a long while to browse and take mental inventory of the abundant and extremely varied sports merchandise, as I've decided that this will be a preferred destination for future shopping trips for sporting goods.
