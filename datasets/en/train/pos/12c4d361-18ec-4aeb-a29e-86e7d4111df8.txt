I've been searching a long time for a shop that I trusted enough to work on my vintage Porsche.  From our first meeting I knew Don understood exactly what I wanted done.  Based on the swanky rides coming through his shop, my car was small potatoes, but Don treats every customer like gold.  

So, I had several original speakers rebuilt, and an iPod adapter put in, and my system sounds fantastic now!  I am so pleased.  If you're considering stereo work - go to Soundwerks on Scottsdale, they really care about you being a happy client!
