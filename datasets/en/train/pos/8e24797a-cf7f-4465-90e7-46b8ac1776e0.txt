I`m becoming addicted to this coffeehouse! Been a longtime supporter of local places such as Coffee Plantation and Hava Java, as to Starbucks which I am tired of. Being in Lux five times now, love the locally roasted coffee!! Smooth and velvety and full of flavor!  Like the eclectic atmosphere of people, art, music (they have a live dj on Sundays) and the coffee of course! Also they have a variety of scrumptious pastries, scones and muffins!  And free wi-fi another plus! They have sofas, chairs and plenty of table spaces to plug in laptops. And great service from these peeps! Very addictive indeed!!
