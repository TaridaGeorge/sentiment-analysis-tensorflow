WOW!  Our friend, who we took to another Italian food restaurant the night before and was horrible, showed us up!  

My wife and her friend got the "Homemade Ravioli alla Nina" ... WOW!  (nothing more needs to be said)

Veal Parmigiana with Spaghetti al Pomodoro (...I'm starting to drool thinking about it again!)  The Veal was sooooo tender almost didn't need a knife.  Their sauce was also EXCELLENT!  Spaghetti was cooked PERFECTLY! 

After our bad experience, this is our new Italian restaurant!
