I have not been here in a LONG time.  I remember the burgers are YUM!  But The Frenchy sandwich on the menu was screaming "GET ME, GET ME, ORDER ME!".  But my friend saw that I was torn so she ordered the Vigazz Burger and offered to share.  So, I had 1/2 a Frenchy and 1/2 the Vigzz Burger.  WOOOOOOOOO....

Frenchy - SO GOOD!  Love the dipping sauce.
Vigazz Burger - The zing from the sauce, Yum!  Cook to perfection burger.
French Fries - Love those skinny fries with the seasoning.

The service was great!!!
