Excellent. Had the Italiana (panini). Fantastic. Sooo delicious. And there are at least a dozen more menu items I look forward to trying.

Great decor & ambiance, excellent service, personable contact with the owner-management team. All qualities prided upon for sure. If they weren't so far from Tempe I'd be there once or twice a week.
