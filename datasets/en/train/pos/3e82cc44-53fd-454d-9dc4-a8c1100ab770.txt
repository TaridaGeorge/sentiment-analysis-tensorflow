Had a take out order from My Florist Cafe. Ordered the Pear Salad and Bruschetta. Got to choose 4 different types of Bruschetta. Ordered; Brie and Apples with Cranberry Relish, Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Pesto, Salami with Pesto and Parmisan, and Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone.  It was all delicious, split between 2 people with left overs. Their bread was especially good. My favorite was the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone. The pear salad was surprisingly delicious. I generally am not a big fruit lover mixed in salads. The flavors and textures combined perfectly. The salad was light and memorable. One of the best Bruschetta's in town. I also really like Bombero's Bruschettas.
