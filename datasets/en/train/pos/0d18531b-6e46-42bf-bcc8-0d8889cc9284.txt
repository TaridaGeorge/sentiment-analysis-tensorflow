Wow! Went to Talavera for my friend's birthday and had a beyond amazing time. Our server, Penny, was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. She put the special touch on our evening by bringing over several desserts for the table. We were all so shocked and impressed! All of the food was incredible! I highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for somewhere to go for a special occasion and want everything to go perfectly. (or even if you're just in the mood for some really awesome food & service!)
