I loved everything about my experience at Phoenix Rock Gym.

I had never been climbing before and was a nervous wreck, but the staff put me at ease, made me feel safe and comfortable and I had an exhilarating experience.

Great workout. Perfect way to clear your mind and learn to focus. And they have different areas to accomodate every level of climber.

I will be back.
