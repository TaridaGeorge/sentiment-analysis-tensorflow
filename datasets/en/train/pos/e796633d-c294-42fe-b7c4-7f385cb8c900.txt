I have tried various places to get my labradoodle, Chelsea, groomed, but had never found anywhere that did it just right.  Well, i am glad i have found Paws Salon - they have done a fantastic job with my baby girl and really listened to what i wanted.  She did not come out looking like a poodle, which so often happens with labradoodles (apologies to poodle owners, but I want my dog to look like a labradoodle not a poodle).  They did exactly what I asked for - in fact she looks better that I could have imagined - thanks folks!  We will definitely be back and will probably try the day care as well.
