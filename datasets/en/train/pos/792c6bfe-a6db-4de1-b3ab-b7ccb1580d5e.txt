We found Clearly Professional though the web. Upon calling, we were quickly able to make an appointment. Brad, the owner, was at our house on time and did an amazing job on our windows. He was extremely thorough, taking down all the sun screens and cleaning those as well. I was amazed that our windows could look so good! 

Brad is a very personable guy, one that I would trust being at my house when I'm not home even. He even brought in our trash bin from the curb to our side yard without our asking... who else would do that??? He was great. He was also able to re-screen our over sized, ripped screen door for a very reasonable price. 

I look forward to using Clearly Professional Window Cleaning again!
