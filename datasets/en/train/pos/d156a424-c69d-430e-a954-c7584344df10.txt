Very cool place.
The guys that work there ar very, very helpful.
The do "while you wait" custome tee-shirts.
They just opened a store next to their main shop that has all sorts of relly cool gifts.
If you are anywhere close to downtown tempe, check them out, lots of fun stuff you can't find anywhere else.
