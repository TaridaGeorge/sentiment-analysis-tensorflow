My dear love and I have had a few meals here and we have had nothing but great food and great service. The happy hour seems like an excellent value but we just havent been able to get it together sufficiently to get in there on time. We prefer sitting in the bar, because you can sit a cote. The poke is excellent, as of course it should be. We will be back, many times.
