Great Service, Great Wine, Great Food, Great Ambiance.

I always come here when I am in Phoenix on business.  I am very comfortable coming alone and always meet people at the bar after I eat.  The bartendars are very friendly and accomodating -- gave me and a date directions to another restaurant while we had a glass of wine here.

I have had their oysters -- excellent.  I have tried their rib eye steak, excellent.  Their bread is a must have...even if you are watching your carbs.  Kitchen is very clean.  Wine is stored at the right temperature.  Just a great place all around.
