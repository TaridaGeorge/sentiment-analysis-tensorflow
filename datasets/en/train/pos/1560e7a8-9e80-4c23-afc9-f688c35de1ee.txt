Yum.  What a great addition to downtown Tempe.  
I'm already of the opinion that paletas are the most superior incarnation of the popsicle, and this place takes it up a notch.  It's like the gourmet version of what you grew up on (if your're a Phoenician and didn't live in to bougie of a neighborhood).  
My favorite is the pineapple chile, sweet and spicy.  
They even have paletas for your pups - peanut butter or liver on a rawhide.  Too cute.
