Yum! Husband and I went here on mother's day. Super fresh fish, delicious rolls. Ate the deep fried soft shell crab as well. Tasty! About 1/2 way through our meal, Steven Seagal sat down with an entourage. Our server was also theirs, and still the service was good. We were greeted by the sushi chefs, and saw that they were talking and joking with each other and the patrons. Great atmosphere.
