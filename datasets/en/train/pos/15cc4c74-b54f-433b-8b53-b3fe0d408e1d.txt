I was a lake-rat for many years before I sold my boat, got married, had kids, and so on.  I love going to humbug cove to tie up my boat and party all day long in the sun.  There is always about 40-80 boats in the cove with lots of beer and bathing suites....what else can you ask for.  After a while I stopped going to the lake to wake-board or water tube and would literally go straight to the cove on Saturday and Sunday around 1-3pm and stay till 5-6pm.  Then we would stop over at Top Shelf on 83ave & Deer Valley to eat and drink more.  Those were the days and going out to Scorpion Bay this weekend brought out all those memories so I thought I would write about them.
