From the moment I walk in, I always feel like I belong there. As a person whose hipness faded quite some time ago, if I ever had any at all, that is a good feeling.  I feel like I know the owners and that they're always happy to see me. the heart etched in every sip - while I know it's corny - is worth the extra price for a cup of latte.  Someday I'll have time to sit and chat, but for now, it's a quick stop on the way to a long day at work.
