I love this little place! Delicious coffee (drink and beans.) One of my 3 favorites (Cartel, Stumptown and Lux).

The times I have had food here, it's been great too. 

I have had nothing but great service. 

My office is moving into this area of town, and I'm very excited I'll be able to walk to Cartel!
