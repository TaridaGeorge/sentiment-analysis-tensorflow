Another GREAT experience at Fletcher's. This time around David helped me out and I truly appreciate his customer service and advise on my vehicle. 

Honestly, I have not had any kind of negative experience at this Fletcher's at this location. I am a long time customer and will remain a loyal one with their continuing great service!

** It's unfortunate for the other Yelp reviewers that had a different experience. **

I recommend scheduling an appointment if possible for your needs.  They are extremely busy. I trust my car here and I own a Lexus.
