Rolled in here on a Sunday afternoon around 4 PM. after we attended the Scottsdale Arts Festival. 

We didn't eat just tried 2 different glasses of red wine. The place filled up pretty quick after we arrived but yet the service was attentive and friendly. They even had happy hour pricing at $5 a glass. We sat outside which really made for a nice experience.

If you haven't been yet, I would recommend it for happy hour deals.
