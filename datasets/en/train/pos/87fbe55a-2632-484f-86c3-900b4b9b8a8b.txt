Love this place.  I continue to return and enjoy trying something new each time.  The vibe of the restaurant is comfortable and allows one to feel at home.  Love the different range of the music that plays in the background.  Yes, finally Old Town Scottsdale has given me a restaurant that I can be comfortable stopping by and having a bite to eat by myself.
