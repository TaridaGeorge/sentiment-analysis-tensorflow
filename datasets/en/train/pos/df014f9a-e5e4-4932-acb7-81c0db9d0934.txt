I'm sure most people don't go to a fancy steak restaurant for the Mac 'n cheese, but as a mac aficionado, it's practically my duty. And the mac here, well it's high quality. I like to order the lobster mac sans lobster (not a big fan of seafood), which without the seafood, is actually quite inexpensive. Now be warned, this is real heavy mac 'n cheese. It's so cheesy, and thick, and delicious; don't plan on being able to wiggle out of your booth any time soon after eating it.
