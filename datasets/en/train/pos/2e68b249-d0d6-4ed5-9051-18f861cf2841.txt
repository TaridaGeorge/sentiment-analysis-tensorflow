So far, this is by far the best breakfast we have had in the area. It was a tad on the pricey side probably because it's in a hotel, but the food and coffee were delicious with generous portions. The service was wonderful. Hubby had the lemon cream cheese stuffed brioche French toast and I had an omelet stuffed with broccolini, carmelized onions and roasted tomatoes with a side of bacon. It was one of those meals that had us practically moaning with every bite 'cause it was so tasty! Oh yeah, free valet parking!
