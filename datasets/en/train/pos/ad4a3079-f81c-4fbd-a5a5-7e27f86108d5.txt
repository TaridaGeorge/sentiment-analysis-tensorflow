We visited the 16th St. location.  I gave it 5 stars bacause I can't think of anything to improve.  Food and service were both excellent.  The signature ravoli almost melt in your mouth. Of our party of five, four had the ravoli.  They must have seen me looking at their plates.  They left me 1 1/2 ravoli to try.  Also try the antipasto appetizer plate. We will certainly go back the next time we are in town.
