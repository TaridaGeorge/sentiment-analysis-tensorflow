I will put this review simply. I lie awake some nights still craving another encounter with a Lola Coffee muffin. From the moment I bit into it's soft, billowy interior, time slowed down. It was reminiscent of the cartoon love scenes. Butterflies, train whistles and the ability to float of the ground were all happening. 

As far as the coffee goes, it was a hit with me. I not a super picky coffee drinker. Perhaps considered by some a lightweight given that my drink of choice is a white chocolate mocha. I've heard those are hard to mess up. 

This is less of a review and more of a love profession of the delectables that reside on the counter of Lola. I will return my sweets...
