Fuego Bistro is on the top of my list for Cen Pho dining. After the first time I went, Kevin (the host) has always remembered my name and that I perform improv.

ALWAYS ASK ABOUT THE SPECIAL.

That being said, the pork is unbelievable! As is the apricot chicken. I would recommend getting the cream corn with either the Orzo or the mash potatoes. But honestly, it would be hard to go wrong with about anything on the menu, including deserts. They have an unbelievable banana burrito desert.

I always make reservations, even on a Wednesday... weekends are packed! The best time of year to go is Fall and April. Unless you are one of the first 15 or so you will be sitting out on the patio, which is beautiful and quaint.
