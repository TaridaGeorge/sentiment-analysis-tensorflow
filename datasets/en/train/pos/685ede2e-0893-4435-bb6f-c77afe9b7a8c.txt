Got my dog's shots and micropchip for a great price at their low-cost Sunday clinic.  Terrific experience!  Lady at the desk was really friendly, staff was great with my pup, and it took no time at all!  Price was great.  They sell donated items for great prices, such as treats.  I bought a huge bag of treats for $2.00 and all the money goes to the rescue!  Great idea!
Wonderful experience!
