I am so excited because I am lucky enough to get to have Songbird coffee at my wedding....woohoo! Thanks Jonathon!

 This shop is very close to my apartment, walkable for me. The coffee is really good. It is from a local roaster in Tempe. Additionally, the people who work there know a lot about coffee. The guy with the darker hair who works there is very interesting and has worked in the coffee business for several years. The owners are hard working and great at making delicious lattes. Everyone is friendly. Additionally, the decor is super cute and the furniture is comfortable. I have never had a bad experience here.
