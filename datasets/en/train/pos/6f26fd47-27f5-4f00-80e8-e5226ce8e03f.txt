Chloe's Corner is an oasis in the desert of closed shops in downtown Phoenix!

The food was great and so was their coffee.  But what really stood out was the staff.  Each person working had a smile on their face and went out of their way to be helpful.  We sat at the counter and chatted with Malalay (sorry, I know I messed your name up) about all sorts of things.  We had such a good experience, that we returned the next morning to get a cup of coffee before heading off to the airport.

I urge you to visit this place and support a non-chain establishment.  You will no regret it!
