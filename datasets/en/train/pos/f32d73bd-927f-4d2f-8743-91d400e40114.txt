Haven't been here in a while but was treated to lunch yesterday by my boss! I ordered the half Cuban Sandwich, with a side of red, ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella salad. Yum! It was outstanding! The sandwich was too large to fit in my mouth so I had to cut it up with a knife and fork. The pork was tender, juicy and delicious - and was bought from the local Pork Shop here in Queen Creek.

 For desert I ordered the warm lava cake with a side of homemade vanilla ice cream and whisky sauce. Oh my! I think I am hungry again! My boss is a Southern gal who knows that good food = good teamwork. I hope she doesn't think I was a pig! Next time, lunch will be on me. Oink Oink!!
