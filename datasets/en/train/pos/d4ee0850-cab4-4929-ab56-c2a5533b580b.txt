Tarbell's is at the top of the food chain here in Phoenix. In the dozens and dozens of times I have been here I have never been, nor have my guests ever been, let down.

The drinks are outstanding, the wine list well thought out, the menu a perfect mix that makes you think "gee I wish I could have the Scotch Beef (best item on the menu) and Mark's Famous Spaghetti and Meatballs." Great News you can!  I will have a half order of this and a half order of that, and they say "no problem!"

Anyway, Mark Tarbell has created a special place that all should enjoy at least once; but I recommend not limiting yourself to just once.

Call for reservations, but keep in mind that the bar is a great place to have your meal as well...
