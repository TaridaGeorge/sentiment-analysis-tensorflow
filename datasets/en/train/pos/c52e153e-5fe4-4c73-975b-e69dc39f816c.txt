Smeeks!! In little cupcake section, I saw cupcake flavored chapstick and toothpaste and wrapping paper covered in child sweets.  I must say something about The bacon spot.  Bacon flavored candies, a bacon wallet, bacon wrapping paper, bandages, candy bacon necklace candy, rare sodas, and just random toys & all good stuff. Really nice shop for candy and charming place for your children too.

Candy bacon necklace candy is my first choice.

I really really !! fan of this place. I love to be there.
