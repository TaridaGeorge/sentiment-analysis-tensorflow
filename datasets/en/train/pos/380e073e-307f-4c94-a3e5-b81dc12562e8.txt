I stumbled onto this place thanks to Yelp!  My friend and I were enjoying ourselves at a beer festival down the street - and decided that we needed better food than the hot dogs they were serving there at the Venue.  So we strolled in, they had just opened, and we basically had the entire place to ourselves.  Since it was happy hour, we basically ordered one of everything.  No, we weren't sober.  But, yes, we were loving every bite.  The service was equally impressive, and I can't wait to go back for a full meal!
