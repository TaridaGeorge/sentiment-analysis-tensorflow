I'm really glad we chose to come here instead of Great Clips, Super Cuts, or some generic barbershop... the setting was perfect for my 1.5 year old son. There was a small play area with tv and toys to play with, merchandise on the wall that kids would like, and a short wait for my walk-in on a Sunday afternoon.

We had Ciara do a basic Cool Cuts style, ($18), and my son watched the tv that they had on while he sat in a fire red car. Very cool. He was scared and crying at first, but Ciara made sure she talked to him and made him calm.

Although I think the price was a bit steep, I think it was worth it, there is a lot to keep the kiddo(s) entertained. Very good experience for my baby's first hair cut. :))
