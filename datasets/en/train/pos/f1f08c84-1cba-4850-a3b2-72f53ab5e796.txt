Do you remember all the cant through out history?  Well, they do!  This is definitely the place to shop if your a "Candy Addict".  And even if they don't carry some off the wall you're looking for they can special order.  Can't get much cooler than that.  If you have a sweet tooth, this place is recommended.  Conveniently located a block and a half south of the 3rd St & Mill Ave Metro stop.  Easy to make a candy run while on the way to of from down town.
