This place is seriously the best shoe repair place in the US!  I spend 75% of my time in Dallas and 25% of my time in Phoenix and I bring all of shoe repair to Tony's...it's just that good!  He fixing some problems on the spot or within the day and is reasonably priced...you seriously can't beat this place!
