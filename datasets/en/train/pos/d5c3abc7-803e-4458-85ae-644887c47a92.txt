I crave breakfast food all the time, but I want something more than an Ihop or Dennys. Not only is Crackers & Co way better than a mainstream breakfast place, it's actually cheaper too!

I ordered the breakfast burrito without meat and it was amazing. It had just the right amount of spice and the portions were way bigger than I imagined. Their country potatoes are awesome and have nice, brown, crunchy edges. I went with a group of 5 people who all ordered different breakfast items and not a single person was disappointed with their food.

This place was not only really cute but also great for the price and taste. Plus, they serve breakfast all day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays.
I can't wait to go back.
