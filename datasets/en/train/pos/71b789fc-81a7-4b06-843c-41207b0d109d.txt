Sunshine and the guys there are awesome.  Beer on sale every week.  A little bit of everything. Light bulbs to Mac and cheese and of course candy, beer and wine.  As a matter of fact they have a Growing wine selection.  The guys learn your name and get you in and out quick. What more could you want.  Salem always supports the neighborhood association also which is cool as well.  Great neighborhood convenience.
