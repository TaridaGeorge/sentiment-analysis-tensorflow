I can never turn down NYPD- NEVER!
So, like Allison said, what's up with the Pepsi product?  I prefer Coke as well.  But since this review is about the food, I give 5 Stars.  The pizza is pretty darn good.  I prefer the straight up pepperoni but when I am feeling meaty, I like the Brookly Family with the sausage and pepperoni.  

The atmosphere is very casual and laid back, perfect for shoving pizza down your throat.
