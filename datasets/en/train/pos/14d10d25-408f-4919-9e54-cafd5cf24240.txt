I have been coming here for about 9 months after another nail place ruined my nails. Jenny was honest and has been working with me to get my nails healthy and nice.  She suggest the shellac until my nails heal ,,if ever.  I like it, they are nice but not as hard as acrylic. Thank you V Nails for being honest. If you think you have an issue, over drill, too thin, white ends, go see Jenny, she is honest.
