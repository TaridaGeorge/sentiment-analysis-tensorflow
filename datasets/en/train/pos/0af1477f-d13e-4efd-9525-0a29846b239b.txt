As Donkey would say: Wo O O W.  Have you SEEN the views from here?!  Nestled beside Pinnacle Peak Mountain, with views that last forever into the valley - and hey!  ck out that sunset - do you see the moon?  Look at those STARS!

Ken was the most efficient, knowlegable and attentive server - good grief, I was almost (but not quite) getting uncomfortable by his outstanding attention and prompt service - I mean did i look like a celebrity ???

YUMmmEE caramlized pear flatbread pizza!  And funky handmade potatoe chips with sweet & spicy dip.  Huh, interesting!

We later moved inside, onward and into the catacombs of a private wine room in Talavera, the adjoining dinning area ... but THAT is another story... review.... experience..... 

Of course - i'll be back!  r u kidding ?!?!
