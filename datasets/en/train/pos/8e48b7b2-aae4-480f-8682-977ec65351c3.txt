I have been here alot more times than my check-in reflect. I think Lowes is more go-to for home improvement. 

This particular Lowes is always well stocked and the staff is super friendly. One of my recent purchases include a new sliding shower door for the kiddos bathroom. Of course I had illusions of grandeur on how 'me' installing a shower door would come out - a few extra parts and lots of caulk later, the kids will no longer be getting their bathroom floor wet. Yeah for me!
