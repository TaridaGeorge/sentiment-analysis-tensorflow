I've recently started a garden using pots in my apartment patio. Trips to Home Depot and Lowes leaved me wanting more. They had all the basics, but I wanted something more exotic like a grapevine. Oddly enough, another customer at Home Depot recommended Baker Nursery. Home Depot and Lowes has just lost a customer.

The selection is crazy. They have everything you could want at relatively decent prices. There seems to be plenty of knowledgeable employees, but they're always busy with other customers. I didn't have a problem with that because it gave me a chance to tour the grounds. The one question I did have was answered by the woman at the check out counter. She pointed me in the direction of the grapevines and gave me tips on care for them.

Baker Nursery is now my place to go for all my gardening needs.
