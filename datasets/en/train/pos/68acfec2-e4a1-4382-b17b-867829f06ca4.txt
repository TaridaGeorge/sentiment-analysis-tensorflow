I had a landscaper that was pretty good in the beginning, but then they started skipping dates or only doing the backyard and not the front. I actually started getting citations from my HOA! So, I asked around and one of my friends recommended Corona Landscape. 

I've been using them for about 6 months now and I couldn't be happier. They haven't missed a date yet and they do a really great job. Oh, and I had a broken sprinkler head (from the previous landscaper, of course) and Corona just went ahead and fixed it... for free. If you're looking for a landscaper in Tempe, I very highly recommend them!
