Basis is a great place for lunch or dinner combining innovative food, excellent service, and a perfect atmosphere for conversation.

I have eaten eaverything from thier fish sandwich (grilled and a nice lunch bite) to their more elaborate dinnerfare steaks, lamb, etc

they always have some great specials and a decent by the glass wine list

It's in a strip center that hides its qualities but don't let that scare you away!
