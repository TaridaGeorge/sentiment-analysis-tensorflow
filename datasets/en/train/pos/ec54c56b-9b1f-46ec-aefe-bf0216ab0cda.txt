Carrabba's was nice enough to provide catering at an AAWL (Arizona Animal Welfare League, a no kill animal shelter) volunteer dinner. That gets them an extra star! :)  I'd like to try out one of their restaurants based on their food.

Food was pretty good too given the volume of people served. The  chicken marsala was flavorful, a bit dry, but it is difficult to keep it moist at catering events. The cream mushroom sauce was very tasty also, and helped cover up the minor chicken dryness. Pasta was somewhat overcooked too, probably for the same reason of having to be out so long. Bread to go with the pasta was very good, desserts (cake) were soft with plenty of icing. Overall, pretty good!
