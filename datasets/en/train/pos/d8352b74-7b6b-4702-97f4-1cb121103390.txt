Usually, I would hate this place.

Every ounce of my body hates the kitsch.  Bears, everywhere. The napkins, the walls, the poor high school kid in the bear suit, all of it. Even the plates.

But their food is amazing.  The breakfast is filling, flavorful, and the variety is astounding. 

From scrambles, to skillets, to steaks, potato pancakes, and pie, this place has everything one needs for a good breakfast.

What is an added bonus is that their food isn't greasy. Time and time again I have been to plenty of places with greasy food, and the Black Bear has constantly kept up great food.

Definitely worth going, over and over again.

However, I have never tried anything but the breakfast.
