This place is tied with the Chuckbox for the best burger in arizona in my book! This is the way a burger was meant to be! Grilled over a wood fire, your choice of cheese and you add the toppings the way YOU want them! The fries are pretty good and the cheese sticks aren't bad either. Don't forget your punch card if you are a regular, I've already gotten one free burger!
