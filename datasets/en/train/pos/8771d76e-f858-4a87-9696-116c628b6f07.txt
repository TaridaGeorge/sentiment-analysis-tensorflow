I would definitely stay at this hotel again!  The room was pretty and the bathroom was spacious and had dual sinks...shower is roomy with a place to sit.  The sliding glass door led to our second floor patio with a small table and 2 lounge chairs, overlooking a white bridge with beautiful flowers.  There are multiple pools and a basketball hoop at the end of one of the pools that was fun to use with my boyfriend. 
The gym here is great!  The eliptical has a tv attached and earphones are provided at the desk.  I participated in 2 pilates classes; which were enjoyable and had only 1-2 people in each classs!
We golfed one day and the course was very fun, pretty, and well kept.
