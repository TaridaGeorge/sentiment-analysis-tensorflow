Kyoto is by far my favorite place to eat sushi in Scottsdale. The atmosphere feels authentic, the prices are great, and the staff is top notch. One of the best places to throw a birthday party, have a fun date, or just hang out with some friends. Reserve a table for some cooked Japanese food and be witness to a show then enjoy a very tasty treat. Hang out in the bar and get served by a friendly bar tender who will give you advice for the rest of your evening. Can't wait for my next time.
