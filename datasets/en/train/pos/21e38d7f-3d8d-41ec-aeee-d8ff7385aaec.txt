We had an amazing evening! First we used coupons from Groupon. We got the movie and a drink for $5 each. Get there early to guarantee a good seat. They lined us up about 20 minutes before the movie. Loved the seats! Sit in the larger comfy chairs with the swing around table.(Easier to get in and out of for bathroom breaks..) My family enjoyed ordering food from the menus instead of waiting in long lines at Harkins.  Servers were prompt and respectful not to interfere with the movie. Food was awesome! Love the coconut chicken strips and sweet potatoe fries! Can't wait to go back.....
