We go there every year on our anniversary.  We special order the Beef Flemington...it is SO good.  I wish they would put it back on the regular menu so we don't have to call and order it ahead of time.  We would probably go more often if we didn't have to preplan and call them a day a head of time.  The baked potatoes are So good and my husband just loves the brie they put out with the bread basket.
