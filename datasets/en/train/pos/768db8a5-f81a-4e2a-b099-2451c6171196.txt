I ate here in the afternoon, sober. I ate a slice as a leftover tonight and was blown away! It was great cold! Tasted just like this place in Cleveland called Danny Boy's Pizza. The sauce is a little bit on the thicker side with a kind of deep dish crust. I thought it was excellent tonight, but am not sober writing this.
