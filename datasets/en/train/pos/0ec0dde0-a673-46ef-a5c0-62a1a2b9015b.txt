I am a huge fan of this restaurant. I love their locally grown fruits and veggies. I love their healthy options. I had their brown rice with curry sauce, veggies, and organic chicken...it was incredible! Can't wait to travel to Arizona again and return to this wonderful restaurant!
PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA! It would be a hit!
