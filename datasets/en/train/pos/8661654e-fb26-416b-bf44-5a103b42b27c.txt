Back East Bagels is the place to go for bagels in Phoenix. Being from New York, I can confidently say that Back East Bagels knows what they're doing.  Other bagel stores don't hold a candle to their selection!! On top of that, everyone from the owner to the delivery runners are professional, courteous, and genuinely concerned about their customers' satisfaction. If you are in Phoenix, you should be at Back East Bagels for breakfast and lunch! :)
