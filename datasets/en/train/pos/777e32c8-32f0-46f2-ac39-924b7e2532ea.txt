Delicious lunch buffet with great naan and vegetarian, sometimes vegan, dishes.  You definitely won't miss meat.  Their dosai are wonderful, with or without the masala filling.  Dunk them in some tomato chutney for some spicy nummyness.  I've had their lunch buffet here for months and it only rarely gets old; they often serve cauliflower dishes for lunch, but they're accompanied by at least 2 other dishes for you to choose from.

I have yet to visit here for dinner, sadly.
