Chris Bianco has made this into a pizza experience.  You sort of forget it is pizza.  You will have to wait!  It's just the way it is.  The experience begins with Chris taking care of you by opening a wine bar right next to his pizza place so you can tie one or 5 on while you wait.  Everyone is treated like a rockstar in this place, but if you have a rockstar friend go with... you will still have to wait, but it makes it more fun while the locals eye you.  Famous People Eat here!  that should be Bianco's Slogan.   That and Oh yeah it is the best pizza.
