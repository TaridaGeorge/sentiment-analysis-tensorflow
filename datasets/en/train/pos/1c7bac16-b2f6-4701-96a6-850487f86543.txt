Dr. Cook and his staff and amazing! My cleanings are done perfectly and they NEVER try to upsale me on anything that is not in need of work . If they recommend a whitening it's because of how much better it makes my smile look. Sometimes you have to trust in their opinion because they are really looking out for you. I recently had 2 veneers done and wow they have changed my smile and I love it!!! Listen to the professionals, I did and I love my teeth now! Thanks Central Valley Dentistry!
