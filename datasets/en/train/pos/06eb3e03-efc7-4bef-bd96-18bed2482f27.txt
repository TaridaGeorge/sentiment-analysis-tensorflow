I enjoyed eating at Olympic Gyros. The food was very good, the place was kept very clean. Both owners and employees are very friendly. The cost of the food can't get any better than that. The menu has a lot of options for both meat and non meat lovers.

Anytime I am in the area I will make sure to stop by for lunch or dinner.
