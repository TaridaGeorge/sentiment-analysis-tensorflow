New to the area...wanted pizza!  Great Yelp reviews lead us here...definitely NOT disappointed!!  Caught the BOGO Rustica special (great deal!) ...hubby picked the Mediterranean and I chose the curry chicken with yams (sounded too weird to pass up...). Both were incredible! Light crust, fresh toppings, amazing flavor!  Signed up for email/text notifications on specials/coupons.  Can't wait to come back and try the Moroccan and pear/gorgonzola Rusticas!
