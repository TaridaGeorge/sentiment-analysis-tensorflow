i'd never heard of this place and we thought we'd give it a try.  i accidentally ordered a bacon buger (2 patties) with relish because i thought it came with all the default toppings, but it only came with relish.  when i took it back, the staff was nice but the owner/manager was visibly dickish about it.  the new burger i got ended up being a single patty and they said i could keep the old one.  so of course i combined and now had a triple decker.  and i pounded that bad boy.  it was awesome.  the cajun fries are also outstanding- very big fries.  i only wish this place had shakes.
