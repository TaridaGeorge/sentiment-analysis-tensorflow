Tony is an Excellent Barber...I was completely out of date on my cut, he made a suggestion for a new style, I trusted his instincts and we went with it! Since then, I've kept that style as he was exactly right! For those with beards, Tony is your man; he is patient and will give you a great look! Say bye-bye to all those other commercial cutters, Tony is the only one you'll need to stay in style!
