We heard about this place during the 2010 AZ Resturant week. We wanted to go but didn't make it. Fast Forward to 2011 AZ Resturant week....we made it! after a year of thinking about this place and finally making it, we LOVED the experience. 
The food was amazing (minus Frois Gross which is just not for me). We will be back and are just waiting for the right time. It is a little pricey but the food, experience and service is worth it.
