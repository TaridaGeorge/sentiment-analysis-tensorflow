Who knew a Bundt cake could be so delish? Everything about this Bundt cake is excellent it is also very moist. My favorite flavor is the Chocolate, Chocolate Chip. The  frosting is also yummy and you have the choice of how much frosting you want on the Bundt cake. The other flavor's are pretty good as well, the decoration's are very cute. First time I tried this place was actually in Las Vegas and I was hooked, so when it was my Bro's B-day I discovered they had a location near his home and had a Bundt cake delivered to him for his B-day. I have ordered many Bundt cakes from this location for several occasions and events or jut when ever I'm craving a yummy treat, The Minis are also good...
