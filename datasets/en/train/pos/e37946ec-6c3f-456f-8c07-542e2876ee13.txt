EXCELLENT FOOD! My favorite place to eat in all of Arizona.
I've had pretty much every dish here since about 2006, and like them all. I love the enchiladas con chile verde the best, and the mac-n-cheese, and.....
I always refer friends and family to this place, or treat them to dinner. Phoenix does not have a lot of excellent food, but this place will leave you wanting to come for more!
The service is excellent as well, waiters and waitresses are always friendly and fun. 
The restaurant is large, so waiting for a table is rare.
