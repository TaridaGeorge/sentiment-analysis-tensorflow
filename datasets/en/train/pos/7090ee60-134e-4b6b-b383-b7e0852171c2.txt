My fiance and I stopped in for lunch this week and absolutely loved it! We tried 2 sandwiches- the CBT on wheat and the Mousetrap on sourdough. We couldn't decide which one was better, but agreed that the sourdough bread was a must. Everything tasted fresh and delicious- the homemade potato chips were a nice touch. We will definitely be back to sample the rest of the menu. Love the variety and of course, all the CHEESE! The gentleman working was very nice (but I think he could have used a little help during the midday rush) and the restaurant itself feels a little European- in a good way.
