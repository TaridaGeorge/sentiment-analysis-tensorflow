The food's OK (corn dogs, tater-tots, chili cheese coney), but where they really shine is in the drink department - the most important in the Valley of the Sun.

My favorites are:

cherry lime slush, strawberry limeade, ocean water and blue coconut slush (same as the ocean water, just in slush form).

If you go during happy hour (2-4) you can get half price drinks! What's not to love?
