I am not entirely sure what to say about this place except that it is my go-to store for pet supplies.

I have been in here multiple times to look for anything from cat litter, to cat food, to beds. (plus a long time ago, fish supplies).

Every time I have came I have been greeted by someone on the floor. In every case, the person seemed to know what they were talking about and made sure that I not only found the product... but made sure that I knew that if it didn't work to bring it back. 

Let me say this once - customer service means a lot to me and this store has been very good to me.

So if you love your little furball at home, I suggest you come and get them some goodies here at Petco.
