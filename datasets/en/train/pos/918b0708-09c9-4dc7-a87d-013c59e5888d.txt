These people are WONDERFUL!  So friendly, reliable and great service.  I place my order one day on line or via phone and the order appears at my doorstep the next day - along with a little bag of bones/cookies!  My dogs think it is the best thing to have the "Cookie Man (or Woman)" show up and bring them treats.  It makes life so much easier to not have to lug a 40 lb bag of dog food home from the store.  Also, they are one of the few people in the Valley that carry Canidae food which is the brand/quality that I want.  Highly recommend them.
