Havng been to other Michael Mina establishments, (lame Clock Bar in San Francisco), my husband and I decided to try Bourbon Steak in Scottsdale (at the Fairmont Hotel). What a difference a city makes is all I will say! THis place had incredible management, an amazing staff, and outstanding food. The best steak house I have EVER been to all around. Here's to hoping their reputation, in my books, keeps their stamina from our last vsit!
