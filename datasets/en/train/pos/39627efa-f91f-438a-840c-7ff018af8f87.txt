In all fairness, I am yet to have a "full meal" here, but have been to happy hour a couple of times for wine and appetizers.  This is a GREAT place if you like good wine for reasonable prices.  I have had a few of the reds off the $5/glass menu, along with the bruchetta and butternut squash ravioli...delicious!  The happy hour lasts until 7 which is perfect for those that work and can't get to the 'till 6pm type.  My friend got the Ahi Tuna app and declared it delightful.

I have to say the best part of my experience has been the bartenders, as we sit at the bar to enjoy conversation with them.  I find them to be not only friendly, but also entertaining.  I'll definitely be back here for more HH in the future.
