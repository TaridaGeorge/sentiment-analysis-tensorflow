Went for Groupon Now.
Had the goat cheese and veggie sandwich.  My husband had the BLT.  We both loved the quality and great taste.  Mine was perfectly put together.  My husband found a bit too much dressing on his (for his taste) - easy to fix next time.  This is definitely now high on our list of favorite places to lunch.  Service was very helpful with a great smile.
