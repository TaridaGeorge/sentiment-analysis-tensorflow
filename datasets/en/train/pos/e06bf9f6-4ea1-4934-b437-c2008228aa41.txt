Fender makes an amazing guitar. The lower end models tend to stay in tune longer than their rivals. The higher end guitars sound better with age!

Fender uses quality materials for their instruments. However, always investigate and see where your guitar is made. Even big companies like Fenders make instruments outside of American in countries like Mexico. The American Fenders sound the best just like American Marlboros taste better than Mexico cigs. Why? Better quality materials and possibly better craftsmanship, too.

I highly recommend Fender. I've played Fender guitars for over a decade and they are amazing. I'm also a guitar teacher and I recommend Fender over any other brand.
