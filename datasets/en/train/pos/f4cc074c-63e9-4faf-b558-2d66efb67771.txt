Dr. Mitchell I felt was excellent! He understood my concerns with my teeth and made several appropriate suggestions. He designed a long term preventive care maintenance program for me.  Bianei did a great job of cleaning my teeth. She discussed with me several hints for better cleaning techniques.  John Mezick was wonderful!  He promptly followed up with getting me a quote for future visits.  He thoroughly explained the expenses.  Scottsdale Modern Dentistry rates 5 of 5 stars!!!
