Fantastic food and service, and the ambiance fits perfectly -- modern, clean, spacious yet dark and cozy.  

We had a former employee of their Bay Area location doing all the ordering for us.  She knew what she was doing.  The miang kum (appetizer, "fresh cut mustard leaf wrap of roasted coconut, prawns, pomelo, fresh herbs, and sweet palm") was the absolute star of the show for me.  SO.  DELICIOUS.

This is a weird thing to comment on, I know, but the sinks in the bathrooms are GORGEOUS!
