You know how some people say that those little mom & pops "hole-in-the-wall" restaurants make the best food? Well, this is THAT place. Seriously, words can't express how much I love pupusas, and choices are limited here in Phoenix, but this place does it right. For those of you who have never had one, it's like a thick homeade tortilla stuffed with cheese and pork- or whatever you choose as the filling, then topped with this pickled cabbage/onion/carrot mixture. Amazing. Pupusas are only around 2 bucks each, and you only need 2 or 3 to fill you up. 
Come check this place out- I know I'll be back soon.
