I had vertical nipple piercings done by Andy and it was painfull, yes., but only while it was being done. Aftercare was easy and pain free. Andy made sure that I was comfortable and it felt safe in the room. Very professional and clean.

Atmosphere, welcoming. I did not have an appointment and they were accommodating and very warm.
