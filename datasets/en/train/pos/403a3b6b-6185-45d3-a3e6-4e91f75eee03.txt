This place is everything it's promised to be.  Greasy giant burgers.

How can some of these people give it 1 star because of it's grease?   It's the Heart Attack Grill!  If you don't like grease, stay away from it!

This was an amazing burgers and I really liked the fries.  Amazing cheese / meat ratio on a triple burger.  I finished it all but I didn't feel good afterwards.

ALSO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T OVERCHARGE YOU!  Waitress tried to charge me $10 more than what the total should be.  They count the total up in their head.
