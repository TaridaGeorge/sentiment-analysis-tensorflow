Famous Dave's serves up the best barbeque in town, without a doubt. The staff are friendly, the ribs are to die for, and the desserts (if you make it that far) are simply awesome. The feasts on the clean trashcan lid are good value if you have a large number of people in your party and offer you a sampling of some of the best items on the menu. If in doubt, though, try the St. Louis ribs. I've had them often and have never been disappointed.
