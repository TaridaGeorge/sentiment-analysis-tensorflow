Known for their outstanding service and memorable meals, Lone Star Steakhouse's atmosphere is casual and inviting. Binge on the signature lettuce wedge or tender filet mignon for they are truly delicious. However, keep some place for the desserts because the home-made apple cobbler or brownie sundae is an absolute must. Their $2.50 beers and margaritas were the perfect price for happy hour.  The wait staff and management must have improved since the last review left here.  I found the service sincere and would recommend this steakhouse to anyone craving some real sustenance!
