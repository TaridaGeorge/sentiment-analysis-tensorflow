There has rarely been a Target that I haven't liked. The bonus about this one is that it's shiny and new. 

Located at the new Tempe Marketplace shopping center this store boasts all the amenities and other cool things we've grown to love about Target. Everything from cool clothes at decent prices to DVDs to groceries.

The employees at this location are great too. There is one cashier that's helped me twice at this store, both times calling me over to her register when all the other registers had lines.

Plus, their shopping carts are made almost entirely of plastic instead of metal. I don't know why this is important, but I like it.
