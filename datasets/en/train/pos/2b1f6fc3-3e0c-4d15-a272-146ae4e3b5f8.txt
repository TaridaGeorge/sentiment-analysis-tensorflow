Hail the Pasty.  This place rocks so much I can't even put it into words.  It is definitely one of the places in the entire valley that I recommend to travelers.  Everything is made right there, in front of you almost.  Their selection is vast and pretty much everything is awesome... I suggest the Reuben.  Desserts are good, check out the banofee pie.  Hoegaarden on tap plus others, and the kicker $3 car bombs all day everyday.   We have a winner.  This spot is legit!
