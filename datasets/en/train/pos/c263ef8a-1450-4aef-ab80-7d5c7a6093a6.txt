I scheduled an appointment at Alameda Dental Care for a cleaning and Dr. Nelson recommended that I needed a filling. To be honest needles scare the living daylights out of me and I have never had a filling done before; so needless to say I was not excited about getting my cavity filled. The injection was painless, and my fear of needles is now gone! My overall experience was GREAT! Dr. Nelson is super nice and his staff is awesome! I would recommend Alameda Dental Care to all of my family and friends!
