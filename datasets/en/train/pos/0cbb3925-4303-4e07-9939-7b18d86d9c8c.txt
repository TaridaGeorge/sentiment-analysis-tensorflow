I LOVE Mojo Yogurt. It's healthy, nummy and can turn a bad day into a good one anytime. Some may complain about the amount of flavors, but I don't need 32 flavors. I'm totally happy with 12 quality selections. The staff is wonderful and if you follow them on facebook you can get 1/2 off on Tuesdays. :)
