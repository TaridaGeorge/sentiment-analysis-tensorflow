Ultimate Body Boot Camp has, by far, the best trainers and will really whip your butt into shape - literally.  But, they offer more than just killer workouts. They also provide consultations and nutrition courses if you are interested.  Work out programs seem to be pretty price competitive these days and their always seems to be some "deal of the month" at many places - I say - you get what you pay for - quit bouncing around with the latest deal or fade and stick with Ultimate Body if you want lasting results! Richelle is my favorite!
