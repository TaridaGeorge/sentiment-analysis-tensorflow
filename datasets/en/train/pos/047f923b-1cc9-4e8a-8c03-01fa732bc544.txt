I'd be shocked if there was a better wing place in AZ. The wings are out of this world. So are the honey biscuits. The prices are good too. Yes, there is a wait for your food. But I have no problem waiting for food prepared only AFTER I've ordered it. The honey habanero are the best. So are the garlic parm. You can tell they actually make their own sauces and don't just pour a bottle of who knows what on the wings. This place is worth the money and the wait. Seriously, you won't be disappointed.
