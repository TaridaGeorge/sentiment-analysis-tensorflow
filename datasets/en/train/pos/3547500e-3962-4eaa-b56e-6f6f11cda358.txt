This place makes me a happy girl. It's just bonus that it's next to the Trader Joe's I frequent. They sell both new and used books which IMO is pretty awesome. They have a decent selection of used books but not the best OR it could be that they just sell out of the good used stuff quickly. They have a fun selection of novelty items and a cozy atmosphere. I could spend hours in here looking at everything.
