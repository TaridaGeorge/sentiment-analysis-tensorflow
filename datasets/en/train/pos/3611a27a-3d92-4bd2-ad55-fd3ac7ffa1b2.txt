When I was in Arizona and needed watch repair I was glad I ran across this store. The staff was friendly and courteous and helped me with any questions or concerns i had.. I felt very comfortable leaving when i left the store knowing my belongings were in good hands. I have since then recommended this to my friends and family in the area. These guys understand what customer service should be - thanks again!
