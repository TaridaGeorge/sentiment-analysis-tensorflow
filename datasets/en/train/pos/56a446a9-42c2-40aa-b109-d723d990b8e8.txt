My hidden gem in Mesa. Yes, they have every possible liquor and wine you can think of - but what you probably don't know is there is a bar downstairs.  You literally feel like you are going down into a wine barrel, where the atmosphere is very casual and comforting.  There are wine tastings often, and you will literally see all forms of life visiting.  The back of the cellar can be rented out very reasonably, but doesn't hold many people.
