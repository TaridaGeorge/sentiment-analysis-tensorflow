I can't  say enough about Flaming Kabob, both the Tempe and Mesa locations.  The food is always fresh and good quality.  The portions are large.  My favorite is the chicken kafta, which is a well seasoned ground chicken kabob.  Both the sandwich and the platter are great!  I get the rice as a side and love how moist and flavorful it is, especially with the almonds and raisins.  The service is always friendly and polite.  The owner is always present at one of the locations and greats everyone with a smile and friendly hello.

Give this place a try, you won't regret it!
