Great Pho and egg rolls! We come back regularly and have eaten our fair share of Pho around the valley. The staff is always attentive and the establishment is clean. It is busier each time we come back, that speaks for itself. It is family owned, and the owner is always trying to please everyone that walks in the door. I have had the chicken and beef Pho dishes, love them both! I highly recommend Pholicious if you are looking for authentic PHO.
