Los Olivos definitely takes the cake when it comes to car washes for me. Even though I live about 15 minutes away, I always bring my car here at least once a week to be bathed. The wash is cheap, well done and bonus that they are perpetually friendly. If you want a sub par wash that uses brushes and the employees couldn't give a crap about you, please, frequent the other 'cheapy places' closer to you.
