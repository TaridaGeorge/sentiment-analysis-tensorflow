My favorite part of Lost Leaf is that it still feels like a house more than a bar. It's like you're going to your buddy's house and everyone you run into looks semi-familiar which adds to the comfy feel. There is a friendliness and welcoming vibe to Lost Leaf that I just don't get at other area bars like The Roosevelt. 

I can't help but adore the bar & the total embrace of leaving it as a kitchen. I love the beer & wine choices and seeing stuff on them I have never heard of and trying something new. Plus live music and local art, I am sold. This is definitely one of my favorite spots in Phoenix.
