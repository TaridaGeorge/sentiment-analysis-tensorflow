Why do I always forget this place,
When deciding on where to eat lunch,
Here I could really stuff my face,
It doesn't matter if it's dinner or brunch.

My wonderful, tasty Honey Do,
Alfalfa sprouts, turkey on whole wheat,
Add a slice of cheddar for you,
This sandwhich cannot be beat. 

Located not to far from the hospital, 
So you get a great crowd of nurses,
The hotties who come here are pivotal,
I'll stay until the crowd disperses. 

Get the soup in a bread bowl,
Or a bag of chips if you please,
Add a cookie for your hole,
I'll say bless you after you sneeze. 

Bottom line is you cannot go wrong,
You'll love whatever you order,
Go home and hit the bong,
And then make a run for the border. 

DEEEES NUTS!!!
