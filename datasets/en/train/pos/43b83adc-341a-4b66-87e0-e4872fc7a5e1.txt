This place is the best!!  They have better rates than the big banks and they are always friendly and helpful down there.  Also, they don't gouge you with fees like the big banks.  They have no ATM withdrawal fees at any credit union ATM.  Why do  you still do your banking at Chase, Bank of America, US Bank, or any other large bank again????
