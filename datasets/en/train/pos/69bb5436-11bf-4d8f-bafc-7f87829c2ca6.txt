I'm probably going to move out of Arizona soon, and I keep thinking that ATS is one of my regular food stops that I just won't be able to replace. My go to menu items are: torta al pastor, America's corn, carne asada tacos, and cochata (half horchata and half iced coffee). My vegetarian friends always get the bean burrito "pastor style" with pineapple and cilantro. I love it all.
