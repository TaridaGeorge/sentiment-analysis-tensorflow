Great sushi place. 
Went with some out of town friends.
They were hesitant at first because they didn't relate Phoenix with good sushi.
They left happy and with changed minds.
We shared several rolls, the names escape me now.
I love their iced green tea. It actually had flavor, the best green tea I ever had.
I will return here soon with my local sushi eaters.
