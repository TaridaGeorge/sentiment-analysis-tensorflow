This is NOT your typical restaurant in a hotel. This is NOT a cook trying to be a chef. 

Authentically a great restaurant with phenomenal service (almost too good). I always judge the cleanliness and feel of a restaurant by the taste of the water (not bottled) that's offered. I know weird right?.....Lets just say the food was great. Had the salmon.
