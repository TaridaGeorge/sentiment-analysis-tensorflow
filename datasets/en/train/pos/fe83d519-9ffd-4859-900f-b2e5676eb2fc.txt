For people with kids this is a spectacular thing to do. We love bringing out of town friends and families with us and make an entire day out of it with a picnic and everything. We are members and go all the time. We love the summers because of the water entertainment for the kids. Now they have a winter slide that's super fun. Not to mention Zoo Lights (a family tradition!). My kids love to play at the tree house any time of year and we always find hidden pockets of entertainment. I can't forget to mention the sting-rays, the little farm, the carousel, paddle boats, tram rides, shows and classes. There is also an equine facility and your kids can take classes there! Anyway, Love it!
