So happy to have found this location while on my travels to Phoenix, AZ!  
I can't speak highly enough about Viking Cleaners, especially for the exceptional job 
they did on my dry cleaning suit.  It's very clear that they take personal attention
to every detail of your clothes to make sure it is as good as new.  If you choose
Viking Cleaners you'll be sure to get the highest quality service possible.

The place was nice and clean & the prices were inexpensive for the amazing work 
they did so quickly! If you are lucky enough to live in Phoenix then I would 
highly recommend them for any of your laundry & dry cleaning needs.  It's very, very hard to find someone you can trust with your clothes, and I know I can trust Viking Cleaners.  I just wish I lived closer to them.
