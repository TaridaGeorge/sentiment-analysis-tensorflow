Yum!  This place had my family wanting to go back the very next night. Hubby and son had gyros and loved them. We had the spicy feta fries as an appetizer and...wow!  Dishes are authentic and fresh. Our server was fantastic and brought all of us a small piece of baklava after dinner. We only wish we lived closer so we could visit Saba's more often.
