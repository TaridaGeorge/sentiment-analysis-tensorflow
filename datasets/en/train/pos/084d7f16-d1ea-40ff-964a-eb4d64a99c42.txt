Without a doubt my favorite brewery in America (and I've been to quite a few).  I started going here in the late 90s when it opened, and go whenever I'm back in town.  The beer is fantastic as is the food.  I highly recommend the beer bread!  The Tempe location is far superior to the North Scottsdale locale IMO mostly because of the ambiance and the fact that the Tempe locale is actually the brewery.  Every Fall they make a special Pumpkin Porter which is typically very good, although there have been a few years where it feels like they phoned it in.  The only negatives for me is the parking and at times there can be quite a wait.
