Went here for lunch with some coworkers last week. This place is adorable! I love when they turn old houses into little restaurants. I had the PLT sandwhich (Prosciutto, Lettuce, and Tomato). It had a spicy roasted red pepper aoili on it. It wasn't spicy to me but it was delicious. The bread the sandwiches come on is also amazing. I love good bread! I ordered my sandwich with the fruit salad as my side and was in love with it. It came with yogurt and granola on it and was more like a dessert, which I always love! Can't wait to bring my husband here and try it out for dinner!
