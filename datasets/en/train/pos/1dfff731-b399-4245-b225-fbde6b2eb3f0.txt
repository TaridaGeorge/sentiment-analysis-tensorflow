Love this place! If you have not tried this out yet definitely do so! Perfect for the hot AZ summers.

I have tried the Mango with Chile, Roasted Pecan, Strawberry Cream, Orange Cream, and the Watermelon with Mint. All were fantastic. My favorite flavor really is the one that I am eating at the moment. They are all that good. 

BTW if you decide to sit down and eat your popsicles in the store, their water cooler is always filled with different fruit flavors! The last time I was there it was strawberry and orange flavored water. Genius!
