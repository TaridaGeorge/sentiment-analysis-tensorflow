I have yet to have a bad meal at Joe's. The meat is flavorful and tender; the sides are appetizing and cravable.

We have had Joe's cater a number of events and the food always gets complements. Once or twice they have forgotten an item, but if you let them know, they are apologetic and try to make it right with a gift card.
