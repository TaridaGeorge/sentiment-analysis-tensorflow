Chicago style thin crust.... YUM!  

Here's the deal.  Moving from Illinois, I had a really hard time finding a good pizza place in PHX... This is pretty typical.  After the first year, I figured that Rosati's was as good as it was going to get.. And don't get me wrong, Rosati's is good... But then I found Vito's.  I freaking love Vito's.  Pineapple and pepperoni thin crust.  So damn good.  It's my favorite comfort food.  YUM YUM YUM YUM! Oh yea.  And garlic bread with cheese.
