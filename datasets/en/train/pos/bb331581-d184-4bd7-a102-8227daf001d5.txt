AHmazing... loved the tamales, the service and the mango shake! The waiter was so helpful and patient as I was not able to understand all the options on the menu... his recomendations turned out to be delicious and I am so happy I found this place with the help of yelp! I hope if you want so authentic food you give this place a try you will love it :) The presentation of the food also was impressive... and it tasted as great as it looked!
