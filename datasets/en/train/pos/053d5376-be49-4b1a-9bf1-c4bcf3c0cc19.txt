Wait a minute - am I actually writing about a tire shop?!  yup (wow)

Very prompt and efficient service.  

The workers practically salute & snap to attention, running this way and that each time we take the RV in to check the tire pressure.  (Which is sometimes every other month).  

You get in and out in no time, even on a Saturday. 

Special tire orders, if there's a slight chance it's not in style, takes 24-48hrs.  (speaking of which, I have 2 waiting to be picked up - gotta go)
