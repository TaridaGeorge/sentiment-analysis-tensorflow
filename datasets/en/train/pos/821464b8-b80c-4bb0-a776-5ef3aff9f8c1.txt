Foodies Alert!  Eat here now!  Not the best dining room but definitely the best food in the Valley and an impressive wine list to boot.  You will be very happy with your meal.  Unique flavor combos.  Super rich.  The menu is mostly meat dishes with southwestern influenced sauces.  

My picks? The chopped salad is a must.  The miso spicy squid rocks.  The mushroom pan fry is unbelievable but so rich you should opt for the "mini" portion. And save room for dessert.

The cuppa hot chocolate ("cinnamon-spiked chocolate pot de creme with chipotle crema, ancho chile honey, cayenne-spiked ginger cookie") is without a doubt the BEST BEST BEST dessert I have ever had ANYWHERE.  The thought of it tears me up.  Spicy, sweet, creamy goodness.  This is heaven.
