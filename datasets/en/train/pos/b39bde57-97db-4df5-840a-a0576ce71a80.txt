This is place is so cute and in the perfect location...I go here to get special cards and stationary every now and then...it is on the pricey side but everytime I have gone in here they are sooooooo nice!  It is such a lovely little store and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they do not mind spending a little more on it!  You can do special orders for weddings and parties...I have never ordered anything from here but it looks like it would be fun (but expensive)....Try it!
