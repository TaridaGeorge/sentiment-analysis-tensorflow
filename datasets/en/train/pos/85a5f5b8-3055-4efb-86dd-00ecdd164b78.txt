Best, BBQ, ever.

It made the 12-hour drive worth it.  

Between three people, we had the Hog Heaven: chicken, St. Louis ribs, babyback ribs, and brisket.

The sides were awesome too!  All of them!  

The service was also excellent.  Manager came by and asked if everything was alright and the place was packed.

Afterwards, we went to the lounge that's connected to the restaurant called Q-Lounge.  There were a lot of fat chicks.

Apparently the owners traveled all across America and sampled different types of BBQ and thereafter, created Bobby-Q.
