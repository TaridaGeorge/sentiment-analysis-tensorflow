I stayed at the Clarendon from Thursday, February 4th to Monday, February 8th.  Although my reservations had been made through a large travel firm, I was booked by the large firm into an incorrect type of room.  The staff at the Clarendon, both the desk clerks and the maids, were extremely helpful and friendly.   They moved me to the room of my choice with no problem.  The bed was incredibly comfortable and the rooms had comfy and hip furnishings.  
I spent a lot of time by the gorgeous pool (LOVE that waterwall!) and at the rooftop bar.  The restaurant in the hotel is fabulous!
I will definitely stay there again but I'll book directly next time since the Clarendon will match any on-line offers.
