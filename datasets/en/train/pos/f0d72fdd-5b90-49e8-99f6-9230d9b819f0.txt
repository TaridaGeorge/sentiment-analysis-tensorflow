"This restaurant is always busy!" (Lunch, Dinner, Winter, Summer)
The quality of food in this restaurant is Primo!

I feel by stating the fact above I've given you an idea how good the food is...  

I've tried the appetizers, the salads, the Falafels, the Gyros, & the "hummus!" 
"Oh the Hummus!" 
My favorite is the "Hummus with the seared Ahi!"

I've never had a bad meal here! The service has always been great. They get your food to you fast...Also the waiting staff is very bohemian, which makes dinning here even more interesting! This is not a stuffy upscale restaurant, but the food is as good if not better than most of the overpriced joints around town!

My only complaint is that it is always busy, & therefore loud!
