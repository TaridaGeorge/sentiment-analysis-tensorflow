One of the best burgers in town by far, make sure you get tender belly bacon on it though!  church potatoes are easily the best side, ask for them off the griddle!  and always walk next door to churn and get some ice cream.  great place for kids.  and if you go you must you must order the cheddar fondue with pretzels, they are ridiculous good.
