Just simply excellent- really friendly staff, simple and spacious atmosphere, and the food- yum, yum, yum.  We had the beat salad- very flavorful, The trio of pasta- so many delicious flavors, but not overwhelming, and the capellini was a little bit of heaven if heaven were a perfect pasta.  Highly recommend.
