Over the last few weeks, I have been to this ACE Hardware store about 20 times, as I am restoring a 1970's boat. They have everything that Home Depot and Lowes doesn't have... A lot of odd nuts and bolts, stainless steel stuff that you can't find anywhere else. Very friendly staff, right off the 101 Fwy., they have been really helpful and they have "the goods!"
