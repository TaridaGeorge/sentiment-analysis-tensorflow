I have not been in alooong time to get anything pierced but as soon as I turned 18 I did the belly, then eventually the tongue and then the nose followed. I took atleast 10 friends there to hold there hand's. Oi I would still reccommend them to anyone when you walk in it feels cleaner than a hospital that's no joke. They are super cool and they know their sh*t deff pro's there!
