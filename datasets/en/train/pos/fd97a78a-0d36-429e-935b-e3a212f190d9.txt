I'm a fan of this small family place. My husband and I love to go here and have dinner. Their special hummus is always impressive.  My husband tells me that their lamb cannot be beat. I've had a bite of his, and always found it to be very tasty.  I've tried so many things on the menu, and have never had something that I didn't enjoy.  They offer a wonderful happy hour, and one weekend a month they have a belly dancer in.
