My favorite hotdog place.   Most hotdogs at restaurants are awful.   Teds rocks.

It is not cheapest place, but its worth it.

The fries are not good, but I don't care.

The hotdogs are great.  Period.   End of story.

Many places have gone to "super size" dogs that use huge, bland wieners with no taste and cheap meat.   Ted's serves the classic size dog, with just the right balance of dog, bun, and toppings.

I don't eat there often.    But it is on top of my list.
