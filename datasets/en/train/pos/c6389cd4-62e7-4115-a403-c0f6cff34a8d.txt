I've recently discovered Vegetas hummus at Whole Foods.  It's the ones with the black lids.  I've tasted the Kalamata Olive and the Jalapeno flavors.  Oh my, were they good or what!  I really should try some other flavors but I have gone back two more times and got the same ones.  If you like hummus, this brand has to be one of the best out there.
