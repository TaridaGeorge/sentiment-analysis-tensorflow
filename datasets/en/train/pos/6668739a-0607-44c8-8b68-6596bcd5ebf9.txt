Delicious food, delicious drinks, wonderful customer service, and reasonable prices. I've been through Phoenix twice and I must confess that 32 Shea is one of my two favorite restaurants in the greater Phoenix area.

There was a chance that I would have to move to Phoenix for work in the next year or so, but I've been accepted elsewhere. 32 Shea was one of those places that made me slightly regret my decision. For anyone visiting Phoenix, it's a must-eat place. For anyone who lives in the Phoenix area, shame on you for not trying it sooner.

It's not a rowdy place. It was relatively quiet and relaxing when we were there. There was a cute and charming ambiance. I'll probably be driving through Phoenix again in May and I will definitely stop by this place at least once.
