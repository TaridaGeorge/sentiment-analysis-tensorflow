Such a jewel here in Phoenix.    The Heard Museum has one of  the best Native American presentations.     It is well thought out and exhibits continue to change to wet your appetite for another visit.    It is a must visit whenever you are in Phoenix.   I highly recommend that you visit the Heard Museum.
