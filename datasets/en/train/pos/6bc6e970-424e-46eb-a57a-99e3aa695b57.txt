Awesome place.
Burgers are sometimes a little salty, but for the most part they are always good.
Fries are great, and with their fry sauce, they are simply the best. 
To cook is always friendly, and the girls working the counter are always nice & never pushy.

I found that the owner although very nice, can be a little protective over his fry sauce. Either that or I am a pig with the fry sauce. I can't help it, it's amazing.

I like that they not only have the 3lb burger challenge, but also have pics of people that completed it. The one that blows me away is the picture of this petite little girl who has completed the challenge 3 times, and most recent time was in a little over 4 minutes. 

All in all, I love this place.
