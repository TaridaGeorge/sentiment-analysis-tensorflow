I bought a massage certificate a few months ago for Tranquil Massage.  I was kind of wondering what I would get for such a great deal.....and it was wonderful!  
Megan took the time to ask me about what areas were going to need the most work (I spend ALL day on a computer, so the neck and shoulders take the brunt of the punishment), and how long I wanted her to spend working out those kinks.  She took care of them, plus the lower back, areas that needed it too!  
This is what Megan loves doing and she has a great natural talent I think.  Will be back to see her again, that's for sure!!
