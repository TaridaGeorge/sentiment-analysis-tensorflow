Meals for only $5!!!  It isn't just limited to lunch time specials.  I have a hard time spending $10 a plate a Thai places when they sell the same things for $6 or $7 as a lunch special.  

However this place is my next favorite Thai place now.  I just wish it was closer.  

Looking forward to trying the Pumpkin Curry soon.
