My husband and I live nearby so we often walk over to this Wal-Mart Neighborhood Market and pick up something to make for dinner and a movie from Redbox. The staff when we go (anywhere from 6pm-midnight) is usually friendly and the store itself is always clean. 

The only strange thing, and I hesitate to call it strange since we were the ones walking to Wal-Mart in the middle of the night, was an employee on break playing a video game and talking to himself. Big deal though! He was on break and was just involved in what he was doing.

We come here a lot which must mean we like it. Sooo....five stars!
