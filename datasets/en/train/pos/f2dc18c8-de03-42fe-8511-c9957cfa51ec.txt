This place is awesome some of the best Thai food I've had in a long time. Don't let the lackluster interior fool you because there is some amazing food to be had here. My personal favorite Thai dish is the yellow curry with potatoes and onions. Johns is the red curry. They give you a 1-4 scale of how spicy you like and be cautious because when they say hot they mean HOTTTT... But its soooo good. I have only seen one lady working there besides who ever is in the kitchen but she still provides pretty good service even when they are busy.  Overall this is my new favorite spot for Thai food and definitely worth the drive its not close by for you.
