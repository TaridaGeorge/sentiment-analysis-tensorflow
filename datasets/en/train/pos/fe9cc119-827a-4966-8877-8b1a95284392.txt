Was skeptical at first. I mean how is it possible to get fresh sushi out in the middle of the desert? As it turned out, place was great. Food was delicious and service was excellent. Do yourself a favor and splurge on the  ROKA AKOR Rice Hot Pot, it was about the tastiest rice hot pot I have had. Imagine it like this, part risotto, part porridge, now add truffle oil and shitake mushrooms and herbs. It is awesome.

Trying this place while visiting from LA did not disappoint. Will be back again.
