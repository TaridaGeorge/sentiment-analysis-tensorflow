I am in love with what this place has become! It used to be an eyeglass grinding factory [my older brother in law tells me that was his first job out of high school] and now you can meet your graphic design firm, buy your funky [or Bunky?] vintage ensemble and get a great baked-egg and prosciutto breakfast with your delicious caffeinated beverage, all without braving the shaded sidewalk! 

Use your plastic to pay for breakfast - you just have to gesture your signature on their wi fi iPad.

Have your business meeting, do your homework, or just people watch. 

For hours like I did the other day, they don't mind [yet]. 

I guess THIS is why they don't bulldoze good old buildings ...
