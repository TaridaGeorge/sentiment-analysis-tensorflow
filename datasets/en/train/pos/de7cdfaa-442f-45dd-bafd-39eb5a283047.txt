I am from Florida and went to the cafe for breakfast with my daughter. The food was excellent, the price was great and service was on spot. We met the owner Dawn as she was the checkout person. What a nice person. We will definitely go back. As a matter of fact, I am going there this morning. I am retired law enforcement and knew it would be clean and good food when I saw Phoenixs best in there.
