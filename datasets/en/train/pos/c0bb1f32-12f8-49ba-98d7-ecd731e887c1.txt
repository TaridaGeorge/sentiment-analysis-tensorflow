I'm a Texas Girl, born and raised and I KNOW good BBQ when I taste it! This wasn't good BBQ - this was heaven! My husband got the moist brisket - loved it. I got the leanest cut of brisket they had - no fat, smoked beyond perfection and just about the most delicious thing I've eaten. The pinto beans were awesome and I could have cried over the creamed corn. 
I live in Colorado but I would seriously go to Scottsdale just to EAT at Texas BBQ House.
