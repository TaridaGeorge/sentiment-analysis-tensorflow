Wow. My wife and I are diehard foodies. We now wish everyday was an Eddie V's day. This place was awesome. It exceeded every expectation. We used to go to Ocean Club weekly but we have converted to Eddie V's. they don't pack you in like sardines as OC does. Service is better. Food is as good if not better. The bar is unbelievably comfortable and the live music is some of the best I've heard. Do yourself a favor and drop OC and come over to Eddie. The Banana Foster is a gift from the food gods.
