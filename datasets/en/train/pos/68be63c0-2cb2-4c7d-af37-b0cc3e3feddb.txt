brand new place the food is great big burgers and they are not shy about serving size plenty of food even for a big eater. my personal favorite was the tomato basil flatbread. my son enjoyed the asian  short ribs with hoisin bar b que sauce. my wife had the steak called the twin fillets. we missed the happy hour but we will be back for their great specials.
