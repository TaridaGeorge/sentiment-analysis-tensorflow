To start everything is made from scratch and the bread and dough for the pizza are just a small offering in fresh items.  The daily specials that actually change daily show that Pino is in it to win it.  

My family at party of eight had a wonderful night and all the food including the pizza carnivore (fresh made sausage), spaghetti and meatballs, chicken salad and  my mother asked if they could make chicken parm  (which is the best item they make) even though it is not on the menu and is usually a special for weekends.  Always a great place and as everyone else in their review has said Pino will come out to talk to you and the wait staff does remember and care about their job.  

The food above all speaks for itself, go enjoy.
