I've always loved Pita Jungle. I was so excited to discover they opened a new one by me in front of Arrowhead Towne Center (even though I still have not been there yet...)
We always start with the cilantro and jalapeno hummus. Just a tip: the small is a big serving. Usually perfect for 3-4 people. Just order extra pita or veggies.
I have loved everything I ever tried there. This time I had the Seafood Provencal. It was so good I wanted to lick the bowl clean.
I've tried many things here and it seems Pita Jungle can do no wrong.
This needs to become a new staple for me.
