Scratch is my current favorite restaurant of all time.  They've got it all.  Most importantly, they've got an interesting menu.  I've been spending a lot of time in Old Town lately, been in four times in the past week and it never got old.  Items lean toward the french side with the croque madame, quiche, brie sandwich, etc.  Only the freshest ingredients.  The eggs are so good and I don't even like eggs.  Many healthier items on the menu, but the most decadent desserts too.  Great coffee and their own croissants in the morning.  They've become a popular neighborhood place as word's gotten out.  Success often shows up in attitude from a restaurant's people, but their people are always so solicitous and we always get great service no matter how busy they are.  I sincerely hope Scratch is around for a long, long time.
