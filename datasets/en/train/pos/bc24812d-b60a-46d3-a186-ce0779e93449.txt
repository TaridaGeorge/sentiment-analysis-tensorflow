Awesome.  Staff and management very friendly.  Salads are amazing - built to your instructions and while you have a limited number of toppings (five for the large salad I think) the quantity of the topping is not.  "How many hard boiled eggs would you like, sir?"  Sandwiches are great - good toppings and meat, but the bread is exceptional.  You will not leave here hungry.

These sandwiches put Port-o-Subs and Quiznos to shame.  Subway isn't even in the same zip code with these guys.

Clean and new.  Maybe a little spartan on the decor but I'm sure they will improve that.

Please support local businesses and this is one of them.  But you don't need the politcal angle to encourage patronage here - the product is outstanding!
