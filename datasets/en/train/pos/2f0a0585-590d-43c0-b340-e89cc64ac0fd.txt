Lucky Strike is by far the best bowling alley I've ever been to.  The atmosphere is super cool and loungey, service is on point, really cool prints on the walls, great food (love the mini-burgers), and one of my favorite parts....giant TVs with sports on all over the place
I am the store manager of Urban Outfitters at CityScape, and we recently had our store's Holiday Party here...let me say that Lucky Strike was more than accommodating, highly recommended!
