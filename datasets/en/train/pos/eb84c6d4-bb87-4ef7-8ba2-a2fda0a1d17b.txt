The owner was awesome enough to open the bar up early for all us footballer fans who wanted to see Man U take down Arsenal.  I got there a little later, but the bartenders were happy to be serving drinks, and everybody was pretty wasted.  I just had a selection of their beers.  Doing the Hef, Peach Ale (I blame my guy friend for ordering it first), and the Summer.  All were awesome and the bartenders knew to keep pouring us water as the day went on.
I didn't get any food, but everyone who did got it promptly and loved it.  They definitely don't skimp on the food.
I am coming back for all of the morning Man U games.  Arsenal sucks!
