I love this place because it is truly just a great place to go get a good work-out. Not crowded, nobody bothers you, clean, great machines and friendly people. Folks just go there to work out, not to socialize or cruise and that's what I like. Unfortunately they are closing and I'm very sad about that, but have just been told that they are actually moving to 7th St and Missouri, which is even closer to my house. I hope that is true, and not just a rumor. I will definitely follow.
