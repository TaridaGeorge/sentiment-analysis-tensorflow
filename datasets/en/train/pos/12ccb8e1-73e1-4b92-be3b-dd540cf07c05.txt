I had THE BEST pork belly here ever!! When the dish came, I was confused with all the belly fat and not much meat.  After I bite into it, I saw the food heaven!! I can forget all about how fat and evil it is.  My hubby and I were literally fighting for it, haha!
The stetson chop salad was not bad.  The mushroom dish was very hearty.  Bread pudding was divine!
If we were local, that would be our usual for sure!
