I love Dr. Patel. He has been the best physician I've ever had in USA. I get appointments quickly in case of urgency. He not only listens to the problem but also takes extra precautionary measures (being extra thorough).

Some doctors will just give you medicine for whatever symptoms you tell them but Dr. Patel will ensure that you are cured of not only that disease but don't have any other issues either.

If you tend to avoid medicines then you'd need to tell him and he can work with you.
