As a vegetarian, when I first saw the menu I was dismayed, no vegetarian entries...However, when I requested a plate of vegetables, the waitress was extremely accommodating and spoke to the chef. A veggie tower with balsamic reduction appeared! Yes, the same veggie tower is now on the menu! I would love to see more non meat items, but for quality, atmosphere, and price for a local neighborhood establishment, Beckett's Table is a fabulous experience.
