As a vegetarian, it is sometimes hard to find delicious and flavorful food when going out. Udupi's vegetarian lunch buffet is AM-AZ-ING. I have yet to try anything there that I didn't like, and I am a very picky eater. I've never been for dinner, but I have done the lunch buffet many times now. They always have new dishes to try and everything always tastes incredible. The staff is always attentive, and even suggested a spicy soup to clear up my cold one day. Even my boyfriend, who is a serious meat eater, bugs me to go there all the time. I will definitely go there whenever in the mood for some great Indian food.
