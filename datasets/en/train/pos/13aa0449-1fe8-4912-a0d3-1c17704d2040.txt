This is what the whole valley needed for a long time.  This IS the best venue for music in town.  The size, location, decor, and food/drink are all right on the money.  Ha, you need to go, even if you don't like hanging out with the abundance of hipsters and such.   The place is way cool and needs to be the focus of an entire city renovation.
