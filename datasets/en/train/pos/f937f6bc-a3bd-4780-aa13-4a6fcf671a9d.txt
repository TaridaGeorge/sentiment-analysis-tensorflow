We just got back from Arizona and we can't stop talking about our experience at Cafe' Monarch; it was an incredible, intimate, and delicious dining experience.  Chef Chris was a warm and funny host, who kept us on our culinary toes, in terms of surprising us with innovative and beautiful dishes that were packed full of flavor.  We have family in Arizona, and now we have two great reasons to visit!  Thanks Chef Chris for a wonderful evening!
