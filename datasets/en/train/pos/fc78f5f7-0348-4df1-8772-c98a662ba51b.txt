For the middle of the desert this sushi restaurant/ bar is wonderful. The quality and portions of sushi and sashimi is very satisfactory. the service is marginal as expected for a bar style restaurant. This is now the fourth time in the past month I have visited and have had the same quality food every time. Happy hour provides a good atmosphere with reasonably priced drinks and sushi rolls!
