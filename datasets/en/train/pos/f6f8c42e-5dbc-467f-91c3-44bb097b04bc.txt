Mm Steve's Krazy Subs are delicious!  I've been to the location on Southern and Dobson as well, and they are doing things the same!  Both excellent, tasty, bargain subs!  They call an 8-inch sub a "mini" for crying out loud!  You can get the lunch special for $5 even including tax.  That'll get you an 8" sub, Lay's or Fritos, and a small soda!  Excellent!  The way they make the dressings is just so tasty!  Both locations also have a big screen tv that's always playing those comforting sitcoms ("King of Queens" etc.) when I stop in for lunch.  The sandwiches are ready so fast too!  I couldn't ask for a better place to eat on my lunch break.  :)  You can even call ahead and order your sub, though I've never had to wait long when I come in and order either.
