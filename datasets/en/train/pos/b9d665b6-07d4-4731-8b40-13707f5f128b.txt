I have been to August Karaoke Box several times! It is a really great place to go. U can have parties, friends reunion, and social there.
Last year, I went there almost every weekend.
The service there is very sweet! If you cannot find the song you want, u can write it down and ask them to add them into the machine. 
Just have there!
U will not regret!!!!
Enjoy~
