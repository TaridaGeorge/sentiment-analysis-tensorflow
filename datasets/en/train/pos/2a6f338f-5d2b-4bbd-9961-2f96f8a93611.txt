By far this one of my favorite places. My husband and I go there every chance we get. The gelato always tastes amazing. Everytime we go there, there are new delicious flavors. There is one negative, the gelato cakes. We have purchased two of them, and were disappointed both times. Unfortunately,the cakes are mostly cake with very little gelato. But overall, I can't say enough good things about this place!
