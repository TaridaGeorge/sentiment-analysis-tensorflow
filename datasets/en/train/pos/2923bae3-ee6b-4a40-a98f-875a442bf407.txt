I love this little place.  The gelato (too many flavors tried to list here) rawks with flavor and softness.  Within the old Scottsdale area, I can't find a better place for espresso and real espresso drinks.  If I can't taste the espresso in a drink its not fer me.  I just wish that more peeps on the night shift knew how to make those scantily dressed espresso drinks. 

For the most part, the peeps behind the counter take care of my cravings with a diverse group of customers.   The decor is very cool and clean (a big Uhn).
