Authentic ramen with superb flavor! My fiance and I moved to Phoenix from West L.A. where we frequented a place called Kinchan's Ramen. 
We visited Republic Ramen and didn't expect it to measure up to our old neighborhood favorite, but it certainly surprised us! Great taste, great value, and knowledgeable, friendly counter help to boot. Staff is happy to help you customize your order. If it is your first time having ramen, don't be afraid to consult the staff for help understanding the various flavors and options- they are super helpful and know their ramen!
