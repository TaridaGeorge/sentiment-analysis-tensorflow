Been here several times by myself, and with my kids and my family. Always great, friendly service. Food is awesome and portions are HUGE! I've always split something with my boyfriend and we've always had leftovers. I highly recommend the brisket! Great local place, great food, local beers, and Copper Star coffee! What else do you need?
