I've recently started hiking Piestewa Peak (I feeling like I'm cheating on Camelback) and I think I'm in love!  This is a great hike that gives the stairmaster a new name.  The views are amazing and its not too crowded.  Parking can be hard to find but it's worth the hunt for a spot to hike this awesome trail!
