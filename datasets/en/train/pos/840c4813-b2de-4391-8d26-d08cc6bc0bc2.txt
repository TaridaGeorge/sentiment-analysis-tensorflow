I had the pineapple soup with tilapia. Yum yum! It's a little bit spicy and very delicious. I tried a Vietnamese coffee: it comes in an intimidating pot thingy that has condensed milk on the bottom and the coffee on top. The coffee slowly drips into the milk and when finished, you stir it up and dump it over ice. Whoa! It is goooooood. You gotta try it!
