This is a prime example of why this website is so useful.  I didn't know anything about this store until reading some of these reviews.  The atmosphere was very cool and they seemed to have decent prices on used books.  I plan to go back when I have some more time to browse.  I also need to bring a list with me because I completely choke under the pressure whenever I go to book stores or music stores and can never remember what I wanted.  

I came in this time to pick up "When You Are Engulfed In Flames" by David Sedaris for a reasonable price.  I suppose I may have paid more at a Barnes & Noble or something.  Had to put back "Pride & Prejudice & Zombies" until next time.

I believe this will become my new bookstore, especially since Hoodlums is next door.
