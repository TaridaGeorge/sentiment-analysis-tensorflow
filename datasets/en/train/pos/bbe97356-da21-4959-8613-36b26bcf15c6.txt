A very good bone-in ribeye, a footlong kobe hotdog, oysters, champagne, brussel sprouts, and truffle french fries.  Too good to be true.

The service was attentive and the ambiance was okay (not intimate but definitely toward upscale). Everything we had was delicious....the oysters with the celery puree were strikingly good.
