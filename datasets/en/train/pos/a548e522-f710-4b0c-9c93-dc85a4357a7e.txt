I fell in love with this place! The food, the atmosphere, the staff/management and they offer Organic, Gluten-Free, preservative and hormone free menu items. I've started a pretty constrictive diet, so I don't eat out much because of the ingredients involved but this is one of the few with a menu I have absolutely fallen in love with. I had the Gluten-Free Pesto Pasta w/ Grilled Chicken and Pinenuts. DELISH!!! It's a great spot to grab a bite before a movie or heading over to the Merc Bar (lounge). I highly reccomend checking this spot out, they have a handful of locations around the valley.
