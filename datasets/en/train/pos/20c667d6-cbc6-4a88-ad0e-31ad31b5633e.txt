Don't get the negative reviews. Yes, the location in the Circle K strip mall lacks the aesthetics. The place is tiny. But the pizza? Beyond wonderful...hand tossed, brick oven baked, melts in your mouth. The friendly waiter told me they  also have an upscale place in Scottsdale so if that's important to you, go there. I'll keep going to Thomas Rd and enjoying the best pizza in town.
