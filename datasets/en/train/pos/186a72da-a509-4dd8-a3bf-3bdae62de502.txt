176 reviews before mine...what more could I possibly say? I'll just give you a few highlights:

 **If you've never had a Cornish Pasty, it will be a new and very enjoyable experience for your taste buds.

 **I don't recall the name of our server, but if everyone there is as helpful and friendly as our guy, you'll be in very good hands.

 **The salads are inexpensive and delicious. Order one before your meal. You know you need more greens in your life.

 **I enjoyed the narrow, small size of this place; it felt cozy. I'm not sure what they do for parties larger than 4 though.

 **Arrive. Sit. Order. Enjoy. Leave. Return. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat....
