Where else can you find wild Alaskan salmon for lunch in Arizona?  Not many places, guaranteed.  Had a spectacular wild Alaskan salmon sandwhich with whole wheat pasta today.  Was delicious!  Treated myself to an organic lemon macaroon!  Hadn't tried lemon yet.  Had an extremely smooth, creamy, tasty lemon filling. Very refreshing on an Arizona summer day.  Delicious food daily!  Thank you, Eugenia!
