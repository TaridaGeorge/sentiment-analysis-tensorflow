I bought an Ipod replacement battery here, but I could not get the case open by myself.  I brought it in to have them replace it, and they called me the next day to tell me they had sold me the wrong battery but they had the correct one in stock and would waive the installation charge for the mistake.  THIS is the kind of service that makes me want to go back, and I will.  Recommended.
