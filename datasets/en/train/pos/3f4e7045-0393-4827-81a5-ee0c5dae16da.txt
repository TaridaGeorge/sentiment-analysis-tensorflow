We went to Avanti for my birthday. It is a special place. Andrew, our waiter was very pleasant, informed and attentive.   We started with 3 different  homemade pastas and a side of fried Calamari and all were excellent. My wife had a fresh white fish encrusted with herbes and parmesan. I had a double thick stuffed veal chop. Both dinners were excellent obviously each prepared with much care to detail.    We were so full, we didn't have room for dessert. There was a piano player playing softly in the bar. The dining room was quiet and candle lit, perfect for a special adult night out.  The owner came by every table to make sure everything was perfect. Special wine dinners are offered periodically.This was one great find. We will return and bring  friends.
