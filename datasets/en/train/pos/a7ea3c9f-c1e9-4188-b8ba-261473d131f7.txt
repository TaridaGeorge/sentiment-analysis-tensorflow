Had the best fish and chips dinner while waiting for a flight.

Couldn't recall the name of the restaurant, but sure remembered that dinner. Looked up a bank statement from March, and found out it was the Barfly. 

Chose to sit at a smaller table close to the outside, so didn't see much of the restaurant. Hope to get back there again to enjoy more of the atmosphere and music, along with another delicious meal.

Those fish and chips would be worth a trip through security, even if I didn't have a flight to catch.
