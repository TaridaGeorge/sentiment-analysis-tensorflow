I would recommend Maxim for any special nite out!
I have had the Hummer and the Lincoln Towncar Limo. 
The service is friendly and they make you feel pampered and special. 
Drivers are polished, friendly and classy. 
I am on my mission of keeping my drunk butt off the road and have discovered a great option. 
Have fun!
