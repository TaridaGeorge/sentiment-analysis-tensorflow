The dirty rice and boudin at Baby Kay's are really quite wonderful - a local treasure in Phoenix. Baby Kay's and Papadeaux's take the prize for Cajun restaurants so far in Phoenix, with good food at reasonable prices. The lunch is a little pricier here - and so I recommend Baby Kay's for dinner because it's the same price. But hey if Greekfest across the street is full for lunch, pop over to Baby Kay's. The food is consisistently good - gumbo, jambalaya and oyster po-boy. Highly recommended.
