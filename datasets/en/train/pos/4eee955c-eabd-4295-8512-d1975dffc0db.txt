This place is great.  Always gets things cleaned and done when they say they will.  I think they even get things back the same day, but I haven't used that service yet.   Parking is easy.  As someone else mentioned, the sign out front does NOT say Par Avenue Cleaners, which makes it hard to direct people here.  I have never had to wait in line...either to pick up or drop off.  Only suggestion....EVERYONE pays with debit cards these days...kinda awkward to go to a separate counter to run card, then go back to the other counter for your pick up slips.  Otherwise love this place.
