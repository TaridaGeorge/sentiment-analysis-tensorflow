I love this place!  Disneyland for alcoholics!  This was my first Total Wine, but now I have one in my home state of Nevada.  Came back here to get Czechvar since they don't carry it at home, though, and was happy to pick up a 6-pack for 7.99 + tax.  Even better, I forgot to print my $1 off coupon and showed them the email, and the cashier instantly honored it without needing a manager.  Great customer service, great selection, great prices! (BevMo had Czechvar for $8.69+tax)
