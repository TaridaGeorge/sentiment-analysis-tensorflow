Dined in since the new owners and what an improvement! The French toast melted in my mouth, the fruit was off the vine fresh, and the egg sandwich was awesome! Love that they're dog-friendly! Not to mention their tasty drinks and friendly staff! It's a shame they're hidden from the street.. They're the best kept secret of old town Scottsdale!
