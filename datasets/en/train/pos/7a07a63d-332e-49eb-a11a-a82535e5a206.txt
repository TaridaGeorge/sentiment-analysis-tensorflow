Like most gems in Phoenix, Yen sushi is cleverly hidden in a strip mall.  Don't be deceived by it's dark tinted windows.  The sushi is always fresh and the staff is generally responsive.

It gets pretty busy on Thursday - Saturday around 6:30 - 8:30, so be sure to arrive a bit early or be prepared for a wait.  Also, their happy hour is decent with rolls priced at less than $6 each.
