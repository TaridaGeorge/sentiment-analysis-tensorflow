Employees here are awesome.  I was on a wild goose chase looking for in stock flooring.  If you call the department to speak to a sales associate, be sure to first ask them if they have a moment...if not they can take your info and will call you back.  Diana in flooring was amazingly helpful.  I was also helped by a gentlemen in the wood section.  He and another young man helped load evrything in my truck.  I am very thankful to them as I am not in a condition to be picking up larger items.
