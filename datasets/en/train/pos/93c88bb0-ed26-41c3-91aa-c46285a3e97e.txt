I'm in love with tubing the Salt River.  I have fun every time I come.  It's super easy and affordable.  If you are looking for a good time and a great way to cool off in the AZ heat come here.  
But be prepared for a long trip down the river.  Which means LOTS of sunblock and you will need drinking water and if you can bring TP that might be a good idea too.  Keep the river clean! By the end of the season the river is always trashed.  
Oh yeah and I recommend leaving behind anything valuable...chances are you'll lose it:)
