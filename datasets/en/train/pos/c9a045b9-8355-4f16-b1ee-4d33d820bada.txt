I went here with a group on special and was VERY satisfied.   My stylist was Rebecca and she is absolutely phenomenal.  

I cut off 9 inches and donated to pantene's beautiful lengths.  I also had a partial highlight done.  

Coming from Colorado I was very nervous about trying a new stylist but I'm glad I did.  I'll definitely be back and definitely recommend Rebecca.  She listens to what you want, and certainly delivers.
