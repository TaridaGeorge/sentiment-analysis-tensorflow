We went there because of the ridiculous stuff that they had outside their building, and the inside was no different. But it was fun to go to. It's known for their hot wings, but the burgers that we ordered were amazing! Also the wings were drenched in sauce and tasted really good as well. It was a fun place to eat at, definitely recommend it for the wings and burgers.
