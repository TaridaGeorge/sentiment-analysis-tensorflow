I went to Stinkweeds today with a mp3 recording I made off of an internet radio station two years ago. A station from LA used a collage of music in an intro that included a literally 3 second piece of a song, no kidding. I hesitated for so long thinking it would be impossible to identify the artist and when I first played it for Lindsey she exclaimed with a sly smile was "Is this a test"  but with only two listenings  she was able to identify the Go Teams "Do It Right" without the use of the internet thus ending my two year trek. She really knows her stuff.
