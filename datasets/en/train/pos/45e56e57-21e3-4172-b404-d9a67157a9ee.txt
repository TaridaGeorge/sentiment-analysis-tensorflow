AJ's is a great store. They have higher-end food, products and it just feels classier than any grocery stores out there. If Norstrom were to open a food store AJ's would be that store.

We typically come here when we can't find that funky ingredient you need for a Food Network recipe not easily found at a Fry's or Basha's.
