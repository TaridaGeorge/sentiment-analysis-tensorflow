Some amazing BBQ!  You start off with corn bread that is really moist and sweet.  It's almost like eating cake.  We did the three meat platter and they split it onto two plates for us.  Don't bother with trying different sides, just get double the Mac n cheese...you won't regret it!  It's creamy cheesy goodness!  Brisket is really tender as well as the chicken.  Finish your meal off with some complimentary mini donuts in cinnamon sugar goodness and you'll have to roll out the door. Nice environment, good service and great food!  I know I'll be back for more when I come back to Phoenix!
