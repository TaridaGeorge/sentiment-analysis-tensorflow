A great addition to the area. I will agree with some other reviewers that holding yourself out to have the "Greatest Carne Asada in the history of Creation" might build the expectations up a bit high, but I sure didn't leave disappointed. 

I had a regular carne asada burrito (around $6) and a Pacifico ($2 all weekend) and was in heaven. The meat was juicy and flavorful, the pico was fresh and added a crispness that was really nice, and the onions were caramelized well. I can't wait until the fall to make use of the patio and take better advantage of the cheap beers all weekend.
