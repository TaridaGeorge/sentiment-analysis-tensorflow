My go to, absolute favorite grocery store.  Sure, I love Trader Joe's and Whole Foods for specialty items for dinner or entertaining but they aren't one stop shops like Safeway.  

This location has recently gone through a renovation and a lot of great changes.  The staff are friendly and helpful too.  

Just beware, the snow birds flock here and sometimes hold up the lines while writing checks or scrounging around for exact change, so come with some patience.
