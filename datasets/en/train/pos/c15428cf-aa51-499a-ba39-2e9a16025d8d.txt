I went for the first time last month for a cut and highlights. Michael was very good at understanding what I wanted and most importantly, GAVE ME WHAT I WANTED!  I paid just a little less than what I had been paying so I think I'll go back since I'm on a tighter budget these days like most of  us ;) Hopefully he can keep his prices reasonable. I really don't get these stylists that charge like they're using real gold in your hair instead of $4 bleach products.
