I stopped here with my four year old yesterday with a Groupon.  We had lunch here.  I had a gyro with fries; he had a hotdog and fries.  The fries were simply amazing!  Perfectly prepared and delicious.  The gyro was done perfectly - not burnt or dry.  

The interior is nothing special - a tv, some chairs and tables.  The people behind the counter are terrific.  

If you like soda, this is the place for you.  They even had my home town favorite - FAYGO!  Plenty of great energy drinks.

The prices are reasonable.
