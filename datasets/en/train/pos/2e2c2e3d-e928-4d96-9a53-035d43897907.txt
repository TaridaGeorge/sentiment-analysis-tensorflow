The beef rolls are my main addiction. They're a little pricey, but it spares me from making them myself and they are darn good. 

The waitress currently working there is super friendly and remembers me every time I go. I generally eat to-go just because I usually stop by quite late.

I love this place. I don't eat seafood, so maybe I didn't have a crazy reaction like Brother Diarrhea did. It reminds me of several Chinese restaurants in Rowland Heights/San Gabriel. If you're not used to those kind of joints because you're afraid of a little "added MSG" or hygiene, go to Panda Express!  If you're in it for a dang good meal, then you've found your place.
