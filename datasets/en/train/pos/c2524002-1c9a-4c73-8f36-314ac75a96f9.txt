besides being the set for a ricky martin music video (or christina agulera, not sure) this place is SICK. you must hit up the wetbar in the pool, which is right next to one of the best waterslides in a private hotel in phoenix.

this place is classy classy, and your bill will show it, but it is just all around a great hotel.
