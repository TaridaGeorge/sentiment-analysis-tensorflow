We've been using this place since we moved to the area a year ago, and love their service and attitude.  Everyone is welcoming and very friendly to both the dogs and the humans.  Even though it's a bit farther for us than a few other vets, we'll keep going here for the quality.  Pricing is fair and reasonable.
