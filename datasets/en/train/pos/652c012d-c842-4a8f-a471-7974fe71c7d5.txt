tom  yum noodle soup (tofu and veggies).
served with anglehair noodles, mushroom, tofu, bean sprouts, and other veggies.

I got a HUGE bowl for 7.50 or less,
I ended up taking home about half my bowl and I got another meal out of it.

Order took less than 4 min,
Staff was attentive, helpful and friendly.
Facility was clean.

Seems like manager/owner actually cares about his customers.

I also liked the sweet and pungent chicken.
Served with a big bowl of rice.


I would def recommend to a friend.
