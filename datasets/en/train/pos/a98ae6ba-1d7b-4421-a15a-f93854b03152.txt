Went here for the first time today after seeing reviews. Wow!

I walked in with a fruit flavor in mind, something refreshing, but then my eyes landed on the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake flavor and there was no turning back. 

Being uninspired I couldn't think of a second flavor to mix it with so I only got one. 

When I first saw the small size it looked miniscule but I'm glad I stuck with it because they really pack it in there and it was plenty!

At about $3.15 for the small it is reasonably priced and I can't wait to go back and try more flavors!
