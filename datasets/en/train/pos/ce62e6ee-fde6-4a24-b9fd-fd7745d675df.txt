I would probably give this 4 1/2 stars may be even five.  This place is fantastic.  For those who have traveled to Germany - this is the place to go that will bring back all your favorite memories.  First I have to give them kudos for having authentic German beer (my favorite is about 4th or 5th, a wheat beer that is a little darker than a hefenweizen).  Both times I have gone we had the potato pancakes - these are a bite of greatness.  Also the schnitzel is wonderful, I recommend the Paprika schnitzel.  Dessert - bread pudding is delicious!! I would highly recommend this place.   Specially to people who can appreciate German food, beer, and flavors.
