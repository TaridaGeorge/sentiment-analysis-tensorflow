Holy smokes! This is definitely my favorite place, hear the kid comment, ever. I have eaten sushi in some of the best places and Sushi Eye seriously beats them. Their food is simply the best. All fish melts in your mouth and their options are unique. I love the Atkins, Cherry Blossom, Orange Blossom and Crazy Horse, but seriously, it's hard to choose which one. What I also like is they have photos and the description of the rolls on their menu. So there isn't the guessing game on which one you liked and/or want to try and/or asking the server. The atmosphere is nice and simple. The night we were there, they had live music. I am thrilled this place opened.
