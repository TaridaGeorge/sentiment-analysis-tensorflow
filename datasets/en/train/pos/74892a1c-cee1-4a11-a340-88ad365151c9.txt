This place is fabulous!  I just moved into this neighborhood and needed a gas jug to put gas in my old VW, so I could start it up (had not run in 5 months).  They let me borrow it for free and also offered to help if I had problems!  The shop always seems to be busy, which speaks to their great and honest customer service.  

I have also noticed that their gas prices always seem to be at least 5 cents lower than any other station in the area.  The men in the shop are always very pleasant too.  This looks like my new go-to car maintenance shop!
