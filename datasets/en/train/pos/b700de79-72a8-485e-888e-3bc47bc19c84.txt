This Panda is always pretty busy- especially around lunch time. I don't mind it though because that means that the food is fresh and not sitting out for hours just waiting to be ordered.

My faves are the green bean chicken, the sweet fire chicken, and the chow mein.  

FYI- they always offer that you purchase a medium drink which is big.  Just get a small- free refills.
