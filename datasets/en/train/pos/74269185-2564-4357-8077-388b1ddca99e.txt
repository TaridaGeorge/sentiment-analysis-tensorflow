Pei Wei is the originator and everyone else is an imitator! They're on point. Every time, without fail. I always know what to expect. Fast service, great food and a fair price. My only complaint is the seating. The tables are a little close and it is hard to have a conversation without the table on either side of you being a part of it. 

Order anything on the menu. It will be a home run!
