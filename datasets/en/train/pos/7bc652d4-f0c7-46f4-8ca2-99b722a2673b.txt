Stopped in around 600pm on Tuesday Dec 27th just before the Guns  and Roses concert....found two seats at the bar.....told our server  (the older dude with glasses at the bar) that we needed to be out by 7pm....he could not  have been more helpful...drinks were excellent...love the way they give you a little  bottle of soda for the vodka soda drink.....mushrooms on toast was awesome as an appetizer...we both had the salmon  as an entree ( I had beets which were terrific and she had green beans which were also very good) which was excellent...the mashed potatoes were way toooo hot to eat for about 15 minutes but overall a great dinner....we will be back...
