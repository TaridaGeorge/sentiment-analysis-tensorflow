If you like nostalgia/Old Hollywood/Palm Springs, then you will love the Biltmore. I stayed here for Spring break back in the mid-2000s and loved it. It's on beauitful grounds, and my sister and I got a kick out of the croquet fields. The hotel's architecture was consulted by Frank Lloyd Wright, and everything from the block design to the spacious lobby carries the Wright style. Great pool as well, though you might have to get there at the crack of dawn to get a poolside spot. Overall, a great vacation spot, and centrally located near downtown Phoenix and Scottsdale.
