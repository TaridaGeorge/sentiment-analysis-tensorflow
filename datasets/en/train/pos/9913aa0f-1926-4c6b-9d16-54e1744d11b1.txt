What a great hidden gem in old town Scottsdale!  Orange Table offers a great mix of flavors like the jalape√±o pancakes (sounds bizarre, but out of this world amazing) all while using local fair and offering a layed back atmosphere.  If you are looking for a casual breakfast spot any day of the week to sip a morning cocktail and enjoy great food and service, this is the spot!
