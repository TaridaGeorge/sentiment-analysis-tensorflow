I had no idea this place existed, what a find!

A stunning array of herbal, fruit and spice teas.  Great helpful and friendly staff.  Absolutely huge selection, all packages sealed and fresh.  Fantastic prices and some very interesting and novel tea stoopers.

Each tea is organized in affordable sealed packets. A sample of each tea is available to help yourself and take in the aroma. '

A sample of a hot and a cold tea is on tap as well as some wonderful cookies. 

Its a really welcoming warming store. I'll be back!
