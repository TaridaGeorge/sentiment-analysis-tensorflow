We all know how hard it is to find an honest mechanic. Luckily, I have 1 right up the street. Today was my second time at the Brake Masters at Shea & Scottsdale Rd. 

I had somehow managed to break the button that automatically opens the gas cap by my steering column. I had been quoted a full day of work and a $90 price tag by a reputable repair shop close by. Remembering my first good experience at Brake Masters, I figured I'd give them a shot, even though it wasn't their specialty. Within 10 minutes it was fixed and there was no charge. (Always tip the mechanic, even if there is no charge) The honesty, professionalism and friendliness of the staff has made me a loyal customer as long as I'm in Scottsdale. A++
