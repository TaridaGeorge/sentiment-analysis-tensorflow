We LOVE Capital Grille.  Had amazing experiences at both the bar (Kevin is one of the city's BEST bartenders) and in the private dining area with a large group.

I've never seen such a well-trained, well-oiled machine, that serves great drinks, decent priced wine ($30 for a bottle of Liberty School Cab!) and amazing food.

They will let you order half-orders of sides, which is nice.  No split plate charge either!  When splitting entrees/steaks, etc., they can do that for you in the kitchen, which is also nice.

The Calamari app is very good.   The $15 Ahi Tuna app (bar area only I believe) IS AMAZING.  The bone-in NY Strip cooked to perfection (Rare plus).  Side of mushrooms and green beans were very good as well.

Never had a bad experience here.  They treat you right and the food is fantastic.
