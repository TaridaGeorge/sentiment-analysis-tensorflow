I've been going here on occasion for the past 5 years.  It's a great spot to go with friends for excellent beer and grub.  The servers and bartenders have always been really cool and friendly, and come around frequently to check on us.

I am particularly fond of the Raj IPA, but I'll drink whatever beer we order (and then some!).  Their hummus is also nomnomnom.

The only downside is that if you come during the busier times, you might have to wait a while for a table/seats.  It can and does get packed.
