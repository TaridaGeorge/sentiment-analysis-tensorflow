This place is awesome. Their happy hour rocks and food is amazing. They use lots of local ingredients which I think is a plus. This place reminds my wife and I of how cafe boa used to be before it started to raise their prices and add fancy names to their old pasta dishes  reasonably priced awesome staff defiantly a must.
