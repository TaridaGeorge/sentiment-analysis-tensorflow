I flippin LOVE this place!!

Granted, most resale stores are 'hit or miss' but I never seem to 'miss' with MSC!! They have TONS of name brand clothing, shoes, purses, and accessories! True Religion, Se7en, Juicy, Coach, D&G, the list goes on and on! Of course, you'll have to search for what you're looking for but even with the store being 'picked over' today (70% off sale making room for their fall apparel debut tomorrow!!), I was able to find a pair of Aldo sandals for $4.89!! I also found some Lucky jeans, a JunkFood Tshirt, and a pair of D&G sunglasses!!
