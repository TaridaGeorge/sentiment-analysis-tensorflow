My son is a clarinetist (a pretty good one)....and I know diddly about that instrument. So when his horn started squawking the week before a big audition, I asked his instructor who to take it to, and he reco'd Mike. The shop is small but bustling, and Mike has always been thourough in explaining what is wrong and what needs to be done. His prices are very reasonable, and the turn around time is always fast. Highly recommended.
