Woowza!!!! I've been here five times and I can't believe it's taken this long to "yelp" them. Tonight was the kicker! I ordered the veggie pizza and added pepperoni, plus a caesar salad with chicken. What got my heart (which everyone other items on their menu has, but not like this) veggie pizza and added pepperoni. The veggies are so fresh . The artichoke hearts are smokey and the perfect blend of the veggies, touched with the perfect amount (not too much) pesto. I'm not the biggest fan of Caesars, but my hubby really loved the dressing and the freshness of the salad and best of all fresh grilled warm chicken. We will be regulars on a weekly basis for sure. The prices are in expensive for the quality of food too.
