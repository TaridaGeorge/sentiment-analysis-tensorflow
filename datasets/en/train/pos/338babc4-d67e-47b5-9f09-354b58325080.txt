Love this pasta. Made some of the Spinach Basil Garlic Linguini with some sauteed mushrooms & garlic in some Thai garlic olive oil. Added some cooked shrimp & asparagus to the dish...Yum-O!

Purchased this pasta at a local farmer's market when I was in Phoenix. 1st turned onto it when it was at a local arts festival in Henderson, NV.
