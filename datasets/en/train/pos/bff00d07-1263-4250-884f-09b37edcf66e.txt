Such a beautiful venue. Since October 2012, I have been 3 times: once for the Day of the Day performance and twice for the Nutcracker. Every time, I am wowed by this place. The performances are beautiful, engaging and well done, employees are friendly, and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house. 

There is a gift shop, couple of bars, and bakery that serves coffee, as well. I also like that there is a desk where you can check out a booster seat for small children. Very helpful.
