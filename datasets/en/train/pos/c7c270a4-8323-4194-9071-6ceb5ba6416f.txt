What an awesome little shop! Beautiful nail designs, awesome customer service and attitude, all while keeping things professional and clean. I went in on a Wednesday around 2pm for a pedicure and the place was bustling. I waited maybe 5 minutes for a chair to open and a technician to be free. Nice vibe, and GREAT price! 
Had a manicure done later in the week, and her shaping was perfect. Would give 5 stars, but they do not have shellac or gel polish, which is a beneficial technology upgrade!

Update 8/2012
They now have shellac and gel polish, so they get 5 stars! way to upgrade!
