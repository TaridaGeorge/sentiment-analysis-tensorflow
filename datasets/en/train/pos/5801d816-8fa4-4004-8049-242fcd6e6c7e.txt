We stayed here while in Scottsdale, and it was very nice. The room was nice, had shiny new flatscreen tvs (although no HDTV). It was also comfortable and we had a full kitchen which was nice. The Asada restaurant was good, having a breakfast buffet I visited a couple of times. We also took advantage of the heated pools and jacuzzis (it was great they had multiple ones of each). Sadly I didn't try out the gym or the other places to eat, but maybe someday I'll go stay there again :)
