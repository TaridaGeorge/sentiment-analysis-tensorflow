Visiting Phoenix/Tempe for work and went here for lunch.  GREAT outdoor atmosphere - very casual.  Ordered the Chicken Sandwich and it was probably the BEST one I have ever had!  It had goat cheese and fig jam  which was very inventive and created a taste I never experienced on a chicken sandwich.  When I'm back in Phoenix/Tempe, I'm going to make it back here! 

And...I have to say the name of this restaurant made us laugh a bit - we weren't laughing after we had a great lunch!
