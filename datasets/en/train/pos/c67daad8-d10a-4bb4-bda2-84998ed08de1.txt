4 visits.  GR8 place to hit before or after a movie @ Harkins.  Happy Hour is full of values.  I especially like that premium wines are discounted and the pours are huge -  You get a third of a bottle  = 2 big glasses.  (Oh, I am big on quality glasses, and they actually serve really nice, uniquely shaped crystal stemware - bonus points there - I mean that's where the the 5th star comes in). 

Chicken lettuce wraps are yummy (ie: no guilt here!).  Keep that bruschetta coming!  OK, have to admit, the sweet potato fries are really, really good.

Last night, just before going to the screening of Knight & Day,  everything arrived within minutes of ordering: from the appetizers, to meals, to entr√©e-to-go and every drink.
