Woohoo! This is as good as it gets! I actually prefer this location to the original. They have a great covered patio. We love to introduce people to this place. 

Everything here is delicious. Yes, everything. You can't go wrong with their bruschetta, but their salads and paninis are delicious as well. I love to order a half salad (raspberry chicken) and half sandwich (nine iron). They always have a great wine selection. And you know I'm going to get my wine on whenever I am here. 

You absolutely must get the salted caramel sundae for dessert. DO IT. Who new chocolate covered corn nuts could be so good?
