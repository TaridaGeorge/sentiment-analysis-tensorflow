Had a phenomenal facial with Julia! I haven't felt that pampered and relaxed in a long time! Julia really pays attention to detail and it's clear she's very educated and good at determining what your individual skincare needs are. I completely trust her to decide what to do with my skin when I arrive. In addition she's very personable and makes you feel like you're a good friend of hers. Can't wait to schedule again with her!
