Great dance studio. Wonderful teachers. Hip-Hop, tap, jazz, ballet, pointe, youth to adult. Even home to the Dancin' Dads.

The only issue I have is that during the busiest class times, it can be difficult to find a place to sit and actually watch the kids dance. However, since many studios don't allow that anyways, I guess it is not a bad thing.
