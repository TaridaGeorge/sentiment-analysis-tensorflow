Absolutely outstanding!  I am always on the lookout for high quality coffee and Cartel has just set a new standard.  They roast their own beans on site and their coffee is the freshest I have ever tasted.  I tried their Mocha and found it incredible well balanced and smooth, with just the right amount of character.  I am very picky about my coffee and the coffee shops I will spend money at...this place is my new favorite in the Phoenix area.  I love the atmosphere and the counter folks were very friendly and knowledgeable.  I will be back!
