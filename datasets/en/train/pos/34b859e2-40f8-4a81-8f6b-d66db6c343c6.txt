A "streetwear" boutique without the pretense.  It's in Scottsdale Fashion Square upstairs by Nordstrom.  King & Duck carries gear from 10 Deep, Crooks & Castles, The Hundreds, ALIFE, Stussy, etc.  They don't have the world's best selection, but it's more than you'll find elsewhere in this town.  

It helps that the dudes running the show aren't snotty douchebags, either.  I actually got a smile and a hello when I walked in coupled with a genuine "thanks for coming" when I left with my purchase.  Both more than I ever received at any dime a dozen boutique in LA and elsewhere.
