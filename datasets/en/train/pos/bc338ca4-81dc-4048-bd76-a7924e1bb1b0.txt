"Welcome to Firehouse!!" That's the greeting you get from the entire staff when you walk in the door (and if you go with my boyfriend, he yells that greeting along with the staff every time ANYONE walks into the place as well). We walked up the register and the staff were wonderful - helpful regarding the menu. The food came out quick, and we could tell it was fresh. I ordered the meatball and it was amazing! 

I wish there was one further east (closer to my house), but anytime I'm looking for somewhere to eat in the Chandler area, Firehouse Subs will be on my mind.
