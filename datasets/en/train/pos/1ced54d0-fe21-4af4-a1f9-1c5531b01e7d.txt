Went over here for a late breakfast, and was totally surprised with how delicious my Lox sandwich was.

The bagel was chewy, with a great crust, and an incredible amount of garlic on the bagel. I could see how someone could get annoyed by the amount of garlic, but garlic is pretty awesome, so take that as you will.

The sandwich was an awesome mix of the classic lox. Capers, Red Onion, Cream Cheese, Tomato, and delicious smoked salmon. 

However, what really set this place apart was that they served the sandwich WARM, which I have never had before. Part of me wanted to think that it was odd, but my first bite made all of my concerns float away.

It turned the sandwich into an amazing mush of fish, capers, onion, cream cheese, and tomato, and at that point, I was sold. 

I'll be coming back, for sure.
