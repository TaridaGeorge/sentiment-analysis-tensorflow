Last night I had the wonderful privilege of seeing Ballet Arizona and Ib Andersen's production of Giselle. And what an amazing production it was!

From sets to lighting, pit orchestra, choreography, costumes, and everything in between was incredibly well done. 

Giselle told this story so well portraying every range of emotion. She and Albrecht making moves flawlessly and seemingly effortless! Such clear storytelling through dance! The Peasant Pas de Deux in act 1 was beyond words fantastic. Bravo! Queen Myrta and her wilis in act 2 were elegant and phenomenal! 

Thank you Yelp, Lindsey and of course Ballet Arizona for treating us to such an amazing performance.
