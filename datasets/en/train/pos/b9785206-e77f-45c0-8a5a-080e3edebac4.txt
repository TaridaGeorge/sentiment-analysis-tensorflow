Absolutely fantastic food.  The strip mall it is located in is very nondescript, with a second hand clothing store, a liquor store (among others).

Do not be fooled by outward appearances.

This place is the real deal.  Lamb shawerma that have to be tasted to be believed, big fat chips (fries, whatever), and plenty of home made hummus and tzatziki to go around.  Beautiful.

With a very friendly owner and staff - who like to joke and chat with customers, and brilliant food at a very cheap price - a definite plus for the neighborhood.
