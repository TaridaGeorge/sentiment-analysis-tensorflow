Trying to boost the reviews to this place. because this is by far one of the best pho places in the valley, that's if your looking for a clear broth with a little zip to it. i have been to a couple better pho places in Long Beach and New York, but for Arizona this one is the cream of the crop. The pho is tasty, the servers are friendly, and I enjoy the sometimes bizarre Vietnamese music videos that play in the back ground.
