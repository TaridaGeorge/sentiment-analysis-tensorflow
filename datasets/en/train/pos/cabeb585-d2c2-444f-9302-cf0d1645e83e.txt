We love Angel Sweet. Here's why:

1. There's always plenty of parking.
2. The kids working there are nice.
3. They have the BEST PEANUT BUTTER GELATO I have ever eaten. 
4. They don't limit you to the number of flavors you can get in a size, like some other places do.

So go ahead, try that super dark with the peanut butter and the cheesecake and fall in love with Angel Sweet. Just be prepared to sit on the hard bench outside or take it to go--they have only three or four tables inside.
