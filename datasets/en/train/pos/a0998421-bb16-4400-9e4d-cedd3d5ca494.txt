Getting back into biking since moving to Phoenix (since I'm carless and it is so flat here hehe) and seeing as the last time I rode a bike I was twelve, I needed some help!

...they were super helpful teaching me the ropes and getting me set up with all the essentials. Knowledgable staff, friendly atmosphere and average prices. 

Good selection for store size.
