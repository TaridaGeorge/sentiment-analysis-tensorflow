Went in mid afternoon when it wasn't too crowded, very laid back atmosphere but not completely dead. Although I was almost afraid it was closed by the frosted panes on the outside and closed doors, gratefully peeking inside showed signs of life.   Had prompt and generously friendly service by very energetic and positive waitstaff.  Surprisingly long and large place for what looks otherwise like the usual strip mall location standard for Phoenix; its a shame this place isn't in a better location instead of sandwiched in between cheap chain stores.   Sat under the picture of the great (!!??) Joe Appaio (I'm not even from Arizona and I know his reputation).  Great menu with original combinations: had a carmelized jalepeno/fried ratatoille burger with side of broccolli and ginger beer to drink, and chocolate bread pudding for dessert.  Not too pricey for a filling meal with original flair.
