I love Lost Leaf. I discovered it completely by accident. 

I got invited to a gypsy punk show there, and honestly, how could I say no? 
There is a line out the door to the sidewalk, a sign of good times ahead, in my book. 

It moves fairly quickly and it was worth the wait. 
When I finally get in, we are in love with all aspects of this great little bar, from the art on the walls to the band playing above the bathrooms. 

Here's some advice: 

You don't drink beer? Don't go to a bar and criticize 

Think its only for skinny jeans people? You're crazy 

Don't own a Mac? Get over yourself and drink a beer...at the Lost Leaf
