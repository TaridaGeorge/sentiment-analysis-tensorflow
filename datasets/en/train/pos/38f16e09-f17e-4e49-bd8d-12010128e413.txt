Now th his is a place that you can go if u want a southern homestyle meal...you wont want to eat for the redt of the day but its worth it...their waffles r to die for I dont know wut they put in the batter but its like no other waffle besides roscoes In la...then you have to have chicken...either the chicken smothered in gravy and onions or the honey hot wings with their fresh fries...dont forget the red koolaid...then you have to have big slice of red velvet cake or if they have lemon thats delicious too...this place is not a place to go if ur watching ur weight but its delicious and very much comfort food I only go to places I love or that have been recommended to me I dont play around
