This restaurant is really, really fun. Great atmosphere, fun crowd, really great food. The provolone fondue with pretzel balls is amazing.

We were a large group of girls, and had a bit of a snotty server. We also had a pretty big issue with the timing of the food service. So why five stars? Because when the manager saw that we weren't pleased, he went way, way above and beyond to make sure we were happy. Our night went from questionable service, to seriously one of greatest in a matter of minutes, all because the manager cared to make the difference.

Its things like that, that makes one restaurant stand out from another. I will go back again and again. Love the place, so impressed.
