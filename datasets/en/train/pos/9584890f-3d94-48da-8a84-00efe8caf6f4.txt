Had a great lunch here...sat at the bar. Food came pretty quick, even though they were pretty busy. The food was VERY good, I had the pea soup which was great, and I had the fresh fish special which was Halibut. It was also very good. Portions are small but I like that, I'll have to come back and check out the wines....the wine list looked good!  It was about 80% women in here...which was also very yummy...
