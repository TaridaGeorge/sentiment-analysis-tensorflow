We needed our windows cleaned and our previous service had raised his price by 30%. So we went to Yelp and read the reviews and  found so many people were really happy with CPWC. So we set up an appointment for yesterday. Brad is a very likable guy and the best thing is that he delivers quality. Our windows are squeeky clean and we are thrilled. Brad will be our window man from now on. He also pointed out some breaks on our stucco which needed repair. Brad's company also fixes screens, changes batteries on smoke alarms, changes light bulbs, (excellent for high ceilings and senior citizens) and other things. Call him-you'll be as happy as we are. This is truly a five star company!
