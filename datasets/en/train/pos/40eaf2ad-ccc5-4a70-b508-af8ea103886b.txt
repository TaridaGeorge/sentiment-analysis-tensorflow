Mmm, who knew burgers can be made with crow?  Last time here, our experience was scuttled by a longer-than-quoted-wait and an indifferent hostess.  This time around, the wait was fine, and the (new) hostess was doing it all to make sure she kept the line moving - even busing tables.  And that left us free to concentrate on the food, and realize what we had missed last time in our grumpiness.

The sweet potato fry sauce is the best I've ever had.  The burgers are very, very tasty.  And the service is very good.  The owner saw that we were unhappy last time and went out of his way to take care of that.  I respect that, and good customer service means a lot to me.  We'll be back.
