Probably the best Chicago style food and by far the best Chicago Dogs I've had in Arizona...  Nuff said!

Menu is very fairly priced and make sure to get the Vienna beef Chicago dogs... ugh sooo good.

table/booth seating and a few bar type seats up front along the window.  
Al is usually manning the front and/or register so be sure to say hi...  Very friendly staff and plenty of Chicago swag around the walls to check out. 
Definitely check out Al's... very good food!
