Love this place!

The pedicures here are divine and last forever and the manicures are just as lovely.  They recently got a new model of massage pedicure chairs which are even more addictive to sit in.  I have been coming here for 6+ years and love it! Reasonably priced and clean, consistent atmosphere keep me coming back!
