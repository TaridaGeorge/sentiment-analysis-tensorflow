I've been using Safeway's grocery delivery for the past few months and for me, it's been terrific. My orders have always been on time, rarely is there a substitution, and even the produce has been fresh and good. I had a customer service issue only once, when a product had passed its expiration date, and they credited my account immediately. I've been using this service because I don't have regular access to a car, and with a 4-hour window the price is about the same as it would be for me to rent a Zipcar to shop. I've never had any of the problems mentioned by some of the others. Highly recommended!
