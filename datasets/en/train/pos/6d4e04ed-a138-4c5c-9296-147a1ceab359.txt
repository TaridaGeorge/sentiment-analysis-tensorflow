I just heard about this place from my hairdresser today, and made a beeline for it. Let me just say it was wonderful. The people were extremely friendly and helpful, the food was OUTSTANDING, the ambiance was warm and inviting. They also had a huge selection of teas and coffee's. Their signature pomegranate tea is homemade by the owner with agave. Super yummy! I HIGHLY recommend this little gem to the veggie and non-veggies out there! Yum, Yum!
