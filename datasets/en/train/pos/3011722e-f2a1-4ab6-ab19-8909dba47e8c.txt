Just dined at Oregano's in their new location. All I can say is awesome! I had the chicken lasagna and my date had the shrimp pasta, both outstanding entrees. Don't miss the Italian gold wings for appetizer. The servers and bartenders all so friendly and do everything they can to make your experience awesome. Can't wait to go back again!
