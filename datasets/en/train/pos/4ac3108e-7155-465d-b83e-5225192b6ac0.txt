Always great service, lovely ambience, great wine selection, and appies that can't be beat. The bruschetta is delicious, the meat platter is divine, and the cheese plate delights my palate. Our party of 10 had a very enjoyable evening here with extremely attentive service. I can't ever say 'no' to Postino's. Ever!
