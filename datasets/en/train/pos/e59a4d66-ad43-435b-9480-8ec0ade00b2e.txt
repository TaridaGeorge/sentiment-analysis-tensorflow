My hubby and I stumbled upon this place. The music and ambiance was so cool. It was like toned down house music. The service was amazing! Our waiter was mixing our drinks, and after 2 each Scott and I we're pretty drunk! The food was also amazing! If you like Greek salad I have to strongly recommend theirs! The best I've ever had, hands down. The entrees are so gourmet and its so hard to make a decision. I can't recommend this restaurant enough. We are so happy!
