We are frozen yougurt snobs and die for Yogurtology. The staff is ALWAYS so nice and patient - even remembering our daughter's name. As far as flavors and quality, there is nothing that comes close. The topping bar is decadent. Price great. And cleanliness? 10 stars! We visited another fro-yo spot on our way home one night and were repulsed by the service and atmosphere...made Yogurtology even more heavenly. When we drive to Trader Joe's, our little one chants "Yo Yo, Yo Yo." Thank god she's got good taste. A foodie in the making!
