I can't say much about their spa, but I can say the service must have improved since everyone else has gone here because I just got back and I had an amazing time. They gave us a golf cart ride down the road to Ruth's Chris, the have beautiful weddings, and they are sending my laptop charger back to me. The one thing I can say is either they are a little slow or I am getting craftier because I was not thrown out of the wedding but the guy sitting next to me was.

Not a fan of Arizona, but the Plaza gets a thumbs up.
