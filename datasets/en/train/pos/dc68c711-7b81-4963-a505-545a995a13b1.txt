Im surprised this place doesn't have a 5 star average rating. Food is by far the best chinese food in arizona, very cozy feel inside, the prices are unbelievabely reasonable for the type of food and service they provide. Owner is Leon that came up to our table a few times to check up on us and offer us a few shots of his tequila collection. He is very friendly and warm personality. We lovvvvve this place, everything is delicous!!!!!
