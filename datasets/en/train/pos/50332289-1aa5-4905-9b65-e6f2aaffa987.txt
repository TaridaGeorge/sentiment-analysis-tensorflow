My wife discovered a flat tire yesterday that was changed by roadside service. We took the flat to Discount Tire. They patched and balanced the tire and checked the pressure on the other four. I was shocked when I picked the car up the the charge was $0.00. I had contact with four employees while at the store and each was as pleasant as could be. I would absolutely use them again.
