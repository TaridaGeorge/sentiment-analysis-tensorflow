As a self proclaimed burger connosuier, I first went into the habit after receiving a coupon for a free burger and really enjoyed it. I got the regular fries and a coke. The fries were great and the Coke was just right. Today I couldn't help but go back. I got a double charburger with cheese and bacon. It was outstanding! The Bacon was crisp, The lettuce tasted fresh, the cheese was, well, cheesy. The onions really add a nice flavor. I am very impressed so far with the quality of food and will be back. Soon.
