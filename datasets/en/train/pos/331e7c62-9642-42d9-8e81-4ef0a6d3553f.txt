Excellent food, delicately prepared and presented with class in a gorgeous setting.

The atmosphere of the restaurant reminds me of a Lyonnaise or Aix-en-Provence cafe. Frequented by more mature locals, it is quiet and composed, an excellent place for conversation. It's a little rustic and by no means formal; the service is inviting and just standoffish in southern French fashion. Best for smaller groups, no more than 4-6 people.

I've tried two dishes here, the Coq au Vin and the Salmon, and they both blow me away in terms of flavour. The portions are intelligently small, and each meal comes with some of the best mini-croissants I've ever tasted and a rotating dessert. 

The only fault I can find are the prices; at $7-$10 a meal, I feel almost obliged to use the tip keep from feeling guilty. An absolute steal, hidden away.
