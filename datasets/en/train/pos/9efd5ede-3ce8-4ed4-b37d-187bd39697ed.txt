It is refreshing to be the recipient of some good customer service.  When you try a new place, you want to feel welcome.  (Note. If you prefer to feel unwelcome, see my review on Temptations Cafe.). I believe that if I would have walked in and said that I thought that they had a buffet on Tuesdays, the cashier/waiter would have immediately said, "Why didn't you say so earlier?" I had the chicken shawarma entree.  It was really good in a good way.  Juicy with good chicken shawarma sauce.  A tahini yogurt something maybe.  It was undercrowded, so I hope that it become more popular with locals.  Come on Whole Fooders, its right next store.
