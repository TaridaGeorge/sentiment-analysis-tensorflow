I've been taking my vehicles to Shumans Auto Clinic for many years.  I've had BMW, Dodge, Toyota, and Lexus and they have worked on them all.  Breaks, oil changes, timing belts, transmissions, tuneups, A/C, etc.   They do excellent, honest work and you'll save $$$ over the expensive dealerships.   If you need any auto service, give these guys a call.
