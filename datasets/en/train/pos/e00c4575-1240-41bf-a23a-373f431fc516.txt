Went to the grand opening weekend.  Had to go see Laurie Lewis/David Rozum since they played at our wedding 25 years ago in N. California!  Got to speak to her at the intermission and she remembered our little soiree!  

The theatre is a thing of beauty!  A must for any live music lover!  The colors, acoustics and seating are all top notch!  Only seats 250 so makes for an intimate experience.

As for Laurie and David, they are the best!  Always a pleasure to hear them play together!
