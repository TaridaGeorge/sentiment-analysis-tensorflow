I would highly recommend Dunway Cleaning Service.  They quoted a very fair price over the phone.  When the day of service came around, he called 30 minutes before he would arrive (at the front end of the quoted 2 hour window) to give me time to make it home from work to meet him.  They finished the job quickly, but absolutely not at the expense of quality.  My carpets looked fantastic.  Also, they were very accommodating to work with me to find a time before Thanksgiving when I had lots of family coming in.  A+.
