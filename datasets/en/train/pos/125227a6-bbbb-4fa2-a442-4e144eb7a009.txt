Loved the set up and concept! What do I have to do to get one of these in Illinois!? YUMMILICIOUS!!

It was soooo good and the choice of fruit toppings was fresh and in season. My creation was coconut yogurt, strawberries, blackberries, white chocolate chips, and shredded coconut. OMG!

Can't wait to find a Yogurtland when we're traveling again!
