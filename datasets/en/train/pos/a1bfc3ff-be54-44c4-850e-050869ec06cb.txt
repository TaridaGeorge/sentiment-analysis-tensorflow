How can you not enjoy Oregano's?  The service at this location is always great and friendly staff.  The seating is about as ample as it gets for an Oregano's and the fact that they are ALWAYS busy, says something, they are popular cause they are good.

I got the Junior Beefstro Salad, the bf got the chicken lasagna.  Both are amazing ( I had to sneak a bite of his).  

The portions are good size, and the price is right.  

There is just no way to go wrong.
