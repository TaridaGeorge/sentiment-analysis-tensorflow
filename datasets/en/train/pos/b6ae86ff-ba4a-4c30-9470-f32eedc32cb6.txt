i'm a socialphobe so the fact that you couldn't get the cappuccino to go was a little disheartening but also slightly humorous. especially after reading the sign on the wall about it. anyway, my gf got the capp and i got the chai latte. holy sh*t! i have never had a chai like that before. that milk was insanely creamy. hands down, best i have ever had. the capp was good but i don't know if it is worth torturing myself over. if we can get the latte to go ( which i think you can), than that will work perfect. for sure, blows away any coffee chain. and for me, the best i have ever had. the staff was super friendly. and the side bar where you can watch from was pretty neat.
