I feel like I'm in Plaza Mayor in Madrid, or a cafe in Paris. This has such a modern European cafe feel to it. I love it. I love the homemade pastries, mousses, and everything else. I've had the chocolate eclair- Which I wanted to LOVE but sadly the icing on top is a tad too sweet. But scrap some of that off and it's perfect. The iced coffee ( I like to bastardize my coffee with cream) is delicious. The large is MUY grande. Expect your thirst to be quenched. The Irish Cream mousse is tre bien. It's a little pricey, but worth it.
