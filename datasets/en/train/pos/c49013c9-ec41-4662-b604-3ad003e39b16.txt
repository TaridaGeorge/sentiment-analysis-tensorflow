Come on now, Folks.... one star reviews and complaints about the wait?  You HAVE heard of Pizzeria Bianco before, right?!??

Fresh, local ingredients, a Chef who cares more about his craft than arguably anyone in town and a great location - that's a recipe for fame, Kids. We should consider ourselves lucky to have such a gem in our city.   Not to mention, the Rosa is hands-down, without question the BEST pizza I've ever had in my life.  

Worried about the wait?  Go buy a frozen Totino's, whiners!  ;)
