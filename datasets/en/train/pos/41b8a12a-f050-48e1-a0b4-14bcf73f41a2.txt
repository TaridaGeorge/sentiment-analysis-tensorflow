** Note:  This review is ONLY for their "Soyname" soft-serve soy ice cream.

Their ice cream is the BOMB.  It's soft-serve homemade soy icecream that tastes like real ice cream!  No gross soy taste or aftertaste, no weird consistency, just pure ice cream goodness!  I really don't know how they do it, nor do i care.  It's served "blizzard" style with a variety of add-ins to choose from.  My personal favorite is the vanilla soy ice cream with chocolate and mint syrup and chocolate chips mixed in.... heaven!  When I stopped eating dairy I was bummed and thought I would never again truly know the joys of an awesome ice cream treat, I was wrong.  I drive from Higley to this place just to get a Soyname, it's THAT good.  Even folks who don't eat dairy-free say it's amazing!
