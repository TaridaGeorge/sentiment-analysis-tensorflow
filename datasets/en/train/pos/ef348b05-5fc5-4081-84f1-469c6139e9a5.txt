Second visit to this location, stay at Villas part and the place has gotten better in five years since I was here last time.   The Spa was perfect start and on a hot day was also perfect end with almost any service.   So much to do if you don't golf, pools all over, open 24 hours, lazy river, water slide, and service that is not over done, but just right.   And weather yes 100 degrees might be hot, but humidity isn't there, so it is perfect pool weather.
