This place is amazing. Always fantastic friendly service, delicious food, and simply a beautiful idea with the new featured artwork every few months. Grilled veggies are so tasty, I don't know what that marinade is but it is so flavorful. Great wine selection and caring staff. I highly recommend checking it out. And the bathrooms are a hoot!
