This was my first "real" pen buying experience.  I am not a pen connoisseur but after using a pen of quality from a colleague I decided to start looking for a "higher end" pen.  With my 1st anniversary approaching trying to stick with the whole paper concept I asked for a quality pen.  My wife and I went into the store and felt welcomed immediately.  We told them our price range and what style of pen I prefer and we narrowed it down to a few.  Not once did we feel rushed or pressured to buy.  When it was all said and done we walked out with a pen that suited me spending less than our budget.  Excellent Customer Service.
