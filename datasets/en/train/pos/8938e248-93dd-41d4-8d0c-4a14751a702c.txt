Corn tasted like the wood it must have been cooked on which was a little weird. 

The Pig Burger was wonderful with so many different flavors and textures (burger patty, pork, and bacon). Definitely would get again!

Gringo Nachos were excellent with the fresh cut fries covered in cheese and a In N Out Burger style sauce. With all this on top they never got soggy.
