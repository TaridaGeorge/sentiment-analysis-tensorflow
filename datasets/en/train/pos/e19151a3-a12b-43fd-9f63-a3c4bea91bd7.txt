We are not foodies...we don't go out often but this place exceeded our expectations.  We went here for our 5 year anniversary...made our reservations online thru their website and mentioned that it was our anniversary and we would prefer a table away from the live music.  We had a wonderful dinner...there was an anniversary card on the table from the restaurant and rose petals.  

We had the Jumbo Gulf Shrimp cocktail for starters, the fuji apple salad and Chilean Sea Bass & the fresh catch Halibut for Entrees with a side of broccolini.  We topped it off with the Godiva Chocolate Cake dessert. 

Our server was Rocco...he was really attentive and very nice.  We can't stop talking about how good the food was, the great service and when we are returning.
