After calling for a price estimate, I was able to get someone out here within just over an hour, which was a nice surprise! The technician not only installed a large-size dog door in a stucco/drywall outside wall, but also patched several large drywall holes, all in just three hours. He was polite and courteous. I'll definitely be a repeat customer.
