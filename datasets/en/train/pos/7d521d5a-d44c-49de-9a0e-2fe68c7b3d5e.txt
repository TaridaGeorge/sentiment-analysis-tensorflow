Liberty Market is an icon of old town Gilbert. And I'm not one for iconography. Yet I still rate this place 5 stars. Go figure.

The word "exemplary" comes to mind. The dishes are simple, yet delicious. The staff is efficient and friendly. The atmosphere is homey and first-class. 

Oh, and then there's Joe, the guy that runs the place. Joe acts as if you are a guest in his home. And he has this strange Gretzky-esque ability to sense where someone is about to have a question, materializing there just as the query comes to mind. It's kinda creepy. But in a good way.

Lunch or dinner. Small group or large. Go to Liberty Market. Often.
