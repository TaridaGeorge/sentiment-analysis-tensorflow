Great mom and pop store, not a chain.  Friendly staff, good food, organic, fresh, what more could you want?  Free wi-fi?  Got it.  Clean bathroom?  Got it.  Ample parking?  Got it.
I've had the bagels, breakfast sandwiches, hummus, wraps, homemade scones, all good.  Lunch items like wraps and salads available to order or out of the grab-and-go refrigerator. 
About the same price as Starbucks without the guilt of patronizing another corporate giant.
