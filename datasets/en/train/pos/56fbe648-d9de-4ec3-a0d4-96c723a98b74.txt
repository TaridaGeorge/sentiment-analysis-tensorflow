Where do I begin with how wonderful this place is?  Oh Urban Cookies, you are messing with my waistline and I like it!  

By far the best cookies and cupcakes I have ever had in my life.  I literally have to fight myself from not going here on a weekly basis.  Their double chocolate sea salt cookies are too die for as well as their Chocolate X2 Cupcakes.  

Everyone raves about Sprinkles but I won't give them the time of day.  They seem to be overpriced and on top of that they're not local.  

The staff at Urban Cookies are so friendly and they make the tastiest cupcakes yet!
