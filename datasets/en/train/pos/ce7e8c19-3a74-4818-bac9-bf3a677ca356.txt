Hidden gem in the valley. This place doesnt look it but it has the best chicken parm in phx. I dont care where in the valley you live get in your car and drive there, yes now! You will not be disappointed, well at least I wasnt. Again the CHICKEN PARM that is all you should be ordering, well that and the fried mozzarella.
