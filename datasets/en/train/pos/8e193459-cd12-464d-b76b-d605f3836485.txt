Outstanding!

I'm from Montana and was in town for a company Christmas party.  Of course we needed wine!

My co-worker needed to go to Best Buy for some wireless equipment and Total Wine was right next door so in I went.

At first I was completely overwhelmed.  Towers and rows of wine divided by type, country, and everything else.

I thought to myself, "Self, you're never going to find your wine here".  I was wrong.

The store is set up very intuitively.  I walked in, stopped and absorbed the massive inventory.  Then I turned left and three rows down located the 1.5L section.  I spotted my wine, proceeded to check out and was back in the car waiting on my co-worker.

Less than 10 minutes, in, out, and paid for.

Excellent!!
