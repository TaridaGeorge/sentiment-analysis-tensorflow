I was so happy to discover 101 Bistro - just a short walk from home and an awesome alternative to driving all the way to Tempe for some Pita Jungle.  

I had the Vegetarian Platter, which, IMHO, is WAY better than the Pita Jungle comparable plate, the Mediterranean Platter.  The dolmas were perfect, with cashews!  The hummus was slightly spicy, yum!  The Baba Ganoush was to die for.

I can't wait to go back.  YUM.
