Went to Phoenix with my baby over the weekend. He asks, "Baby wat u wanna eat?" I thought about it and said, "fried chicken, boo." Baby goes to get the food. When he comes back I'm looking at him like he's the LAST chicken wing on the table..."WHERE DA FOOD AT???" He hands me my container, which I almost drop cuz I ain't expectin that much food! I open and much to my delight...3 juicy (NOT greasy) pieces of chicken, greens, mac n cheese, and some good-ass corn bread. Baby wasn't lyin when he said this place was GOOD. He's from the South, so I knew to trust his judgment. =)  Can't wait to go back to Phoenix so I can have some mo' of that good good...food. LoL. ;-)
