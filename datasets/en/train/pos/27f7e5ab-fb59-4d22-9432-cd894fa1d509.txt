I'm in LOVE with Cornish Pasty Co!  If you've never had a pasty (pass-tee) before, picture a big pocket made from buttery-flaky crust and filled with your heart's desire!

They have nearly a dozen delicious, vegetarian pasties to choose from!  I love the Veggie Oggie filled with veggie-steak, potatoes, rutabaga and onions.  Mmmmm!  Pre-order 45 minutes before hand and they'll custom make you a vegan one!

My only complaint?  Since the place is so small it can really heat up because of the ovens.  Be prepared, it can get pretty hot in there!
