Was teetering between five and four stars and two things pushed me to the five... best white sangria and best red velvet cake which I have tried a lot of both.  Love it for lunch, dinner, or drinking on the patio.  I have been here several times but this is my first review.  Service is always fantastic, it is a great place for kids (better without did I mention white sangria).  When it comes to what I like to eat, there are so many choices.  The nachos are my first favorite but you need a friend to share them with you or get as an appetizer for a group.  I suggest ordering them the "old way" which means with black beans on them.  I encourage you to find your favorite.  Ohhhhhhh, I almost forgot this place make fantastic soup, this day it was vegan squash.  Prices are very reasonable.
