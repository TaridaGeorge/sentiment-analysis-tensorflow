Food and service were amazing.  We had the panchetta and brussel sprout flat bread and the smoked salmon scramble.  Service was right on with the check-ups and ensuring that we had everything we needed without bothering our conversation or meal.  I love the decor and open feel to the restaurant.  Definately a return for a brunch service!
