The must-eat for serious steakhouse enthusiasts. I've been made fun of for my love for the petite medallions (2 of 'em) and shrimp (Louisiana-style) on top, but there's nothing petite about my appetite, I kid you not. Put two of them together, and it's a luscious filet mignon meal. The cocktails are off the hook; and the delectable creamed spinach is an essential on the side. "Ruth's Chris" is one of those must-once-a-year occasions, it's expensive, but a necessary splurge for any true steak lover. Note: Don't get butter on your nose like I did; the waiter won't laugh at you but your friends will.
