Yayyy! Self serve frozen yogurt has finally hit Scottsdale! This is one of my fav yogurt places. Their yogurt is great, no chemically after taste and they always have a bunch of yummy flavors on hand. I love the cookies and cream. I also love that they have a gadzillion topping to choose from. One negative thing to say though.... Their toppings in the back are hard to reach for us tall people because of the glass that covers the toppings. I can never reach back there with out bending over, sticking my butt out (basically putting my head under the glass) and looking like a retard. So unfortunately the back toppings are going untouched by me. What a shame. Yogurtology...please raise the glass over the toppings! 
They also serve frozen yogurt for dogs! So bring your dog and you can enjoy some delish frozen yogurt together. How sweet!
