I would have never have even known about this place without this website.  It's tucked in the corner of a stripmall, pretty much across the parking lot from a Starbucks.  I wish I could sit in front of that store and direct them across the way to a place where your coffee doesn't taste like someone burned it.  

I've had several drinks here, all have been good.  Pastries are always freshly made.  

It's probably really a 4 star-ish place, but they get the extra star because the girl making my drink was wearing an Illini shirt.  Definite bonus points.
