Excellent food in a fantastic venue. The menu isn't extensive, but the food is so good that it more than makes up for what some might see as a lack of variety. Perfect for those times when you get a craving for an amazing basket of nachos between bands (the next room over, in The Crescent Ballroom). Prices were reasonable too. I'm already contemplating what to order on my next visit.
