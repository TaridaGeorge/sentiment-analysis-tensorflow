Woke up this morning with a sick dog and a wheezy cat.   Saturday morning, but they still fit both of them in.  They have been absolutely amazing over the years, everything from clipping dog nails to putting my sweet older cat down after she was diagnosed with cancer. I also love that they have the place divided into two:  a cat side and a dog side, so that if I'm bringing in my cat, she's not surrounded by sniffing, barking dogs.  AND.....they have cats for adoption on a regular basis for only $40:  a deal!

They are all around professional, caring people.  Thank you!
