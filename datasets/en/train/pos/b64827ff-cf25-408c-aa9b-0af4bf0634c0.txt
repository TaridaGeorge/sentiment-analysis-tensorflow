Wow.  Plain and simple.  Wow.  The Eddie Lopez pastrami burger was pure Awesome and the fries they came with were a delight.  Came in because of the yelp reviews.  Our party of nine was pleased.  I recommend the blueberry Maine root soda and the Gale's rootbeer.  I am glad there is a place like this on the west side.  I am looking forward to my next visit.  Cheers to rocket burgers and subs!
