This is a great place for gelato!!! They make their own gelato on site, the owner has a degree from Gelato university in Italy. This is real authentic Italian gelato...really one of the best I have tasted. I bought a cone with pistachio and the chocolate cookie flavour...was yummy!
Forget about the Gelato spot -- i tried their pistachio and it was not authentic gelato! Spread the word on Cool Gelato  - will def go there again on my next trip to Phoenix. They were a little hard to find but definitely worth looking for!
