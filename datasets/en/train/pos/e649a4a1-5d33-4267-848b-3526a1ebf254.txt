I used to work nearby and would visit JOTC weekly for lunch. It was never very busy and the lunch waiter would recognize us and get us everything we needed quickly.

The Keema Samosas are delicious!

If you are new to Indian food, I recommend the Non-Veg Thaali. It has an assortment of Tandoori chicken, curry, a veg dish, naan bread, yogurt and rice pudding - all for $10.

My favorite dish and the one I ordered every time was the Chicken Tikka Masala. It's like $15 and doesn't come with naan or rice, but it's worth it. It's a lot of food and it makes me oh-so-happy everytime.

By comparison, the lunch Chicken Curry special for $8 comes with rice AND naan. 

The rice pudding is excellent as well.

I will miss JOTC!
