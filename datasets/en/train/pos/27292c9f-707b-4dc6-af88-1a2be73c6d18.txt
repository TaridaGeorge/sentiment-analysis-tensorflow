Awesome food! I love the option of heat level on the spicy Thai dishes they have red pepper powder and pickled jalape√±os
On the side to turn it up a notch. It takes a bit of time for dinner, so don't be in a hurry. Take a few friends  and try a few different dishes! I LOVE the Jungle Princess dish and the Thai chicken wings are sweet and tangy.
