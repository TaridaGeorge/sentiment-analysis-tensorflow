This place has some serious food!  I enjoyed their grilled fontina & mozzarella with procuitto (sp) and roasted tomatoes on whole wheat bread.  It was messy, but fantastic.  My husband enjoyed his sub.  We both enjoyed a side of pasta w/basil pesto, cucumber, tomato, and mozzarella.  My 3 year old tackled their mac and cheese, which was almost too good for someone her age.  

We will be back!
