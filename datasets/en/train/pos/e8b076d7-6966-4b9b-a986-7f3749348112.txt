This place was AWESOME! I could not get over how friendly everyone at the restaurant was ("Oh, you haven't been here before? Let me give you a tour") and if you had to wait for a table, they would serve your beverages while you are waiting. We ordered the spinach salad and added shrimp (which were basically huge grilled prawns) which was delicious and then a simple small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms. The crust was thin and crispy and the pepperoni and mushrooms were baked under the cheese so that you would not lose any of the toppings on to your plate! Just the regular salad and small pizza was enough to stuff both me and my boyfriend! You cannot go wrong at this place, our best lunch experience in Scottsdale.
