Pita Jungle has earned a very special place in my heart as "comfort food".  I've been enjoying their incredible food for over 10 years now.  I feel confident in assuring you that anything on the menu is thoughtfully crafted and Incredibly delicious.
As much as I adore this establishment, I will offer one warning:
My friends and I typically avoid the apache Blvd. location.
90% of the time we manage to get a server named something akin to "rainbow flower" or "moon stream" and they tend to forget you are there or choose to ignore you completely.  Rest  assured, the food is consistently amazing, It's just the service.

This location (ray rd.), however, has always impressed me with impeccable service.
