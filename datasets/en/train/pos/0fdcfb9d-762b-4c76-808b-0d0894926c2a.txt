Best chinese food ever, period. LOVE this place! No, they don't deliver, and it is about 35min round trip from where I live, but you will not hear me complain! It's 100% worth it! Everyone is really friendly and the food is such good quality and tastes amazing. I don't eat from any other chinese restaurants now, only Iron Chef!

PS- you can also order online.
