I thought my boots were beyond repair after a long trip to San Francisco.  Little did I know, the owner of JR's Shoe Repair is a miracle worker. 

My colleagues urged me to visit JR's Shoe repair for some boot-TLC. It's an unassuming shop tucked away in the west corner of the AJ's center. Just walk in, discuss the repairs and when you need them, and pay. 

He's super speedy and did an absolutely phenomenal job. My beloved boots are resoled, refurbished and look brand spankin new. They look better than they did when I purchased them!  

Do yourself a favor, don't go out and waste your time trying to find a replacement pair. Take them to JR's for some pampering.
