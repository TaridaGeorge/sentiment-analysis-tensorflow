My Lola dog had a terrible allergic reaction to something. I called the clinic and they were very friendly and gave me some advice to get us through the night after we determined her reaction was not too serious. They made an appointment for me the next day and Dr. Bryan and all of the techs were great! I really feel they care about my dog and the price for the treatment was very reasonable. They also have a clinic once a month with discounted vaccine prices. If you need a vet in this area (and it's worth the drive if you're not that close), I highly recommend this establishment!
