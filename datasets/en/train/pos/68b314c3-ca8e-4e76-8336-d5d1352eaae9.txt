I was a bartender at Jupes off and on for 20 years! Love the owners, they are my family!! Never had a better job or time in my life, ice cold beer, frozen glasses, great clientele. You can shoot pool, throw darts, play the ass kickin jukebox or just sit and get tore up with the regulars!! The bar is kept very dark so let your eyes adjust when you walk in and if you are a Minnesota Vikings fan.........this place is for you!!!
