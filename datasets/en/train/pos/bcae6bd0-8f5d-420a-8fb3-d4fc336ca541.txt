pleasantly surprised by the variety of costume jewelry here, right now they have a lot of interesting summer sun hats in the $20 range.  A fun browse with friends when you happen to be downtown or going by on the light rail.  The lady in line in front of me in line yesterday was agonizing over what to buy because there were so many things she knew she would never find back home...in Chicago!  Take that, Chicago.
