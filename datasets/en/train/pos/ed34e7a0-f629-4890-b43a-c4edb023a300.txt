Discovered this gem - for a last minute lunch @ scottsdale. It's a quaint little place, tucked away in the middle of nowhere (seems to be near construction??) The staff was warm and friendly. The decor reminded me of a little bistro in Paris :)

The food was cheap- hors d'oeuvres looked appetizing- I had escargots. The snails were perfectly baked, din care for the puff pastry that much. the main course I had was salmon, perfectly seared on a bed of microgreens. the salad was tasty and and a kick to it. My bf had roasted chicken crepes... which i din care very much for.

Dessert was chocolate brulee, although we had asked for poached pear. But it was also good-not too sweet. 

The total for lunch came up short of $40 for two, which imo was very worth the money! Will go back!
