I am a pizza lover!  I could eat pizza every day for lunch and for dinner!  This is one of my favorite pizza places in town!  I bring all out of town guests here and frequent the place as often as I can. 

I always get the capriccoisa pizza (not sure if I spelled that right), but it has olives, proscuitto and mushrooms!  

AND I always get a crepe for dessert!  My personal favorite is strawberry and nutella.  To die for!
