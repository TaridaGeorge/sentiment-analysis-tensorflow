I was so very excited to eat here as I had been trying for a number of years.  The wait was not bad and we were seated within 30 minutes on a Thursday morning.

Everyone was polite and this being a very tiny spot everything was quick.
I ordered the waffle and bacon and my wife had the ham and cheese omelet. WOW is all I can say we were both impressed and I really enjoyed the waffle and the thick sliced bacon.

My wife really really enjoyed the thick sliced bread with the strawberry preserves and her omelet was amazing. Also the chocolate milk was very very good.

If your in phoenix I cant say enough that you should try Matt 's for friendly service and great food. It is worth the wait.
