If you are looking for a store full of dehydrated and freeze-dried foods visit FoodWise! There is a huge selection of foods and cookware.  There are also classes that you can take which will teach you how to make amazingly tasty, healthy bread that can be made with the foods sold in the store.  While my experience with the FoodWise section of the store is limited, I love when I go to Mr.KnifeGuy (see my other post) and one of the ladies that just finished teaching a bread making class, brings over some tasty pieces of bread for for us to try.
