Breakfast at this place is awesome, great food, prices, and customer service unlike no other.  Once had an issue with some bread, they refunded my bread, and gave me a 10.00 gift card for the trouble.  

They also respond very well to feedback on Twitter, @wildflowerbread

One of the best dishes they have is the chicken caesar salad!  To die for on a hot summer day!
