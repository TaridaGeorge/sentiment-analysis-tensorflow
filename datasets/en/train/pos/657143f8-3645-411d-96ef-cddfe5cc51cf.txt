When I got here it was empty.  REALLY empty (I contributed the photo of the interior...look at how empty it was).  I'm guessing it's because it was pretty late at night (the mall had already closed) on a weekday.  

We got the potstickers as an appetizer.  It was good, but it was no different from the frozen stuff you'd get at the store.  I got the sea bass as an entree and it was GREAT!  The fish was tender and flavorful.

I'm giving this place 5 stars because this is easily the best meal I had during my short stay in Arizona.

(In case you're wondering what the worst was, it was a chicken burrito at the airport.  Tasted like wet Kleenex in a tortilla)
