Yasu Sushi Bistro is located in close proximity to the Paradise Valley Mall.

I highly recommend that you start with Sweet Shrimp and the duck sampler.

For the entrée, I highly recommend the grilled black sea bass. The bass is grilled to a near char -- yet beneath the skin, the meat is white, moist, and flavorful. The bass is accompanied with a uniquely flavored sauce.

Sashimi/Sushi prices range from about $6 to $15. Entrées range from about $17 to $75 for the Wagyu beef (approximate). The grilled black sea bass is about $20.

Of all the Japanese/Sushi restaurants in Phoenix, Yasu Sushi Bistro is at the top of my list.
