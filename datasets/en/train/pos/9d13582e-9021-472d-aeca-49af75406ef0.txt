I am in love with this place. Met here for a business lunch and was blown away. We met at 11:30 to beat the crowd -- good thing because by noon the place was packed (good sign). I had the Hand Roll Special (three different rolls, soup and salad) and everything was fantastic. I never did ask what each one was called, but one was a crunch roll with a tuna and a jalapeno pepper. The world would be a better place if I could eat that every day. The other two were just as good. I was just as impressed with the service. The servers were all very friendly, helpful and attentive -- but not too attentive if you know what I mean. I will absolutely be back.
