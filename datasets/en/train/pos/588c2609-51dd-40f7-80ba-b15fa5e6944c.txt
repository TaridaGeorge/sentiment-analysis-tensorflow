Always I have found a good time here! Downstairs they have 'Cowboy Karaoke' the local old timers singing old time hits... And you know what? It's always entertaining. I've met and had great conversations with the bar patrons. Been upstairs with the tiki torches going on cool evenings with the younger crowd too. Something for everyone at The Vine. One time really drunk I looked over an saw Elvis enjoying himself here as well. Well bourbon in a short glass with coke, nice price, very reasonable so I'll stay for another, and maybe get a bite to eat. Here you will find the real old west of scottsdale, that you've been looking for
