CHIP IS GONE! I called yesterday 10/16/2012, and I was told that he no longer works there by some girl. OMG, what am I going to do. Chip is the best groomer ever and I need to find him, my Lhasa Apso hates everyone but him. I was told he's been gone for a month and that he works at "AT&T" , "Like the phone company?" I asked and she said yes.
