Yeah, I'm giving a Domino's Pizza five stars. Whatcha gonna do about it?

Here's why. I know Domino's isn't a high class joint, but you have to rate it against what it is. Among inexpensive pizza delivery places, I think this particular Domino's is pretty damn good.

1. You can order online, and then a tracker gives you by-the-minute updates on your pizza's status.

2. They ALWAYS have coupons, and they're easy to use online.

3. They deliver fast. I've had pizza in my mouth within 20 minutes of clicking "order."

4. I like the new recipe pizza. It's not gourmet, but if I wanted gourmet, I wouldn't be ordering Domino's. I ordered Domino's because I wanted something greasy and hot that pairs well with my beer.

5. They are cheap! I get convenience, speed, and tastiness for a minimum price!
