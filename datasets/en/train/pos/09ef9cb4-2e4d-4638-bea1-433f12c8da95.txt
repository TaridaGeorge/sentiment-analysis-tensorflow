Probably visited this place about 4 times since moving to AZ - wish we made it up here more but the distance is not desirable. Absolute favorite place to eat. Never disappointment with our meals. I tried a new dish every visit, of course we love the hummus & pita apps - ordered 2xs. My husband loves the ahi sliders and seems to gravitate to that with each visit. I can say, we will "pig out" but never feel like it when we dine here. We just feel healthier.
