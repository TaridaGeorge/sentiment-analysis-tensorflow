One evening here and you will be scratching your head as to why there aren't more German restaurants around. The atmosphere is cozy, crowded, and congenial.  The decor is Bavarian and what you'd want in capturing the right ambiance.  And then the food...
I know the German menu might seem heavy and uncreative to most.  But for those times when you are craving something more substantial always trust a man in lederhosen.  This place has incredible schnitzels and sausages.  I recommend their specials.  The rouladen brings back memories of the German family in my childhood neighborhood and their marinara schnitzel blitzkriegs the flavor out of any chicken parmigiana you are going to get at the myriad Italian joints.
