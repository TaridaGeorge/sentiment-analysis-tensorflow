Now that I'm living back in Central PHX I got a membership once again at Movies On Central. 

I love their selection and I can usually find that odd arty flick here that most other video stores don't carry. Just like this weekend I was searching for "Ladies and Gentleman Introducing The Fabulous Stains" starring a teenage Diane Lane and Movies on Central had it! 

I like how they have a cult movie section and section off movies by director.

If you are a movie buff this store is for you.
