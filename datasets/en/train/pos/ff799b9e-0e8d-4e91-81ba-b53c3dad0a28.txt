We had dinner last night at Moki's, which is very much open. It was soooo delicious! I had the Ohana platter with bbq salmon, teriyaki chicken and breaded shrimp with rice and potato mac salad and my husband had Loco Moco with sirloin patty, 2 eggs and gravy over rice with potato mac salad. It was all wonderful and nothing was left when we were done!!!
We will definitely be coming back. For dessert we tried Grandma's Chocolate cake with coconut ice cream. It was heavenly...homemade, even the ice cream! We brought an Ohana platter to go to our daughter and she wolfed it down! My husband got the Spam sushi to go too and loved it. Everything fresh and homemade is why we will be coming back!!! The bonus is the service with Aloha and Mahalo!!!
