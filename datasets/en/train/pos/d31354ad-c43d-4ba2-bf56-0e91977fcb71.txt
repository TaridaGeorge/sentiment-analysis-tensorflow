Good no-frills cleaner.  They do a good job, it's always done on time, and the price is good.  You won't get any extras like bags, night drop-off, and stuff like that, but you do get a good low price and clean clothing that is nicely pressed.  It's the only place I go to any more.

Tonight they let my wife in to pick stuff up when she got there after closing.  That's an extra star in my book.
