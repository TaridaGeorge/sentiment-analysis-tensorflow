Best store in the Valley, possibly the State.  Plays all sorts of games (Magic, Spoils, WoW, D&D, board games, etc). Has fun and competitive tournaments both, and the best selection of cards in the Valley.  Great snack bar!  Store is clean too!

FYI that my rating is for the original ManaWerx, not the MW run under new ownership in conjunction with Imperial Outpost.

4/4/2012 - ManaWerx has been purchased by the owner of Rookies 2 Legends.  The new owner is great (see my review of R2L) and I expect things to pick up at ManaWerx.
