As a member of the Catholic and Greek Orthodox Faith, I'm proud to be a member of St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church. I attend Mass here every other Sunday and often attend a mid week morning Mass. I love the traditions of the Church and always feel at ease here. Christmas Midnight Mass is a true joy -- Love the festive Christmas Holiday decor of our Church.

 As a gay man, I'm often ridiculed for my deep Catholic faith. My faith and beliefs are those of my own and between God and myself...and I'm thankful to share spiritual moments at St. Francis Xavier Catholic Church.
