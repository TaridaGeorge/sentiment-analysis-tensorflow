Decided to go to Beckett's Table because of Yelp's reviews.  It was exactly as described.  We had to try the cheddar bacon biscuits and glad we did.  They were flaky, tasty and no butter needed.  And yes, we did the macaroni and cheese as well.  Listen, if were going to Beckett's table we were going to try it all!  The mac & cheese was a unique blend but it worked.  We also had the short rib dish.  The meat just fell apart.  The yukon mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious.  We may have overdone it but it was well worth it.  Plenty more to try next time.  Oh, and try an Arnold Palmer...mmm mmm!  Cool ambiance too!  Beautiful presentation & great service.  A nice surprise for the location.  Great place, give it a try!
