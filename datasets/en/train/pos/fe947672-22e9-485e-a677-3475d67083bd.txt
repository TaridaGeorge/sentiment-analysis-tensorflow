I had lunch here this week for the first time. I happened to notice this place when driving by and decided to take a friend to give it a try as she always like this kind of place. The historic house has a wonderful atomsphere.  I had the spek and my friend had the vegetariano.  We were both impressed with the food, it was fresh and delicious. Service was very good also, my glass was never empty.  I look forward to coming back some evening and trying the pizza.
