Best Sushi in town!!! From the setting (great music) to the food.  Surfer roll, asparagus roll (wrapped in cucumber), volcano chicken, calamari,  kobe burger ...just a few of my favorites!!!  I love how they are willing to wrap any roll in cucumber....the coolness and crispness of the cucumber is a wonder addition/change to any sushi!!!! A lot of other places are reluctant to do that (maybe because it takes a little more time???)

And just to add a "cherry on top" (as if its needed)...one of the most beautiful servers I've ever seen.....not a common name...if memory serves..I believe it was Jillian...ask for her!! Not only is she "easy on the eyes" but she will give A+ service!!!!!!
