I've been to AJK a number of times and it is always good. I've had the ma-po tofu, garlic chicken, and pad thai. I enjoyed the ma-po the most out of those three dishes - it had a thick and flavorful sauce that had me wanting more.

The ingredients have always seem pretty fresh. The service was good. The interior of the place is done very nicely, they definitely put a lot of effort into the atmosphere of the place. I am used to many Chinese places being completely bare bones in terms of interior, so this was a pleasant surprise.

Also! on a side note, I was so happy to find a local place that has good boba / pearl tea drinks. They only have milk tea and Thai tea, but both are really good.
