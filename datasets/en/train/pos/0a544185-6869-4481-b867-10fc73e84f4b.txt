Honestly some of the best food I have had in a long time.  My husband and I eat out a lot, but as people often do, we get stuck going to the same places.  So this time we tried the Roka, it was delicious.  I am not a huge connoisseur of Sushi or Japanese dining overall, but if you're new, they help you choose some of their signature dishes and your old favorites are to die for. 

We were able to get out of there for just over $100...but we drank a lot of wine, so that helped our bill push the $100 mark :)
