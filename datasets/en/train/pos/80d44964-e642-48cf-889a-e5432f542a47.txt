I've been a member at another local gym that also has "Fitness" in their name, and they are nothing like Competitive Fitness! I have never been to a gym that really challenged me like this one does. The trainers actually care about your progress and work with you to modify daily workouts to fit your abilities. So, you never have to feel like you can't do something. In fact, they'll help you have the confidence that you can. The gym has a WOD or "Workout of the Day" which everyone participates in. There is always a trainer around to help answer any questions and motivate you. Members are very friendly and supportive of each other. I would recommend this gym for everyone!
