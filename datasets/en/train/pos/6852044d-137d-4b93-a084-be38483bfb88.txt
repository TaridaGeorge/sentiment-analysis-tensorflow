LOVE THIS STORE!  Everything country and such neat finds.  Some day, I will clear out my house and head to Cave Creek and the Lazy Lizard to completely redecorate it (will wait till the teens have flown the nest because it might make them crazy).. Love the cowboy/girl handmade cards for birthdays, weddings, etc.  The staff was very friendly and welcoming.  Just a really fun place to search for that perfect cowgirl find.
