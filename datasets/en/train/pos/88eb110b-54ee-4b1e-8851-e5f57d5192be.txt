My family has been going to "The Place" for the last four years and keep going back because of the service. They recently moved into the old 3 Margiritas building on the SW corner of 51st and Bell and they are busier than ever! The waitress' all know our family and even when they are super busy they always stop to say hi to the kids. The 2 Egg Breakfast (less than $5) if more than enough food for one person. Everything on the menu is great. Will keep going back for many many years if the service and quality stay like this!
