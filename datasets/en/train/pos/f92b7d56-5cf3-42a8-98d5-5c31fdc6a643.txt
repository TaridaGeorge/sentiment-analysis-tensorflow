Anything and everything for the gear junkie.  If they don't have what you want it's a great idea and thought generator for what you're gona want for the future.  The staff is useful for the weekend warrior but as you become more experienced you become accostumed to what you want and find the super tech geek in the store to help you out. HAHA.  Overall the store is super fun to just browse in fiddle faddle with gear you'll only use when your roughen' it!
