My favorite sushi place in the valley. The fish is always fresh and I've even been there when the chefs were about to filet a big eye tuna. Great stuff!

Located in an ugly strip mall which can be a deterrence from trying. Don't let this stop you. The service is nice and casual and they remember you.
