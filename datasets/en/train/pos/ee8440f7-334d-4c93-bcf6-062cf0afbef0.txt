I don't think I've ever been to this place when it's not been crazy busy. It's just a small little eatery, but it's always busy. They have some great food and the peanut butter pie is delicious. Just a place to hang out and enjoy some breakfast, lunch, dinner or snacks at. Parking isn't the best and that is a problem, but if you live close and can walk, its ideal.
