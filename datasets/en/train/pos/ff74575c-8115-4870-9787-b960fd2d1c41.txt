Prior to going to 'Sushi On Shea' I had only been to Ra. I knew nothing about sushi, but did have at least a sample of what is out there as I know Ra is everywhere. Sushi On Shea offers individuals the exclusivity of having some phenomenal sushi with someone without running into people you may not want to see. It is tucked away in the corner on the second floor but is very spacious and with extremely gracious service. Very nice fish tank to gaze upon even if you decide to get your food to go. More of a formal sitting than a casual sushi bar such as Ra. Can be intimate with seating available. The wait is a bit longer than some places but not bad!
