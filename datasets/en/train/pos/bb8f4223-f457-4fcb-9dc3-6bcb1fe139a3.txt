I guess Over Easy is one of those places people either love or hate. Fortunately I love it. We decided to make the trek to Phoenix for breakfast recently and chose Over Easy because it is close to my office and I thought it looked cool when I'd driven by.

Located in remodeled Taco Bell it's a funky space with a diverse crowd. So un-Scottsdale. That's one of the things I love about Over Easy. The food is pretty darn good too.

Yes, I agree the food it a little on the high side, but for me it's worth it. I loved the French Toast with carmelized bananas.

Give Over Easy a try and let us know what YOU think!
