I normally don't write reviews for Starbucks but this one deserves some kuddos. I'm here a lot waiting for my wife to finish at ASU. I do all kinds of writing here...yeah I'm there a lot :)

If I want to go to Starbuck's, I try to make it this one. Especially if I want a frappuccino. For some reason, these people just know how to make it right. They are friendly here and quick. If you come there somewhat regularly they usually know your name and drink. Not to bad for a chain store. While I prefer local coffee houses, I found myself here a lot this semester. I was very pleased. Probably one of the best starbuck's I've been to in tempe. And they have a lot of comfortable seating...not just wooden chairs.
