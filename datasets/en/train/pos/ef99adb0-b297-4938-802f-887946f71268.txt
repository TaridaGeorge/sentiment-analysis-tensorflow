So happy that they have a Yogurt Land here.
Coming from LA - where yogurt land was on the corner of my block - I was so excited to find them here too!

They are hands down the best self serve frozen yogurt around.

I tasted the PB&J, it was soooo real tasting!

Recommended to all froyo lovers to head here asap.

Gluten free flavors are clearly listed!
