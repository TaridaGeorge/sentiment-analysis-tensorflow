I came across this little gem while on my way to visit my folks in Phoenix, AZ.
the service was exceptional, the treats to die for. We showed up at their door at closing time, 5:00pm., Eugene greeted us and said it's OK, he will get us what we want. WOW!, he has been there since 6;00am so I was truly impressed. he gave us some advice on some of the items we were looking at and left with a bunch of goodies for the family. all in all. everything was great!
I would recommend this for anyone who has a hankering for something good.
Give it a try, you will not be disappointed!
