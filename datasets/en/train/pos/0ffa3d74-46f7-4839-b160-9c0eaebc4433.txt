This place is fantastic if you have the hobby of collecting gems and minerals. Don't bother driving to Sedona or somewhere else, because the prices here cannot be beat. Unless of course you can purchase rocks  & Gems in wholesale. I was very impressed with their selection, and their 'fair trade' hand made items. The people who work in the store will also answer any questions, and are very knowledgeable. Sometimes I go in here just to chill out and touch the rocks. ha ha.
