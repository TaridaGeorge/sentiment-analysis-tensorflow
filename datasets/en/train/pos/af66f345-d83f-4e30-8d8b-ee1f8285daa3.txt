Pro check is the best company from 3 others  I used prior when I purchased properties. They are honest, fast, and can be trusted. They will give you a very detailed report; I got 52 pages with pictures. The inspector gave some idea how to fix small repairs. They are awesome if I could give them 6 starts, I would.
