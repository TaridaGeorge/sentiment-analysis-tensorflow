Normally I get a little frustrated at hardware stores because I often don't even know the name of the thing I'm looking for, so I have to do that awkward "It looks like this and it's shaped like this, and it does this" with hand motions.  Well I did that this time and the person who listened to me was very helpful. 
Then a true miracle happened.  I was standing waiting to get a key made.  The person making the keys was helping someone else.  All of the sudden, another employee of the store saw me, asked if I needed help, and then made a key for me. Bing bam boom. Done. 
Very helpful and friendly store.
