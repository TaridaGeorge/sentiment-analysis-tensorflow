So to compensate for my not-so-positive review I just wrote, I am writing accolades for one of my favorite places.  

As far as vegan fare, this is the best as it gets.  And I'm not even vegan or vegetarian...and that's saying quite a lot.

Their food is yummy and affordable (and makes me feel better that I'm eating at least one meatless dish for the day).  The ambiance is just such a cool, beatnik, hippie vibe, that I'm surprised they don't have live local music on occasion.  

I pretty much like everything on the menu, but my absolute favs:

1) any of the tsoynamis
2) drunken mushroom with mock chicken
3) BBQ chicken sandwich
4) mongolian bowl w/mock beef

Who knew mock meat could be so tasty?!
