We have only gone to Tempe Camera for repairs of our DSLR. We had a cracked LCD screen and went to Ritz camera and they told us a minimum of  $300 and it would take weeks, so we took it to Tempe Camera and it took like 4 days and $50. They were honest and totally down to earth. They could have screwed us but they didn't. That shows a lot about a company.  I have heard they have good classes but have yet to partake. I would recommend this place HANDS DOWN.
