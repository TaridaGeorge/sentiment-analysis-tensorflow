This is one of my coffee haunts. It's a good place to meet and talk through all the pressing issues of the world. I am confident that the cure for cancer will not be found in an obscure medical lab somewhere, but will be realized by a group of people meeting at a coffee house and talking about it over the third cup of tripple shot espresso. Who knows, it may be right here.
