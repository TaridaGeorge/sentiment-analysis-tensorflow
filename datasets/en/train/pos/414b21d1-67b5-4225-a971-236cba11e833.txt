I adore this little food-to-go/eat at your leisure spot! I've been on a wild goose hunt for great Hue food and I finally found it! Being from San Diego, I loved eating at the infamous Hoai Hue, however it has failed me twice after moving to its new location. On a happier note, Hue Gourmet's menus is authentic and so is the taste of bun mang vit, bun bo hue, nem heo, and banh beo. That is all I've tried so far, however I'm sure the rest of the menu won't disappoint me!
