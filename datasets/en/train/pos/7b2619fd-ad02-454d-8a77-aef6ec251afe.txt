I love this place! where els can you go and get 3 types of hang outs in 1 bar. You have the down stairs where you can watch a live band (metelhead!) and listen to some great music. Then go outside and get a totally different vibe and you can actually talk to someone with out it being too loud. Go upstairs and it turns into a full on night club. Yeah this place is the best. THE HOTTEST SPOT FOR A SUNDAY NIGHT!!!  

The staff is very friendly and the bartenders are attractive and nice. I have read some of the reviews on here and I'm kinda shocked cuz i have never had a bad time at this bar. its been around for ever and still going strong.
