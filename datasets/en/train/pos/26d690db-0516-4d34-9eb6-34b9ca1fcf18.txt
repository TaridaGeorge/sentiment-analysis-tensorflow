I ordered the veggie pho (with tofu) and the iced condensed coffee. Yum! Both were heavenly. Seriously. This marks the first time I actually sought out the little cubes of tofu and ate them willingly. The hoisin, sriracha & other spices were already on the table. I like my pho spicy and I spent the entire time wiping away the spice induced tears. It was fabulous. Bean sprouts, basil & lime extras were brought with the order. The broth was super aromatic (cinnamon? allspice?) and tasty. It was a good portion. Slightly pricy at $7 but it was raining outside and totally worth it. I will be back to try the bahn mi.
