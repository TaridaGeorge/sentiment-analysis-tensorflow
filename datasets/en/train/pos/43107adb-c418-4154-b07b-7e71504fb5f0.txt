Delicious and family owned!

I've been to Niccoli's only twice and the first time I went the owners made me feel like part of their family. After reading and watching a video about this little place I decided to give their desserts a try, boy were they good. They BEST cannoli that I've ever had the amazing wedding cookies. 

The second time I went I gave one of their sandwiches a try. They were delicious!!! Again, everyone makes you feel so welcome and like you're part of the family. :)
