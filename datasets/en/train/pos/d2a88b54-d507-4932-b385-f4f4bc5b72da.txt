Excellent Service, Excellent Food, Excellent Ambiance. The Oyster Rockefeller was great, the house salad (has seafood in it) was huge and can be split for two, the Prime Steaks were great and the Carrot cake with whip cream could feed 5. This is a fine establishment. Only thing is out of the way if your in Phoenix and it is expensive. But this is the best Steakhouse in the Phoenix area.
