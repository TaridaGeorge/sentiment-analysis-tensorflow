The food here is really good!  And it is very affordable.  I strongly recommend the Spartan Club sandwich.  Excellent!  The staff are very friendly and accomodating.  It is a good place to go for a casual meal and it is in a great location.  I plan on visiting many more times.  My wife and I go there with our young son and it is a good place for kids as well as adults.
