I love their food, even if it took me more than two or three attempts to figure out that you can customize your burrito. I love that they supposedly don't use microwaves and only use the freshest ingredients available. I also like that they have the salsa self serve like Senor Taco or Filibertos, but it's fresh. 

Five stars, even if it IS fast food. ; )
