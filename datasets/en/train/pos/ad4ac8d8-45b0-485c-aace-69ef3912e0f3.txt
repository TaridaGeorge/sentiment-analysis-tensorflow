We were looking for coffee after lunch right around the Deer Valley airport and saw the Coffee Grove's flag on the side of the road.

Jill made me feel right at home from the moment I walked in. The coffee was excellent and strong. I would have gone back for more just before closing if I didn't have a long flight ahead of me.

I'll definitely be back. I can hardly wait for our next trip to DVT!
