I LOVE Dr. Kells and his staff! I stumbled upon his office listing online when I was searching for a new OB. I had just found out I was pregnant and the OB I had been seeing had just retired.
   The thing that has impressed me the most is that Dr. Kells has called me PERSONALLY. I was on a lot of medications when I found out I was pregnant and Dr. Kells did research on them and called me to explain all his findings, even giving me numbers for places to follow up with. He also called when I had a concern, asking me questions and putting my mind at ease.
   Their office has squeezed me in twice for same-day visits due to my symptoms and background. I have always been met with compassion and top-notch care.
