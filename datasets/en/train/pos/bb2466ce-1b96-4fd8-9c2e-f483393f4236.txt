As a picky-pesca-tarian, I was initially nervous about eating at Nobuo for fear of ordering like an asshole. Surprisingly, I was interested in numerous dishes and completely satisfied with each one and continue to up the ante on my coming of age eating habits.. 

 The teeter tots, i could eat by the truck load, as well as the pickled watermelon radish. - Still craving these two bites.
 The seabass and mushrooms were my favorite.
 I had a bite or two of: the pork belly buns- soft shell crab sandwich- the okonomiyaki..all wonderful flavors, but by this point I was filling up. 
 To finish we split the orange fritters and throughout I had a couple Devil's Haircut cocktails...hands down, my new favorite valley cocktail.

 It's always a pleasure to go to Nobuo, Sit at the bar if it's available so you can watch/chat with the magic man at work.
