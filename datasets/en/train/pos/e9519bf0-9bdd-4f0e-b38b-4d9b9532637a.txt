STICK W/ THE AMERICA WEST FLIGHTS! BELIEVE IT OR NOT, US AIRWAYS PROVES TO BE THE SAFEST AIRLINE I'VE EVER FLOWN! THE PILOTS ARE COOL AND THE FLIGHTS ATTENDANTS ARE COURTEOUS. I flew from lax-ams then ams-phl-phx-lax I've seen how they function. The PHX LAX flight was comfy, there was leather seats and the flight attendants served from the rear of economy to the front(I thats a lot better) and to speed up on the drinks, the f-class Fa would even serve economy. I never had an issue with them except PHL TO AMS, we were delayed for 2hrs for our broken screen! stupid FAA laws, they could've removed it and let us take off but no we had to wait for paper work!
