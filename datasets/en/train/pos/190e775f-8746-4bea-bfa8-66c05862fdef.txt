I enjoy eating at Firebirds and take advantage of wine down Monday's often. Half price wine by the glass or bottle on some very nice wines. The bar staff is always friendly and always on top of things. The manager of this location, Tammy is a great person who runs this restaurant extremely well. There are a lot of places to dine in the area but this place stands out and I would highly recommend it.
