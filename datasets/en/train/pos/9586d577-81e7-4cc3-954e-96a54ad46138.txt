With the exception that they should have made this one twice as big (you can hardly find a seat around noon) I've never once had a wrong order and sometimes I order some complex stuff. Employees are like, overly happy which is actually sometimes annoying, but oh well. But yeah, In N Out hardly even needs a review... everyone knows the food is always incredible.

And Amanda B is right! There used to be a little green house that was on this lot before they finally gave in.
