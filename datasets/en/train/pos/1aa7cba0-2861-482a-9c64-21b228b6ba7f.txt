For some reason, the Mortal Kombat theme song starts playing in my head every time I step into Last Chance. This is a battleground, for sure, and if you are dedicated (it takes time to sift through the racks), sharp-eyed (goods can be damaged or pre-owned), and willing to undress in front of others (the dressing room is set up like a high school locker room), you will walk away with all the spoils of war. Shoes, suits, ballgowns, purses...I have walked away with seriously cheap and fabulous finds.
