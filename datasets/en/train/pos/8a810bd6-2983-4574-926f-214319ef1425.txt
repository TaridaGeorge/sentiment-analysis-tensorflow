These guys are awesome.  As a first time home buyer, hiring anyone to work on your house is scary.  I found these guys here on Yelp and called them up.  They stopped over to my house after working in an attic all day to check out what I needed.  The next day they came to start the work- they did everything they said they were going to do and more.  They explained everything they were doing to my boyfriend and I, and gave us an overview of how things worked.  

These two are not your typical guys- they do their work with a smile and tell you how it is.  They are honest and I will not hesitate to have them back for anything else we may need.... which is probably a lot!

Cheers, Good Guys!  And THANKS!
