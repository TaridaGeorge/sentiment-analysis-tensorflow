16 Reviews, and its hidden.  I will leave this review somewhat vague, as that's what they want.  Its an old school speak easy.  Really good drinks, very knowledgeable mixologist (not bartenders).  Parties over 6 will have a tough time sitting together as the place hold 30 people.  This is not a great place to "pre-party:, as they will ask you to keep it down if needed.  Great place to have a drink before hitting the rest of Scottsdale, of 1 after dinner.  Remember, this is a little place, but everything is hand made.  10 minutes for your drink is expected, but well worth it.
