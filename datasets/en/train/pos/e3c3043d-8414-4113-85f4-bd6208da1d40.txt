Love, Love, Love this restaurant. Everything I have tried here is tasty and priced right. Try the Fungi pizza, risotto, or the spinach salad. Amazing french fries covered with parmesan cheese. The service is great and the atmosphere is fantastic! Great place for families too, but get there by 5:30 if you are bringing the kiddos. My kids love the spaghetti and risotto balls. Terrific place for happy hour on Friday night if you're kid free. Lots of eye candy.
