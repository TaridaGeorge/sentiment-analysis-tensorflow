Well, I should probably start out by saying that I've never had pho before, so I don't have anything to compare this to, but nevertheless... I have never tasted something so delicious! A friend of mine picked up an order of beef pho for me and showed me how to prepare it. The portion was so huge I had to search high and low for a big enough bowl to put it in! Major bonus? It was SUPER cheap!! I just wish the location was closer to me in Scottsdale!
