If you need to mail something go see the owner of this place.  He is usually there and is super helpful.  I had used this store many times and he would help me tape boxes up, make sure my items are boxed correctly, jsut overall a helpful guy.  He is a business owner that cares about his customers and he is worth the extra TLC that I won't get at my local post office.  Give him some business next time you are in the area?  I try and sent all my shipments out from his store now.
