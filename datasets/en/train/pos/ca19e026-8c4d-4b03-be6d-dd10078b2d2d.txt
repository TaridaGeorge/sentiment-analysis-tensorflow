Super good and authentic! The food and atmosphere is awesome. Not a great first date place if you're trying to impress her with your pretentious style, but a great 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th date place. The owner is right there every night, and his sons are the servers. I recommend the specials, they are unique in taste and named after Giuseppe's sons and chef. Very cool place. Bring your own bottle of wine, and get there early if you don't want to wait long!
