Bravo for performing arts! When done well, they are definitely as good as it gets! It takes true passion and creativity to keep a home for them both vibrant and successful, so hats off to Scottsdale for doing just that. I attended a performance by Diavolo. The facility was beautiful and well-organized, and the show was entertaining. Flipping through the program, I appreciated the diversity of the events, from jazz to opera to dance and comedy. Whenever I am in town, I will be sure to give their calendar a gander!
