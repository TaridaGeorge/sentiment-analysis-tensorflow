I could go on and on about how wonderful the cupcakes are but I feel that has already been done.  They are phenomenal, no doubt about it.  In addition to all of their wonderful flavors, the cupcakes they had for Passover were amazing - finally, a dessert that's worth eating during the holiday!  

The customer service at Sprinkles is FANTASTIC!  I have asked them to package the cupcakes for air travel on two different occassions and they have made it so easy for me.  Total side note - a red velevet cupcake goes a looooooong way in terms of barter.  Hello first class cabin to Hawaii!
