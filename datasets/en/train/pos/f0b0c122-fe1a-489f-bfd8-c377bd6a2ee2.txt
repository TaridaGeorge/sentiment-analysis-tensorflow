Double Overtime Sports Grill is great....I have ordered take out from here twice. The first time I ordered the Patty Melt with sweet potato fries. I asked for it medium...is was just a little over done, but the fries are great!
The second time I ordered the pulled pork sandwich...Amazing...I really like the BBQ sauce that comes on this, it is sweet. I also got the sweet potato fries.....I am a big fan... So if you are in the neighborhood stop in and grab some grub.. I work in the area, so it is very convenient, and the food is prepared in a very timely manner. The staff is good, I haven't sat down to eat there, but for take out the service was great!
