Awesome Custom work!!  I've had 2 rings custom made, both turned out exactly how I wanted.  The 1st ring, I had quotes of $3000, but Rod (owner & Jeweler for 30+ yrs) quoted around $1K.  

Rod is extremely helpful & patient.  You can come back to see your design in mid-process, usually a wax model, to make any changes before being cast.  He has tons of designs, or bring in a pic of your own  - he'll be happy to make your dream come true! 

I would highly recommend this little shop to anyone.  It's right beside Burger King, {same plaza as Sapporo's}.
