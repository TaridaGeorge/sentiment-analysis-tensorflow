Havn't eaten here in a few years but very glad we returned.  I love this part of town and how tucked away the restaurant is.  When I called to make reservations I was told there was a large party using most of the dining area but they could seat us in the Wine Cellar.  It was a great and romatic atmosphere.  Did not feel like we were even in Phoenix.

To add to the evening the food was the best I've had in a long time.  Had the Hanger Steak on the server's recommendation and it was one of the best pieces of meat I've ever had.  

I don't think they seat in the Wine Cellar very often but request it when you make your reservation.
