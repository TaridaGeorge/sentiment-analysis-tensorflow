It's patio weather and Carmel's has a fantastic patio!  Fact.

They use Maya tea, from Tucson, in their chai.  Best tea out there. Fact.

The owner is super friendly and on-site daily. Love that! 

I didn't eat today, but the food looked amazing and there were lots of people there eating it, so I'm guessing it's pretty great.  I'll definitely be adding this place to my coffee shop rotation. :)
