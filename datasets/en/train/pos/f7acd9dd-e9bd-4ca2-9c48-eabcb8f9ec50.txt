We are big fans of Pita Jungle but this one is by FAR our favorite.  The staff here is wonderful, they are all so attentive and personable.  Our 4 year old picks P.J, every weekend when it is time to decide where to eat.  I love that their kids menu has such great options for her.  My husband and I always have a hard time deciding what to get because the menu is just fantastic.  We love going during Happy Hour and taking advantage of the smaller plates.  We just discussed after our last visit how impressed we were that we each had a meal, a kids meal, an appetizer, a soft drink and a happy hour drink and with tip our bill was right under $30.
