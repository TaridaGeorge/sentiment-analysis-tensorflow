I am a long time BBQ connoisseur. I participate in BBQ judging at the KC royal, and have spent a solid portion of my life in Kansas City. When it comes to good BBQ - Joe's is really your only choice in the Valley. BBQ pork, Beef brisket cannot be matched anywhere else. Now - Ribs, I can say my personal preference is not Joe's, but because they hit the mark so well in many other ways, I rate them a 5 star without hesitation.
