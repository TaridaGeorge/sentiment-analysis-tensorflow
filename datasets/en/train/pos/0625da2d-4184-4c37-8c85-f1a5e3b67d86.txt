Several days ago, another a/c repair company had been in to look at our unit, and told me it wasn't worth repairing - they suggested replacement and quoted me $2670. 

Someone I trust who knows HVAC said they were wrong, and recommended Benefit Air. They came out the same day I called, and fixed the problem for $180! 

Both people I worked with (Mack on the phone and Chuck at my house) were wonderful, and I feel so good knowing that I've found a company I can TRUST.
