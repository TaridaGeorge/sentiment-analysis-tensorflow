My cousin introduced me to Pomegranate and now I'm moving to AZ and into the neighborhood so I can regularly get my fix. I love eating and then feeling amazing afterward and that's what happens here. 

Follow them on Facebook if you dare ... it will give you cravings like you won't believe! Everything looks amazing and tastes even better! Fresh, crisp, fruity, savory - whatever you're in the mood for they've got it. 

My favorites: the everything "bagel", the daily quesadilla, and the homemade snickers bar. YUM!
