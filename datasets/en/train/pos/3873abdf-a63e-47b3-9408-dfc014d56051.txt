AMAZING! This little gem is hidden away just outside downtown phoenix! It is a small little restaurant being run out of what looks like it used to be a small house. They menu offers a variety of flavor combinations that one would never think of when cooking at home.

The service staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. They have great suggestions and offer explanations of the ingredients in English. 

The moscato de asti is WONDERFUL. It is so sweet and goes so well with any meal. It is very reasonably priced and is more cost efficient when ordered by the bottle.

Be adventurous, try something new, DONT ASK FOR RANCH and make sure you order the nutella and banana crepe for dessert!
