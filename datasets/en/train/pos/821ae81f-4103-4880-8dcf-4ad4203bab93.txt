We were looking for someplace different to go to in the neighborhood.  I have driven by Osha Thai many times and decided to stop in.  Wow, am I glad we did!  Everything about this place is great. Great food, Great prices, Great Service.

We started out with chicken lettuce wraps and Mee Grab.  For our entree's we had Ginger (Pad Khing Sod) with chicken,  Spicy Cashew Beef and a noodle dish.  Everything was better than the next!  

I'm looking forward to the next visit!
