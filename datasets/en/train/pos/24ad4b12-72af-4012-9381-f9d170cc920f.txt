I needed to get an appointment to get some stitches removed from my finger. I called my primary care physician, the hospital I went to and a few other places and nobody could accomodate me in a reasonable amount of time. I contacted Alliance, and they were able to get me in same day. Not only did they get me in, but unlike almost ever other dr experience I've ever had, they were ready when I arrived! Check in was a breeze and within 10 minutes or so up on arriving, I was already in the back awaiting the doctor. All total, I think I spent maybe 30 minutes there? It was a great experience (or as good as it can get when you're at Urgent Care). The staff was courteous, speedy and professional. Highly recommend this place if you're in need of urgent care in the area.
