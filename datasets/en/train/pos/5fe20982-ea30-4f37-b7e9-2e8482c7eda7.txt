This is my new favorite restaurant - you can't beat the $5 glasses of wine, and the Bruschetta is so incredible.  My favorites are:  Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios; Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese; and Brie & Apples with Fig Spread.  I have seen reviews commenting on slow/poor service, but I have never experienced it.  My servers have always been quick, accomodating and friendly.  I will make this a regular haunt, well worth the drive from Mesa to Gilbert.
