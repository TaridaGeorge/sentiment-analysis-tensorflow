This place is awesome! I got a behind a scenes tour and got to meet Dave Muncey, Jon Hook, Kerri Lake, Troy what's his face and others.  Most were really nice.  It was fun taking pics all over the studios, sitting at the newsdesk, morning show, etc.  Most of the people who work here are very friendly.  Most of these one/two star reviews come from angry viewers.  Maybe they should take a tour and meet the people who make it happen and then they could appreciate it more.
