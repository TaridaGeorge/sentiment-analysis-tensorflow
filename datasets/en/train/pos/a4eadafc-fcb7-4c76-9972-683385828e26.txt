MMMMMMMMM! I love the atmosphere of this place! Instant win when I first walked in. We ordered the appetizer that has been mentioned here before - ball like creations. Interesting texture and tasty; beautiful display. I ordered a curry dish, while my date ordered a pork ginger dish. We requested the spicy levels around 2 or 3. Ubbbeerrrr yum! Although the heat factor got way intense at the end of the meal, it was still irresistible. Leftovers were even better. For desert we ordered the coconut ice cream. All around lovely food and not overbearing service! I love the lack of background noise. A must try!
