I have never been disappointed with this place. I always order take out for work and they offer me free delicious iced green tea and always converse with you while you wait there awkwardly :) The spiked cottage cheese sparked my curiousity as a side with my meal and being the adventurous foody that I am I gave it a shot. I always order it with my lunch now. Try the funky name that I cant remember for a piece of pita topped with feta, cucumbers, olives, onions, tomatoes and havarti cheese. It is amazing! I eat everything and feel so fat after every time but its worth it.
