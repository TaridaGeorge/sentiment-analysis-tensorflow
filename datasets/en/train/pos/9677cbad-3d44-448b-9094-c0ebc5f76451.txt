One of my other favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  My absolute favorites are:  the tuna tartare, bbq seasoned fries, and the short rib tacos.  OMG, the short rib tacos are DELICIOUS!!! I definitely recommend that dish for anyone who haven't tried Chelsea's Kitchen.  It is my favorite!!!

Very cute restaurant, kind of a random location tucked away.  Definitely a mixed crowd and not your senior citizen restaurant that you get every where else in the Phoenix metro area.   They offer complimentary valet service, so it's great on nights when it's crowded!  Don't forget to get some cookies on your way out!
