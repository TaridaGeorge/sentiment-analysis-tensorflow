They have my favorite Phad Thai in the valley! That is all I have had here, so if you are in to something else, you should look for more reviews. But if you love a spicy Phad Thai then you will love Sala Thai! I tried it after reading about them having won best Thai in Phoenix many years in a row by the Phoenix New Times, and I have to say that it seems well earned.
