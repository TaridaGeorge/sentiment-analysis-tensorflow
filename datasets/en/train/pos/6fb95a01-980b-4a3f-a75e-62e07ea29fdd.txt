Was here for breakfast with a group of friends. Neat diner/deli environment. Old school...  

Service was A+. We had an outstanding waitress yet the others would check to make sure our drinks were filled on an ongoing basis. The food...  Wow!  I had the hash which was incredible!  Others at the table had French Toast, salmon, and a scramble. All were delicious. 

The only regret I have is not going to this place while I lived in Phoenix. I'm definitely going back next time in town.
