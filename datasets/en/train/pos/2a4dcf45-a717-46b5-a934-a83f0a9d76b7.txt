We came to the down town location for the first time yesterday and I was even more impressed.  The service was sooo nice, the food was great, and the coffee was to die for of course.  We had the breakfast sandwich with bacon and the burrito with bacon, they were both great, I liked the sandwich the best, the chipotle made it sooo yummy.  They aren't small, we could have shared one and been full.
