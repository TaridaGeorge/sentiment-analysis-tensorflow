Down home french toast with whipped butter, yummy!   My boyfriend had the skillet which was cheesey, bacony and hot!  Belly warming goodness everytime.

Breakfast on the weekends, this is my favorite spot.  This ol' diner has no fancy bells and whistles, country decor wall paper with old fashioned sweet customer service.  I love the sweet ladies that work here and the meals are made quick, no long wait.   They have a small TV by the counter bar where I've been able to catch a soccer game once or twice.  I ask nicely to change the channel.  :)
