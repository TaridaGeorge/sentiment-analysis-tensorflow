Ah-mazing food! On your way into the restaurant you'll pass by a fresh herb garden that The Parlor actually uses in their cooking. Wonderful options for building your own pizza or if you're a little more adventurous they have their own creations that are fantastic as well. My husband is pretty picky about his food but with the build-your-own he was able to  create a pizza he loves. 

The atmosphere is so lovely esp. at night on the patio. We always sit outside whether it's January or July and have always been very comfortable. Great place for a one on one date or with a group of friends!
