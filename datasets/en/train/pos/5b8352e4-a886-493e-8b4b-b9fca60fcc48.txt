Without a doubt, the best dining experience I've had since moving to Phoenix. From the courteous staff (everyone said a genuine "hi!") to the bartender, the food runners and the waitstaff, tremendous customer service. Onto the food... the creamy polenta app and the kale/cabbage salad are winners (especially the salad).  For an entree, try the seafood ciopino (ask for it spicy if you can handle...absolutely worth it). Great for dates, family special occasions, etc. etc.  A gem in Phoenix!!
