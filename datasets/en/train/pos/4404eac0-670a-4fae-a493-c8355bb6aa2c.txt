We split the medium Bobby and a custom salad, with stuffing.  Both were much larger than we expected, and the salad was very fresh.  The Bobby (turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce and mayonnaise) is apparently the most popular sandwich (just like Thanksgiving!), but some of the others on their menu also look really good.
