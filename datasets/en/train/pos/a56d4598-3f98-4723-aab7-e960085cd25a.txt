Problem: 4 obscure lightbulbs for bathroom have blown out over 2 years. 

Hypothetical solution: these guys

Result: they were very polite, found the bulb in 90 seconds and had me out of the store in 3 minutes. Got 6 bulbs for 24 bucks

Conclusion: great specialty store... I'll use them again at some point.
