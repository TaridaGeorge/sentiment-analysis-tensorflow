I have been shopping at the farmer's market on 22nd St. and Camelback, Town and Country Mall,  for a couple of years now and I still get excited every time I go.  How many other local farmers are organic and accessible?  Bob has done an excellent job of procuring and growing really good organic produce, legumes and honey here in the valley!  5 Stars for ya Bob....get there early though!  Opens at 8:30 am...

We also use his produce at our catering company and it never ceases to amaze me the difference between organic and conventional...I grew up in New England and we took local produce for granted, out here with all the mega petrochemical agribusinesses,  Bob is outstanding in his field..well maybe I hope he is in his truck delivering us his produce...

if your a food professional...here is the contact info
