The trolley is my happy hour savior!  This is the perfect way to get around Old Town Scottsdale and not have to hoof it to each destination. I love that I can sit back and take note of businesses and points of interest that aren't on my normal commute. There are many trolley stops in the area and there are maps so you can pin point where you need to stop. Oh yes and did I mention it is free? And perfect for happy hour?
