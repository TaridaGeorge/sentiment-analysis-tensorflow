Bottom line- Wine lover's heaven!

The place has an old school speakeasy feel.  I LOVE the wine list and live jazz music.  The crowd is very diverse (age, culture) and has a relaxed, sophisticated, yet non-pretentious vibe.   I recommend trying the different wine flights...found many new favorites that way!  I have been here numerous times and have never had less than a wonderful experience.
