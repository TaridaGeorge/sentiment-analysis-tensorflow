I have to say the most annoying person on TV right now is Flo. You know that perky bitch pitching for Progressive insurance. UGH! I just want to smash her face in because her voice is like chewing on aluminum foil while scraping your nails on a chalkboard. 

That said, I almost want to get rear ended again. Get your mind out of the gutter folks. I was stopped at a red light recently when the man behind me decided to go and ran his Mercedes right into me.

Within ten days, Hamilton, my now buddy at Progressive, came to my house and cut me two checks for damages to my car and damages to my back. 

If I wasn't so happy with my little gecko insurer I would consider Progressive. Course they'd need to dump Flo. Dump Flo? Ewww...that sounds gross...
