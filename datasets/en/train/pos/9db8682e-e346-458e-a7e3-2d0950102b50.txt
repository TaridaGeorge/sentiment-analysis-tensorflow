This store is great!  Well organized with a wonderful selection of clean and pressed clothing items.  Some of the items were even half off the day I was there.  I have been shopping at Kid to Kid, but Puddleduds is much more consistent with their quality and prices.   Great selection of used kids books also!  Highly recommend
