We have been here a few times now and have been very happy each time. I ate in house twice and sat at the bar both times, the service was awesome and the pizza even better.  The first time it was pretty empty and the second time it was hoppin'.  Had the Patagonian the first time which was a unique pizza, chicken, pepperoncinis, green olives, feta cheese and the pesto/tomato sauce.  Really, Really good.  Second outing was the Margherita, which i thought had a ton of flavor for just having a few ingredients, real mozz, not the plastic shredded junk, kinda sweet tomato sauce, and shredded basil.  
Also, the have some really good beers on tap, and a couple of big tv's behind the bar.  
This place rocks, our new pizza place.
