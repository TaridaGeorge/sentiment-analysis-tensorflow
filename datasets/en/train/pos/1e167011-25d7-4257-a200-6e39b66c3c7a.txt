My neighborhood grocery store and you can't beat it. It's recently renovated and it seriously HEAVEN for a grocery store. A Starbucks, fountain sodas, a bakery, make-your-own-peanut butter-station (seriously), Sushi Bar plus two of the best kept secrets in the Valley... the sandwich station, pizza bakery and salad bar station. 

You can get a Build-Your-Own pizza and salad for $4.99. That's UNREAL. And it's GOOD. Both are made to order (typically by Ross or Ricky) and they're generous and tasty.

Same goes for the sandwich bar... lots of choices and fresh ingredients. I love (and crave) the California Dreamin' sandwich. Plus, buy 7 get the 8th free. All you have to do is swipe your Safeway card and it keeps track for you. 

The Safeway "Eating Right" brand is our favorite.. wonderful pita chips and tons of discounted healthy options.

Love it!
