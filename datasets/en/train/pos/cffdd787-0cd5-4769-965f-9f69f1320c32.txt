Dear Sonic,

  Why all the commercials in Los Angeles when the only place I have EVER seen you is in Arizona?  

I love Sonic.  It's a great fast food place, with classic drive up windows and servers that come and skate your order to your car.  Their fries are always crispy and salty the way I like them and their chicken strips are exactly what they need to be.

They always seem to have some sort of milk shake for any occasions, such as Valentine's (raspberry/cherry) or St. Patrick's Day (mint).  I wish they would open a Sonic over here because I can't think of any reason in the near future to go back to Arizona.
