Several years ago I met Lorel through volunteer work that we did for the same organization in Phoenix.  Fast forward to a head-on car accident in 2006 that left me with constant neck and back pain.  Since engaging Lorel as a massage therapist and recently undertaking fitness training with her, my back feels much better.  Lorel really understands the needs of her clients and pushes - but just to the limit that individual can do.  I lover her approach to overall health and fitness.  She is amazingly positive.
