I've been to this place several times and have tried a variety of dishes and have not been disappointed by one. One important thing to consider when having Filipino food is that there will be slight variations in taste. You certainly can't expect it to be what you're used to and/or your Mom's cooking. I will continue to keep coming to this place.
