This is one of my favorite restaurants. We've been going to Eddie V's for several years and usually go about two to three times per month. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I always go back to my favorites which are: crab cakes, Jonah crab claws, wedge salad, either Parmesan crusted lemon sole, snapper meuniere, or a halibut special when in season, au gratin potatoes, sugar snap peas, crab fried rice, sauteed spinach, Godiva chocolate dessert, bananas foster. I don't like shrimp but my husband swears by the shrimp cocktail or any of the shrimp dishes. They have a huge wine list and many specialty drinks. Dining on the back patio is great. Wonderful views.
