On the advice of friends I took a little dog I was fostering here.  Dr. Jarvis and her staff were so kind, caring, and knowledgeable.  This little guy had a rough life wandering the streets and needed help for infections, ear aches, and to be up date with shots, etc.  After the first visit I knew all the good things I had heard about this vet were true- they care very much for animals and put their welfare before all else.  They will not recommend things you don't need or "upsell" you, just quality care and advice.  The staff and doctors are a cut above the rest- we had a misdiagnosis with our previous dog elsewhere, among other problems.  I am confident we found the right vet and we are happily keeping little "Dave"!
