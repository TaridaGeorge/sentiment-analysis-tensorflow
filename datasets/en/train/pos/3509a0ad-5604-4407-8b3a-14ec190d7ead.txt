Great place to visit while downtown Phoenix. We were there during the Pearl Harbor Memorial ceremony Dec. 8, 2012.  Very nice, respectful ceremony. A lot of vets and current service men were present.  Many statues and memorials to visit while there. A "must see", especially if you live in the Valley!
