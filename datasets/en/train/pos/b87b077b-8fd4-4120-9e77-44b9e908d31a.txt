I stopped at True Food Kitchen with a girlfriend a few weeks ago in the Scottsdale Quarter.  We both started with a glass of wine and a generous portioned hummus appetizer. I then had a chicken salad and my girlfriend the tacos.  Everything was so deliciously organic and reasonably priced. I would definitely stop back for round two!
