Good food and airports are usually mutually exclusive. In this case the food is amazingly great, probably the best simple food a busy traveller has ever had. No frills here, just a beautifully prepared double cheeseburger with egg on top. The bun is fresh and soft and brioche like, the burger a perfect medium and it was so messy ( a good thing! ) that I needed a knife and fork. Please other airports realize that simple good food is possible. Hats off to this great burger joint!
