This place saved my life! I dropped my iphone and shattered the back side glass. I thought there was no way to repair it. I found these guys and called CJ who really knows his stuff. I came in and he took my phone, gave me a great recommendation where to grab some lunch, and by the time I was back my phone was repaired. Fast repair, great price, and great customer service! Thanks CJ!
