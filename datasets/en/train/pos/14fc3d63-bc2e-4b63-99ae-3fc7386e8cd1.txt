Absolutely delicious and great service. 

Jeff, the owner was very friendly and easygoing. We talked about his french-inspired recipes and his foodtruck background.

The menu is pretty simple, with about a dozen crepes and a standard coffe-bar drink menu. Jeff says the crepe selection is always changing - when we went he had some cool seasonal options. For crepes you have the choice of 'savory' or 'sweet.' My wife and I both ordered savory and loved our choices.

The menu is reasonably priced - about $4-$5 for sweet and $7 for savory. For two savory crepes and two drinks our bill was $20 and change.

We will definitely be back to eat our way through the menu!
