You better come hungry because they pile on the food!  I never thought I'd like middle eastern food, but wanted to try something different from the daily chicken sandwich and burgers, and OMG!!! 

Come and get the chicken schwerma. I just have never had anything like it. 

The location is great but as you walk in you're going to wonder if you're in the right place. 

True hole in the wall gold mine!!
