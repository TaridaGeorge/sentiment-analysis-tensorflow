The Roasted Sweet Potato sandwich is the most fantastic concoction ever created.  It is like Wildflower tapped into my brain a stole all of my favorite things and placed it between two gorgeous pieces of bread. Marinated fennel, fig confit, roasted sweet potato, arugula, buffalo mozzerla on focaccia bread. I warn you. It is massivee and I could barely eat 1/4th of it. But oh is it worth it. Dont think, just do it.
