I am really enjoying this tanning salon. I've been to a few in the area and this one has proven to have the most friendly and knowledgeable staff and highest quality beds. 

The salon is set up so that you walk in, use your fingerprint to access your account, use the self-serve computer to pick your bed, number of minutes, and help yourself. This is set up this way because this company is set up to be a 24/7 salon, but they are currently awaiting local legal permission to do so in this area.
