Very good service that is prompt. Our waiter made sure we always had a full glass. The food is phenomenal as well. I had a seafood combination special with salmon, shrimp and a petite filet mignon. It came with mashed potatoes and a hefty portion of asparagus and a crab succotash . The meat was perfect as was the salmon. The prawns were butterflied and grilled. A very filling portion. This is primarily a seafood place but you can't go wrong with the steaks either. Top notch service that is on par with the food, you will be hard pressed to do better.
