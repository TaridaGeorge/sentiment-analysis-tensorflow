Last week I was craving the Tuna Salad Sammy from Pugzies, it's cold and crisp and perfectly refreshing on a hot day especially when paired with the fruit salad! 

Check out my Glorious Lunch (see pics) complete with a cream cheese brownie, which was much lighter and fluffier than a brownie, more like cake if you ask me, but still yummy!

This is by far one of the better sandwich shops, check it out!
