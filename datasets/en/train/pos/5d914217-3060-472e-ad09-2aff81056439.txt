My daughter is 8 years old. She had a bad experience when she was young at a YMCA and it took a while to get her back into a pool. We started with a couple of private lessons and then went to a group. That seemed to be key and the staff made it work. It was a very positive experience for her. 

She went from not being able to put her face into the water, to now swimming freestyle (beginner) across the pool width within six months. She is comfortable in the water, can float on her back and has a great backstroke.
