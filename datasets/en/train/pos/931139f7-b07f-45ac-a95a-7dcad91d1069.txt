This neighborhood jewelry store has something for everyone. They carry everything, ranging in value from modest to high end.  The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly.  There is never pressure to buy anything. They love what they do and it shows in the way they treat their customers.  I've been very happy with everything I've ever gotten there. There is an ever-changing estate counter filled with lovely baubles at great prices.  Rare is the time I go in there and don't come out with some treasure. There is also a very talented woman working there who creates original pieces, either from her imagination or yours. Ask for Lauren. Can't recommend this place enough.
