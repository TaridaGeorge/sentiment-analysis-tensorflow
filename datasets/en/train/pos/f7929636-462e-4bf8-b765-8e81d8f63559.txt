Very nice property! It's a bit away from more established golf courses and shopping centers, but if you want to just relax, this is the place to be. 

The staff was very pleasant. They honored my diamond status and upgraded me to one of their corner suite with extra living room and a huge balcony. Their pool looked awesome - it was unexpectedly cold when we were there in mid March and we didn't get to enjoy the pool, though. 

The downstair bar area has different performances almost every night. it can be loud but they stop playing around 10pm, so it was tolerable. 

I would definitely visit this place again in the future for our family vacation.
