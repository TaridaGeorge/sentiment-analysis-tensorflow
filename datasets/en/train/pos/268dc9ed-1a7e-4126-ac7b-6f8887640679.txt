I LOVE The Uprooted Kitchen. They provide some of the best tasting breakfast food that I've ever had. They use local organic ingredients and they don't use any refined sugars. They show that it is totally possible to have delicious vegan food without compromising taste, texture, or price. I'm so glad that they are at Gilbert Farmers Market and I hope they grow big enough to get an actual restaurant some day!
