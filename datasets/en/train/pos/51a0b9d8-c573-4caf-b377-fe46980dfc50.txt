Liberty Market is delicious. When I go, I tend to get the sloppy joe which is better than any sloppy joe I've ever had. Their pizza is great as well. My girlfriend is vegetarian so sometimes it is challenging to find somewhere that we can eat and she can get something other than a salad. She loves this place though, and says that the grilled cheese is the best one she has ever had. Very nice decor, lots of stuff to look at. Very friendly staff. All around great experience.
