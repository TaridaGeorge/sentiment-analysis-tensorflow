Being a regular at the Phoenix Public Market, I never miss a chance to stop by the Smart Cookie booth to say hello to the wonderful guys there and, if I'm not being too bad, sample a cookie or two. And they are incredible (the guys and their cookies!). They've positively redefined the chocolate chip cookie, but I love their "Heartthrob", a heart-shaped shortbread cookie half dipped in a chili-chocolate. It breaks my heart my diet keeps me from eating more of them. There are some good reasons to come down to the PPM, Smart Cookie is definitely one of them :D
