I love this place. Sadly my family does not so I either need to eat alone or do takeout. The hummos is unique and light...I had a salad with what I think was cold quinoa. This opened the wonderful world of quinoa to me. 

I love the pommegranite on the salad. So perfect. And the pesto was nummy as well. 

I had a gift certificate the first time I web here. It was from a silent auction at our church. Subsequent visits made me realize the cost prohibitive nature of this wonderful cafe. 

If I win the lotto I will visit this restaurant weekly. 

Really wish they had some coupons or discount dates or frequent visitor program.
