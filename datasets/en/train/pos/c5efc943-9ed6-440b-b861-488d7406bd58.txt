I grew up down the street from China China but had never been there until last year.  Dear lord, how did I not discover this place sooner?

Seriously, hands down the best Chinese-American food I've had since I lived in the Bay Area.  It's a little dingy looking at it from the road, even from the parking lot, but it's another story inside.  This place is such a perfect, family-owned Mesa staple and I highly recommend it.

They even have a crazy cocktail menu that I have yet to try.
