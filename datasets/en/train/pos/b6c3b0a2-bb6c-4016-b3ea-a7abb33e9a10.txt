Have been eating here since I was a kid and it was on Thunderbird. We go mainly for the bread. Smileys are the best! I brought some to my neighbors who moved here from Vegas and told them they are the best around- only to find out his dad was the original owner.

The also have the Stadium Mustard from Cleveland, OH which my husband said was a big deal. 

Well worth the drive from way out north west Peoria.
