I have to say, for just being open 2 weeks, I was very surprised at my dining experience at Cask 63.  We ate at the bar and had excellent service.  Kathy, who was dead on with her recommendations, was awesome.  Lawrence allowed me to sample their signature cosmo and I was hooked.  Top notch bartenders!  The food was fantastic!  A nice ecelctic menu.  The seabass is a must.  I'd go back tonight!
