I love my morning mochas.  Always try to find the best one where-ever I visit.  This hits all the high points.  #1 - being my first day no one else was there, and it still took 5 minutes to get my drink made!!!  That means its made well.  Not the pre-mix Starbucks machines.  If you like mochas, go for the Spiced Mexican Chocolate!!
