We adopted a pup (4 month old Australian cattle dog mix) and this place is super clean and does not have a bad smell like many other places we have been.  They offer a great service for a great value.  We paid $160 for a pup that has up to date shots and neutered and even an electronic chip.  They gave us a full run down and all the paperwork that the dog had previously.  We really enjoyed the experience and felt good about going with a rescue this time.
