5 stars isn't enough for this awesome pediatric center! My son's primary doctor is Dr. Sotelo, but I've spoke to all of the doctors here and I couldn't be more happy with trusting my son's health in their care! I've never had a moment where I know I could call and never get a call back or get a call or advice I couldn't trust. They put my new mom jitters at ease immediately! Most of my friends use this office, also, and we all gush about the great care they show towards you and your child. It's nice to have someone ask how the mom is doing after a new child, so they take care of the parents, also! They are a fantastic office!! The whole staff!! A++++
