Very good - a marrying of concepts...  I had the quiche and it was actually amazingly delicious - and I'm something of a quiche snob.  Staff is very helpful - but not in your face...  Lots of bikes from bmx to cruiser - and from very modestly (read: low) priced to high end stuff.  Parts, upgrades, expert advice...

All kinds of surprises - gear - books - board games - etc...  Great concept executed well.

Plus, some of the walls are my favorite shade of green...  

Dammit.  Now I'm hungry.  For quiche.  Stupid Trailhead, you should be open 24 hours.
