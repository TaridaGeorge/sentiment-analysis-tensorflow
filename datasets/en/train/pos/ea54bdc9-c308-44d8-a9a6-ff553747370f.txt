The owner/designer Rachel answered the phone and within just a few hours emailed me a photo of and receipt for the cutest arrangement!  I order flowers as little pick-me-ups for clients and while we don't want to break the bank, we for sure want the arrangement to look classy and posh.  Perfection!  And BONUS - if the delivery is in Scottsdale she said there isn't a delivery charge!
