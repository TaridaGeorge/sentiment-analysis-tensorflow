The food is amazing. Always got the pollo cubano and the paradise pulled pork. Both are fantastic. You get a pretty big serving that can be split. Try to get there on a Friday or Saturday when the band is playing, it really adds to the atmosphere. Also, if you can, get the fried plantains. Can't go wrong with that. Also, all of their desserts are completely homemade and incredible. I didn't know mangos could do that. 
I can't really speak for too many other menu items, since it was impossible to deviate from the goodness of the pollo cubano and pulled pork.
