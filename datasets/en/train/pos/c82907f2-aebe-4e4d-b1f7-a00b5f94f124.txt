ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!!!

Wanted to book a helicopter tour over the Grand Canyon with a hotel pick-up in Scottsdale and Detours hooked me up. I booked everything at the last minute and was on board the super comfortable corporate van (with individual seats) less than 12 hours later. Larry was our driver and tour guide extraordinaire. He made everybody feel comfortable and provided incredible narration throughout the day. Water was provided, we made a stop in Sedona and several scenic stops along the Grand Canyon after the heli ride. Maverick Helicopters delivered as promised with a breathtaking 50-minute flight over the Grand Canyon. 

I enjoyed every second of this action-packed day and highly recommend Detours.
