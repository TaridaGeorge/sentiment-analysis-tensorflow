I've been eating here for 10+ years. Never a bad meal and I've had everything. I'm allergic to corn and every bagel place out here has cornmeal on the bottom, not this place!  REAL BAGELS IN ARIZONA!!?? WOW. These taste just like the ones back home in New Jersey!!  Best toppings amount and bagel size in the valley.
