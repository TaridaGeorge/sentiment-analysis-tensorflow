Great food service and atmosphere. Reasonable pricing. 
Wanted to find a nice local restaurant w atmosphere for our last night in Scottsdale. Made reservations for 6:15 on a Thursday and arrived early-- no problem. It did become more crowded quickly.we sat outside on a very pleasant large patio. Service was great.
Menu was not huge but food was very good. Especially notable was the Mediterranean salad and the sweet potato cannelloni. Cannelloni was rich and unique. Though my hubby thought it was too sweet. He had mushroom flatbread he thought was awesome. Two in our party had great filling lasagna. We had gelato and brown butter almond cake for dessert. All five in our party gave this place high reviews.
