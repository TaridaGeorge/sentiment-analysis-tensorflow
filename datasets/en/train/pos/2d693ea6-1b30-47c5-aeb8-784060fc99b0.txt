I am so behind on writing reviews... I really need to catch up!  I came here for Gabi's bachelorette party.  Stingray has great energy for a party right next to us was another bachelorette party... see??
Anyway the drinks and sushi were great!  I cannot forget to mention the service... our waitress was great she handled our party of 8 like pro.  I will definitely be back here again.  Thanks Stingray for making the start to evening wonderful!!
