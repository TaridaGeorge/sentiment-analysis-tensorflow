I'll admit, Sens had to grow on me.  The first time I went I thought it was just okay, but willing to go back.  It was a cool environment. Upon going back with some girlfriends and "researching" the menu, I can't say enough good things about it! I love the place.  Let me recommend the Red Curry Tofu (doesn't matter if you "do" tofu" its amazing) and the Sugar Cane.  Order the Sugar Cane last because its the best thing there.  One particular evening we had exceptional service from a Kelton.  We told him we were going to a show and he had us enjoying our food and sake and out the door in record time.  Much appreciated.
