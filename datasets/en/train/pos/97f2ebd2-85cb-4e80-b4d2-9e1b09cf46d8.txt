This is my go to wine bar in Phoenix.

I like this location best between this one and the Arcadia location (splitting hairs here) because of the patio, on a cool day outside it's heaven.  It's also smaller and to me seems more relaxed and intimate.

The Monday and Tuesday night special is of course killer because of the star of the show, the bruschetta is unreal.  There are multiple types but for me I have to make sure I order the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, the Brie and Apples with Fig Spread, and the Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheeps Milk.  I've had all of them though and you really can't go wrong.

If you live in Phoenix/Scottsdale/Mesa/Tempe and haven't been to a Postino you're ridiculous and missing out!
