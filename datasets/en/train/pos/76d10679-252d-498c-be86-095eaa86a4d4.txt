Ahh Memories... I miss here since I moved from Arizona. Literally, best beer you can find in AZ. I went to Germany for training. I  miss Four Peaks :) (Yes even in Germany)

My favorites are Kilt Lifter and Arizona Peach Ale. I can drink a pitcher of Pitch ale myself.

Food : I like veggie pesto pizza a lot. Also, Chicken strip with chipotle sauce is food for late night. They have a good burgers too.
