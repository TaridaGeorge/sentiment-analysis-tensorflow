A beautiful spa inside Scottsdale Healthcare Shea Medical Center.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this facility, the people, the prices and the quality of services.  First of all, it's a full-service spa.  Robes, slippers, showers, quiet sitting room, sauna - everything you need.  Secondly, the service and quality is excellent!  Thirdly, FREE valet parking and easy access in and out of the spa.  Lastly, the products they use are high quality... Pevonia is fabulous!
