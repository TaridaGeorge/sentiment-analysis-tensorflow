Awesome little shop. Good coffee, free WiFi and of course: Ice Cream!

I don't know the owner, but they need to get themselves listed under "Breakfast & Brunch" on here. I've known about Pink Spot and have come here several times in the past. But who knew they opened at 7am?!?!

This morning I sat in my car for nearly 30 minutes looking on Yelp for a place to go and Pink Spot didn't even make the list. Fortunately I did see the "Open" sign while driving by.

A very satisfying breakfast bagel and coffee got me on my way. Much better than the crap you can get at 5th Ave.

The place is super clean, bandwidth is very good and the staff are friendly. You should come here. The best in this neighborhood.
