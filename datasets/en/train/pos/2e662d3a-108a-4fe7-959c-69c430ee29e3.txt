I have been eating there since before I can remember. My mom used to take me and now I bring my bf there all the time.

The waitresses are always very nice and they know me so well they know our order before I even have to look.

We always split two order of the egg rolls and go back and forth between sharing the charbroiled pork, egg cake, and (I always forget what it is called but the cold pork with noodles).

I also love their rice noodle salads, their chow fun, tofu, summer rolls, and wonton soup.

I have never seen any bugs and it's always clean.

They remodeled a wile ago and though the booths are new I don't like how short they are. It makes the meal less private.

It's the one place my mom and sister miss the most after moving to Oregon.
