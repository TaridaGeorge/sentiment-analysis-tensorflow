Love this place! It makes me want for more time to read, so i can go here more often. Local business, active in the community, great lectures and workshops, staff that are super helpful. And they permit dogs! In fact they love em. I shopped for a lot of Christmas presents here this winter, have been to a workshop and a book signing/lecture. Love that they buy used books, have a frequent buyer card, and are in a shopping center where I can hit Wildflower Bakery and Trader Joes as well. Wish they weren't run out of downtown tempe on mill avenue, as they would be closer to my house. But i am happy to make the drive esp. since i batch it with my TJ's shopping.
