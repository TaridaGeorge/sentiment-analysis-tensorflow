This place is great.  Their wraps are unique and fresh.  I was surprised that a Swedish/Canadian fusion restaurant had such good falafel; better than some middle eastern restaurants in town.  But hands down my favorite thing on the menu is the poutine.  It's the only place I know of in town that makes it. For those of you who don't know, poutine is french fries topped with hot brown gravy and cheese curds.  It's like the French-Canadian version of chili cheese fries, and it's delicious.  Beaver's Choice is definitely a must try, even if its just for a late night poutine snack!
