i've been going here for years.  i've tried other places like this, but none of them add up.
if you go at lunch, you can get 2 or 3 meals for 8$!  it also includes rice, crispy things, soup and a drink.  and then you don't have to eat the rest of the day. :)
over time, i've created my own sauce.  the suggestions they give you are helpful, but its good to be creative and figure out what you like.
you can get to-go boxes for $.50 and definitely worth it.  the only time you can't get one is with all you can eat option.  i can't understand why anyone would do that, i can hardly finish 1/3 of a bowl.
