I. Love. Sprouts. This store is truly fantastic. Unfortunately, there is not one close to our house so I do not frequent them as much as I would like to. However, this location is near my work and I will sometimes pop over there on my lunch to do my grocery shopping.

I think stores like these have a reputation for being much more expensive than a typical grocery store. My experience has proved otherwise. Granted, we do not eat meat so I am not sure what the comparative prices for those products would be. However, the food we do buy--vegetables, fruit, dairy products, etc--is very affordable. They may be a bit more than what you would spend at Fry's but the quality is certainly a cut above.
