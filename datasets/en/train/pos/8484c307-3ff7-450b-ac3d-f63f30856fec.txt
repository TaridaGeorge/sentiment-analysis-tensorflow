My fiance and I always come to this location and get the same thing every time....the mouth-watering Pollo Fundido. Its just absolutely delicious! When both of us don't feel like cooking and we want something quick, yummy, and inexpensive this is where we go! But beware the Pollo Fundido is quite addicting! :)
