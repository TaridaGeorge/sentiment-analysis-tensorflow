I was plesantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the food here.  I had the Pork (pernil asado) with cornbread casserole and cheddar mashed potatotes.  When I arrived, the owner greeted us and asked my husband and I if we had reservations.  We didn't but we were quickly seated to a table for two.  We tried this place because we had a Groupon, and I'm so glad we did.  The pork was perfectly cooked, delicious, and tender.  We ordered the empanadas for an appetizer and we were treated to a tasty beef pastry.  The empanadas were nicely complemented by a fresh pico de gallo which had the perfect bite.  The casserole was not overcooked or dry, and tasted wonderful.  I'm so glad we found this little hidden restaurant.
