Best Pho I had outside of Los Angeles. Best eggrolls ever!

It was just my girlfriend and I. We seriously ordered enough food to feed 4 people and out bill was only $32.

Awesome food and ridiculously low prices. Tood bad its not in Los Angeles, I would be there every week.

The other comments you see about cleanliness and service are true. The staff is not the friendliest or the most helpful, most of them walk around like they are forced to be there. No warm greeting when you sit down. They don't come by to check on you, you'll have to wave some one down and if they speak enough english you will get what you want.... eventually.

After all that, I would still go back.
