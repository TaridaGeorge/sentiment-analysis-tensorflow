I am so surprised that this place has such mediocre reviews!  Maybe I had a fluke experience or something, but everything about it was phenomenal!

I must admit we didn't have sushi, we had edamame, lettuce cups, a teriyaki chicken dish, and the horseradish mashed potatoes.

Oh my gosh, it was all lick-you-plate-clean delicious!  I mean the sauce that came with the lettuce cups was really incredible - a TON of flavor! The horseradish had the perfect "hint" or horseradish so they weren't overpowering and the teriyaki chicken was far from average! 

We had drinks and for 2 the total was $50 bucks or so, and we had a great, attentive, funny server.  I have nothing to fault the place with.  I'll keep going, and hopefully my standards stay about the same!
