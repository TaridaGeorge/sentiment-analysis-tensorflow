Dr Eric Clyde and his staff are great, personal and effiecient. They did exams my old Dr in Texas never did and explained things much better. he listened to my concerns and told me everything that was going on with my vision. My old Dr never listened about my contacts being uncomfortable for the longest time and was stuck on one brand and Dr Clyde said there are so many brands to try and he got it right with the first ones. Great communication through website and email. Cant say enough great things about this practice!!!
