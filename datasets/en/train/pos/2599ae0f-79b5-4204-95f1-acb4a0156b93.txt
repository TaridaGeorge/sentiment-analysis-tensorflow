I will never eat a regular hot dog again!  If there were 10 stars, I would give it!

Large hot dogs, garlic-chipotle mayo, mustard, coconut and pineapple - sounds weird, but it was a flavor explosion.  We had Maui Dog for lunch and I wanted to go there for dinner.  

The venue is casual with indoor and outdoor seating.  The owner was very helpful in explaining the menu and the place was fairly busy.  Be ready to try something new and not expect the same boring hot dog with ketchup and mustard.  Well worth it!!
