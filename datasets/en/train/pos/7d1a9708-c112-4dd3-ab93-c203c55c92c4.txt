Let me just start by saying holy crap I'm full! This place is awesome! The pineapple is good, but the mango is even better. Turkey dog, cilantro, chipotle garlic mayo, maui mustard, jalapenos, pepperoncinis... seriously what more could I ask for in a hot dog?! The guy who owns it is great too, there was a little mix up and he was extremely accommodating, made sure we were ok and that he made things right, definitely a 5 star experience.
