Hot shaving cream to clean up the edges on a haircut?  A hot towel and massage to wind down?  This place is fantastic.

Rushel is everything I want to see in a barber, and one of the best parts of prepping for my recent wedding was going to him for a hot shave and tune up.  Gold Scissors is clean, well-equipped, and everything about it shows the pride and care that they have for their business.
