My partner and I were driving cross country from Los Angeles to Atlanta and while in Phoenix he started getting horrible stomach pains. Pull up my yelp app, type in doctor and found Dr. Cohen. Gotta love it. 

She was very nice, first they said they had no appointments but then called me and said if we didn't mind waiting 15 min we could get in. Turns out he was fine but when your on the road about to drive across the desert the last thing we wanted to happen was a appendicitis or something!! So thanks Dr. Cohen for assuring us of his health and keeping our roadtrip on track.
