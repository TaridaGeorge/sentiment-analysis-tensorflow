Close to the office. Way Cheaper than SBux!...

There have never been more than 2 people in line when I come in, so I am not sure how to rate the speed of service. The music playing in the background is nice. Oh, I almost forgot! The Best thing about Echo is that the 'ToGo' cups do not leak all over my work shirt!!!
