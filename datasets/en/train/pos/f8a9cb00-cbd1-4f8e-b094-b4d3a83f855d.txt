Probably my favorite spot in this city to get Gluten Free pizza! They also take into account cross-contamination for us Celiac's, which means I can go out to eat without stressing or worrying over whether I will have a migraine with the hour. Anybody out there with similar dietary constraints can appreciate the significance of that. Besides the pizza, though, they have a pretty wide variety of GF dishes, and my non-Celiac friends and family always seem to find a dish they love, (my mom always gets one of their pastas). I go here once every few weeks, typically. Love it!
