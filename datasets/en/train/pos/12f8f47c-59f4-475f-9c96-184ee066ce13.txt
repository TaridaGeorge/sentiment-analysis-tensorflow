Best Gelato! I am not a huge fan of sweets but I cannot resit the pull of this place. Not sure what you want, no worries since they will let you taste as many as you want until  you decide.  Taking it back to your office, not a problem, they have nice foam cups with lids to keep it from melting while you walk back.
