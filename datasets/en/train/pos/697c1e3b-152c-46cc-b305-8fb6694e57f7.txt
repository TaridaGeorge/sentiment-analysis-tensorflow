Great place for beers and sandwiches. Friendly & attentive staff, love the furniture and atmosphere. Feels like your in your best friends home, very comfortable and not stuffy. TMI toast is amazing, and i love all their sandwiches- not too crazy about the hotdog but that's my only complaint. 
be sure to visit this quaint place at least once! you will be hooked
