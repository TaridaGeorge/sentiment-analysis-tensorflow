Finally we tried this place! Each time we've walked by it we always comment "oh we need to try that place!". 
Located in Old Town Scottsdale on the brink of the civic center mall, it sits below sidewalk level. Inside and outside seating make for great people watching and although it was small inside, it had a cozy feel. They have a decent beer list and even when I ordered a house red wine the bartender gave me a choice of three! The staff had a good attitude, welcoming, by no means stand-offish. The way you sometimes get from small bars when you're there for the first time. 
I enjoyed myself, and my wine thank you very much.
