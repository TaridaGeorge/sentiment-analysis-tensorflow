Udupi is one of the best Indian restaurants that I've ever been to (and I've been to a lot). The Gobi Manchurian (noted by several prior reviewers) and the Chole Peshwari are to die for. I also recommend their Sunday brunch even though it costs more than ordering off their menu. The only downside to Udupi is that it received some bad press for the cleanliness of their kitchen and dining room. I must admit that I saw a cockroach once at Udupi-- but, this was a year ago and they seem to have cleaned up their act. Nonetheless, the food is amazing, well priced, and offers a welcome treat to a veggie-lover's tummy!
