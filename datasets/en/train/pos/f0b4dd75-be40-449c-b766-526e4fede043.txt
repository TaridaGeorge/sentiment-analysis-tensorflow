I look forward to work trips that take us to Phoenix and Cibo is the one restaurant that we never miss.  The restaurant feels like home, the wait staff is generous but most importantly the quality of the food is amazing!  We were there last Friday for dinner and ate on the patio with our daughter (Very family friendly!!).  The weather was perfect.  We started out with the Burrata, then amazing pizza as the main course.  Compliments to the chef!  Can't wait to come back to Cibo!
