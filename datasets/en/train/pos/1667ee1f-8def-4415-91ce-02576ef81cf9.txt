It doesn't get any better than Unlimited Coffee/Monsters Gelato. The staff are friendly and well trained and have a high level of customer service. Not being a coffee drinker, I can't comment on the coffee though it smells absolutely wonderful. They have a wide variety of top notch teas and an unrivaled selection of mouth watering gelato flavors. With regard to "Jason W's" comment, yes, "Monster's Gelato" was in fact named in memory after the owners beloved cat, "Monster", hence the portion size names! If you're ever in the area it's definitely worth the stop! I can't recommend it highly enough. 5 out of 5 stars all the way!
