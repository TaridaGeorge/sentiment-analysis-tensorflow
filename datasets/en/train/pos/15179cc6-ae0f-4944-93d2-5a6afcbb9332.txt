Sakana - forgive me! I love you! Yes, honey, I ate somewhere else tonight, but you were with me in heart, mind and spirit the whole time! 

In my mind I have written to you millions of times and sung your praises on the top of Mt. Yelp professing my love and admiration for your large servings, sake selection and wonderful service. When I am with you, there is no other and you are first in my heart. But you know, honey, how the song goes...
 
"and if you can't be with the one you love, honey, love the one you're with, 
love the one you're with, 
love the one you're with, 
love the one you're with."

Sakana, I still love you!
