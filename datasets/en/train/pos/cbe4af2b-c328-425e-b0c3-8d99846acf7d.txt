I ordered a really awesome Nixon watch on ebay and was really excited to get it. When I opened it and went to put it on, the band fell apart. I fooled with it for a good hour trying to put it back together and finally gave in to finding someone to repair it. I had no idea where to go, so of course found this place on Yelp! The guy is super friendly and has very reasonable prices. He had my watch fixed in about 45 second, sure beats my hour struggle!
