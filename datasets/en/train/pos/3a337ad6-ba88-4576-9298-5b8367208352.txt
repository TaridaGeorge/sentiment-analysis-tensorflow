Ended up at the duce on NYE right before the ball dropped. They were serving hot cereal, Skillet scrambles, baked pancakes and hot coffee drinks along with all the other goodies they create in their 65' Airstream trailer turned kitchen and cocktails from behind the bar of what the owner told us used to service Chicagoans before, during and after prohibition. 

This place is to cool for school.  Everybody that worked there was donned in pajamas, robes and slippers as were many of what appeared to be "duce regulars".

 Food, cocktails, old school gym, amazing clothing store, ping pong, shuffle board and corn hole...or as they call it..."duce bag". 

best NYE ever!!!
