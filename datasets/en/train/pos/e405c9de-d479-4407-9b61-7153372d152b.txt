We have used the Dryer Vent Doctor for 4+ years now. Not only does Paul provide excellent customer service every year, but I have peace of mind knowing that our dryer's vent is all cleaned out and we are not at risk for a possible dryer fire. I have recommend The Dryer Vent Doctor to many friends and neighbors and I encourage everyone to have this service every year....it's worth it - our dryer is much more efficient because of it!
