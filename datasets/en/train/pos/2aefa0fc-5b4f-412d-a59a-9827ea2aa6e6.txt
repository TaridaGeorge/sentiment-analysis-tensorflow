Bad Ass Cajun.  
Came in on a Friday and sat at the bar to get some Cajun fare.  I got the seafood gumbo and the half shrimp Po Boy.  Both were delish! Shrimp in both dishes was plump, juicy and that special crunchy fresh you dream of at night.  Sitting down at the bar, I talked to the tender and the guests.  Everybody was friendly and the tender even was calling me by name when I left.  I explained how much I liked the gumbo and she let me try the sausage and chicken gumbo on the house and it too was also a tasty classic gumbo delight.
All in all this was a down home friendly, classically Cajun experience that is now one of my favorites.
