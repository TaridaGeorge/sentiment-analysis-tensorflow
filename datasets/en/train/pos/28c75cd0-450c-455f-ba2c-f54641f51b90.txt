My husband and I have been looking for a local artist and I came across drastic changes.  I introduced my hubby to brandon and he did an amazing piece on his inner arm.  He is talented, knowledgeable and professional.  Its the best work on his body.  While I was waiting I decided to get an old, ugly rose covered up.  Brian did so with a gorgeous, detailed rose.  I'm amazed that I can't see the original one under it!  Its not much bigger than the original either.. which due to placement is neccessary for my job.  Highly impressed with both artists and the shop in general.
