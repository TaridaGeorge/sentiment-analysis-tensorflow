Wow! John answered my call at 6:40 am on a Sunday morning after my AC went out. He was over within two hours and had it working - and only charged $100! Very nice and professional. Had a few suggestions on things to upgrade but was cautious to point out that they weren't urgent if money was tight. Absolutely recommend them!
