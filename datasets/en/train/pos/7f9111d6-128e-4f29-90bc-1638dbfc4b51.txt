Staff went out of their way to get a shirt done for me within an hour. I picked out a shirt, sat with a designer and told him exactly what I wanted and that's what I got. They were in the middle of a huge job of shirts for a Tweetup, but snuck my shirt in there and called me when it was done. They even brought it out to my car so I didn't have to find parking on Mill Ave again!! Stellar customer service, tons of options. And better than the online places because of near instant gratification.
