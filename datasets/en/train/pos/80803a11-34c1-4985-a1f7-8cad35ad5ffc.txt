This place is neat!  There is something for everyone.  There are all kinds of cute clothes, journals, checkbook covers, shoes, baby clothes, dolls, and I could go on and on.  The lady at the sales counter was also very welcoming and friendly.  I bought a barette and was offered to have my purchase gift wrapped.  It seems that service like that only gets offered at fancy snotty stores anymore.  Thank you Frances for having a down to earth, ecletic, and friendly place to shop.
