Ok, so it isn't excactly Ling's, it's more Louie's. I would describe it as asian inspired with a healthy twist.

This is hands down my favorite lunch spot. They make amazing food, and at great deals. Not to mention it is so conveinently next door to Golden Spoon yogurt. :)

The only down fall is this total creep that works the bar. Mid 50's, greesey pony tail, dangly earring..total weirdo. He is a space invader for sure. I go through a state of panic each time i go with the thought that I could end up in his section. He is one of those who thinks he is 20-something, attractive and funny. He gets down on his knees (so he is at your level sitting) and just joins the conversation. It is really annoying and almost enough to make me avoid the joint.
