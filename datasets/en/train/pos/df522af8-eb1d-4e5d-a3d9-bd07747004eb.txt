I used to be a cheap person when it came to getting my eyebrows waxed. If I had to spend more than 10 dollars for a wax I would cringe.  After two serious burn sessions and a very unattractive healing period I decided to spend a it more money and found myself at the Nordstrom Spa.   It flipped my brow world upside down. Casey the Aesthetician was wonderful.   Sh e gave me a true brow shaping and showed me how to fill them in with a powder. After my first visit I received so many compliments on my brows I became hooked.   Well worth the splurge!
