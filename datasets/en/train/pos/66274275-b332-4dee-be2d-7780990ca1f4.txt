This is the best children's consignment shop that I have come across. I frequent this location at least one to two times per month. Lisa is the owner and is super friendly and helpful. They seem to be very selective about what they take and I never feel like I am sorting through someone else's "trash to treasure garage sale leftovers". 

I have been shopping her for my kids for the last 3 years and plan to keep coming back. Prices are GREAT and we can usually find some great name brands (which it important to my daughter). 

Easy on the wallet & cute on the kid! :)
