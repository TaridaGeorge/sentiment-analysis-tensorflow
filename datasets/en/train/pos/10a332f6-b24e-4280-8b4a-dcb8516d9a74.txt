Love the ambience of this place! The night we went, there was a guy playing the piano in the bar who was awesome! The recent night we visited we only had a cocktail and happy hour menu, but we have eaten here before and it is divine! We will definitely be doing dinner here again soon! Drinks are super pricey, but that seems to be the norm for this type of restuarant.
