Thank God Christopher's has moved to a new location at The Biltmore shopping mall between Saks and Macy's. WOW, what a beautiful space! I felt like I was in New York City! There is an attached lounge called Crush that is relaxing but also a nice place for a pre/post dinner drink. I found the staff to be very attentive and the food to be fantastic. Try the roasted bell pepper soup and the hanger steak. The french fries are to die for! We were able to watch the kitchen staff working in the open kitchen which was also fun.
