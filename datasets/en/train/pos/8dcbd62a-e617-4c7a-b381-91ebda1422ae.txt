Once again i have found an all time favorite dish at this fine establishment.

The House Chicken! If you do not like mushrooms what so ever or do not care for spicy food i do not think this will appeal to you. Oh my god it is out of this world! I do not think i could consume it every day back to back but every other day or once a week would be my preference.  Its even amazing when its warm not burning hot temp. wise.  I will edit this review and add in more as i try more on the menu to keep you all posted. So for anyone who wants a little spice and kick in your mouth with yummy mushroom this is for you! 
:D
