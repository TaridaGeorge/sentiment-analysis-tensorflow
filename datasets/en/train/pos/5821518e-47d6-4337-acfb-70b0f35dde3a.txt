This is my regular coffee spot, even though it's not even the closest Starbucks to my home. The employees are FANTASTIC. They always greet me and my grandparents by name. They have all our drink orders memorized. They make the BEST drinks by far of any location I've ever been to. If they don't make it right they go above and beyond to make it right for you for free. My only complaint is that they haven't hired me yet! ;)
