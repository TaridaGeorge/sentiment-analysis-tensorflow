Okay, what could I possibly add to this review that the others haven't covered? I doubt much. I'm Italian and was raised in an Italian part of the city in New Jersey, so I judge every "so called" Italian restaurant by very tough standards and Aiello's passes every one of them.

Joe, the owner, is the real deal New Youk Italian bringing the traditional northeast Italian to the Southwest. Not only is the food true to form, but Joe himself is about as personable an Italian guy as you'd find. You might as well be eating in his own kitchen as far as he's concerned.

I live 30 minutes away and willingly make this trek a couple times a month. It's real Italian and hard to find.
