This boutique is great!  Maybe it is where I am shopping but I have never been to a 'boutique' that was not expensive.  So I come here knowing that most things I will not be able to afford but there will be somethings I can.  I know that she does not charge more than any other vintage boutiques for the same items because I have compared prices.   I always end up leaving with some cute tank tops or something.  They have something for everyone... girl, guy, baby, home.  You should check it out!
