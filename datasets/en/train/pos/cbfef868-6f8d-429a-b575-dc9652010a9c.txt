My girlfriend and I love this place. Great atmosphere, service and food. The bar is really cool looking. I have never had anything less than outstanding service. 

My girlfriend always gets the balsamic infused rib eye and I can't blame her. It is really good. I like to try different things, but my fall back is always the Maytag crusted fillet. I like that they have interesting specials too. the best was a special vegetable side. Buttered mint green beans sounded odd to me, so I had to try it. I am glad I did because they were awesome. 

Great place to take a date.
