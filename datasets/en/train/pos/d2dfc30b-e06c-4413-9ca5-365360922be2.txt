This new cafe is great for anyone wanting to eat great healthy food at a very affordable price. Don't be fooled by the name, they have a ton of dishes other then salads to choose from. It is a great environment, the owners are so nice and one of them is always working. My kids have had the pan fried whole grain noodles twice a week for three weeks now and still ask for it every night. My hubby loves that steak wrap and I love the Scottsdale Salad and Fish Tacos.
