If you like LGO and Cheauvront you will love Wedge and Bottle. The choices of cheese and charcuterie are first rate. Sit for a bit with a glass of wine or specialty beer and cheese plate either at one of the neat little tables inside or out on the patio. 
Pastas, honey,jams, olives, gourmet salts, crackers are just a few of the flavor filled offerings they have. There are sandwiches to fill your hunger need. If they could just start carrying MJ bread and local Queen Creek Olive Mill products! 
The staff is friendly, very knowledgeable and ready to help you make a selection for cocktail hour or dinner at your house tonight. 
Don't be afraid to try any of the samples they love to share. Their goat cheeses and triple cream Bries are savory and inspire fabulous pairings with the bottles of wine they carry.
