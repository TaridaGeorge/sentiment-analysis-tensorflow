The TPC's 16th Hole is looking good right now for next weeks Waste Management's Phoenix Open.

I came over here to stake out my spot. Looks like they tournament people have everything ready to go for the start... plenty of bars and porta-potties!

Having a VIP pass is key to really enjoying this nutty place during the week.... not fun seeking out porta-potties after an afternoon of the caliber of drinking that goes on here.

Hope to see you all here.... and lets all be honest.... we don't go to really watch golf being played!
