I'm sitting writing this review from a sofa here at the Copper Star. I must admit, I'm impressed! 

From the quaint "drive through" that turned out to be a door you simply pull up to and an employee comes out to take your order from you while you sit in your car.. to the eclectic and hip interior. I was sold even before I sat down to take a sip of one of the most delish  mochas I've had in the states. Strong and rich w/o being too sweet!!! Perfect! This chocolaty masterpiece easily surpasses mochas de la Starbucks. 

Cooper Star is on my "Visit Again & Again" list. 

If you are reading this ignore all the other reviews that say less and come visit this place yourself. Simply delightful!!
