This is how pizza should taste and be cooked, in a pizza oven! I have tried the so called great pizza from Oreganos, Gilbert pizza, Bucis, and all of the other places and this kills them. Let me educate Arizona on pizza, it's supposed to have a crust on the bottom. It's supposed to drip oil. That's the quality of the ingredients.  There salads are nice, there antipasto is excellent, and the heros are great. If you have a problem with the owners eyebrows or you want someone to kiss your butt with service then go some where else. If you want excellent Italian takeout then Prima is for you.
