Ohh myy gaah.. Where do I start?

I am completely obsessed with this store. It's overwhelming to even try to explain why it is SUCH a phenomenal Canadian company... but I'll keep it short and to the point.

Quality products: Period. There is no fancy packaging or facade. Every product is honestly amazing.

The LUSH Girls: Super sweet, extremely helpful, down to earth, polite, and genuinely honest! My favorite LUSH girl is Amanda Sipenock. She is such a sweet girl and always makes my shopping experience incredible.

The main reasoning behind my initial interest in Lush Cosmetics is Deanne5253 on youtube! She's awesome and tells it like it is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFLv-aHQ3Lk Great video for new LUSH shoppers and also gives advice on what to do when you go to Lush!!!
