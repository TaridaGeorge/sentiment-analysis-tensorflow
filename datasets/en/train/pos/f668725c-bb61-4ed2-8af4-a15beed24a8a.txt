I have to admit I am a big fan of yogurt.  this place just opened up and is open till midnight every night of the week!  (I get late night yogurt cravings)  This place is great, it's cute (not that that matters very much)  The staff is friendly, it isn't very expensive (.39 ounce.)  They have a bunch of flavors (personally I'm a fan of the cheesecake, cake batter and red velvet)  they also have sorbet and dairy/sugarfree options...  they also have a very wide range of toppings .  It's a lot like yogurtland, just in the moon valley area.
