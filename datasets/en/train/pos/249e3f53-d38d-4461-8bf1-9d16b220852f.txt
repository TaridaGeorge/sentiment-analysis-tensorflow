I went to Beautif- Eye Studios after yelping threading in the Scottsdale area. I am so happy I decided to come here! Tori was amazing, Very friendly and the studio is failry small which creates a very comfortable feel. Eyebrow threading is only $14 and $9 for first time cients. Tori took her time and paid very close attention detail. My eyebrows turned out great and I will for sure be going back!
