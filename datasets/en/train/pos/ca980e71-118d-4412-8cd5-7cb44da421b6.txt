Went here Saturday night on a first date.  We decided to eat at the bar and one of the owners was serving drinking and was very friends and helped me find just the right beer for my mood.  I tried the duck and carrot cake which were fantastic.  The menu is unique in the best way possible and their beer/wine/spirits list is perfect for my tastes.  I even made the point of creating a yelp so I could help this new family business out...just saying.
