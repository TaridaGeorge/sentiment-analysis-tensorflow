Easily the best doctor I've ever been to, Dr. Patric Hernandez-Kline is a knowledgeable and kind doctor. He is accepting and while the clinic has grown it is fairly easy to make an appointment, or you can just walk in.

Candy and the other staff members are friendly people as well! Dr. Kline is also compassionate and accepting of all in the LGBT spectrum.
