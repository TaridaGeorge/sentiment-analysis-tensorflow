Shadows is a great cigar and martini bar. For a quiet evening one should arrive around 7pm for a wonderful choice of comfortable seating. Place starts to really hop around 9pm so if you are looking for a quiet place to talk with friends and enjoy a cigar or martini, plan to arrive early. Live music was entertaining and the wait staff was friendly and very attentive. We will definintely be going back.
