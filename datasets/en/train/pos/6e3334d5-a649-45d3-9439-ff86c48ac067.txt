In my opinion, the Chicken Shwarma Sandwich  is "THE BEST" Sandwich in the City.  That's all I have to say.  It truly is the best.  The chicken is all white meat,  very juicy.  Cooked and seasoned to perfection, and there is a TON of meat in this baby.  The bread is chewy and hot and grilled just right.  It comes wrapped in foil.  My favorite part is when I open up the foil and the heat and steam hit my face and fog up my glasses... and fill my nostrils with the great smell.  The french fries are hand cut and some of the best around.  All the food is great, but the Chicken Shwarma sandwich is outrageous.
