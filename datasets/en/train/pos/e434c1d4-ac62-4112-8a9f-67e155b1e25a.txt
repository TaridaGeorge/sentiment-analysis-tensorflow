The Two Hippies family has had a key to my heart since day 1. The 40th street and Bell location is another unique, colorful addition to the fam! The decor makes for a bright, reflective 60's experience! Not to mention, the fish tacos are THE BEST IN THE VALLEY!! The 3- pack taco combo allows for variety and is just enough to leave you full and satisfied! And for the finale, the "magic brownies" DEFINITELY live up to their name!! They are magical melt in your mouth delicious! The service is great you cannot be disappointed!
