FEZ Rocks!  Went there last night again, and it's always been great.  The good thing about FEZ is that not only is the food great, but the staff is friendly, unlike another new restaurant down the street ...lacks..I had there special of Macaroni and Cheese!  We sat outside even though it was only around 55 degrees, still great!  A Must if you're visiting Phoenix!
