I'm adding "great place to find a gift" to my review of Phoenix Art Museum. While searching for a birthday present for my photography loving Mom, I immediately thought of the Phoenix Art Museum. I found a great gift for her at the museum gift shop and I also got to enjoy the latest exhibits and have a nice Arcadia Farms lunch all in one visit. Now that's birthday shopping at its finest!
