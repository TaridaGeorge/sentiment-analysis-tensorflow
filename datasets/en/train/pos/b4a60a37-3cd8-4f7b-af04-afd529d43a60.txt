Sunday Brunch is extraordinary. Last Sunday, we had the buffet for $25 with a fabulous selection of choices from fresh sushi, pastries, desserts, fruits and on and on...even a press pot of coffee. We could have had many additional hot choices for $10 (a bargain) more, but didn't see the need. Loved it. Terrific service. Quiet. One of the best gourmet bargains we've found. the Frank Lloyd Wright designs shine through.
