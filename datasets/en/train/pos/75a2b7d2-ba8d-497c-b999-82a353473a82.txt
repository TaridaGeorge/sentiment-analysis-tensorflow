I have been to several chiropractors over the years and, frankly, was never too impressed with their "move 'em in, move 'em out" mentality.  Dr. Mike Martin is SO far away from that; he really knows his stuff, combines massage with manipulation...I've NEVER walked away from here without feeling anything but amazing.  HIGHLY recommended, especially for those who have their doubts about chiropractors!
