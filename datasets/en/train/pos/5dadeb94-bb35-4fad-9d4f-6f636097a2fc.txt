My family really loves Grimaldi's. The pizza is so delicious, very unlike the chain pizza restaurants in the area. The crust is so thin and crispy, the sauce has a very distinctly tomato flavor, not too seasoned or herb-y, and the cheese is so perfectly melty. It's not cheap, but it won't break the bank if you don't go crazy with toppings. The service has always been fabulous, just don't go at 4 pm! They clean out the ovens and you could wait up to an hour if you order after they start. Anyway, it's a great place in a great location. We will continue to go there when we crave REAL pizza.
