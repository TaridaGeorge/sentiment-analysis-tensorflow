Got a discount coupon on my Safeway or Frys check. 8$ for the full service. This is the first time I'm pleased to pay for a car wash service. They did a GREAT job and no annoying seller trying to fix your windshield, or asking what fragrance you want inside your car. 

Just car wash? 5$...highly recommendable!
