Being from the Southeast I had never heard of Charming Charlie.  My first experience with the store was at the Fashion Square location.  Both stores were virtually the same although I have to say I prefer the Norterra location since it was less crowded.

If you are in the need for cute, fashionable and AFFORDABLE accessories CC is your store.  They have every accessory you could possibly need in every color under the sun.  There were so many accessories that it was hard for an indecisive, ADD person like myself to actually focus and look at everything.  You could seriously spend all day in this store looking at all the merchandise.  I ended up buying a maxi dress that was reasonably priced.  The prices on accessories were better than the prices on the clothes but I loved the dress so I had to get it :)
