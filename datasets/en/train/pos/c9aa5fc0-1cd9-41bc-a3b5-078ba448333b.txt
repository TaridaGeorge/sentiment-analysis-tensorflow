I ordered 2 dozen cupcakes for my daughters' 4th and 2nd birthdays.  We had vanilla with vanilla buttercream frosting for the kids.  Kelly colored the frosting pink (my eldest's favorite color) and added edible glitter.  These cupcakes were beautiful and would have been the best cupcakes I've ever had if it wasn't for the other dozen that we ordered

The other dozen was chocolate brownie cupcake with brown sugar buttercream and these were hands down the most amazing cupcakes I've ever eaten.  Everyone at my party raved about them.  Despite the fact that everyone was "watching their calories" these cupcakes disappeared so fast.  Fifteen minutes after putting them out I went back to set one aside for my Mother in Law and they were already gone! 

Also, Kelly's customer service was impeccable and the free delivery in Scottsdale was super convenient!
