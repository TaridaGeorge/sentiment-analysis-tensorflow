I love when I'm so impressed by a non-food related business that I actually remember to write about it! The people that work here are 100% wonderful. Honest, straight forward and fast.

After my tune up at the Toyota dealership in Tempe resulting in a recommendation to get 2 tires replaced plus a dented wheel fixed, I said, "Thanks, I'll have it done somewhere else." Took it to Discount Tires who took one look and said, "You're wheel isn't damaged, we'll just do a balance adjustment." 35 minutes later I was on my way with two new tires and a much needed adjustment. Shakey steering wheel fixed and feelin good!

All I wanted was to leave feeling like I didn't get ripped off. Success.
