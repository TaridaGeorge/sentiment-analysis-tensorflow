Crash. Sunday nights at 6pm in the Chapel. Scott Savage and Dr., Maxie Burch trade off teaching on real life, practical, applicable ways that we Love, Think and Serve like Christ. Lots of small groups, Bible Studies, and other ways to get involved. Great workout facility in the Family Life Center that only costs $30/month with no contracts. Overall, just a fantastic community of people!
