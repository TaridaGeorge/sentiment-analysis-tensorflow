Truly an original experience. All the food was fresh and wonderful. The presentation was marvelous, the service was great. A little pricey at almost $25/per person with tip. I don't mind paying though...the rent in this cool place must be sky high! Definitely a place to experience!

PS...the Sweet Potato Hash is a must!

UPDATE: I didn't add my bill/tip right but they did (when I got the CC statement) it was $10 bucks lower! Honesty earned them the 5th star! Thanks, guys!
