I'm surprised to read some of the other reviews here... I'm from New York and know good Italian when I eat it.  This place IS good Italian.

The Veal Parm and garlic bread both stood out, and I loved the sauce... something I don't often find myself saying.  The pasta fagioli was also quite delicious.  Of course, I think the home made tiramisu was probably my favorite, though I'm a sucker for sweets.

Good service, good authentic atmosphere, and a few tacky signs and menu reminders give off the charm you'd expect of a great, neighborhood Italian place.

All in all, we left around $50 with an appetizer, two entrees, and dessert.  And we felt like we got the "great" birthday dinner we were in search of.
