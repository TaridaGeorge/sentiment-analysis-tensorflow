The dinner club selection for August was The Parlor.

Since Im writing this review many months removed from our outing, Ill spare everyone the specifics and just say, we loved this spot. Our second highest rated DC spot in over 1 year of Dinner Club (at 2 restaurants per month, thats quite a few). 

While we will all admit The Parlor isnt perfect (the potatoes on the pizza were undecooked for example) its strengths far outshine the problems. The cheese plate was fantastic, the pesto was fresh and perfect. The pizzas were scrumptious, and the ambiance was fantastic.

We all cant wait to go back....

PS - we have it from a good source that the burgers here are even better than the pizza.
