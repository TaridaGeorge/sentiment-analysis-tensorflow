As you come up to Pinnacle Peak this appears like it will be a daunting trek. As you watch people seemingly go straight up on switchbacks you may get the impression you are in for heavy workout. However, this is a hike for beginners to intermediate level and is a well-groomed, easy going trail.
The first part of the trail leads you up close to Pinnacle Peak top, but then wraps around the mountain to three main checkpoints, to give you various amazing views of the city and mountains. There is enough parking close to the trailhead and some information on some of the shrubbery and cacti of the desert along the trail.
I don't feel like most people are familiar with this mountain trail, but for any level of outdoor enthusiast I would definitely recommend it.
