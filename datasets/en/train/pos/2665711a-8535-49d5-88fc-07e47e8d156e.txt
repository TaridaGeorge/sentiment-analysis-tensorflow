WOW!!! You are back! Hopefully you burned the 80's crap and I can now add you back as my #1 station again. I only clicked on you again by accident in my boyfriends truck and at first I was confused-was this my old fave 103.9 back from the dead-YES! with the very best music- PLEASE I plead with you stay strong and be who you are- the best music station out there with Alternative-and I was happy with some other music in there too-BUT no 80's crap at ALL!!
