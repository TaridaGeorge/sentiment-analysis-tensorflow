Amazing Italian Food!!! I found The Strand on Yelp. Thank you fellow Yelpers! I'm relatively new to Phoenix and spoiled by the famous italian food in Little Italy, San Diego... I'll admit I've found some awesome Italian food in Phoenix!

The Strand has traditional, scrum-diddly-umptious Italian Food in Phoenix, Arizona... 1/2 OFF Happy Hour is the best... Bartenders are sweet, great drinks... The lobster mac n cheese is everything you could want. I love seafood pastas and this is probably one of the tastiest dishes at The Strand..

They also cater!!! I was enthralled as I am constantly searching for affordable, amazing, creative caterers... They will be at Search Control's event at the ASBA headquarters, if you're not there for the internet marketing event, you'll be there for The Strand's awesome italian food (:
