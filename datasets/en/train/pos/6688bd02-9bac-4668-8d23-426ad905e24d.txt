There are two road houses I love, Logan's and Texas road house. If I was rich I would eat at those two places every day.

The steak is always fresh and juicy, the bread is always fresh, and the happy hours here are pretty nice. I love eating the peanuts and just throwing them on the floor that is what a road house is suppose to be like. If you come on your birthday and someone in your party tells the waitress they will pull a sattle over to your table and make you sit on it and sing you happy birthday. I went along with it since my meal was being paid for :) 

If you are a fan of big steaks for under $22.00 come here and enjoy, and don't forget to stap on the A-1
