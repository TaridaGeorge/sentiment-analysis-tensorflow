This place is great! I had a number 1 combo with avocado and it was one of the better burgers I have had, definitely a step above the standard fast food burger.  This place was extremely clean and everyone was very friendly. The condiments were a plus, I had some yellow hot chilies with my meal at no extra charge. I'll definitely be back!
