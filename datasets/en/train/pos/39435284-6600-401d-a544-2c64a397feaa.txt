This wonderful woman is so good at keeping my wardrobe up to date! If you are trying to get the most of your fashion budget, why not update what you have?
I have been using her for years. She is fast and very good. She can shorten hems to update a dress or skirt. Or maybe you need her to make your skinny jeans skinnier, she can do it. You can even take her things that you bought on sale that maybe were not just the right fit. Elizebeth is your gal. She is also great at repairs.
Definitely a thrifty find for all you budget minded fashionistas out there. Now clean out your closet!
