I've loved this place for a long time; it's like my "Cheers". The staff are always welcoming and helpful and the drinks are stiff.
They recently remodeled the seating area and outside patio. It's a really great lounge-type atmosphere for just hanging out with a few friends or having larger group parties. A nice place to spend time almost any night of the week.
