I HAVE FOUR CATS AND THIS IS TRUELY THE BEST VET EVER! I'M SERIOUS! . THE STAFF AND DR. CRUZ ARE THE BEST. Dr. Cruz explains EVERYTHING to me, he actually TAKES THE TIME, to explain and listen to me. He will explain everything, including different treatment and costs options without making me feel guilty for looking at different options due to cost. (I do have United Pet Care insurance, which is very helpful with the costs). My last vet was too "busy" and impatient with me so  I never felt comfortable asking questions. Dr. Cruz really includes you in the treatment options and overall care for your pet!
