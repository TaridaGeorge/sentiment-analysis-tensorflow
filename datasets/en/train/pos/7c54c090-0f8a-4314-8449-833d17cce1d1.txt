Simply the best. It was first time ever eating In-N-Out and I was not upset one bit! I had the double cheeseburger with fries animal style. The animal style fries were out of this world and lived up to all of my expectations. Even though this place was packed the customer service was still amazing and I'll be back next year for my annual visit!
