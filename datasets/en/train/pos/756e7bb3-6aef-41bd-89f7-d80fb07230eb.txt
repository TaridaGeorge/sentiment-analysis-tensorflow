Probably the best place I have found so far to take out-of-towners so they can reinforce their notion of what the "West" is like.  I have yet to eat here, but they menu looked very resonable, and the beers were plenty cheap too.
Back to the atmosphere.  Greaswood has it all, from a dilapidated rusting manure spreader to what appears to be fighting chickens, seperated from on another with rustic chicken coups.  Donkeys constanly hee-hawing and a workshop/barn that looks like it hasn't been regularly used since 1973.
I wish I had discovered this place before my brother visted earlier this year.
