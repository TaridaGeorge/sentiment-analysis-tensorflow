I can't say enough about Jenny Poon's amazing talent and wouldn't recommend any other graphic design studio in the valley.  I've passed along Eeko Studio's name to many of my friends and family; they have all been highly satisfied with Jenny's professionalism, talent, timeliness, and of course her fun personality!

Every time I pass out one of my beautiful Eeko-designed business cards, I hear oohs and ahhs.  Jenny ensures that your personality is reflected in the designs she creates for you, whether it be a business card, a logo or a wedding invitation.  

Oh and did I mention she is highly dedicated to the earth!?
