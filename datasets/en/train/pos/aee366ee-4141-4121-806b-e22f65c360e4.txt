A cute little ice cream and candy shoppe owned by the guy who brought us Postino and Windsor, conveniently located next to Windsor. 

I love me some sweets and this place hits the spot. I am a big fan of the banana ice cream with choc chips or gummy bears. They also have cookies, cupcakes, candy, etc. They even have pretzel cones, now that I've never seen before.

The staff is very friendly and is good and helping a lot of people when the line gets long. You're never waiting for long and it's always worth the wait. It's dangerous to live only a few blocks from this place.
