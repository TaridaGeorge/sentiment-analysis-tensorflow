We went here during happy hour.  We had the cashew calamari and the Texas gulf oysters.  Loved the calamari!   Gently fried and seasoned.  Thank goodness the calamari wasn't fried to the point of hard and nonexistent.  The veggies in the rest of the dish were perfectly seasoned.  The gulf oysters were obviously fresh, and had three types of condiments, which truly added and not over-whelmed.   The Grey Goose drink on the happy hour menu was the best I've had.   Because the food and drinks and service were so fabulous, I suggested our next gal pal birthday party event be at Wildfish on the Waterfront.
