When I think of ice cream where else can you go???  Cold Stone is the only place that has ridiculous combinations, a billion calorie shakes, too many flavors to pick from, and once you are in there you can kiss your behind goodbye....
Seriously I  workout to go here later in the week.  Worth an hour on a treadmill to eat one ice cream treat from here.
