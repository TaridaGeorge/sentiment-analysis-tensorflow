Most menu items are exceptional while a few are more average.  Pizza, breakfast plates, salads and coffee bar are exceptional.  I've found many of the baked goods to be less moist than I like, such as the cinnamon rolls, bread pudding, and cakes.  Once you find your favorites though, you'll have plenty of reason to come back again and again.

Liberty Market offers a lot more than quality dishes though.  The atmosphere is unique and inviting.  It's a cool meet up place for groups, whether that be family, friends or colleagues.   Additionally, the service is always excellent.  It's a very tightly run operation in many ways, which makes it a 5 for me.  It has really enhanced the look and value of the Heritage District in Gilbert.
