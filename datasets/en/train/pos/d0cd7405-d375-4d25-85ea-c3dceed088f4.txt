Can't give more than 5 stars or I would! $15 for a 3-course tasting menu on Wednesday and Thursday nights. LOADS of choices for each course. Usually 2 meat, 2 fish and 2 veggie selections. Another $5 for dessert. Rock. ON!

(They still do the brunch on the 2nd Sunday of each month - $25 unless it's a brunching holiday, then the price goes up! But, hey! Who needs a brunching holiday to brunch??!!)
