This breakfast visit stood out to me the other day for this main reason: curtousy. I walked in with a group of 10 people. We were greeted upon entering and when we asked if they could make room for a party that big, they responded, Absolutely! Just give us two minutes! They probably did it in less. The waitresses were patient with our crowd who were a little indecisive with our orders, always had water and juice refilled quickly. Also, the waitress was thoughtful when I wanted just one pancake to go with my omlette, she suggested the kids pancakes because the regular size would be rather large. Then the kids pancakes came in the shape of mickey mouse heads. Yaya! Also, their food is always delicious.
