The claim to fame for Grimaldi's is the crust, which is not bad.

I really enjoyed the toppings much more than I expected! The sauce is slightly sweet but not cloying, generously applied but not soupy. The cheese is obviously a fresh whole milk mozzarella, very tasty! And the pepperoni was good and zesty!

Having had the pie carryout and dine-in, I have to recommend dine-in for the freshness of the experience. The crust does lose a little something after sitting in a box for awhile. 

Overall I would give the pie a 9/10 for an above average pizza.
After the closure of Zza's in downtown Chandler, Grimaldi's is now my favorite pizza place. Man I wish I could get delivery here!
