This is the most authentic Chinese food I have found since moving to Arizona... and it's excellent.

Being a "good jew," my first trip to China King was for dim sum last Christmas. I found it through the wife of a friend that just so happened to be Chinese... we also let her order for us.

Although I was not brave enough to try them, I have on good authority that the hen's feet are great. My favorite dish were the dessert rolls with the lotus seed custard-like filling.

As an added bonus, dim sum for five only ran us about $40... less than half of what I've paid for similar meals in metro-Detroit / Windsor.

IMHO, this restaurant is well worth the hike down the 101 from "The Dale."
