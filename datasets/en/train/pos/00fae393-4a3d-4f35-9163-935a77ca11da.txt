Yay, a place with real authentic home cooked food. It's a small mom and pop place where everything is made from scratch. The homemade apple cider sweetener for the tea is to die for. I just wish they were open in the evening for dinner. Great for breakfast and lunch though.

They serve up soups, salads, sandwiches and have daily specials.
