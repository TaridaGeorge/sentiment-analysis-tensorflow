Great food!  Great service!  Price - not for the faint-of-heart, but reasonable.

The previous reviews give you an idea of the ambience of Avanti.  I'll just add that The noir ambience is dominated by low-key lighting . . . and deep shadows, creating feelings of intimacy & privacy. . .  even in the middle of the room.

I'll go back whenever you invite me to go. . .  and some other times too!

They serve larger portions than I want to surround, so I usually take home what's left on my plate.  It's great the next day.
