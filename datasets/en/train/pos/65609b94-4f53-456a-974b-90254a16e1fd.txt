I searched high and low for a good salon near me (even driving out to Glendale & Peoria) and found exactly what I was looking for at Chace Salon thorugh Christina.  Christina's the best, use her and you'll have no regrets!  You can simply explain what you want to her and she'll figure out how do cut and style so that it complements your features!

And the price is beyone reasonable for a great hair cut!
