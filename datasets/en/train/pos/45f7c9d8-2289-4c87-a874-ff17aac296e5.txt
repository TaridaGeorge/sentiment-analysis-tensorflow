Amazing place to eat! Everything is always fresh and beautifully presented. 

Your taste buds will have a new bar to jump over when trying to compare entrees for lunch or dinner with other places.

My favorite: SEARED AHI CAESAR seared rare, hearts of romaine, parmesan crisps, croutons and egg free caesar dressing.

I feel so appreciated as a customer because when you check on on foursquare they tweet you back and thank you for visiting.   I hope other restaurants are reading this and take note... with the fight for the consumer discretionary dollar making the customer feel good bring repeat and referral business!  

Don't be put off by the name....come even if you don't drink because it is so much more than a bar to get a yard of beer! 

The service is great food is fantastic!  Must try you will be happy!
