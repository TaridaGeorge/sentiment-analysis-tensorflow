The meats are sliced fresh for each sandwich.  The bread is fresh and very flavorful.  The price for the size is great!  I wish they had other sides other than chips.  And I have a card I get punched so every 10th sandwich is free.  I think Jersey Mike's blows Port of Subs out of the water!  Subway is average and very generic.
