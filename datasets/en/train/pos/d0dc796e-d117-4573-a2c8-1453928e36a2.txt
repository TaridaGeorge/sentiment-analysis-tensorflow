You won't be expecting food this good hidden away in this location.  The wine selection is not only fun, inspiring and delicious but also beautiful.  As the name implies (cork as in wine bottle cork- and the decor) wine is a big deal here.  Don't be misled though- the chef from Chicago will make you squeal with delight over what ever you order. I have been there several times. A few times for a romantic dinner with my dear husband and several times with a group. The room they set up for our friend's anniversary was so special.  
Try the chef's choice dinner. It is worth the money and will make for one of the most memorable meals you will ever eat.
