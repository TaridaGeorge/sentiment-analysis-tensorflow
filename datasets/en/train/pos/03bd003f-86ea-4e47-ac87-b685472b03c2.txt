Delicious! I have really been missing the wings from City o City since I moved here from the Midwest, but now I have a source of delicious vegan buffalo wings closer to home.  Aside from the wings, we tried a couple of noodle bowls, both of which were very good. One minor complaint was that some vegetables (I'm looking at you, carrots) were cut so large as to be unwieldy. 

Other than the food, they have a limited selection of vegan groceries and natural drinks. I was excited that they had harder to find beverages, like the non-root beer flavors of Virgil's.
