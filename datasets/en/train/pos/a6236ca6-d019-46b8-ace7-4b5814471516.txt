Every time I walk into Changing Hands I think to myself, yup, this place is the best bookstore ever! I also say the same thing about Bookman's in Mesa but what's a bookworm to do? I love the location since it's right next to Hoodlums and is connected to Wildflower Bakery. In addition to the awesome new and used books for sale I've also attended a book talk. It was FREE and very intimate and I want to go to another one soon. I just missed Anne Rice last month where she when she dropped by Changing Hands for a book signing. These guys are local, friendly and make you feel right at home.
