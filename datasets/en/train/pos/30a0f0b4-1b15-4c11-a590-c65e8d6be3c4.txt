You know, it's not that I can't afford Montblanc.  It's just that I'm not really sure if this is truly where I want my next 14 mortgage payments to go.  I love their star design collection.  And their diamond jewelery is to DIE for.  I had to wipe the drool from my mouth as I left this store.  Everything is SO stylish, SO beautiful, SO incredible.  I love Montblanc.
