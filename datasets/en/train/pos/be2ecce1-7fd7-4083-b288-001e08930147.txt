Crepes to DIE for.  YUM YUM YUM!  We only stopped by for desert.  OMG!  The choclate ganache and carmel fondue was ooouber good.  No words to describe it.  It was so good and we had a fun time talking.   Love the atompshere too!  The rocks on the walls, the decor, the feel of the place.  Loved it.  

Need to try dinner here next time!
