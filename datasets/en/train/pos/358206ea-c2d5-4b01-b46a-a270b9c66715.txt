"Woohoo! As good as it gets!" is right.  This is our absolute favorite breakfast spot!  We come here at least one a week.. if not more.  Some of our favorite include The Border Patrol, Outlaw Scramble, Banana Nut Pancakes and The Mediterranean.  The service could not be better.  The staff, including the owners, are always friendly and do whatever they can to make sure their guests are satisfied.  Often times the chef and manager will come by and check on the tables and say hello.  The chef even runs the food to make sure it comes out hot and gets to the table as soon as its off the griddle.  The food, service and atmosphere are top notch!  We will continue to return because it's a true AZ gem.
