I can't believe I didn't review this restaurant the last time I went.  Love it!  Great ambiance, Great service, Great/Quality food and decent prices.

We shared the gluten free wild mushroom pizza and the spaghetti squash casserole.  The pizza was AMAZING.  I didn't even care that it was a gluten free crust.  I would have been happy to just share that for a light meal.

The casserole was recommended from the waiter.  It was okay.  Reminded me of eggplant parm without the eggplant... lol.  I enjoyed it but wouldn't order it again.
