Some people are so mean...  This place is by far one of the best places in town if you're looking for New Mexican Cuisine.  My favorite dish is either the Pasta Heidi or the Chimayo Chicken.  You also can't go wrong with their Blackened Scallop App.  I also always get their Prickley Pear margarita, which is phenomenal.  My husband and I try to goto Richardson's or Dicks Hideaway as much as we can, it's a shame this had to happen to such a fantastic place.  I love you Richardson's and can't wait for you to rebuild!!!!
