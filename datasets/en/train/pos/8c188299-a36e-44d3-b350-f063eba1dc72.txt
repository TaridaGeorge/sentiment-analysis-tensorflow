This place is amazing, talk about great atmosphere, incredible customer service, great attitudes, and... of course incredible... healthy food. I don't get to come down here much, but when I do, the steak taco's are incredible. Anytime I have a visitor in from out of town, I make a point to come to True Food. The only drawback?.. its popular, its good, so you have to be patient and wait for a table on a busy day. All-in-All, one of my favorite restaurants in the valley!
