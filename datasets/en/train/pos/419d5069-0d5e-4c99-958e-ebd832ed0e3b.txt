i still love this hill, especially the cholla canyon side (more parking, less crowded-sometimes). it's odd to me on the echo side to see people waiting in their idling cars for a parking spot to go hiking...kind of oxymoronic. 

anyway, just an update. extremely early runs up the hill have become my favorite as i only pass 2-3 people going up to the top and at the most, 10 on the way down. the lights of the city are so pretty, and you can be guaranteed a fabulous sunrise everysingle time you go up. 
but it's so cold now in the morning....even better for me...fewer folks!
