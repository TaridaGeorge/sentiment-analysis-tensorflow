I went here an hour before closing time on a Sunday, and was thoroughly impressed.  Got the wor wonton soup, kung pao beef, and shrimp egg foo yung.  I hadn't had egg foo yung in years, and this dish was amazing!  All the dishes were delicious.  The veggies were perfectly cooked and still crunchy.  Nothing was overly salty or sweet -- just great balance.   And the staff are really friendly. 

Looks like I found a new favorite!
