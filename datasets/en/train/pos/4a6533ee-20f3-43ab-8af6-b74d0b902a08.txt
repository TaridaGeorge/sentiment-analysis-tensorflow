lets just say that I didn't particularly care for coffee til I had Cartel!! Just a great clean flavor! mmmm...my favorites are the Iced Toddy, Espresso Excelente (which is double shot with homemade horchata) and the cappuccino!  
There are only 2 coffee's I drink in this town, and Cartel is one, the other is secret!
