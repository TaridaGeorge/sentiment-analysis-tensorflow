I was refered to Pecan Grove by a friend and have had great experiences.   I live in central Phoenix, so changing to a vet in Tempe was a big sacrifice.  But, Dr. Holmes and his staff are awesome.  They managed the care of both of my dogs in their later years, keeping them comfortable and pain free when they needed it.  They are extremely friendly and show genuine concern for the care of your pet.  And the rates are just right.  

Also just found out that they are opening a new office on 5th Ave and McDowell in central Phoenix.  Can't wait to walk my dog to the vet!
