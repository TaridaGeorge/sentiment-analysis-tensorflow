This was the best Torta I've ever had and I have had many.  We had the Torta Norteno, which had lean steak (carne asada), cheese, peppers, chipotle mayo, avocado and a chipotle BBQ sauce.  The food was as fresh and tasty as it gets.  We can't wait to go back and try other tortas and other items on the menu.
