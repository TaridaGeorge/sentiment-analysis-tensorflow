By far the coziest restaurant in North Scottsdale, with food and service to match. The owner and staff are little gems. I have tried many of their pizzas and all of them beyond satisfied my taste buds.

I am very impressed by Lamp Pizzeria and have no doubt that they will be very successful. It is the personality of the owner that shines through the great flavorful food.

Yes, I am somewhat addicted to this place but it's easy to understand why and I am confident that it will become one of your favorite restaurants to savor a delicious artisan pizza.

Also noteworthy to consider that LAMP pizzeria ranks # 8 of some 743 restaurants on Trip Advisor. What an achievement....Even Pizzeria Bianco is far behind them. Woooo hooooo!!!
