I LOVE this place!  It is located in a very unassuming shopping center.  When I first walked in I was extremely impressed by the d√©cor.  It is super clean and there is nothing tacky about the place.  It's beautiful!  Ben, the owner I believe, is so funny and very friendly.  He always chats with customers and jokes around, really nice!  It is very different from all other nail salons that I have been to.  I feel like you are getting a manicure or pedicure at a fancy salon for the price of one at your normal run-of-the-mill places.  My pedicure always last a really long time! 

They accept credit card, but make sure to bring cash for tip! 

I've been about 5+ times, and won't go anywhere else from now on!
