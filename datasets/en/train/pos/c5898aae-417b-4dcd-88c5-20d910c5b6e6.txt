Ordered from the Happy Hour menu, and there was not one bad item on there. I was actually offered a tasted from several people from their sampling. We were all there for a Raven B2B event, so when it was my turn to pick for me I was stuck. The shrimp, clams, garlic cheese breads (sorry when it comes to food, garlic wins, if you don't like it then don't go to Italian places). Excellent atmosphere, the bar crew was excellent. I can't wait for next month!!
