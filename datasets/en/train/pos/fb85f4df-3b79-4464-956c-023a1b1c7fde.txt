I wonder if Jeremy T was at the same clinic I go to! I have taken my three dogs here after having the same experience he described at another clinic in town. Dr. LaRock has been extremely helpful and caring both with routine care and a chronic problem with one of my dogs. I was always given low cost alternatives including generic heartworm medicine, a prescription to be filled at the local pharmacy to reduce costs, and some inventive no-cost ideas. Prices were always revealed up front and were substantially less than the other clinic. I have taken pets to veterinarians across the country - we have only had quality experiences in my visits here.
