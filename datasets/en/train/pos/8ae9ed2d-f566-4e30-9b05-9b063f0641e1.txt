Love the Matzo ball soup!!!  My daughter got the kids chicken tenders with FF and for a selective eater she loved every bite!  Next time I will bring Pastrami lovin hubby to score the deli meat selection.  I was tempted by the bakery items and knishes which I will also have to give a try so I will definitely be back!  Clean, with courteous prompt service is an added plus to the great food.
