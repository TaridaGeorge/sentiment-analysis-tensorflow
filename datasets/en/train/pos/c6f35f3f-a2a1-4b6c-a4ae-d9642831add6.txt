ASU is a great school! Pat Tillman was a Sun Devil and in my book more of a hero than half the chachies coming out of these fancy little ivy league schools. If you wnt to be the next mark zuckerberg then try getting into Harvard. ASU provided a great education for me! Im earning seven figures a year and Im happy.
