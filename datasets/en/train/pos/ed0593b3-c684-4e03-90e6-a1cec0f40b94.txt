Everyone is so friendly, in particular, Myra in the Impulse department.  She's always friendly and has a good eye for fashion.  She has no problem telling me what looks good on me and what doesn't.  She's never pressured me into buying anything and for that I keep going back - been over 2 years.  

I love this location.  It's always so clean and the layout is easy on the eyes.  I don't get overwhelmed when I walk in.    I agree with others when the selections are as big as other locations but their level of customer service by far stand out.  

Having a Starbuck's at this location and a handful of coupons is always a good day.
