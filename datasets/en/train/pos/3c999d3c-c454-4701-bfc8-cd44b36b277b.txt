I have been going to Erin for about 5 years now & she is the best. I followed her to Epic from another salon she was working at. She gives great haircuts. & is wonderful with color. I always make my next appointment before I leave the salon because she does have a large clientele. She has always made time for me if I have to change appointment even if it means her staying later. She is just a doll.Great Stylist!!!       Lynda S.
