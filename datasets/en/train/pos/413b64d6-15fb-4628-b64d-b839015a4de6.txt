You have to love Trader Joes, they have so much to choose from.                   However, you  do have to read the labels because, a lot of the food items are from China.     I am not digging that. I think they have gotten a little bit better than they used to be with that.    A lot of their fish at one time was from China. You get to fill out a coupon for your chance in a raffel for each bag you bring in when shopping. Which is  always a  good incentive.  Food is fresh and good. Everything is a good price ,including the  Vino.  Sometimes  they even have fabulous samples!
