I have driven 7 hours to eat here! i am Chinese and have lived in SF so I have had my fair share of Chinese food. This is the real deal. My wife and I stumbled upon this place 4 years ago. We have literally made trips to Phoenix from New Mexico for the food at GHK. Food is consistent, authentic and just damn good. Be careful, I am pretty sure the staff and chefs customizes your food. If you are non Asian and order sweet and sour pork and egg foo young, you will probably get Americanized Chinese food.  Our favorites are the lobster with ginger and scallions, satay fish pan fried noodles, walnut shrimp and beef chow fun. Ask the waitress for authentic Chinese.  And tell them the Fat Chinese guy from New Mexico sent you. :)
