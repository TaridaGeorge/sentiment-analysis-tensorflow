While it's rare to get a bad tasting donut, it's very easy to fall victim to the too greasy, stomach ache inducing donut.  The donuts at Bosa Donuts are THE BEST I've had in a really long time.  They're satisfying without being too greasy or heavy.  I wasn't even bothered that the selection was a bit limited when I went in at 8:40 pm.   Service was very friendly.  The interior is also really nice looking and looks more like a cafe than the typical donut shop.  The bathrooms were super clean as were the tables.
