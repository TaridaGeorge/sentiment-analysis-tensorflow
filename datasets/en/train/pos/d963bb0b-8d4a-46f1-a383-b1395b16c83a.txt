They serve sweet potatoe fries here! Don't let their name throw you because they have sandwiches and subs. Their pizzas are pricier than most local pizzerias because they make it when you order it. I don't recommend getting the pizza unless you want to wait awhile. Their sandwiches are good and less expensive compared to their pizza.
