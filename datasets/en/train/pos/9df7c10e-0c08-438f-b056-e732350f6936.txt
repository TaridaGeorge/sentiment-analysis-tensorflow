It's about time I update this review. I am here on a regular basis and am quite the Windsor fan. Unique, delicious food with consistent, excellent service. 

I highly recommend finding a spot at the bar and hanging out for a while. I've witnessed all kinds of entertaining moments including a man leaving his sloppy, drunken wife. Good times. 

The cheddar fondue (with pretzels only) is one of my favorite snacks during the colder months. Try it out...you won't be disappointed.
