Finding a good Chinese restaurant is hard to do, but George and Son's is perfect.  They have great food, great service, friendly staff, etc.  If you are going for lunch, they have a buffet where you can try everything they have.  If you are going for dinner, they have a wonderful sitdown atmosphere.  Most of the time, I get my food to go.  Their egg drop soup is great and is garnished with fresh spinich leaves.  Their crab rangoon has real crab in it.  Their house fried rice is filled with meat.  The Chef's Special Noodles is really good.  It has very thin noodles with meats and veggies in it.  The spicy pork is good.  I have not had anything there that I don't like.  You will be very happy going there.
