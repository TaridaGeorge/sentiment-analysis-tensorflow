Mmmmmm..a Combo please!  Pastrami and Corn beef together at last on a soft onion bun with Swiss cheese (or without)..best thing when you are craving MEAT! Yep, certainly not a diner for vegans.  Miracle Mile has been around forever, and I love to have a great sandwich or entree at this location.  From deli sandwiches to daily specials like meatloaf, roast chicken even cabbage and corn beef, it's a miracle I haven't gain 20 pounds from here! And they have Cream Soda...mmmm.   Side dishes include fries, potato salad, salads, mac n' cheese and potato pancakes.  The portions are huge that you can share or take the left overs home for a midnight meal.
