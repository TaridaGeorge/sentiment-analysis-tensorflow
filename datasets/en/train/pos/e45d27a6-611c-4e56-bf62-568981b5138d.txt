Been going here for 5 years now and bottom line is, they are the best in the state, hands down.  I've only had one issue before and that was with ordering some custom jewelry...long story short, it was a big mess that took a few months to straighten out but in the end they were very accommodating and corrected the situation and then some...even after that headache I still recommend everyone I know who is interested in getting pierced to go to HTC, the piercers are rad, professional, CLEAN & really, they are the only place in AZ I would ever trust to poke holes in me =]
