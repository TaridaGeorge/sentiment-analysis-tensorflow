This place is super cute and relaxing. Prices are not too bad during happy hour and the food is tasty. I love to go here with a group of girls and just talk. There are many nice chairs and couches to just hang out on. The waitresses are very socialable and do not rush you. It can be quite crowded when an event is being help. This could be the place for a blind date if you are single and ready to mingle.
