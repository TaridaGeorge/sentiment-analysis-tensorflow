My husband and I drove from LA to Scottsdale and almost to Scottsdale, one of our tires was going flat.  We went to Discount Tire on Shea and they checked it and found it was a cracked wheel (the tires are new).  They helped us get a new tire shipped from the east coast and put it on first thing the next morning.  They were nice, helpful, honest and affordable.  Absolutely great service!  I highly recommend them.
