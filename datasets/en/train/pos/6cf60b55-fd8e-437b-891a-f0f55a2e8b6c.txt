Well, my report may be a bit biased since I am staying here for work so thus don't have to pay for it directly, but the staff here is really amazing.  They are attentive, helpful and do a great job staying on top of everything.

I used the free fitness center and took a few yoga classes there and realized there's a squash, raquetball court, sauna, steamroom and swiss showers (whatever those are).  Drinks are a bit pricey but nothing that you wouldn't expect at a high end resort.
