Had lunch and enjoyed the Drunken Noodles with chicken!  Thai Hot is very good, but the dish has excellent flavor even if you don't kick up the heat!  The Thai Hot was just enough heat to almost cause sweat on the brow.  Very pleasant and nice service, and the coconut ice cream desert with banana was awesome!  Palees is definitely going to be a regular stop for dining out!
