Fabuloso.  This is my kind of place.  I love everything from the great candle smell when you walk in to all of the knickknacks that you want, but don't really need.  

There was really cool note cards that made me wish I sent more thank you cards so I could justify the purchase, but who knows, maybe I'll find a use for them yet.  One of my favorite items was a book of shopping lists that had been found and bound into a clever, entertaining read (with organized chapters!).  The slang flashcards had me laughing along with many other great novelty items.  There are also fun vases, books, and all sorts of random gifty items.  I enjoyed my short time going through the mish-mash of inventory and I hope you do the same.  I will definitely be back and leave with a purchase next time.
