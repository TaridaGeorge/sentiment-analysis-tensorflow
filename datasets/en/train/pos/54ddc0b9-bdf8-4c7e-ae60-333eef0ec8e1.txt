I've been using mineral makeup for a couple years now and Bare Escentuals is the best in my experience. You can order their stuff online as well and it's free shipping after a certain amount, but I like being able to ask questions and compare things side by side before I buy, and the salesgirls are always really helpful with that. Once I find a product I'm loyal to, then I do the online thing. This stuff just feels much better on your skin and doesn't clog your pores. It seems like an initially pricey investment when you're first getting started, but mineral make-up keeps much better and I can use less of it to achieve the effects I want.
