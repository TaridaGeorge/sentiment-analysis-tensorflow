I was amazingly lucky enough to find this studio through Living Social. Kim is an amazing instructor in all the different classes she teaches, she makes sure you learn all the moves correctly and pushes you to go to the next level. My mind and body have definetley felt the difference because of Kim and her amazing studio!!! When you go make sure you take a Barre class, it will kick your butt!!
