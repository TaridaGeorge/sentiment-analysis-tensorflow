i love this place.  just moved here from san francisco and being hot and dazed and confused, we walked from our new neighborhood and had the orangeade..so generous and refreshing.

the calcutta tortilla omelette can i say MMMMMMM; fresh tasty with the salted tomato.

croque monsier of course my husband ordered...managed to sneak a bite of it god it was yummy:_) 

better than most sfo restaurants and without attitude.  you  must visit this place.

server was so friendly too.
