Avid yogi - I plan to get buried in my Lu Lu garb!

A little vain perhaps, but I love that I can coordinate a whole ensemble, and feel stylish, yet comfortable and practical whether it be in class, or out and about doing chores on a Sunday afternoon. Luon, their in-house fabric washes like a dream and fits like a second skin.  The whole brand culture is great - with class suggestions, teacher endorsements etc. 

We all identify with brands... and I put this one right up there next to 'Apple' for its functional usability and desirability!

Nothing compares. Period.
