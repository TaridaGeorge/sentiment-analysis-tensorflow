I went here for lunch and it was YUMMY!  I had the Pumpkin Bisque soup to start and then the Combinacion de Favoritas.  Wow!  The flavors and spices were just a perfect blend of sweet and spicy.  The portion size was large, I was very full and still had some left to go.  I will definitely be coming here again.  There are lots of tasty sounding dishes on the menu.
