I love, love, love their Chicken Walnut sandwiches, they are so delicious....Not to mention their cookies as well,with each order you get a chocolate cookie..... If this isn't enough you have the option to buy a dozen and now as well can buy nibbler's if you do not want such a large cookie or for the little one's that you don't want to have sugar high as well.

We don't live in the area so every time we visit Arizona we make it a point to stop by and enjoy some Sandwiches.

Aside from Sandwiches, they have great salads/soups as well.  A  great get in and out location!
