This place was excellent. I brought my elderly grandparents, who aren't big on greek, and they had a great time. The sergice was attentive, and thought was put into every dish. 

Most Greek/Mediterranean places tend to overflavor their food, I thought Eden balanced the flavor of their chicken brilliantly with just a compliment of nice spices. Their salads were fresh, and the falafel was cispy outside and fluffy inside. I would absolutely go back...and congratulations to the owner on opening a nice, quaint business.
