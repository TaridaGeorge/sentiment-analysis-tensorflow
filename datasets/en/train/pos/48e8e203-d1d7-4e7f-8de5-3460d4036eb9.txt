I have been going to this place for the last 15 years and it just gets better and better.  Contrary to a previous post, the salsa is great! Always fresh with the right kick!  The atmosphere is great; very relaxing and a lot of fun. The staff is always friendly and pleasant. My son lives on the pot stickers and my favorite is the Filet tacos!  Now, I am not from New Mexico, but I run into people all of the time around time who say this is as good as it gets!
