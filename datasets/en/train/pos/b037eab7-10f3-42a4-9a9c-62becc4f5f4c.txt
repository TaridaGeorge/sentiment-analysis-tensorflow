OK this is a pizza place and a welcome addition to the North North Scottsdale culinary scene. 
The salads are huge.... and tasty - perfectly dressed.
The pizzas are terrific - the Gem and the Sargent are great. We tried the Gepetto the first time we were here...normally, I'm not a fan of white pizza, but it was excellent.
Servers are a bit funky...the first night we were here, our server (who also works at X-Tapa Joes) was awesome. Last night, our server was just a little odd...but I couldn't fault the timely service and attention.
Overall, a stellar experience....
Note that they only take reservations if your party has more than 6 in it.
