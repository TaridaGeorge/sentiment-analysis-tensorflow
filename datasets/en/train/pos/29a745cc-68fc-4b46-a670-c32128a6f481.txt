I was a bit skeptical that P and B would be able to wash, deep condition, and blow dry my hair in an hour (it takes me two hours to blow dry my thick, long, curly hair!) Shannon did my hair: she was all business. Not much small talk, but thays ok because I enjoy having the quiet time and often find small talk forced. I have to admit I doubted her, but section by section, she gave me a gorgeous blow out, with some curl at the ends (as I dont like it pin straight). Not only that, she finished with it all in an hour. I cant say enough how many stylists leave my hair frizzy and still wet, so suffice it to say that I was blown away, and will recommend Shannon to all my thick/curly-haired friends!
