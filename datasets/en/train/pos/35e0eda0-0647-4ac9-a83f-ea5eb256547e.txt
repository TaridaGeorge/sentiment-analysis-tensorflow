I think this is my favorite bar in Phoenix...not that I go out nearly as much as I used to in my college days, or that I've tried most of the bars here...but I found a place I like and I see no reason not to go back.

We went on a Saturday, which was on the quieter side at first but ended up pretty busy.  They had a cool local band playing (Sonorous) which really worked well in the space.  

The bartender last night was very friendly.  They have cheap PBR, tons of beer, and a decent wine list.

This place makes for a chill night.
