A hidden treasure up on Pinnacle Peak & Pima!  The pizza is quite possibly the best in town.  It is cooked to perfection with lots of cheese & ample toppings.  If your not in the mood for pizza, their sandwiches are excellent as well.  Also, the staff is always friendly.  I'm not sure why Paul didn't like it.  Everybody I've talked to loves the pizza, & I've often heard comments like it's better than other pizza places in the area (like Rosati's & Barro's), which I have to agree.
