This place is WONDERFUL! It makes you forget you are in an airport. I know it is modeled after to a local Scottsdale restaurant, Culinary Dropout. Barfly blows Culinary Dropout out of the water! The service is a hundred times better and the management was so friendly and inviting. I could not believe how fresh the food tasted! HMS Host I believe is the owner and they got a home run with this one. I will be there every time I fly.
