Honestly the best Chinese food in AZ. Ive been to a lot of Chinese restaurants throughout the East valley and this place is the best by far! Everything I've had on the menu has been great. I used to go to Iron chef twice a week back when I had classes at ASU's Polytechnic campus because it was that good!! Never once have had a bad meal or experience. The owners are awesome and provide excellent customer service. They also have great lunch specials. I just wish it was closer since I live in Arcadia now and its quite the drive (though I've made the drive just for the food on several occasions). I wish they would open a location near ASU's main campus because I know it would be a great success! Especially since there is a lack of options for Chinese food in Tempe.
