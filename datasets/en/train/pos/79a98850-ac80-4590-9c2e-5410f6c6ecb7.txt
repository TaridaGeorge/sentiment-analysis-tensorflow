All the food here is wonderful. Tastes amazing! I went with my best friend and we split everything. I went there December 5, 2010 and we had:

Japanese Chips - A very yummy snack made with fingerling potatoes.

Ebi Salad - Very refreshing! I could eat this for lunch everyday.

Duck Breast Salad - I have never been a huge duck fan, but oh my god, this duck tasted like steak. Its amazing!!

Okonomiyaki - Very good and filling. The japanese mayo is great too!

Shiromi Carpaccio - This dish was excellent! Make sure to get extra bread, because the oil and seasonings are so amazing. You will want to savor every bite!

and for my drink, you must try the Devils Haircut! I could have drank quite a few of these! I cant wait to go back on my next Arizona trip!
