We went here for a late morning meal on Saturday. I am in love.

I had the caprices sandwich with the sweet potato fries on the side. Tasty sweet potato fries are the way to my heart and Maizie's did an awesome job with them. My sister and mom had the omelette and french toast and also had good things to report.

The setup was great, it's a little small, but I didn't feel like the tables were crammed together. Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. 

My sister tells me they have great drinks so I will be returning in the evening hours to give them a try for sure.
