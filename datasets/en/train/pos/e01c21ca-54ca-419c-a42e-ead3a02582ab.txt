Great Beer, Good Food.  Excellent atmosphere.  Service and staff always very good & friendly.  Sometimes loud in the 'garage' but that's because there's a big crowd and everyone's having a great time!

I've been coming here for, what, 13 years?  Since just after they opened up.  In the old days you could sit outside and had to have food delivered because they didn't have a kitchen.  Now Four Peaks does a great job with food as well as beer.  They're always happy to accommodate special orders  from the menu.
