I had a caviar and pearl facial by Pevonia, (my favorite skin care line) at Essential Touch Wellness Center in the Scottsdale Healthcare Shea Hospital, it was awesome. I have had one before at the Desert Ridge Marriott that was not that great and the Price was $50 more than Essential Touch ($100). I am so excited I have found this awesome diamond in the rough.
