Read some bad reviews, infeel i should tell my experience. I too bought a deal, and have had excellent service! Of course they are going to book up, their deals are ridiculous cheap. What I priced elsewhere at $1800 I'm
getting for $200. The staff are super friendly, helpful, and knowledgable. I found out the owner is somewhat of an expert in the dermatology field, and teaches aroun the world. The office is spotless and modern. My laser hair removal was virtually painless with the newer laser technology. I highly recommend Alli..
