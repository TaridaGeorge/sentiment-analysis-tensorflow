We just did a balloon ride for 2 in the Arizona Star and it was a great time!

It was well worth it to be in a smaller balloon and basket with just the two of us plus the pilot rather than a large basket with 10-12 riders. It's also fun to be in the only balloon that has the Arizona State flag on it.

This company is owner-operated, which really makes a difference in their knowledge and engagement to make your experience wonderful.

I would highly recommend balloon rides with Arizona Hot Air Balloons, it was a great experience!
