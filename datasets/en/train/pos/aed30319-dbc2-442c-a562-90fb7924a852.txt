I LOVE THIS PLACE. I have been going here for years and the atmosphere is amazing and still not as great as the super fresh food. It's gotten a little crazy since the Food Network show (I was there the day after not realizing; and the line was INSANE) but it doesn't dissuade me. Especially when you can take a walk down the path after and burn off a few calories and scope out the farm itself.
