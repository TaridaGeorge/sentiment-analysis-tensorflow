Great Sushi! Good Happy Hour prices on food and drinks!

This place is great!  I have no idea why everyone crowds to Kona down the way, when this place is less crowded, has good food and the services has always been good. Also it is cheaper and has a better offering of sushi.

I would definitely go again!
