What a cool little shop. My colleague wanted to go here so I tagged along and am glad I did. I tried the Dutch coke - $1.99 for 8oz with real cane sugar and no preservatives! I don't even want to drink regular coke again. I also tried a lemonade that was recommended by the very helpful staff. I think I'm going to have to come back here and try everything, diet-be-damned.
