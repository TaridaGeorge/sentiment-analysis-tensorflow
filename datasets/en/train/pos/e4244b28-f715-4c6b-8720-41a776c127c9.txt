Mastro's Ocean Club is Elegance at it's best. The ambiance is an experience on it's own. When is the last time you sat down and the host unfolded the black or white linen (which ever one you prefer) onto your lap? As you open the menu, the choices begin. Steak or fish? The Ocean club has the best of both worlds. Fish flown in daily and steaks that are cut so tender and prepared to the perfect temperature. It doesn't matter which entree you select because it's not possible to make a "bad choice." the sides that compliment could easily be mistaken for an entree also. They are huge portions and absolutely outstanding! For dessert, dive into the warm butter cake and good luck getting out! The music is great and lively also. All in all, debatable the hottest place to be in arizona.
