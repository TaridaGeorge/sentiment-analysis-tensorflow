I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I'm eating my chinese leftovers from last night as I write this... For a traditional chinese delivery place, I think this is about as good as it gets in Phoenix. They deliver quickly and the food is always delicious. Things that I've tried that I like include the Kung Pao Chicken, Chicken with Cashew Nuts (Kung Pao is better though) and the Sesame Chicken. I'd recommend getting the combo platter that comes with fried rice and an egg roll (I substitute and get a spring roll in its place - they're really good). Very reasonable prices, most meals are around $7-$8. Give them a shot!
