Ummm... Drive-Thru boba? How can this be a BAD thing? Well, it just so happens that it CAN'T! Thai Iced Tea, Taro, and Honeydew too! This place is the BEST! The lady who runs the counter is VERY nice and the donuts are delicious! Stopped in for a Honeydew melon boba and a ham and cheese croissant and my kids spent the next hour munching quietly on donut holes, which was just a reward in itself! The prices are cheap, the service is friendly, and I will take BoSa over Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts ANY day of the week! Also an FYI, ignore the BoSa website - this location does NOT serve kolache's and they have their own hours which I believe are 5am-10pm every day!
