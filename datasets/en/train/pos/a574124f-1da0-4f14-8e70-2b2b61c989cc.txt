Fresh toasted subs from the heavens, a fresh alternate to all those bland commercial sub shops.   Good food and friendly service is what you will find here.  Afgani sandwich is hard to beat, but everything is good.  Not to mention they have kool-aid on tap.  Originality and flavor make this place a must. Cool joint.
