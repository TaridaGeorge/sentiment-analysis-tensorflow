Great place to have a drink and watch a movie, so much better then going to a regular theater.  Why spend the same price you would for over priced popcorn and a coke... instead just get a couple beers.  I much prefer this place, then your traditional theater.  My only complaint is that I wish they had more of a movie selection, either way still a cool place to see a flick.
