Mexican produce at this store is top notch!  A+...Woohoo.  Great pepper selection.  VERY Reasonable prices.  We get Kale from here all the time and it is superb.

Sadly...This store has now closed and is yet another huge empty retail and eye sore in Phoenix.  The owner of the plaza apparently wants exorbitant rents based on the number of shops in that same plaza that have closed.
