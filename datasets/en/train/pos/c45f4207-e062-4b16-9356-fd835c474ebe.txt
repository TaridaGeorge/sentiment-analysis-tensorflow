Coffee, music, and buur...

I dig this joint!  It's like walking into a brew house with some random people hanging out.  Live music and freshly made coffee.  I have to say one of the best coffees I had in a long time.  I'm no coffee snob by any means, but shazam! This coffee hit the spot and punched me in the face "in a good way -- if there's such a thing as getting punched in the face, but enjoying it....", and woke my senses up! 

What else is cool and I dig about Cartel is you can order alcoholic beverages.  Coffee and Beer -- Aside from water, my two most sought after and preferred drinks!  Cartel is like my kryptonite - I must succumb to your bidding....must be strong and ahhhh...more more coffee, more more, pleasssse! - Enjoy!
