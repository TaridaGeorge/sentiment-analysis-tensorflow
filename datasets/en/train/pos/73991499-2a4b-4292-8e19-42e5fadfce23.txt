Our neighbors found signs of termites. They suggested we check our home. Sure enough, termites. We all went to the Bug & Weed Mart  and the staff was EXTREMELY helpful. Jim talked us through exactly how to treat each property for termites; he explained and drew it out. The cost for each home was about $160, significantly less than the $750+ an extermination company proposed. Research showed exterminators dilute solutions significantly more than recommended, rendering treatment ineffective. It took a day of work, but we teamed up and did the work and together spent $320 instead of $1500+. It is now 8 months later and no signs of termites. We are confident treatment will last at least the 10 years Jim told us. We highly recommend Bug & Weed Mart; they truly are informed, knowledgeable and EXPERTS!
