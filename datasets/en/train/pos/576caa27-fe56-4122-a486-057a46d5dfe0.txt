Wonder where the  guys hang out at lunch?  Looking for manly men who still eat meat?  THIS is a real BBQ shack, no namby-pamby dishes served!

Fish sandwich outstanding, great tartar sauce!  The Reuben with the blue cheese slaw on top Fabulous.  Tortilla soup, just spicy enough to show it has personality!  Salads - the JR sizes are just right for lunch.  

I have never had anything from the menu I didn't LIKE or LOVE.  Service is excellent.  The Iced Tea (prickly pear) is most excellent & refreshing.

Go Here. Go Now.  Go Often!  Support your local biz or you will be stuck with corporate chain food with no one to blame but yourself!
