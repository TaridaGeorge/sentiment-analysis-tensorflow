The 5 stars is for Tony, the owner. He is the only one I will let touch me with ink. He did my first tattoo 2 years ago and since then, I have gotten 4 others. My boyfriend and I have referred our friends here too and they love Tony and his incredible talent. I'm sure the other artists are great,  but Tony is devoid of that cocky, rude attitude that you find in other parlors.
