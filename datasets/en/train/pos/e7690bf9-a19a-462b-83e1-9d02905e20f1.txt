I have been a semi-regular at the Acacia Cafe for over a year now. I first found this local place from a New Times ad. I like to eat breakfast later in the morning/early afternoon, and the Acacia Cafe is one of the few non-chain places in the Arcadia/Biltmore area that serves breakfast after 11 AM.

The food is very good and fresh. Everything is made there including the bread, which is one of the highlights. The Eggs My Way is a great deal and very filling. I have recently grown to like the waffles as well.

The wait staff is very friendly, and they get to know your name.

The restaurant can fill up quickly, so sometimes it can be a challenge to find a seat. If you go late morning or after noon, it shouldn't be a problem.
