I saw this resaurant when I went to the discout movie theater.  Since I like Thai food I had to try it.  Very glad I did.  Really good food - full of flavor.  The special seafood dish was full of fresh seafood and had a sauce with lots of citrus notes.  The people running this are very friendly.  I got medium heat with some trepidation since I can not eat extemely hot food.  It was just right, spicy but not burning hot.  If you like your food really hot I would get hotter.
