I've been volunteering for the VPA and the APS Shade Tree Program two times. This was my first approach to them. In the middle of it I got to find out other things they do and how they are encouraging networking among neighborhoods. They have good and experienced speakers for their classes and through their website you can find solutions to your garden or START your own production of greens.
