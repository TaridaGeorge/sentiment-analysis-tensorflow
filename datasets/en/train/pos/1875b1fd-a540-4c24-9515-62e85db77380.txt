God this place is good.  Stepping into their dinning room is like being with friends.  It's quaint and comfortable and the servers are always friendly.  As for the food, it is equally as enjoyable.  The mac n cheese is to die for and the fish n chips is the best I've had in the valley.  Their homemade tartar sauce is what really sets them apart. 

It's a little tucked away, but quite the gem.
