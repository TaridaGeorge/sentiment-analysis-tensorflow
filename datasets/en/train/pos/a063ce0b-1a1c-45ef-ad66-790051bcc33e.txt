Such a beautiful resort! My parents stayed here over the weekend so we popped over a few times to visit them & check it out. The staff were friendly & very helpful when we had any questions. The rooms are beautiful & pretty spacious. The bathroom is stocked with great products from their spa.

The pool isn't large like other resorts in the area, but it's extremely relaxing & peaceful.

Thanks to my parents, we'll be back to try T. Cook's restaurant soon!
