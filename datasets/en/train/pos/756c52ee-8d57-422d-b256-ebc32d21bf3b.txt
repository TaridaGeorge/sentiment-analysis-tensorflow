How refreshing to read a specialty sushi roll menu and see something different!! YUM...by far the best sushi and most unique menu I've seen in a while, and so mush less pretentious and more affordable then all the other Old Town Sushi restuarants.  From first glance, you wouldn't think so but after having a great conversation with my waitress and reading the total line on my tab...I was hooked! Oh, and the best tempura ever (i'm not even a tempura fan!!) And the curried lobster spring rolls were so tasty.
