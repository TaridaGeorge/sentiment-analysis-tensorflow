My friend and I came here for her 50th birthday to get our hair and make up done and we couldn't have been more thrilled with the results! Marlene and Kasey were absolutely brilliant and they worked wonders with our hair. We told them what we were looking to have any they did it better than we could have even imagined. Unfortunately, I'm not from Scottsdale but if I was, these girls would be my preferred stylists! Thank you so much, Kasey and Marlene!
