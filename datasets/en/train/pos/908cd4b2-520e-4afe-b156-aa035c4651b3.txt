New tour schedule starts May 19 and will be closed for tours until then. Saturdays only and gates open at 8:00 am with tour starting at 8:30 which is when the gate closes.   After the tour starts the gate is closed. The gate re-opens at the end of tours for about 10 minutes and an info box is at the gate with flyers. The reason for a shorter schedule is no snow birds and hottt weather, bring water and keep hydrated.
