Great place! I LOVE the atmosphere at this place.  Decorated very cute, cozy, and unique.  Not "just another" frozen yogurt place.  The service was excellent, even though I know at that particular time, she had to have been bored out of her mind. I was impressed by the employee. I immediately fell in love with the red velvet flavor, YUM! Good selection on toppings too. The frozen yogurt flavors were ever so slightly lacking in variety in my opinion, but not enough to take it down to a 4 star level, because thats just a preference thing on my part.  Go support this place!
