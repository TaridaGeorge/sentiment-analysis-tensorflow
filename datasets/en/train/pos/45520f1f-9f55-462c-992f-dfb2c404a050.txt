Hey just want to say thanks to mark the general manager. I had my sons birthday party last weekend and he was great help. Had us taken care of all the way even though there was like 7 other parties going on at the same time. The staff was great and helpful working really hard to keep things clean. I think sometimes we focus too much and the out side appearance but I was able to see these guys were working hard and still made themselves available to anything I needed and made it easy to have an awesome time with my family and friends to celebrate my sons 3rd birthday so just wanted to say thank you.
