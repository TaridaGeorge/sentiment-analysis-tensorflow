Had a great dinner at Stingray last weekend, 3 great rolls!  This was our first visit, as we have been wanting to try it for awhile now.  Had a Japanga roll, a summertime roll in soy paper and can not remember the name of the other.  Fun, contemporary environment that you can actually have a conversation with your lovely date and hear them.

Will definitely visit again, and try the Oldtown Scottsdale location!
