we have dined in / night capped at Armitage 3 or 4 times during the 2 or 3 months we have owned a home in DC Ranch and have yet to be disappointed. As pointed out the wine list is solid , ( not stellar), and the ambiance , food , decor and service have been above expectation ( Nates attention over lunch was above and beyond) . 

The patio is comfortable and well flowered but i considered taking a star away to reflect the knuckleheads and their loud Italian sports cars rollin up and down the adjacent promenade -( i decided not to as it is hard to fault the restaurant for the sins of the neighbors) 

all in all a good to great bet for any occasion out.
