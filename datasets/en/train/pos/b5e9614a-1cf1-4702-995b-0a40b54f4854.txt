If you are looking for great food and a fun atmosphere I definitely recommend this place. I have visited this location many times and although I have always ordered the same thing (Jambalaya) I have a great dining experience each time, as the food is always excellent and the service is terrific. The food items are little more pricey but well worth it. To be honest I was a little bummed that they changed the Mud Pie dessert but not enough to altar my rating as I still get excited every time I visit.
