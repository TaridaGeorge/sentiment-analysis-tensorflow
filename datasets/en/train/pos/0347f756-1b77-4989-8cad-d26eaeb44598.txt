Let me tell you about a great experience I had at Kierland Golf.   Yes, the course is beautiful and so well maintained, but I had a free afternoon, but not enough time for a round of golf, and instead of the usual resort spa experience like a massage, I decided to see the golf pro for a lesson.

In one hour, the pro with the aid an I Pad app,  was able to set me on a path to correct a serious swing flaw that I knew had to be present but I couldn't detect on my own.  He gave me two great and easy drills to get me hitting the ball straighter and longer.

So, if you visit the Kierland, be sure to get some great instruction from Heath.

Now I need to practice :-)
