We left another Red Robin location after being treated like dirt & came over to this one. We weren't griping necessarily, just commenting to the server about our experience, and he had the GM & manager come over & talk to us. The food was great, as always, and then they took $20 off our bill just for the inconvenience that the other location had caused us. Great staff, great food, and high on our list of places to eat. We will be back!
