This is one my favorite coffee shops and since finding this place, I seldom go to starbucks anymore. The staff is super nice, they even bring you the drink to your table and it feels more like a family run friendly place than an assembly line setup of the typical starbucks, and what I really like too is their super fast and free internet.

The owner Steve is also a super nice guy and always is on top of things. If you're looking for cool place to have awesome coffee, this is the place to visit.
