Exceptional food and service.

Took my in-laws to Christopher's to celebrate a retirement and had an even better experience the second visit.  The food was perfectly prepared, top quality, and tasted superb. 

Josh was our server and managed our experience perfectly-- courses landed together, drinks never emptied, he was great with our 4 year-old, and was intimately knowledgeable about the preparation of the options.  Couldn't ask for a better dinner.

Only odd thing is that this restaurant is in a high-end strip mall and splits with a small bar.  Not bad things, necessarily.  Just not things one sees often.  Then again... ZinBurger is also in that mall.
