My husband (English) and I took my parents (19-year Phoenix veterans) on this tour this past weekend. It's not easy to find something all four of us enjoy, but we all had a great time! The food was plentiful, the walks were reasonable, and Jessica and Jay were fantastic to work with. We are definitely going to add culinary tours to our vacation agendas from now on.
Thanks for a wonderful time!
