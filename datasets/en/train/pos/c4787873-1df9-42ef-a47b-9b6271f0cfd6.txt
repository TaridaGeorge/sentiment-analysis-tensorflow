Yes, Yes, Yes! I am so happy that we found this place. The yogurt here is fantastic, the toppings are great, the price is right and the decor is wonderful. One of the problems of frozen yogurt shops is the vibe. I actually feel like an adult in this place. It has a coffee house feeling and it is right next door to Hulas, which makes it easy to pop in after delicious food. 

Yum!
