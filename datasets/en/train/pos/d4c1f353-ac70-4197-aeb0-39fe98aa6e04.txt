Love the blueberries and fruit from here....we bought about 10 bottles of wine also, somehow we got hung up in the wine section...I love the Salsa here, very chunky and I always get my dogs Lamb and Rice here too. he loves that food and chomps it up...and if you havent tried the Mickey Mouse Chicken Nuggets in the frozen section...you are missing out big time...the seafood ravioli is great and we also got the smoked pulled bbq pork, pre cooked...heats up great in the microwave and their bbq sauce...2 huge jugs for like 8.00 is very tasty too. we also buy the mozarella chese in the water...very good for caprese salads
