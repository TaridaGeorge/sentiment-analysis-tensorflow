I've had a massage and a pedicure here, both of which were great. Prices are a bit high for regular visits (used a new member discount), but if you're willing to pay over $30 for a pedicure, it may be worth it. Pedicure area has 1 chair and the technician is not full time, so although the experience is a private and quiet one, you'll definitely want to call ahead of time and schedule an appointment. Very serene and relaxing environment (you forget you're in the middle of a large gym), and the staff is very friendly and attentive.
