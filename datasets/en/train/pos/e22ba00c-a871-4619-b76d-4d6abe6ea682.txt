Even though the shop is buried in a small industrial center, you will find AZ Auto Care well worth the hunt.  Finding an honest mechanical shop is no mean feat, but since my first visit (on the recommendation of a reconditioning manager) in 2010, I've been servicing 3 vehicles (2 BMW, 1 Land Rover) with Jeff and his team.  Good mechanics (I've spent some time on the shop floor), fair pricing, honest and accurate diagnosis, and outstanding service from Greg make this my favorite and only shop of choice in Phoenix.  The lobby aesthetics won't impress you (no feng shui here), but you will feel great doing business here.
