this place is a breath of fresh air in Laveen - finally we have a legitimate SALON. not just for hair either, they do hair color consultations that complement your skin tone, & other services for skin/waxing etc. But, the best part are the cuts & the staff. I have not had a bad cut. Actually I came here because I had a bad cut somewhere else & Tracy fixed it. She is the best. She has TONS of experience, is hilarious & entertains throughout the cut & tells you how you will look the best, with your shape of face & your goals. I finally feel like I can just wash & go or with minimal effort have great looking hair.
