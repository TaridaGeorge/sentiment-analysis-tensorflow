OK- 1st off; If you really want to have the "Eddie House" experience you'll have to get a group of 'Foodies and get reservations at the "Kitchen Bar". (At least I think that is what it is called) The bar sits 6 people and is right in fount of the kitchen..Where Eddie prepares a multi-course meal..incredible! A Mushroom Bisque soup, Spicy greens salad w/ the thinnest sliced scallops ever. Seared Ahi,  the best mashed taters ever!
Oh yea.. if a cook offers to feed you, don't reach for the spoon! You just have to trust the cook! Be fair warned- you paying for front-row service and a show! BUT well worth it!
