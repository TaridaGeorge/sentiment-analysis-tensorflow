The office eats here for lunch once a week.  The lunch speicals gets you out of the place for $10 or less.  They have some Thai dishes too which adds to the variety.  The meals are tasty and  large and we waddle out and usally need a nap when we get back to work.  The folks are friendy so we cant help but come back over and over and over agian.
