This place deserves a fiver.. Went with a buddy to try it out and both of us landed slam dunks with his ahi tuna sandwich with onion rings and drink (bit expensive at around $20) and my '4B' burger (with fontina instead of bleu) with sweet potato fries (around $12).. Have to mention that although my burger was great, I had a bite of the tuna and know I am getting that next time!
