Typically, I'm a bit weary and critical of places with an average of only three stars, but we tried this place with family on a Monday morning for breakfast during a recent vacation to Phoenix.  If you find yourself in the area, it is well worth the scenic drive out to Lake Sagurao.  The food was great, but the view was spectacular!

As I mentioned, we had breakfast. I had the corn beef hash.  It was made from scratch, big portions and very hearty.  The bacon was prepared perfectly as well. Don't expect a gourmet breakfast, but be ready to eat some great, home-cooked food.  I recommend eating on the outside patio overlooking the lake.  You won't be disappointed!
