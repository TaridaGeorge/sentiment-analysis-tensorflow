This place is a true gem in Phoenix! Easily a top restaurant in the valley. We had the fresh guacamole made table side, the enchiladas suizas and the carne asada and pork tacos. We all kept looking at each other with amazement by how good everything was tasting. The place is small and quaint, but the ambience is so nice. They don't take reservations, so you may have to wait. But it's so worth it! Will definitely be back!
