My wife and I have been driving all the way from Litchfield Park and West Peoria for several years going to this restaurant.  We have never had a bad experience and we are absolutely in love with their weekend buffet.  The naan is fantastic and my personal favorite dish is the Palak Aloo.  Who knew spinach could be so good??
