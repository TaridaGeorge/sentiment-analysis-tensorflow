So, I am sorta new to Indian food.  I was introduced to it last year by my Indian coworkers and I am hooked.  This place is by far my favorite.  I liked it from my first visit, the waiter was helpful, knowledgeable and put up with my indecisiveness.  

I have liked everything that I've tried here and I've tried a lot. I usually go with my Indian friends and therefore get to try new things that I might not have ordered for myself.  My personal favorites are the Chicken Korma, Chicken Tikka Masala, and some sort of shrimp dish that I don't remember the name of at the moment.  

They usually have a belly dancer on the weekend which is always fun to watch.
