Poverty Pets is an exceptional organization. I adopted a great doggie from them. They do spay and neuter clinics for free, unlike any other animal shelter. They will care for sick animals and get them healthy and adoptable. The Human Society will take a sick animal and put it down, instead of investing time and money to get it healthy and ready to adopt to a loving family. They are the only shelter that catches and treats the animals. Most shelters finds an animal and then calls the Human Society. The Human Society Will pick up the animal, and then the shelter will go get the animal and the shelter gets a $150 fee towards care and feeding for the animal. Poverty Pets does not do that. They will find a pet and treat it ASAP. They are exceptional people and have great dogs that needs homes!!!!!
