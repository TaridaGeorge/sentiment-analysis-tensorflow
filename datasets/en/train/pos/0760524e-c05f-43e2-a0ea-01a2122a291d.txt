Stayed there over the weekend and my wife and I had a great time.  

The rooms were immaculate. When we travel we just like to hang out, relax and enjoy the pool and the service. The Pool was very nice, the food was excellent. 

By far the best food at a hotel I have tasted. The Breakfast Buffet rocks! The lunch was way better then the dinner we had at West Gate right across the way. 

This place is a hidden secret as far as food goes that is for sure. This place should be rated a 5 Star Hotel.... The way they treat people there is wonderful!...  The spa treatment was off the hook my wife said!
