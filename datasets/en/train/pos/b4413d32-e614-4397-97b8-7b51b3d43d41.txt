A hidden gem! Tried this place for the first time and ate their vegan cupcake (I'm a vegan)-was so impressed! I'm definitely coming back to try their chai latte.. and hopefully in the near future, they will have a vegan option on their breakfast and lunch menu because it is so close to where I live!
