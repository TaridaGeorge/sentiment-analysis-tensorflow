I love the food at this Old Chicago! I have never had cold food, unless I order one of the many fabulous salads. It is a fun place to watch a game and have dinner/drinks.For lunch, it is great to sit at the bar, Amanda the bartender is quick and very friendly.
I suggest if you had a bad experience to give the Mesa, Old Chicago, another chance.
