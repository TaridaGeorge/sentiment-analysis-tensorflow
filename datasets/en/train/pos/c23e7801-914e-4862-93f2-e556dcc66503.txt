My mom thinks I come to see her in Arizona because I want to come and see her. What she doesn't understand is I just come for the In-N-Out.

Ok, so that may not be totally true, but it's part true. My first taste of In-N-Out was in San Fran. Now, my only taste comes when I visit for the holidays. A forever yearning that is satisfied but once a year. 

The animal fries beckon. Will you heed their call?

Why aren't you in Seattle?! WHYYYYYYYYYY
