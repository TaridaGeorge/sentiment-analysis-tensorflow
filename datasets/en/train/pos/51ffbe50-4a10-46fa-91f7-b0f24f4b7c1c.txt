What a wonderfully cute place this is, with a huge sparkling outdoor patio to the quaint cozy interior seating this place will continue to be a lunch hit in downtown Scottsdale.  We had a tasty selection as well, from a steamy hearty chicken tortilla soup to the large chicken club sandwich on focaccia bread.  This is a gem!
