The best sushi...the best sushi experience...the nicest interior design of any sushi restaurant I've ever been to. Roka rates in my Top 10 restaurants of all time. Right up there with CUT in Beverly Hills, Picasso in Las Vegas and Kai in AZ. It's hard to compare this place to any other Sushi restaurant because it would be like comparing a good Kobe Fillet to a regular fillet. Sure, they're both cows... but cummon. These guys get it right all the way around!
