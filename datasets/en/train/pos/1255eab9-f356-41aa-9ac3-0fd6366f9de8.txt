Steve runs his own business, and provides a wonderful personal level of service. The tour was on time, professionally conducted, informative, and fun.  Steve pointed out details about what to look for, history, geology, where to eat, etc. We were in Phoenix on business, had only one day available, and wanted to see the most of the Grand Canyon. We took the day tour which included a stop at Montezumas Castle. We saw a lot of different gorgeous views of the canyon with this tour and learned alot. Great value too. I will definitely book AZ Scenic Tours again.
