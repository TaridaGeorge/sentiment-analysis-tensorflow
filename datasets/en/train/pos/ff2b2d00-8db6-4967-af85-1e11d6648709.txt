Had the brisket and rib combo.  Brisket was tender and juicy, great flavor.  Ribs were awesome, pulled the bone out with no resistance.  Mac n cheese was good and gooey, as it should be.  Wife had the pulled pork sandwich, no complaints there either.  All around good experience for some good BBQ, definite return trip warranted when we're in Phoenix again.
