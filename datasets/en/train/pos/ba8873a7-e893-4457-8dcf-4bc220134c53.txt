Sunday omelette :)

A "MUST VISIT" if you're in Phoenix.  Food here is great and very healthy (then again, I eat a 3.99 bag of chips by myself every other day so my definition of 'healthy' may not be yours).

Portions here are very reasonable and it is enough to get you to that "good" feeling of satisfaction.  

Atmosphere has a mix of college students and older crowd.
