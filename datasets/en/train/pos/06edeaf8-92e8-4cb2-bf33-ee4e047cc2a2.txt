I love the cramped cluttered feeling of Shirts 'n' Things. Eh, where to start I love the belt buckles they keep in the case since I am a belt buckle person and they have some cool and beautiful belt buckles. Cool lighters, stickers, posters, gothic hair accessories, hats and even cute baby outfits with a metal or gothic twist. Huge music memorabilia selection to choose from whether it is shirts, posters, stickers, bags, patches, and hats. 

They have a great shoe selection from Demonia, creepers, and boots. Nice purses as well near the back of the store. There is way too much to look at in one shopping trip, just take your time and do one section at a time. Nice assortment of jewelry and altogether weird items. Right across the street from MCC, next to Cheba Hut and Subway.
