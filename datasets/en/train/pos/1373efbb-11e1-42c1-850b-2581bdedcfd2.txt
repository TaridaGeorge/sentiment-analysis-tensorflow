pros:
+food is amazing. grilled cheese with yellow tomatoes is the bomb diggity. mixed fries & aioli rock the house.
+decent vegetarian options! if you don't eat burgers, you aren't stuck ordering a mediocre salad. the grilled vegetable panini is fucking fantastic.
+open until 2:00 am ALL WEEK.
+papago orange blossom beer = yum
+pretty interior (blue center table, nice restrooms)

cons:
-pricey. would love to try the desserts, but $12 for a banana split? um, no.
