I am speechless that I have not written a review for this awesome place. It is one of my favorite places to eat in Arizona. You just can't go wrong with it. The service is great, I love the casual yet not too casual feel of the place, and I love the menu. I have been here for lunch and dinner and both times I have left with a happy full belly. I have tried their sandwiches, burgers, and pizzas. All were fantastic. I love their side sweet potato salad. Their desserts are the size of your head. I have a feeling the cinnamon bun is bigger actually. The prices are super reasonable for a quality and delicious meal. This is a must if you are in the area.
