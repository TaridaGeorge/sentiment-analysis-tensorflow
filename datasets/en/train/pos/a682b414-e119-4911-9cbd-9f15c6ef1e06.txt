I've only been here only once so my review might not be as accurate as it could be.

The mellow mushroom is a very delicious sandwhich/pizza place. When I went, I had the Avacado sandwhich on french and the italian sandwhich on pita. Both were delicious. I believe the pricing for sandwhiches is around 6 dollars for a half sandwhich and 10 for a whole sandwhich. The servings and quality are tops. I would go here for a nicer, casual lunch.

The menu also seems friendly for vegetarian as I noticed a lot of non-meat sandwhiches.
