One of my favorite lunch spots around Scottsdale.  Conveniently located at The Borgata Shops on Scottsdale Road (just south of Lincoln) and across from the Cottonwood Resort.  Ample parking.  Their old-fashioned cheeseburger with Tillamook cheddar cheese is perhaps my favorite sandwich in the valley.  The house or J Alexander salad is fresh and colorful with tasty crouton bites.  Their honey mustard dressing tastes homemade.  In addtion, either the mashed or shoestring potatoes are tasty, too.  Nice atmosphere and excellent servers.  Yes, it's a small chain mostly in the midwest, but this J. Alexander's has a unique feel and sense of style.
