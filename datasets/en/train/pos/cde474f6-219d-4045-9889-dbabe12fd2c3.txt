Who cares if its a chain?  As far as bang for your buck is concerned, Outback has always been good in my book.  It was a packed house when we got there, so we sat at the bar and Paige was our bartender and she was great.  She helped us get the table we wanted quickly and was very friendly.  Blake was our server and he was great as well.  Food was all very tasty.  Had bloomin onion, filet with wild mushroom sauce, and prime rib.  While the prime rib was a little tough in some places, it was still very good overall.  Good prices, good food.
