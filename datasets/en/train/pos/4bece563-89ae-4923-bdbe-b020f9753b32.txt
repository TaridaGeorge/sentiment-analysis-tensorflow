Food overall was good (Tofu soup, grilled meat, etc.).  There wasn't really any dish I could knock.  Serving size for lunch dishes was still pretty large.  The wait staff was pretty helpful in helping me pick something good that I've never had before.  Hell, I even think the water they serve there is bottled, not tap!
