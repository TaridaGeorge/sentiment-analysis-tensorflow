I haven't had a cupcake, cake, or pie for months. I have been at a few birthday parties recently and finally just had to have a cupcake. My problem is, I must have GLUTEN FREE.

I decided to go to my favorite place for cupcakes and try their gluten free cupcake. After so many months, as I expected it was to die for!!!!  The chocolate cake reminded me of my grandmother's recipe and the icing was light and creamy. One bite is an explosion of flavor in your mouth.

The only thing that could possibly make it better would be the chocolate ganache icing on top. 

If you are gluten-free, I wouldn't waste my time going elsewhere. This is simply THE BEST!!!

Note to staff: Is it possible to offer additional varieties?
