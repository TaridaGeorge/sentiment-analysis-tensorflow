I went there with my wife when we first moved here from Chicago . it is a great zoo.big enough to have a lot going on and small enough and it will not take you all day to see everything,  i liked that you could get up close with some of the animals. you can feed a giraffe, ride a camel, just  get real close to a lot of the animals. i totally suggest this place for couples and fa miles.
