White Rabbit Saturdays and the stand up comedy show before the music gets going is my favorite way to spend Saturday night. The drinks are a good deal (discounted beer and vodka...can't remember details but nothing I had was more than 5 dollars per drink) and the music after the comedy show is great. It's not your typical nightclub... so the place doesn't get sweaty or overcrowded. You can still hear the tunes from the bar if you aren't interested in dancing theres a place for you. There is a very nice patio in the front of the hotel with ample seating and myst system. It's like a perfect hybrid of nightclub/lounge/everyone-knows-your-name bar. Something for everyone.
