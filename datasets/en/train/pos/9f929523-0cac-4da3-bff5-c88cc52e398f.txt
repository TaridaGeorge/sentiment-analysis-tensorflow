I really like Durant's.  A couple of my best memories were made here.  I've had the coconut shrimp and also the crab; both were fantastic.   i've also gone there just for drinks, and i have to say that Durant's is probably the best place to sit down and talk over drinks with a friend.  It's like entering a different world.  It's just so cozy, with those low lights and plush red velvet.  I especially loved it because with the two of us at the bar, it felt like we were the only two people in the world.  The staff is so incredibly attentive, and the bartender is very jovial and friendly.
