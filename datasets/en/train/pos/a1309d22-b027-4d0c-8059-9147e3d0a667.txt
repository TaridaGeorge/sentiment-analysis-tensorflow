Picazzo's is a freaking miracle for gluten "allergies"!  

Almost everything there is gluten free, and you can get something besides gluten free pizza.  I highly recommend going during happy hour and just eating the starters - meatball sliders are awesome!

Pizza is very good as well.  More reasonably priced than a lot of the chain places that get their (really friggin' expensive) dough from somewhere else.  

People with celiacs:  rejoice.  Picazzo's is legendary.
