Remember that place "where everyone knows your name?" This is it. You can show up alone, with your love or with friends and if you are open to fun and new friends, you will find them here. The owners make sure that there is always a great roster of musicians. If you haven't heard Notes from Neptune, Kyle Phelan, Javier Garcia, Stephanie or Steve Krum, come on down. Sit on the patio, enjoy the beautiful fountain and sip  great glass of wine. Better yet, join the Wine Tasting Club and be sure to visit at least once a month. From pastas to gyros, to hummus, to salads and s'mores, you'll find a tasty and inexpensive meal -- and lots of reasons to smile and Just Enjoy Life!
