Now this is an awesome theatre. I would go to this theatre even if it were regular price. Growing up in lake havasu city, we never had nice theaters. This theatre is nicer than those in Lake Havasu and very nice for what it is. The wax statues are awesome too. My daughter loved seeing Batman that looked like batman. The price here is great and if you can wait for the movie to go to this theatre, I highly recommend. Very great experience!
