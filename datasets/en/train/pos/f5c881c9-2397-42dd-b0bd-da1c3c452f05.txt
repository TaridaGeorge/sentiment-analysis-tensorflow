Been here off and on but never for this long. I've been working here today for 5 hours so far because I was nearby when they opened. I had a drip coffee and loved it. So tasty and made cup by cup. Then a black mango tea that was the perfect aroma and need nothing. Later in the morning a friend came in and purchased a cappuccino. OMG it was the prettiest thing I've seen so I had to buy one. I have NEVER had a better one in my life. I am serious. Come here. Drink here. I love their iPad cash register & art. Late Sunday mornings the wifi gets a little clogged from the number of people but it's a cool joint. 

PS. I know Jeff M. had issues with their customer service but the two ladies working today rock.
