Mel is great. She's compassionate, and will take great care of your four-legged loves. I have a lab, so I'm not picky about her having a perfectly prissy cut, but I know she always has a ball when I take her here. There always seems to be poodles and malteses and labradoodles here, so I'm certain she specializes in fuzzy breeds. But needless to say, my dog and I always leave happy!
