Einstein's is Noah's Bagels in SF

They're the same!
Who knew!?

Anyways,
I like the manager of this location.  He's always so friendly and seems genuinely happy to be there and talkin' with his customers.

I am obsessed with the jalapeno salsa cream cheese.  I literally buy 3 tubs of it everytime I go there.

My favorite items include
Santa Fe bagel sandwich (jalapeno salsa cream cheese, turkey sausage, eggs, pepperjack cheese and salsa! YUM)
Pepperoni pizza bagel

AND.  They have Mr Pibb on tap.  I love Mr. Pibb.  Don't know why, I just do.
