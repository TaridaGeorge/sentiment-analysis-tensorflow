I'm going to go ahead and give this little place five stars because although it may seem overpriced for an 'order at the counter' place, the food quality is just as good as what you'd get at regular restaurant, just faster.

also, they have an entire menu of gluten-free items, or you can even say I'd like the Chicken Salad Spring Wrap gluten-free, and they know what you're talki ng about. Plus they have wine, and probably beer. AND i like their pad thai noodles and i even like the way they prepare their tofu, as george orwell would say, "double plus good."
