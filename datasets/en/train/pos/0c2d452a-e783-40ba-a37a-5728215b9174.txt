I found Tarbell's when doing my usual restaurant research before a business trip, and I have been back every time I'm in town, even twice in one trip in December.  Service, atmosphere, and of course the food are all excellent.  I made sure to sit in Josh's section when I ate here two consecutive nights, and he brought out my colleagues favorite NA beer from the previous evening - truly a great experience!  The seasonal Veggie Plate was delicious along with their house staple of Ribbon Pasta with Chicken-Fennel Sausage.  I make kale chips for myself every week, and I was curious to try a salad of raw, purple kale.  So glad I got it.  Fantastic!
