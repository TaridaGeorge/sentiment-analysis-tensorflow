Just had lunch at the Strand today.  We shared a chicken Parmesan pizza, and a pressed, fresh veggie sandwich.  We also had Cesar salad and minestrone soup.  Every thing was home made ad tasted great.   The staff was friendly, helpful and attentive to our needs.  Very unique / eclectic, comfortable decor.  Nice size portions and a very reasonable price.  

This is my new go to restaurant when I have meetings downtown.
