Wow,wow,wow! Everything is so tasty and  you leave there wanting to come back the next day.  A lot of vegetarian options. The dessert crepes are amazing - we had the caramel and apples. If I hadn't licked the plate of my appetizer and entree I would have opted for the chocolate fondue. Great flavor, friendly staff and AUTHENTIC. I'm tellin' ya - stop by Le Chalet, you'll LOVE it!
