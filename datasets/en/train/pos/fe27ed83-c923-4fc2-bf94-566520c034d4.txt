This place has the best burgers in town!  The best time to go is before ASU football games...it is packed though, be ready!  They have set up a second grill outside to help with the line.  Personally, ordering instead is worth the wait. 

One of the best things about this place is the bacon on their burgers.  Most places just throw a couple slices on the burger.  Not Chuck Box.  They have preformed pieces that are the shape of your burger.  This way, there is bacon in every bite.  YUM!  

Little known fact: they will add slices of green chile to your burger.  Just be aware they are actual slices, not chopped green chile so it will be slippery and add to the mess factor.

Be ready for the following things: cash only, parking sucks, and there may be a line (ESPECIALLY before games) so go early.
