Love me some light rail. Mattter of fact, Im' going ot change my name to Light Rail Larry. Not sure where the Larry came from but hey, it works. I am a frequent Light Rail user, since I live very close to a very central LR stop. I like to people watch, and what a grat place to do it on a weekend on the way downtown. I saw a guy in a prom dress on a BMX bike, that was cool. The light rail is now my go to travel method, since I don't drink and drive. I love being able to go get a few beers and not have to worry about it. It's safe, reliable and clean. Wish I could say that about all of my ex girlfriends.  Bing Bang Zoom!!!!
