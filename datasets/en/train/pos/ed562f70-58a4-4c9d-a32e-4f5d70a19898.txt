John is above, beyond, and by far the best realtor I have ever worked with!  He was there for me, and made absolute sure that I was getting the best deal possible in a situation that would work for me for many years to come.  He is sincere, honest, helpful, prompt, a negotiating genius, as well as a particularly perfect paper pusher.  He will make it happen for you only when you are ready for it.  Buying or selling, John is your best choice as he has an impressive contact base.  Do yourself a favor and contact him ASAP!!!!
