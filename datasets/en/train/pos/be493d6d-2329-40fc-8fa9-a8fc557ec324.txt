I love this place so much, it hurts. I've been going since it opened way back in the day when I was in high school living in Gilbert. This is not really a review, but more of a request to Joe, whom usually reads these posts. 

Keep the Hot Wings on the menu permanently! I got them once before after the 12Ks of Christmas in 2009 and again, last night. I heard on Twitter from BBQ delivery guy that Joe's was taking hot wing orders for the big game on Sunday and I was hoping they would be a special on the menu. So I had to stop by and hopefully get some wings, again.

These are officially my second favorite item on the menu, behind the ribs, but slightly above the pulled pork. Please, please, please put these on full time!
