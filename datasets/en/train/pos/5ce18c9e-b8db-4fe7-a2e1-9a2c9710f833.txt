Everyone here is yelping about the deli stuff. Okay, it's a deli and bakery - I get it. BUT what you gotta come here for is San Marzano tomatoes. Not those SM-like/style tomatoes that are actually grown in USA (yes they have those too) but the real deal, grown near the base of Mt. Vesuvius. Look for the DOP stamp (its like a region-control stamp on French wines).

Oh yeah, pick up some imported pasta in shapes you've never seen or some pizza dough and fresh basil (it's in the deli case by the meats) and make your own sauce. BAM!

Don't forget the Torrone (nougat candy) or some Italian Ice/Spumoni for dessert if you aren't a big pastry fan.
