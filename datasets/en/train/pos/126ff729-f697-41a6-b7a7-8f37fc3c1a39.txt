Amazing. I have been to this place quite a few times. I do have to say I favor the classics over some of the more experimental ones, but don't take that as an insult to the experimental ones; this girl just likes some meat and potatoes. The only pasty I didn't like that I've had was the Royale with Cheese. The cheese was very stinky and very potent. Maybe you like stinky and potent cheese, though, and maybe it's for you. Phenomenal place.
