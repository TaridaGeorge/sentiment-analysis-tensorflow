This place has excellent food and excellent beer.  If you are a craft beer lover like I am you will be pleasantly surprised, especially during happy hour.  They have at least 30 different craft beers on tap, including about 8 from Rogue.  They have several local brews as well, including Papago's Orange Blossom, and Sonoran's Inebriator.  During happy hour, most of the beers are half off.  You can get a pint for $3 and a 20 oz. for $3.50.  They have specialty pizzas and sandwiches.  There are some appetizers that are a little different than most other places.  The hummus is exquisite.  It's some of the best I have ever had, and during happy hour it's half off as well.  I just started going here maybe about 4 months ago, and I go a couple times a week.
