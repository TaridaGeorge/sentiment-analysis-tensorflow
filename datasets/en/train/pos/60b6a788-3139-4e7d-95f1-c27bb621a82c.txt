I was addicted to Sprinkles but had to check this place out since they won Cupcake Wars and now I am craving Ollie Cakes! The guy at the front (Dan) was very genuine, friendly, laid back and provided great customer service. The Orange Blossom was so delicious I practically inhaled it and had to get another one for the road! These cupcakes are priced just right and are absolutely delicious!
