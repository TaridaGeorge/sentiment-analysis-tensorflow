Dr. Farnsworth is the Jam.

I had my first ever eye exam, and she was kind enough to take good care of me. 

She did a complete, and thorough eye exam, and explained each test, and the importance of them.

After the exam, we determined, that I indeed needed glasses. At that point, my prescription was handed over to the very sweet optician who took care of me and let me try on about a dozen different frames before I found the winning pair.

I've sadly lost them in Vegas, but I will soon be back to buy my next pair so that I am not blind as a bat.

LOVE YOU GUYS!
