I have tried many other Pho restaurants in this area (I have tried TONS).. Pho Van is the only place that I would go back to.  It's not PERFECT by any means, but they have a great broth for their Pho and yummy spring rolls.  Interestingly enough, the past two times I have tried to go there, they have closed early!  Very frustrating.
