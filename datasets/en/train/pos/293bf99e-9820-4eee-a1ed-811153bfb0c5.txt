Don't believe that ridiculous post above from that high maintenance agro prick.   I went in there and was greeted by the friendliest staff.  They were super helpful, and I didn't feel any kind of pressure to buy anything I didn't need.   Tj and Alix helped me get it all together, and I back this place 100%.   Highly recommend!
