This was my hangout in Photown.  I had the unfortunate pleasure of living in Peoria.  And with bars like McDuffy's, who needs bars!

This is a great dive.  Kind of has a punk / rockabilly vibe going on.  Two free pool tables is awesome.  The juke  is one of a kind and one of the best in the city.  Lot of favorites, but definitely put on Deadbolt's Mrs Valdez if you get the chance.  It's a classic.

Bartenders are great.  Beer is all decently priced.  Cheap PBR and Old Style cans always available.  The crowd is generally fun and approachable to play pool with.  It's really the only place to hit up for us westsiders.  For that, I thank you Rogue West.  I would of lost my mind earlier in this damn town if it wasn't for this safe haven.
