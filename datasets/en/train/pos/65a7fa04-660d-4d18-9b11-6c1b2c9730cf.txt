I go here as often as possible. I went once and realized I had NO CASH after I had ordered, (Mesa FroYo is cash only =[ ), I was so embarrassed but the man at the counter was so nice! The flavors are excellent, the establishment is super clean and the employees are always, always, always wonderful!

In addition to being a friendly place with lots of options it is ridiculously cheap.

TRY IT!
