Delish!

Well, this super cool spot was my favorite sushi spot in LA, CA and now they have graced Scottsdale!  I would compare it to Asia De Cuba (but better - not trying that hard) and decor blows ADC away! 

Very hip and not too crowded (yet).  Hope it can keep a trendy feel (while still remaining sophisticated).  All sushi rolls were great and loved the Filet Mignon wrapped Asparagus (very tiny, but tasty) Loved banana desert & signature cocktails.

The decor is amazing.  Upstairs bar with pool is pure eye candy.  Love the red shades.  A back drop for a great night out for sure.

Service was AMAZING.  Hostess was friendly and professional, GM came to our table - very cool and nice.  Waitress rocked - what more can I say?  LOVED IT!  Going back again tonight!
