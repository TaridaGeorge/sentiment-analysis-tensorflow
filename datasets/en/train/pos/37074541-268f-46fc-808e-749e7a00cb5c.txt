Sex on bread! My friend and I discovered this gem while going to Moreno's and figured we would give it a shot. The Torta Dominicana is a coma inducing pile of awesome served on hot fresh bread. Imagine this please! Breaded steak, ham, refried beans, avocado, tomato, grilled chilis, and onions stacked high and blessed with hot sauce. Thinking about it takes me to my happy-place and makes the back of my head sweat (just like the sandwiches). Definitely try the Dominicana with breaded chicken instead of beef. It won't just knock your socks off, it will knock you out, steal your socks and point and laugh at you the whole time
