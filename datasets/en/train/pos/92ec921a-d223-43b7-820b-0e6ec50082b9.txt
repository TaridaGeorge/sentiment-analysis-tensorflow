flippin' amazing cupcakes!!  i love how they use local and organic ingredients...  it makes me feel a lot less guilty for indulging in these delicious bombs of flavor!  when we came here we ordered almost one of every cupcake flavor, omitting only lemon.

i HIGHLY recommend the pumpkin cupcake.  as we described it, it's like "thanksgiving in one bite."  simply perfect.  some of my favorite cupcake shops back in Cali make their pumpkin cupcakes with too heavy of the frosting or with an unnatural pumpkin flavoring, but this one was balanced very nicely.

i also really enjoyed their orange blossom.  their brown velvet was good too.  come to think of it, i'm a fan of their coconut as well...  actually, just get anyone of them.  seriously, when in pheonix, you've gotta try one of these delights!!
