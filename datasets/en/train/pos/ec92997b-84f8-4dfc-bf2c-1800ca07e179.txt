Gucci and Louis Vuitton are right across from each other. Enough said.  Not that I actually walked away with a shopping bag from either (my logic of lower sales tax saves you $$ didn't work on the Mr.) but it's nice to know that both stores were so accessible! But aside from the obvious handbag mecca, all my favorite stores are under one roof: Anthropologie, Crate and Barrel, Nordstrom. And the advantage of the AZ heat is that it's all indoors. So while I wander the streets of downtown San Francisco in a jacket and knee-high boots in mid-July, I can shop the exact same stores in Scottsdale wearing flip-flops (makes a difference when trying on shoes) and not having to cross a single street! Yes, I will definitely be back and next time I'm leaving with a new handbag ;)
