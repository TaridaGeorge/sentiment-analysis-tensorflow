I can't say enough about how friendly and helpful the staff of the spa is- from the front desk to the massage therapists to the yoga instructor.  There was not an ounce of condescension from anyone.

It was the little things, too:  I liked having access to the spray bottle for extra eucalyptus oil in the steam room, sized sandals, extra-luxurious robes, sizable showers with all possible toiletries available...

The fruit smoothies are amazing, too, so don't forget to grab one on your way back out to lounge at the pool!
