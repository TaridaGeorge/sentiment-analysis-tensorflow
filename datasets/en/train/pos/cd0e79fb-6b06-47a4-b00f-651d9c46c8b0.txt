Mmmmm Floridinos! The calzone is the most amazing thing on the menu and I have yet to find a comparable calzone anywhere else.  In fact, I ate the whole thing and then felt so guilty that I had hike up to Siphon's Draw the next morning.  Fair trade off, I'd say!

Our group of 4 also enjoyed pizza muffins and salads, and all left happy and full.  A great, local pizza joint!
