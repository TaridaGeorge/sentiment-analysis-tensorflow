Those golden wings! They taste like they were forged by Chuck Norris! Their golden wings are damn right breath taking.  The wife and I enjoy going there sometimes because I enjoy their burgers too. I usually order the Thousand Island burger, add avocado, mushrooms and bacon. The fries...they aiight, yo. But all in all, the burger is awesome.

The beer here is also really cheap, so that just makes it extra awesome. Furthermore, my single friend (who is kinda weird) said that the girls are kinda hot in there. So that's another plus.
