I just ate at this place and the food was just amazing. 
This was what i had

CHILI RELLENOS
A breaded fresh Poblano pepper stuffed with Chevre and melted Asadero cheese and baby shrimp layered over a bed of shredded cabbage. Served with chipotle cream sauce, southwest black beans and yellow posole.
The posole was a perfect side and the pepper was perfectly breaded and fried.
Its about $18 but it was totally worth it and just amazing.
