This place was great! You must order the cornbread. It is to die for. 
One thing, we are from out of town. We called to make reservations and asked about the dress code. The person told us casual. So this being AZ and 112 degrees, we showed up wearing jean, flip-flops, and tee shirts. Boy did we feel out of place. I would say dressy-casual is more the dress code.
The food was amazing and the service was perfect. Prices were very reasonable for the quality of both the food and service. 
Go here if you're in the area.
