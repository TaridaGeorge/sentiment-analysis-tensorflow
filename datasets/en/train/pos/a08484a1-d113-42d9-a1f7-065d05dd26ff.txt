I have to agree with the other reviewers. If you are looking for an authentic Hong Kong style noodle house, this is the best in the East Valley. Prices are very good, restaurant is very clean, portions are huge, and food is extremely tasty. Clear windows to watch the "magic" of noodle making, and the kids had a blast watching. They were even given a dough ball by the very nice chef to try their hand at it. Overall, quite impressed!  I would suggest the "Hand-pulled" noodles over the other variety.
