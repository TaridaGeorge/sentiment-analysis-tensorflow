We have been to this restaurant twice now and absolutely love it!!  The buffet is always well stocked with delicious fresh vegetables, meats and cheeses but of course the real winner is the roasted meat that is carved at your table.  All the succulent cuts are wonderfully seasoned and cut at your table by temp you like.  We had the lamb, top sirloin and ribeye and everything was perfect.  Along with the great meal is great service, everyone is there to make sure you have everything you need at all times.  Finally you have to try their cheesy biscuits they are so great!  You definitely have to try this place at least once it is amazing.
