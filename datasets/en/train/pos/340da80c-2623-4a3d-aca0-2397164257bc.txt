There are plenty of reviews here about their food, yes it is as good as everyone says, but I wanted to talk about their customer service, since I am big fan of customer service. 

Every person working their takes accountability for all tables. We had premiere service from any waiter that saw if we needed water or anything at all. I think 3 different waiters / bussers were concerned about us, and we never had to call anyone to the table because they were on it!

All this when the place was packed, as it usually is. Their outdoor / indoor seating almost feels like European cafe.

They are creative in the way they do business and all restaurateurs
should show up with a pencil and paper and take notes. This is how it's done folks !
