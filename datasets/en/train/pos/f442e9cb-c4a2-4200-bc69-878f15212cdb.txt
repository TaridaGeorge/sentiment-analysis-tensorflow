I ordered two each of a dozen varieties of cookies for our Mother's birthday.  Suzanne, the Baker was very helpful to make sure that we got exactly what we wanted (wrapped individually by flavor) and had them delivered to Mom's Glendale, AZ home the same day they were baked.  She was so impressed with how pretty the packaging was, how wonderful the cookies smelled, and after enjoying several of them (and freezing some for later), Mom is saving Chocolate Star's address so she can stop over for a cup of coffee and a cookie, or order some for friends.  Mom knows home-made quality and value and appreciated all the care and special ingredients she knew were in each generous sized cookie.  This was a delightful surprise and a great gift idea for someone who really does not "need" anything!  Thanks so much!
