What can I say about CIBO that hasn't been said before?...it has so many elements that make a great place to hang out and eat with friends...

* Good Service and courteous hosts
* Delicious fresh tasting food  that  scream  I am somehow good for you 
* Crepes that are to die for .. how can you resist...
* Brick Oven Pizza 
* Edgy Decor  dripping with hipness
* Great reflection of the downtown feel 

Great for meeting after work , taking mom out to eat , wine and pizza with friends , downtown close to events

Go ..you will love it   enuf said
