Okay, not sure where these other reviewers eat bagels, but Einsteins at 40th and Thunderbird MUST not be it.  I eat here every single week, and the place is clean and always packed.  The bagels and coffee are fresh, and the staff is very friendly.  I have never had a bad experience at this Einsteins.  BTW - Einsteins has the best bagels on the planet (and yes, I have eaten at Chompies.)
