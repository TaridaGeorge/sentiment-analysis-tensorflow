Since I was already here I had to stop by one of my favorite, plan my day around restaurants.  
Just be prepared to wait or fight for a seat at the bar since even on a Tuesday night this place is crowded.  Once you have some of the food you will know why.......

Here is some must haves, Stetson salad, Pork belly, mac and cheese, the scallop dish looks large and delicious.  Unfortunately on shellfish I can only look and not sample :(

Also try the bread pudding and maybe the chocolate covered bacon on the way out.  Anything with chocolate and bacon must be good?  2 of my favorite food groups :)
