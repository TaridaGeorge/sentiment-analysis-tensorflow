I recently went to Sunland Auto Service for a transmission issue. I got a quote from another place, then, when I had the money for the repair a month later, the original place raised the price by $400! That was enough for me to look for another "car guy". I turned to Yelp for the best, and I found them.

Bob and his crew not only re-checked the problem and gave me a 2nd opinion, they charged me less than I expected. I needed a transmission re-build, and  Bob was even awesome enough to work with me on a payment plan. He treated me fairly, kindly, honestly, and trusted me to pay him back with just a handshake and my word. 

I will be back to Sunland if I have any future repair needs. I will also recommend them to everyone I know.
