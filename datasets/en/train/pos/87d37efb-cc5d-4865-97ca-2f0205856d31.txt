1st OFF, I AM A RETURNING CUSTOMER AND I DO NOT WORK FOR GREULICH.... THE BAD REVIEWS MIGHT EVEN BE FROM THE COMPETITION.? THESE GUYS ARE AAA APPROVED! 

My busy schedule has me running in 10 different directions and stopping for an oil change and "check-up" is the last thing on my mind or agenda. My "Time to Change Oil" indicator had been harassing me for a couple of weeks. I had a break in the action and so I stopped by Greulich on Alma in Chandler... They squeezed me in and had me on my way in less than 30 minutes. I am a happy camper. These guys always seem eager to help.
