It's really easy to find this place cause of it's unique blue symmetry shapes. When I first walk in I immediately felt really comfortable as I saw the fire pit and lots of umbrellas and table outdoor. They also have a bar area and indoor as well. After tried 4 appetizers that they had, I concur this place is one of the coziest place in Phoenix that serves a superb meals :) I loved their pork tacos and would be coming back for more!
