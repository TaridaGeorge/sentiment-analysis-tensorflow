When we travel down to AZ to visit our friends, we usually end up trying new eateries... and this time was not any different. We were in the mood for some chinese food.. but not like Panda.. REAL chinese food.. and let's just say that I was pleasantly surprised! This place is located in a little strip mall so it can be easy to miss.. but you definitely have to try. Food was delicious and the service was great. Check it out.
