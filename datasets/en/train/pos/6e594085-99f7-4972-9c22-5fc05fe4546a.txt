I have to commend Dr. Lucas for timely and accurate diagnosis.  I have been seeing her for at least 10 years.  She ordered an aortic ultrasound test and they found a very enlarged aneurysm in the aorta just below the kidney.  She had me see a vascular surgeon right away and soon after had a CT scan.  Only a few days later I had to have surgery.

I have no doubt that had Dr Lucas not caught that, I would not be alive today.
