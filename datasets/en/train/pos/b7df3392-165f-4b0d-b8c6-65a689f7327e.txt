I live around the corner so I am always finding myself here.  They draw a real busy lunch crowd because of the medical office next door and just other lunch patrons.

There is a really great happy hour and reverse happy hour.  That is where I typically go nuts on the $2 and $3 items. 

The rest of the menu is all very good.  The falafel plate with Siracha sauce is the way to go.

They've got a great bar too.  Some good beers on tap, tv's to boot.  All around a great place to stop and have a bite.
