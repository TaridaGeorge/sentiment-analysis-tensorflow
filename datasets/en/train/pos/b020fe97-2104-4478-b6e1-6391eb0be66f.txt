Behold, your child's wonder and amazement awaits you inside this concrete monolith.

My little cutie pie was in his right element.  When you have a haptic kinesthetic child, this is the perfect place to bring him/her.  His favorite, remember he's a boy, is the huge digestive installation with fart sounds.  Oh yeah, he can spend hours rolling on the floor laughing after each time he slid out of the duodenum...along with boys his age.  

We love all the hands on exhibits inside the galleries.  As members, we were invited to the first viewing of Dateline Mars inside the Planetarium.  I love perks like that!  I will not divulge any more information.

Enjoy!
