The wonderful thing about this particular oriental store is the fact that their fish is definitely fresher than what you'd find at any friendly neighborhood grocery store.  They most definitely have a bigger selection of fish for all of you fish afficionados.  Their meats also seem fresher.  Although language is a barrier at times, as I can only assume the language spoken by most employees is Chinese, you can get by with gestures when needed.  Overall, this is a great place to shop, especially if you're like me and occasionally crave a little taste of home.
