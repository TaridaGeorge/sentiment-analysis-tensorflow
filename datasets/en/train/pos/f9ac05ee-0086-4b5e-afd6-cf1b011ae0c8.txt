This has to be my absolute favorite for special occasions and all other occasions for that matter. 
The wait staff is prompt and professional. The food, from beginning to end is overwhelmingly delicious. I love it; the breads, salads, soups, main courses, desserts, wine, drinks. It is all so good. 
I can't wait to go back, hopefully soon.
A couple of years ago, we saw Senator McCain with his wife and 2 other couples there at dinner. Wonder if we will see a blog from him for Vincent's on yelp.com....hmm?
