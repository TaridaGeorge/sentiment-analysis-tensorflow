I've never heard of Sprouts until I moved to AZ, but being a fan of Whole foods, I think this establishment is very similar. They have a lot of organic food products, fresh produce, fruits, decent selection of wines, and ok selection of beers

I think the best part of sprouts is their lunch special. Yummy sandwiches and soups are super affordable ($5) and they have some tables and chairs there if you want to eat there.

Another favorite part of sprouts is their meat area where you can get stuffed salmon or already marinated carne asda, pollo asda, teriyaki chicken, etc. 

They do lack the beer selection, but you'll find stuff here you will never see anywhere else. 

give it a try!
