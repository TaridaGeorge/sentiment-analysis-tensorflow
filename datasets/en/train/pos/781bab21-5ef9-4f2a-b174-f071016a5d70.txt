we have a new 5 star casino Buffet in the valley and it is great!!! Rand H. and myself went there on opening day and the place was pact at about 11:00 am .I started with a great bowl of soup and then I had a plate of salad items. they had this one macaroni salad that was unreal it was so good it had sun dried tomatoes,feta cheese and barbecued shrimp in it yumm!!!! After that i tried the hot food items that were all excellent. Then it was on to my favorite part, dessert.Well they have quite a selection of mouth watering sweets but the one that really got me was this hot caramel cake. It was so good i went back for more even though i was stuffed   YUMM!!!!!!!
