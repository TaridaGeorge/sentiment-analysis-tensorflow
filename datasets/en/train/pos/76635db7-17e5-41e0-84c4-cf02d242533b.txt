This our favorite lake on which to take the boat out. The obvious reason being, it's the only one on the West side. 

However, in addition to convenience, we love it because it is so large. There is plenty of room for everyone. So it's easy to find a cove, drop anchor and just chill, without a million people all around you.

In addition, the main boat ramp is nice and wide, so there's rarely a wait, and there is plenty of parking. There is another ramp available as well, but we have never used it.
