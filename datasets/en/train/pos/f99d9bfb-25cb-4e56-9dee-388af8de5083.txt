Chocofin is the ULTIMATE chocolate destination.  It's affordable!  It's unpretentious!!  And it tastes amazing!!!  They have the creamiest and freshest chocolate you will ever find - I think.  I love how the chocolates are kept in a refrigerated case.  Sometimes I eat all the chocolates in the car because I don't want them to melt in the Arizona sun.  I hope Fountain Hills people keep this place alive.  I usually opt for a crappy foam box for my chocolates, but they do have a few options for nice gift boxes.  

My favorite chocolates are the Hazelnut Croquantine (yummy crunchiness on the inside, glorious chocolate on the outside) and the Passion Fruit-Blood Orange (it has this surprising center of "pate" de fruit, which is a delicious solid fruit jelly and it's covered in a delicate, thin layer of dark chocolate).

Try a whole bunch of 'em!
