Stumbled upon this museum while taking a stroll through Old Town. It's a little museum, quaint and quiet, located on a strip of park leading from Old Town to Civic Center. It was welcoming, and being a free admission museum helped! The older ladies that worked here were so friendly and helpful. She gave us a greeting and some quick facts about some photographs. Although it is small, it has plenty of artifacts, photographs, and recreations of scenes from the Old Town back in the early 1900s. The Grammar School was created with extreme details, and even had the original stamp collection from back then! 

It's truly a great place and definitely worth a stop by. Make a donation to keep places like the Historical Museum alive and running.
