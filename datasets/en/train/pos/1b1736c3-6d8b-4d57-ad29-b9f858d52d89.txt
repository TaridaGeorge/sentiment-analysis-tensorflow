I've been eating at Mike & Rhonda's "The Place" for years. Having attended NAU I was introduced to Mike & Rhonda's almost 20 years ago (insert hacking sound referencing length of time).

They are consistently good. Portions are HUGE and easily make for a nice take home meal. The food isn't outstanding, but it's good and the service is remarkable considering that they are almost always full to the gills.

This is the perfect spot to take yourself after imbibing a little too much the night before or after church when you are being good.
