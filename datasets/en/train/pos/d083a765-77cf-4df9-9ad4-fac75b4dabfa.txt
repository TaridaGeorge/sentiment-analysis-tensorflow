As much of a sweet tooth that i have (dark decadent chocolate is my weakness)..Toffee was never my thing ,never on my mind ..

And then i sampled Goodytwo's toffee ..wowzer !
Sweet and salty toffee is regoddamndiculously good ..seriously good !
They have a toffee topped popcorn ..these gals are killing me ..oh ,oh the twozels sinfully delish magical pretzel mix with kettle corn ,nuts and chocolate .

Listen ,you can't put a price on happiness ,ha ha 
Everyone i love is getting their stockings stuffed with a box of salty-sweet love from Goodytwo's.

Nothing more delicious or sexy ,ya sexy then a salty sweet combo ..it is a heavenly pairing ..Goodytwo's has perfected this,worth every penny !

Rock on ladies !
