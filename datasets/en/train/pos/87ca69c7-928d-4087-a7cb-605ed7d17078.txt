A year later, and they're still so good...filling for cheap.  And I just discovered their desserts!  I love that you can purchase them half baked; I was able to take their tasty PB&J to enjoy back home in CA.   

I'd still recommend calling in for take out, since they do take awhile to bake.  But it's all worth it.
