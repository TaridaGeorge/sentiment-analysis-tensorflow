I would give Modern Steak 4.5 stars for the service and the use of really fresh ingredients!  I ordered the beef carpaccio and their warm lobster salad with white truffles and I can just taste the freshness of all the ingredients, def very refreshing to have!  This restaurant is located inside Scottsdale's upscale mall, but it oozes that hampton / beachy vibe which def helps earn brownie points with me,  They also have a decent steak selection for the heavy carnivores, so I think it's a must visit if you are in town!
