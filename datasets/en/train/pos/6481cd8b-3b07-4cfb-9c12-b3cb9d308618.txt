The best part of shopping here isn't the really great coffee, chewy yummy chocolate croissants, or the faint-worthy deli and prepared foods counter.

The BEST part of shopping here is knowing that by overpaying for simple items that cost less elsewhere, I'm making the savings and deep discounts of Food City and Bashas possible. 

It feels like giving to charity, only charity never sends me home with full bags of gourmet groceries after I write them a check.
