Love this place! The only thing that can be improve is for them to accept reservations for parties less than 6. There is a $3 valet which makes it easier. It has a wonderful ambiance and it felt comfortable, fun, and trendy. I ordered the Bellini and it was delicious. I personally dont think they have a wide selection of drinks. The bruschetta is amazing though. I absolutely loved it. The portions are great and make you full. I loved the olives they brought out too. The music was not too loud so you would have to scream to be heard. Overall, wonderful experience! I am definitely going back. This time I want to try their brunch on Sundays.
