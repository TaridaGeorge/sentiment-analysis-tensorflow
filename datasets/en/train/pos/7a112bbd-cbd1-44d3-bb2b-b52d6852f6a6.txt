This is the best nursery by far that I have visited in the Valley.  Honest, knowledgeble staff. I especially like the slightly eclectic Jacob. Great variety of plants & trees, all well cared for & healthy. They also run some great deals & offer informative classes. Try to allow yourself enough time to really tour the grounds and talk to the staff.
