Before I went to this lovely hole in the wall I had never even heard of a pasty -- I actually read about this place on yelp and wanted to give it a try!  They have a great British vibe with a very eclectic feel to it. 

Great beer selection.  I knew I was going to love this place when I saw that they had Strongbow on draft :)

I usually get Cottage PIe or Bangers/Mash... you can't go wrong with either of those.  Their greek salad is amazing too... and definitely go for the garlic 'oven chips' if you go there... very tasty!  

My mouth is watering just writing this review  :)
