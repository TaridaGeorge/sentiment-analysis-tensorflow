I had a great fusion ahi tuna sandwich here.  They made the ahi tuna with a spicy southwestern chipotle sauce on a ciabatta bread.  They added a a few other vegetables inside the sandwich.  It was absolutely delicious.  This has to be one of the best fusion combos I have ever had.  It came with a side of mashed potatos.  The actual menu is very limited, but I would come back here again just to get this dish and some wine (The wine list is huge).
