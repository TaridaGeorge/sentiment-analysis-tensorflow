Yummy brunch in a cute setting.  The restaurant is one of three on a farm.  The Morning Glory Cafe is devoted to breakfast/brunch items while the other two restaurants serve lunch and dinner.  I had the Farm Monte Cristo -- the perfect combination of salty and sweet.  The eggs were cooked just the way I like them.  The Morning Glory Benedict was also excellent.  Loved the farm greens on the benedict, tasted very fresh.  No complaints here.
