Softque has done some work on my computers in the past- adding or deleting software, cleaning up, putting on security features, etc. But a few weeks ago they saved me!  I was working at my office when a HUGE Trojan Virus security alert stopped my computer. I immediately called Peter at Softque. He was at my office within a couple of hours, and worked his miracles. I was up and running again in a few hours- with my computer intact- sans the virus. They are now going to be adding additional security and backup to all of my office computers. It's nice to find reliable, trustworthy people working on my business computers. 

Thank you Softque.  I appreciate your 5-Star Service!!!
