Great wine and great customer service!
We were in Scottsdale for my friend's bachelorette party, and we did the "bottling party" at Su Vino.  We had a big table that sat all 8 of us, with cheese, fruit and crackers, and our own personal wine maker bringing us tastes and explaining the different wines.  Then we were able to bottle our own wine, and put our own label on it (we had a picture of all of us girls).
It was a blast!  I would definitely recommend a visit here!
