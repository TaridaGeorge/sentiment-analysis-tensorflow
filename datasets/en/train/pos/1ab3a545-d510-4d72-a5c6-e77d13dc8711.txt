Oh how I love thee. I am going to miss this place. I used to work around the corner and frequent this spot at least 2-3 times per month. I've never had a bad wrap and the rice bowls are good too! The Senorita No Meata is one of my favorites and I love the chips and salsa... it tends to be my side of choice. The parking situation is dumb... don't go at noon. Trust me. If you can carpool that's even better.
