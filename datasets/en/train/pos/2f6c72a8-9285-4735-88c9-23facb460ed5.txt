I am grateful that there is a discount theatre in town - since Harkins and AMC are soo expensive! This is a nice place to go to the movies at $3 a person - and $2 Tuesdays. The popcorn and drinks are still pricey though. Keep in mind to bring cash - they don't accept credit/debit cards. They have HUGE clean bathrooms not too far from the theatres, and some creepy yet entertaining plastic/wax figurines everywhere. Parking is never a hassle to find. The screens are smaller and not as good as Harkins and AMC, but still overall a great experience.
