Seriously, what's not to love about Trader Joes? I'm obsessed with so many of their store's products, the prices are CHEAP, the produce is fresh and I always end up with a gorgeous bouquet of flowers on my dining room table after a quick stop. The Trader Joe's pizza dough is wonderful, the wine is cheap and there's just enough stuff in the store to make anything you want but avoid getting overwhelmed. 

Plus, who doesn't love being recognized and rewarded for using a reusable grocery bag? I just know one day they'll pull my ticket from the fish bowl! ;)
