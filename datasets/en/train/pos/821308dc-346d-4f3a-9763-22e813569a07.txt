This is one of my favorite sushi bars in town.  Ken, the owner is so friendly and his food is so good that we keep going back even though it is a 10+ mile drive.  The prices here are fabulous for a sushi restaurant, best prices in town.  Nice assortment of specials every night, and interesting items show up on the board all the time, he has a friend in the shipping business.  We've had some items here I've never had at a sushi restaurant, straight from Japan, very special indeed, rare shellfish and other delicacies.  Not a fancy place but nice inside, great prices, good sake selection, good service and wonderful food.
