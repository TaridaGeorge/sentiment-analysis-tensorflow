We finally got a chance to eat at Flavors of Louisiana.  We both decided to get the Shrimp PoBoy.  I was really impressed with the flavor.  The shrimp were cooked to perfection.  I would have liked to try other items on the menu but that will have to be another time.  The decor is pretty basic but the food speaks for it self.  If you are looking for some great creole food I recommend hitting up Flavors of Louisiana.
