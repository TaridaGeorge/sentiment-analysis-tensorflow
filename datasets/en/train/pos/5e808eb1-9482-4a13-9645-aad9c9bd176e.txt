One of the pins in my Citizen Eco-drive was broken.  Took it to a few places in the mall and they all recommended replacing the entire band, which I knew wasn't necessary.

I went to Norm's they took one look at the watch and said, "Oh yeah, we can fix that".  It was $20.00 for the repair, took a few days but was of the highest quality.  Also needed a battery replaced in my Tag Heuer and they did that while I waited for $10.00.

If you need a clock or watch replaced, stop in.  They kindly ask for payment by check or cash.
