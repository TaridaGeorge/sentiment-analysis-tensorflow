What can you say about a place that hits all the right notes?  It is charming...funky...cool...fun.  There are several rooms and within those rooms, nooks and crannies so you can choose solitude or conviviality, depending on your mood.   

The food is A+++++.   All the old favorites are there -- great coffee and melt-in-your-mouth pastries.   I personally have only been there for coffee...yet.    But I heard ooooohs and ahhhhhhs over the rest of the menu items.   You know it's good when people are planning what they will have on their next visit before they have even finished their meal.

There is a bar now and what looks like a very well chosen wine collection.   Enjoy!!!!
