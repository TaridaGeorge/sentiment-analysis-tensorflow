I am giving this place five starts because while it is not the most excellent afghan food I have had many of their dishes are delicious, and we really need more of these types of places here and phoenix, and what more?  Its just down the street from me!

There menu is very diverse covering everything from afghani to Indian to Pakistani and even American cuisine (mainly burgers and fries/ wraps)

Most important of all the owner and employees are very kind.  I do advise to order ahead of time if you are taking out, they can take a while to get out the dishes but when they do it is worth the wait.
