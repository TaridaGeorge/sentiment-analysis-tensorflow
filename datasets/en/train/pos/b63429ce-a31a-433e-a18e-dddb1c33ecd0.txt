This place is great! I used to live around the corner and would always crave their strawberry salad and french fries. Another winner for me is the grilled veggie sandwich. I also could never resist bringing friends there to have the s'mores kit. It's pretty nice being near water in Arizona while munching on some gooey marshmallow goodness. 

I live in San Francisco now and really miss this place. Definitely on my list of places to hit for good food on my next Tempe visit!
