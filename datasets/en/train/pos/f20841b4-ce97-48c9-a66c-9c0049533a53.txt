I have been frequenting this restaurant for lunch for a long time.  My favorite item on the menu is the 1/2 and 1/2 Continental Chicken sandwich with a caesar salad.  This sandwich comes with carmelized onions and some kind of horseradish sauce which gives it just the right kick.  I also love their soups.  It's a nice atmosphere for lunch with a friend.
