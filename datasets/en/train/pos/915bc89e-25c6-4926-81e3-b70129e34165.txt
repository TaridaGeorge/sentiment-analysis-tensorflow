Dr. Loo has been  my primary care doctor since I was a child.  He is so kind and really cares about his patients.  I also occasionally see both nurse practitioners, which are both very attentive and compassionate.  If you're looking for a primary care doctor, I'd definitely recommend this office.  All the receptionist and nurses are very nice too!  He has a Hawaiian theme office, very calming when you walk in.
