wow - ever since the opened around 6 months ago, I've been a fan. I visit sometimes every day (at times, twice a day), but generally 3 times/wk.

Love their pre-prepared foods: fresh, great ingredients, ready to eat.
Lunch-to-go - wow - yummy
Bakery items such as bread and cakes are good
Some pretty ok wines (I prefer the higher end, but stock up on the others for those who visit and implore MORE of what I just gave them).
Beer: Torino - I don't drink/like beer but tried this and it is good! (i would compare it to corona). Half the price, btw !!!

Overall, interesting, fun, yummy, food, many hormone free, organic items, and deli items, as well as "AJ" type things (humus, dips, salsa, ect), for WAY less.

I'm happy :-)
