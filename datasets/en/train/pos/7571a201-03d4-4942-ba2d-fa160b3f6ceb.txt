Oh!  I'm a little jealous that this was a yelp event!

Gary and I also saw The Clean House.  It was superb!  The acting was terrific.  The characters were well written.  I especially loved the sister character.  The Portuguese jokes were funny even if I couldn't understand them.  AND The stage was  brilliant, very well done. 

Make sure to check out the art gallery upstairs.  They change their exhibits every few months.  I'm actually exhibiting right now!
