Liz is by far the best CPA that I have ever found. She truly cares about every single one of her clients and treats them on a more personal level. She really takes the time to explain things. I feel very secure having her as my CPA and I know I am getting a huge savings through Liz. I would recommend this to everyone and anyone.
