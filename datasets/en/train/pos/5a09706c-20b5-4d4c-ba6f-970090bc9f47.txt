Paul is the man.

I accidentally stumbled upon this place one day with coworkers for dinner.  We sat at the bar where Paul, the owner and head sushi chef, promptly struck up a great conversation with us.  Ever since, this is a weekly visit for me.  

Paul always is honest with his fish, tells me what is fresh and what isn't.  For newcomers, I definitely would recommend sitting at the bar and getting to know the fish.

Thumbs up!
