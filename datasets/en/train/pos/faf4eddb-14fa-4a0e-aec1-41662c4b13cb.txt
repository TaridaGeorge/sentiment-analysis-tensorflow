I was nervous about going back to any Nordstrom after what I experienced from their Chandler location. At the Chandler location I received the worst customer service I practically have every seen. Glad I walked through the door of the Scottsdale store. I had interaction with 4 associates while there and they all were wonderful! Love their merchandise too! I spent hundreds!
