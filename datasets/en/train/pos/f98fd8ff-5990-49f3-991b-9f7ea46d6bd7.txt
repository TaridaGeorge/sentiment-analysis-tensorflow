Oh. My. God. This place is amazing! I literally am sitting here with a belly full of delicious Hot and sour soup, crab puffs, orange peel chicken, and Peking beef! This is probably some of the best Kari Out I've ever had. The meat is quality, the vegetables are fresh, and for the amount of food they give you, you can't beat the price! I'll be having the rest for breakfast tomorrow!
