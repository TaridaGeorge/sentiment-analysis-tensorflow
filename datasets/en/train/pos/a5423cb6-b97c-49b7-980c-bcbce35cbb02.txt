Great little sandwich shop! The food was fresh and delicious. The waitstaff and chef were friendly and attentive. Drinks (alcoholic and non) were yummy! We went for Thursday night dinner and sat outside - great setting. If you want a fast, great tasting, low-key lunch or dinner (open late on thursday only, I think) go to the Cider Mill!
