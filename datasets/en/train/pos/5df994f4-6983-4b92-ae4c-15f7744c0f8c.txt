Great place. Great food. Great Sake.
Food selection was different. The taste was very unique too.
Portions are Tapas style---which works out if you are not very hungry.

If you are in a mood for some fusion type cuisine---give it a shot.

It would be nice if they served hot sake---which i missed.
Other than that---no complaints.
