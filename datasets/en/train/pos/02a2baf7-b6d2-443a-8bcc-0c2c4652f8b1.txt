Orange roll, mido roll! This place has the greatest sushi for the money I've had in town. The mido roll is my favorite roll ever. I'm not the most experienced sushi eater, but I've had enough now to tell quality for the money, and this place delivers. Like another reviewer said as well, I too drive 40 minutes one way just to get there. Maybe Mido needs to start a caravan service or start another location farther north? :-)
