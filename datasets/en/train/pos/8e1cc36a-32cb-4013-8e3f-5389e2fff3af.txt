We have never been to a show here before but we went last night for dinner and to enjoy the Rod Stewart show followed by the Rolling Stones! Rod was good and the Stones were awesome! The food was better than expected & food prices were reasonable. All seats are good seats at this place! Will be coming back for sure!!!
