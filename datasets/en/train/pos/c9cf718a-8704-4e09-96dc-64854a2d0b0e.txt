I work across the lot from this place and have been dying to try it out.  Unfortunately I work graveyard shifts and they close before my shift begins.  I learned last week that they were going to start staying open till 7 on Fridays.  Finally I would get my chance!  let me tell you I was not disappointed!  I ordered the pulled pork sammich, cornbread and potato salad.  The pulled pork was tender, juicy, smokey and porky!  I got half way through the sandwich when I realized I forgot BBQ sauce it was that good.   The staff were incredibly friendly and the food came out very fast.
