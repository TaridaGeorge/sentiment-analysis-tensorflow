Pane Bianco should be viewed as a treasure in a city like Phoenix that is completely overrun with chains on every corner.  Although, I think it's so amazing that it would be viewed as a treasure in almost any city.

It's not every day....or any day really...where the bread to your sandwich is baked in a wood fired oven right in front of your eyes only mere feet from where you stand.

From the locally grown produce, to the homemade mozzarella, to the absolutely amazing bread, Pane Bianco is truly a prize for anyone's palette.  

Don't be afraid to stray from their classic mozzarella sandwich to try the daily special...you won't be disappointed!
