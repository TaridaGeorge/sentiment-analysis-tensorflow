Your life would not truly be complete if you haven't tried bingsoo.

Go there with a few people and share the largest bowl, so you can get a sample of everything available.

It is as delicious as all the reviews has described it to be.

They have really good boba drinks as well.  

This place seriously and easily trumps any "yo-go" place out there.  It is in a league of its own.
