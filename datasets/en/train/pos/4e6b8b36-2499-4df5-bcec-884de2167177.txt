Just go. Anything FnB Team Charleen and Pavle do is gold - and they've done it again.  The food is fresh, delicious and inspired.  Beautiful, really.  And priced so well you can order everything on the menu to share. Leave with a happy belly, a few new friends, a couple of bottles of wine from the AZ Wine Merchant next door and some exotic local fruit, farm fresh local veggies, preserved lemons, homemade donuts or fresh bread from Bodega - another Badman/Pavle creation connected to Baratin.  The space is urban, easy and friendly, right in Old town Scottsdale in the Kiva Center.  You'll like it.  Just go.
