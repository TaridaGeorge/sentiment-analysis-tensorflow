Great group of guys! I went in hoping to get some replicas of my grandfather's military medals for his funeral. Two of the employees went above and beyond to help us out! Not only did they read through his discharge paperwork to figure out what we needed, but put them together for us so we were ready to go! Great customer service! Cool place with lots of military knowledge and gear! I would definitely return!
