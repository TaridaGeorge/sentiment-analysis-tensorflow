Holy shit!  CUTE WAITER.  We found this place off the beaten path near the Legacy Resort and Spa where we stayed last night and if you're ever in the Tempe area, this is definitely a nice five star place prepped to impress...  and the help is HOT.  

It's a wine bar and restaurant that is set up in a beautiful converted home space that still has it's homeyness intact to the tea!  Good wine, but for a wine bar, a little sparing...  We had fun!   There was live music, great lighting, did I mention the hot waiter?, and an overall nice atmosphere (ie, hot waiter)!    The menu looked spectacular, but as you've probably figured out by  now, I was there for the vino and the view.
