This is literally the fastest way to become the subject of a rap about having a nice body. All of these songs (and more) were inspired by women who do pilates at The Body Lab. 

"Got the body of a goddess" (I'm in Love With a Stripper)
"Damn youz a sexy bitch!" (That one song)
"Look it how she walk... you know she know she bad" (Bedrock)
"Honey got a booty like wow-oh-wow" (OMG)

An ethereal presence. Sex Appeal. Confidence. A nice butt. What are you waiting for? Get on it.
