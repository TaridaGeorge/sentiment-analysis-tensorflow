I'm not sure why everyone is hating on the Firesky. Firesky is a solid five.

The pool has a sandy beach.

There is a water slide.

There are fire pits all over the backyard.

There are complimentary s'mores kits at the front desk.

The robes in the rooms are leopard print shorties. Rowr!

Free wi-fi.

Everyone here is super friendly (genuine and honest) and you're told up front not to tip anyone.

If you're a Kimpton member (free!) you get room upgrades, complimentary wine in your room, and a pet fish for your stay.
