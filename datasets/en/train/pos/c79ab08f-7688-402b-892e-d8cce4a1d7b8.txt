Loves!  I've been trying different nail salons around my work and I have found the winner!  They have a long list of pedicure options and I selected a basic one for $25 to try the place out.  Low and behold it included an awesome hand and arm massage, hot rocks, etc.   it's a little odd that the masseuse and nail tech switch back and forth, but the result is each doing what they are good at.  And yes... Please tip them both, they both did great work simultaneously!  :)
