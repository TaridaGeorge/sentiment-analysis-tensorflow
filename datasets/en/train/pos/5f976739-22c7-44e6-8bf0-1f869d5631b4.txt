I loved it. 
I've wanted to go here ever since we moved to AZ and I wasn't disappointed. It's HUGE!
We didn't even get to see the whole place-as a former photography major I was super excited to see the Ansel Adam exhibit.
free on First friday of every month. I'm so ready to come back and see what I missed.
Loved the vibe and I agree with everyone else..I'm not an artsy sort of person, but I really was in awe of this place.
What a wonderful place to have in Phoenix.
3 hrs flew by-I could spend the whole day there.
