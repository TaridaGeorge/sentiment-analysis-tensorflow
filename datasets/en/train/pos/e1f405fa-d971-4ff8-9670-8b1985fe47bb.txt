Fair warning - you will become addicted to Hot Bagels. The breakfast special is a great way to start your day. This is how bagels should taste. The lunch meats are all Boar Head and man can those guys put together a great sandwich. Take a few dozen with cream cheese and a few pounds of lox for the office. Very small place with barely a dozen indoor seats supplemented by 4-5 sidewalk tables.
