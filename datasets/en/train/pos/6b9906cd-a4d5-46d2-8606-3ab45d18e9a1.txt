Amazing place!!!   I love breakfast places and have been to many great ones all over the USA, but I think this is the best one I have visited.
While staying Sheraton a couple blocks away, for a work trip, I woke up early to be at the front door at the 6:30am opening.

-Great food (large portions and fresh ingredients)
-Best bacon I have ever had
-Friendly Staff and excellent service
-Small venue
-Long wait if you don't arrive early (If you come solo wait is much shorter)

If I ever get back to Phoenix I will be go straight to Matt's!
