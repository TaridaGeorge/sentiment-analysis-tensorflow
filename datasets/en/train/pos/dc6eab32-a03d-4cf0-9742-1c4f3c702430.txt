I dropped off my favorite pair of boot scootin' (dancing) boots for new soles and heels right before they closed on Thursday.  They were ready the next day and they looked and felt great.  I thought the new soles would be stiff and I would have to break them in again, but that was not the case.  Also, the price was very reasonable.  I've had that type of work done at other places and paid a lot more and waited longer to get them back, so I'm a very happy customer.  I definitely recommend Tony's Shoe Repair in the Christown Shopping Center.
