I loved this place. We actually didn't have a wait at all so I'm not sure why everyone else did. The place is definitely small, but I liked it. It felt less like a chain laid out for maximum amount of getting people in and out and more like a place that was made in homage to good food where you could sit and have a nice long meal. 

We went there after the food network special and got the bolognese - it was really delicious. The food isn't too expensive, it's all the add-ons. When you go there you just can't help order an appetizer, a meal, a bottle of wine AND dessert. 

It's totally worth a visit if you haven't been yet!
