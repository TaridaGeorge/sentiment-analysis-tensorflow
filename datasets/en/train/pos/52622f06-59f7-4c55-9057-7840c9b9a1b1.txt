Decided to give this place a chance and was quite delighted. I am vegan and that's an issue sometimes. I tried the vegetable chow mein(medium spicy) and I love it. I get extra broccoli and there is so much flavor in the veggies and noodles. My husband has tried the General Tso's chicken, The BBQ pork chow mein, the mu shu pork and the garlic chicken and he loved them all. The great thing is that this is a family run business and it shows in the food. I highly recommend at least trying this place. it's reasonably priced and there are great lunch specials during the week.
