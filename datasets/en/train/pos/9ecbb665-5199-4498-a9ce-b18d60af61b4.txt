We visited Scottsdale last year and one day while exploring we stumbled upon this unique and lovely shop. We love angels so we were instantly captivated. Many of the items in the store were amazingly beautiful and ethereal, including a great deal of artwork. They also had smaller (less expensive) items that were equally lovely. Most of it was unique and nothing I had seen anywhere else. I also loved the feeling of peacefulness that pervaded the shop. And the staff in the store were helpful and friendly - it was an all together wonderful experience. Can't wait to go back to Scottsdale and visit this amazing store again!
