I had a really hard time finding clean, trusty nail service in Scottsdale.  The clean and bright facility is designed to hold many customers, the staff is extensive, all nice, and hard working.  

I tried the "gel" permanent french manicure last week.  Two weeks later and my nails are still as beautiful as the day I got them done.

FYI - you can't tip on your card.  But there is an atm in the plaza.
