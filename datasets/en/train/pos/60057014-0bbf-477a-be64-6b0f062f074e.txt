I started practicing at At One Yoga four years ago and since then, have worked my way around the Valley, discovering different kinds of yoga and experiencing different studios.  I'm here to tell you that this is the BEST.  You get what you pay for - the best instructors and the most challenging classes that will help get you to the next level in your practice. You can buy all the Living Social yoga deals you want, but at the end of the day, you will come back to LifePower (trust me).  I was happy to see all of my favorite At One instructors at LifePower and I will continue to come!
