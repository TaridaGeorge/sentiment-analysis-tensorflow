McGurkee's is hands down the best sandwich shop in Arizona. This is a family run business which has really hit the nail on the head. Their toasted bread is marvelous.  Try the Super Silician, Tuna, Pastrami and the JP Turkey to begin with but you can't go wrong with any of the choices. I eat there with one of my family members at least once a week. If it were located in my work territory I would eat there everyday.  Check out the Ham & Cheese- I think I am becoming addicted to this sandwich!
