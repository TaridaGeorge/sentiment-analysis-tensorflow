I stop by Janey's Coffee House every other Wednesday at 8AM for the most AWESOME masterpiece oatmeal breakfast and delicious iced coffee.

Let Samantha (the owner) or any of the crew know that Reza sent you and you want the oatmeal as Reza likes it, and be prepared for the oatmeal experience of your life.

The picture is of my most recent oatmeal!
