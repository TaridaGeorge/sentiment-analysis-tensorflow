Visited T. Cook's on the 4th of July for the first time.  Had lived in PHX/Scottsdale for 2 + yrs and return for visits a few times a year.  What a great spot!  By far the best service, atmosphere and food I've had in Phoenix (outside of Lon's at the Hermosa) in quite some time.  Excellent wine selection.  The specials offered something traditional but also creative.  Recommend the pate appetizer and squash soup for a start.  I ate a filet mignon cooked perfectly but I know their paella is also acclaimed.  Decor is intimate, inviting and not stuffy/overdone.
