I am only rating the person that gave me the best pedicure EVER!!!!  It was a warm afternoon in AZ so what is there to do? Go to the salon and getting pampered!  I had to yelp for a place because I only get my nails done on the East side, and this was last minute so my friends and I did not want to drive that far.  Star Nails and Wax came up with 5 stars, I was a bit hesitant with only two reviews but we decided to give it a go.

I was helped by David- who gave my feet an orgasm!  He was soooooo good!  He took his time to do the pedicure and did not rush at all even when there were customers waiting.  Best massage EVER! 

I will definitely come back as a regular and I highly recommend David!
