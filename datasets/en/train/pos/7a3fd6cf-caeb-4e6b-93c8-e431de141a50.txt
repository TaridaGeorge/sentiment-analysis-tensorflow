We went in for the 1st time the other day with a toddler and it was wonderful. The outside look and the inside feel is completely different. It's much better inside.

The food is delicious, especially their BBQ's. I also like their bibimbob and the little plates before the meal (appetizers?!). It was also our 1st time trying Korean beer and it's also good.

They have good atmosphere and good price. Chodang is a kid friendly family restaurant.
