I have tried many self serve yogurt places and I'll have to say this is the best one. The quality of their ingredients is much better than the other places. I like the variety of each flavor and they always change it up which is nice. The topping choices are endless and the price is just what I would like it to be. I should probably clear up some bad reviews some people have posted. First off, there's one cup size for a reason. You can have as little or as much as you want. Hence, the name "self-serve" If that's an inconvenience to you, then you probably shouldn't be going there at all. It upsets me when people bash places like these. It's a great idea and I'm sticking to this place. Plus, its close to me house!
