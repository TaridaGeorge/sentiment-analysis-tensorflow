Read a review on Yelp that led me to taking a chance for my wife's birthday dinner. INCREDIBLE! The food and friendly service is what we will definitely be back for soon. I recommend it for Indian cuisine regulars and novices alike. They have a great selection on the menu for everyone. My kids even loved it!
