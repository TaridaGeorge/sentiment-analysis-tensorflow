Local owned, Local Grown this place is all the hype and more.  We ride our cruisers here for breakfast and even before we get in for work.  Why? This place has a warm feel to it and the food is AWESOME!  They have daily egg specials that are remarkable.  The Honey Lemonade is fresh and like no other in town.  It gets busy so get in early and put your name in the notepad at the door.  I would not recommend for large parties, because they are very small. Steak and Eggs every Sunday.
