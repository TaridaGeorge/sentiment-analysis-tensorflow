I guess this is the place to comment on First Fridays.  I went to it tonight and it was a blast.  It was really nice to see lots of kids and families out experiencing art of various types.  It's really an impressive array of work.  The quality varies, but there's something for everyone I would guess.  I only hit about 25 spots in one neighborhood around Roosevelt/1st - 7th/the other random side streets around the area.

Loved the use of the housing as studios and the welcoming atmosphere.  There were a ton of cops around too for some reason.
