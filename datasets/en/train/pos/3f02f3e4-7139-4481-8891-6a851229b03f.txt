Absolutely A-mazing!  

Duane just had surgery and is still recovering, but I think he's back at it starting this week - lucky me, as I've amassed more than a few unfinished projects in the past few weeks.

Honest, hard-working, and extremely helpful with advice.  He'll gladly give a recommendation for how to do something yourself or recommend someone else if a task is outside of his skill level...something which hasn't happened for me yet.
