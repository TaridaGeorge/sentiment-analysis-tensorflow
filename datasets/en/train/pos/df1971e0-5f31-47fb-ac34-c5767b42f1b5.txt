Came here the other day and I was eating my 5 guys burger and I had a feeling I was Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction eating that big kahuna burger.  "very tasty"  I say to myself (because I am not really eating with anyone or pointing a gun ready to read scripture right before I blow someone's flipping brains out).  Anyway, this location is pretty nice and they are always clean and very uniform to the same look.  This one is larger than the location on Bell and 7st I have been to.  They cook the burger right when you get there and you can see them put the raw burger on the grill.  Something about these burgers just sing to me.  They have great fresh ingredients and the burger is just so very juicy.  What can I say, I am a fan.
