I should never have tried this place...it's all I can think about now!  The worst part is that it's near my gym, so I am tempted to go every time I workout, thus defeating the purpose of actually working out.  Oh well, I can't help it... I love you Sweet Republic.  I love that cinnamon ice cream I can't remember the name of and the honey blue cheese ice cream is really unique.  You have ruined me, I no longer care for anything else and now I have to workout twice as hard because I know there is no way that I can resist.  You have melted my will power!
