I was a regular at the 32nd St location for a while. I loved the staff. Mark was the manager at the time. I think.

Now after moving into Central Phoenix I have found a quick drive up to Bethany was way easier. And days after a light work day this place is where to find me. The Zipparitas are of course My Drink of choice. The Chambord is a bonus in every Zipparitas...

Happy Hour includes the Wings (ask for the extra hot sauce on the side first time - IT BURNS) The Zipparitas is on special also during Happy Hour!
