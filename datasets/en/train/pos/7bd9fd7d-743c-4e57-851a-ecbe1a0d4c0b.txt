One of the things I love about my neighborhood is that Cornish Pasty is w/in walking distance.

Every pasty Ive had here is awesome. My personal faves include the shepherds pie, the chicken pot pie, and the thanksgiving pasty.

Yes its tiny and loud, but it adds to the charm. Also, the smell that you smell right when you walk in the door= heaven.

We eat in and get to go. Tip for to go: have a beer or a cider w/ your wait.
