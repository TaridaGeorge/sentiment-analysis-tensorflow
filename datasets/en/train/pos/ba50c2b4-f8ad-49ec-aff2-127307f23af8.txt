I've gotta give the Merc five stars out of my duty of loyalty to Phoenix alone. It's just too intertwined with our local culture to be worthy of less from me. The Merc is, as many others have alluded to, Phoenix's hip answer to Scottsdale. Trendy but unpretentious. The perfect place to bring a condescendingly skeptical friend visiting from San Francisco or New York to shut them up for a while. Get a big enough group to come here and I don't see how it is possible to not have a good time. 

I brought a date here once. I know I know, don't know what I was thinking. Needless to say: don't do that.
