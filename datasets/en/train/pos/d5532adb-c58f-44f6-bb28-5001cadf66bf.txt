This is the best pizzeria I've found in Phoenix. Their marinara sauce is super delicious.  I've had pizza and the meatball sub, they are both great especially for the price!  My only complaint is that I don't care for the meat toppings they use.  I'm not sure what it is, but I just didn't like the way the toppings turned out.  I stick with the cheese slices and have never been dissappointed!
