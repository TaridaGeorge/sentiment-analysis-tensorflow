Its my neighborhood 7-11 where I just want to leave the car running so I can run in and run out.  

Grab the sushi, cookies, rib eye, China Mist ice tea and 1/2 pound of the buffalo breast tenders for my salad. 

Meat counter is always awesome and so is the brick oven pizza by the slice. Some of the best pizza in town.

Selected $$ because it really depends on what you get.
