Hooray for awesome vintage stores!  Michael Todd's is definitely one of the better vintage stores.  Everytime we drive along Camelback, and the mood strikes us, we swerve into the parking lot of this place, sometimes almost causing accidents.  In our effort to redo our bathroom in vintage/recycled items we stopped by here in hopes of finding some inspiration.  This time, we struck it rich.  I found a beautiful vintage French mirror here, and the quality of the mirror is still pretty good.  It only cost like 30 bucks!  Other places, ahem, Melrose Vintage, this exact mirror would cost me about 100 bucks.  This store has a great assortment of furniture, clothing, and knick knacks to suit everyone's taste.  Even if I don't buy anything, I always walk out with a smile on my face.
