First of all, their chocolate shakes are too good! I always get a small so I don't over do it.

What I find weird is they don't accept Discover Credit Cards. 


Their animal style burgers are by far the best and only fast food burger I will dare to eat. Meat is fresh, not that nasty freezer crap they let bake under a light while the employees contaminate them with dirty hands.

Also, the people at this location are so friendly. A smile really does go a long way people!
