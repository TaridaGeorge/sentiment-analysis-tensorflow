I can't believe I'm just now writing my review on Yelp for my favorite sushi joint in town!  

My husband has known Mo since way back in the day when Mo was working his magic at Sushi Ko.   We've been going to see Mo at Toyama for about 8 yrs now and we both agree that Mo delivers the freshest sushi in town. Hands down, this is the place to go if you are only about the fish.  It might not be the hip place to go to if you are all dolled up and looking for a scene.  But if you are a serious sushi fan, this is the place for you.
