Soooo good it made me sign up & open a Yelp account just so I can give this place a high five! They've mastered the art of perfect chix wing...the seasoning, sauce portion, that slight crunch. Num num! TIP: food is made to order, so be patient, you can't rush perfection...trust, it is so worth the wait. And get this...wonderful customer service! Their cust serv is a reflection of their confidence in their food, knowing they've got something special and their need to share that to the fine people of AZ. Like they knew we were in need of some good a$s wings! So good, i've nicknamed them 'Crack' wings... Cuz I always leave there feenin for more and usually go there 2 days in a row!
