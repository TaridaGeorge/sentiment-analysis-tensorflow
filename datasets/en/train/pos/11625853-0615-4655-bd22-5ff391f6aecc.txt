In spite of the Malayan curse and being a victim of an untimely conflagration in it's building, this gem is officially reborn and doing wonderful things once again!  As many of you know, Ranch House re-opened its doors last Monday, and today Peggy and I had the absolute pleasure of having breakfast there. The food is superb, as always, and the service is excellent.  Chicken-fried steak (either with cream gravy or with green pork chili) is wonderfully favorable and not just breading. The burritos are always top notch.  It is a pleasure to welcome back this neighborhood place!
