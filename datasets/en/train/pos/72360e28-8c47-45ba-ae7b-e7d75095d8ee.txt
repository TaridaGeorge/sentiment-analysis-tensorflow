I really like this place and I must say it's the best pizza I have had West of Chicago.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but I like that.  It's kid friendly so it's a great casual place to be with family and friends without a pretentious side to it.

The lines can be a little long at times but I think it's worth the wait.
