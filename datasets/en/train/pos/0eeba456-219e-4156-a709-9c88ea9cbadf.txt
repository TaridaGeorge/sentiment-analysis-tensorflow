A friend from work recommended these ladies to me.  It's in a small strip mall on the N/W corner of Thomas and Hayden but don't think that's too far to go if you live in Central PHX like me - this place is definitely worth it! Amazing treatments. 

I was so relaxed during the reflexology part I felt I was floating. They do different therapies but I like the 45 minutes chair massage for my neck, back, shoulders (amazing and complete) followed up with 30 minutes of foot treatment which includes reflexology, energy work, soothing warm water foot bath  - You just have to go and experience them for yourself. Very reasonable price. 

I have already been twice and will be heading back this week.
