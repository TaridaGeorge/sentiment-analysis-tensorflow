What can you say about a gas station? They have good gas at fair prices, usually cheaper that what similar grade companies are charging. All of their locations are clean and set up the same. If I'm on the road and have to use a bathroom, I almost always look for a QuikTrip because I know it'll be clean. Their staff is friendly, clean, and if there is a line inside the cashier has the ability to assist multiple people at once.
