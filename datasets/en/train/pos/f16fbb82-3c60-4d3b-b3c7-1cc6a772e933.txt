Came here on a sat night at 1125 and there was still a good crowd, not packed/crowded. We were greeted by a very nice lady who informed us that there was only 5 min until last call, but if we decided to stay then we would get served immediately. And we did! Our server was prompt, friendly, and knowledgable about all the different beers they had. The beer that is on tap changes everyday, giving a great variety to choose from. Great ambiance, excellent customer service, I highly recommend checking it out.
