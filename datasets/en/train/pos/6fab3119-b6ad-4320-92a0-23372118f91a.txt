To all of you Over- Easy haters. Get bent.  Honestly, if this place was so bad, why give it two stars instead of one? If you going to get all Office Space on somthin' , put your big-boy pants on and drop the friggen' hammer! Also don't write a review just because they were closed when you had a snack attack and it fizzed you.   This is A M E R I C A, not communist china  (YOU EAT EGG NOW!) the proprietors of this fine establishment can open and close as they see fit.

And to finish, this place is the king, better than Matt's.  I like Matt's but it is Over Easy's bitch.  Squirell style.
