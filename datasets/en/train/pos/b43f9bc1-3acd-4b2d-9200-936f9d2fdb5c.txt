I have never had the kind of amazing food like the food I had at the Arrogant Butcher!!!  Not only is it very trendy and fun, but it is also just a great place for hanging out!  

I order the pretzel bun sandwhich...have never had anything like that before I tried and it was out of this world.  It was one of the best dining experiences I had in a long time.  Everything was fabulous from the experience to the staff.  

They also had wonderful cocktails and the happy hour was decent as well!  

Highly recommend this place to everyone!
