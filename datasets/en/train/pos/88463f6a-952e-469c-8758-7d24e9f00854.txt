This is my neighborhood store and I am so glad that it is, shopping here allows me to get a quick healthy meal or snack whenever I wish. The store is always clean and the staff is friendly. About 3 months ago when their ground turkey breast was in their Fearless Flyer  Ad and they couldn't keep it in stock, after my 3rd trip there I gave up on it and purchased a higher priced item but then asked the manager when would the next shipment arrive they told me the date gave me a card to call them to have the item held and refunded my money on the higher priced item making it free. You gotta love that kind of service. Oh and bananas for .19 cents each is always a treat.
