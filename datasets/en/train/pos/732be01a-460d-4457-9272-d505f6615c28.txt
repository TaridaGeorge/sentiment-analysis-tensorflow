I LOVE Pilates Palace as well! Kathy is personable, friendly, welcoming, most attentive and overall an excellent owner and trainer. I love my sessions!! I am already seeing amazing changes to my body, and an great increase in my strength and endurance. I would highly recommend Kathy and her Pilates studio to anyone.
