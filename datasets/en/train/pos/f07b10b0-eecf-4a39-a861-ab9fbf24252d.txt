First of all this place is where you are going to get the best deal on furniture, NOBODY can beat their prices on furniture, It is NOT overpriced at all. The owners are only rude to people that try to bargain when the owners are already not making much of a profit from what they are selling, to help stupid customers afford things, where they cant elsewhere. All in all, this is a liquidation center, they dolet you know if pieces are missing or if something is broken. Love this place!!!! Best deals anywhere....Thanks Mega...from the people out there that are not rich and need help in this economy buying things for the home, makeup, furniture, tv's, mattresses, etc.. Keep up the good work!!!
