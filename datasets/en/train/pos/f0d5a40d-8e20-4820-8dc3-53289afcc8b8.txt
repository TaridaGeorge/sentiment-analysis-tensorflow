I love this store!!! So much they know me by name and if there isn't a line I'll sit and shoot the shit with the employees!! Haha! That's how shopping should be... Like Cheers! 

You'll find everything you need here. And like other stores, things you don't need to! 

(good store, stocked, nice employees. Sorry, it's a CVS, I can't write a "real" review. You get what you get here, a drugstore!)
