I will leave California just to eat here! I ate at the Phoenix location first and then I went to Atlanta and it was just as good!!
I even had fried frog legs and they were excellent! So far everything I tried was very good and they also give you plenty to eat.
They didn't have any LOUISIANA BACK BAY BAYOU BUNNY BORDELAIS A' LA ANTOINE though. :-)
