This place is a killer find and I can't wait to go back again to try their new menu that they introduced yesterday.  We went on Monday and the place was jumping!  A group of friends and I sat at the bar and had good service, great wine (they have a very eclectic wine list) and the food was AMAZING!!!  Although the bar is a totally cool place to sit, the next time I want to sit on a patio, I'm heading here!  Great job!
