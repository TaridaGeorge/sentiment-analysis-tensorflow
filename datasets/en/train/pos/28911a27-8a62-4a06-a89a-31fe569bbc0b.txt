Went to check out this new treat place and was completely impressed.....I was like "Oh hell ya, vegan gelato!!!!"

Frank helped us out, offering us samples and letting us know what he puts in the gelatos to make them. I chose a bit of the Pistachio Soy Gelato and Chocolate Soy Amaretto. There wasn't a bit left in the bowl after 5 minutes. 

I am going to be gaining some pounds over the summer. I can already tell.
