So my wife and I walked into Vintage 95 two weeks ago.  Looking for lunch and a spot for New Years Eve dinner.  Wow! I said to myself.  Been looking for a place like this in the east valley forever.  Cozy, comfort with a great fireplace inside and killer patio outback.  
We had lunch on the comfy couch in front of the fireplace.  Great wine list,  well thought out menu that delivers, and service that fits the food and atmosphere.  

Went back with party of 6 for New Years Eve dinner.  The experience was great and the price for the fixed menu was amazingly low for the quality.  The staff was a little busy with the place being packed as it was, but again they delivered the goods.  

Thanks Vintage 95....we've been waiting for you for a long time.
