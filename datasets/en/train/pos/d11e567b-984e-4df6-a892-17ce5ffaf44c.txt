Niccoli's is a gem in Phoenix and if you blinked while driving by on 16th St., you'd miss it.

Family owned and run, it's everything you'd expect from a little Italian deli that you'd commonly find on the east coast.

It's a great place to stop in for lunch to grab an Italian sandwich - extra Italian dressing!
