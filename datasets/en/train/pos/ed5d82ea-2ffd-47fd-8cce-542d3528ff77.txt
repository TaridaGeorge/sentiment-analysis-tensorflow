Try adobo rice! Everything was good! Since none of Indonesian restaurant in Arizona, the foods in this restaurant was similar with Indonesian foods with different name such as La Ing for Cassava leaf coconut sauce or "Sayur Singkong," Sinigang fish soup was awsome although I prefer with pampano fish (they didn't use this fish)...I always come again! Highly recommended!
