I was in the market or a new Computer and thought I would give them a try. I went in and talked to Mr. Cady about my options. He showed me some models that where out with Linix on them. I checked them out and was very impressed!!!! I did not know that with Linix you get free  software. So they built me a new computer that I have been using for about a few weeks and I could not be any happier. Thank you Redseven
