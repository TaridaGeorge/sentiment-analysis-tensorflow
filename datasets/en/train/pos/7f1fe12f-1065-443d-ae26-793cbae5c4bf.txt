Jacquee's is my lunch time savior.  Oh, ok, breakfast too.  Actually, there is nothing that I have had that I didn't like.

The veggie sandwich is fabulous.  If iced tea is your drink of choice ... Jacquee's usually has 2 or 3 flavors, in addition to just plain old iced tea.

My favorite meal at Jacquee's is breakfast.  They carry a line of oatmeal, Umpqua oats.  WOW, WOW, WOW!  Yeah, it's pre made, but still a healthy, filling, tasty option.
