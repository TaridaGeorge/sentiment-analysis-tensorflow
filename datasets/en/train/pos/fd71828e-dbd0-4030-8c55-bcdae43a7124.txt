Salt River Fields is nice but Scottsdale Stadium is still the gold standard.  Of course I may be biased since I'm a life-long Giants fan.

Great atmosphere with fantastic people watching.  Hanging out in Old Town before and after the game rather than walking through miles and miles of parking lots like at other ballparks is what makes this place one of a kind here in AZ.

Go Giants!!
