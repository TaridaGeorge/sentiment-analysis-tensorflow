There is not much more I can say that has not been said by previous Yelpers. This place is just plain awesome. 

We went to St. Francis with another couple for dinner and we all just loved this place. The open air dining room, lemonade cocktail, cauliflower & curry soup, the pot roast on Texas toast, the service - all five star and I wasn't blown away by the check. Mmm I am salivating for more of the soup as I sit. 

St Francis will the first place I think of when I want to "show off" the culinary options of Phoenix to visitors.
