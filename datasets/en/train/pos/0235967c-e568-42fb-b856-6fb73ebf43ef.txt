This winebar is sexier than a fall desert night.  Or I should say WITH.  And given the clientele, service, and menu, it still feels down to earth.  I think Postino knows he's hot, so I'm not sure how he pulls it off.

The bruschetta menu is an interesting concept - 4 big slabs of fresh baked artisan bread, each heaped with your choice of toppings (like fig/prosciutto/marscarpone or tomato jam/sheep's milk cheese). The $24 bottle of Carmenere was complex and perfect with the food, surely a much pricier bottle masquerading as reasonable to make me happy.  Appetizers like white bean hummus and an artichoke dip you'd never catch dead at Chili's were also excellent.
