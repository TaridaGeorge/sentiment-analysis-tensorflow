Look for the sign!
Found myself in Phoenix for a weekend vacation. The main purpose was to check out the grand canyon and catch a baseball game but I ended up finding one of the best BBQ joints in the country. After trying Memphis, Carolinas and Texas BBQ...the last place i expected to find great BBQ food would be in the desert. I noticed the big sign while driving down the highway and decided to go in. Its an upscale kind of atmosphere...well compared to what you find in Texas. Nice patio for dining when its not to hot. We got the 4 meat platter...and it was some of the best BBQ I have ever come across. I only wish they had one in Jersey. The have some great appetizers and mixed drinks in pineapples as well. Good wait staff, great mac n cheese too!! TRY IT
