Essence Bakery has the BEST macarons in town! Yummy~

The establishment itself is pretty cozy and the servers are always friendly.  Their menu is stocked full of feel-goof cuisine that leaves you content.  If you're starving, I wouldn't recommend this place only because the portions are modest.  The food is always tasty and I love their potato salad!

But really, I recommend this place for their macarons alone.
