What can I say about Sakana? It's the best by far in the West Valley!!!!! Not only do they serve the biggest pieces sushi but its always super fresh & wonderfully prepared. They also have the best staff & chefs who are always friendly and accommodating whenever we come in which is almost every Friday for lunch! We really feel like at home when we dine there for lunch and the service is super. Bravo to Yoshi, Tomo! Yuko! Jun! Oscar! Ian! the entire team (sorry if I missed a name) and JunJi who is now in Chandler.
