Great place!I'm 6'0, 215lbs and the plate that I got was too much for me to finish and I was starving.

The waitress was very nice as well. No matter what you order to drink it'll come in a Mason jar.

The food was great and the chicken was not greasy at all. The cool thing is they leave you alone enough to eat and enjoy your food without ignoring you, great balance in customer service.

The only bad thing is I have to drive all the way to Scottsdale from my home in Chandler!
