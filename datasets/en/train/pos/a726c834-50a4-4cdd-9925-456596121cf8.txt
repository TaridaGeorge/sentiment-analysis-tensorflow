Took the family here for breakfast. The exterior was unassuming and did not prepare us for how delicious the food inside would be. The croissants and pastries were particularly delicious and complemented the meal really well. Everything was fresh and the service by the owner was very attentive and welcoming (not the French stereotype). The only downside was it took a bit longer to get an extra cup of coffee as he had to brew a new batch. The upside was even the coffee was good.

The entire family enjoyed their breakfast and we would return without hesitation.
