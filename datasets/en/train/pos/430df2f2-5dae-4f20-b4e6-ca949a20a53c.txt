I exist in the world of shared-custody or partial custody of a pooch. The 'ex' has her company most of the time, I usually enjoy her when he's traveling or not looking. 

Recently, I took care of her while he was away. She and I had a party. We went running, walking, and she sniffed her way through my neighborhood. We headed to Chaparral Dog Park, and I have to say, I was so pleased at how clean and well kept the area is. My tax dollars are being well utilized.

The park is crowded, but its a good crowd. Everyone seems to have the same mission: to let their dogs sniff, run, play and socialize with other dogs, while they sniff, run, play and socialize with each other. Its pretty much a win-win!
