No matter how hard anyone tries, they just can't top Victoria's Secret.  They have the best in lingerie, undies, bras, lotions, pajama's and candles.

I really like that no matter how sexy a thong or bra might be a VS, it's still classy.  If you want trashy, I'm sure there' s a Frederick's nearby.

If you can catch them when they're having a sale, you can usually get some pretty good deals and they have one huge annual sale every year. But you have to be one of the first to get there or you'll get the picked through stuff and that's never fun. 

There's nothing bad I can say about VS, except I wish the prices were a little lower, but don't we all.
