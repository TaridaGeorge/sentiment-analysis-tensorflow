Pitta Souvli is exactly what a neighborhood Greek restaurant should be. Family owned, family run and the food is wonderful. I used to come here every Monday for happy hour until my job got in the way :( I still frequent it often and when I'm in the mood for a great gyro I know exactly where to go. Everyone I've introduced to Pita Souvli has become a regular as well. I tried what must have been a special hummus one day (avocado I think) and I really hope they consider adding it to the menu. Happy hour can't be beat as well with half price drinks! Definitely one of my favorite lunch/hh spots. Try it, you won't be disappointed.
