I thought that once I'd seen one Party City, I'd seen them all, but then I walked into this Party City. Everything here is organized and they seem to have a much larger selection of party items then some other Party Cities. The rows are themed based on boy themes, girl themes and adult themes. There is an entire candle aisle equipped even with color-specific candies (which are great for theme parties). They have an extensive costume aisle as well. All-in-all, this is going to be my new go-to Party City!
