Ok this place was great...so great I decided to sign up on yelp and contribute to the rave reviews that encouraged me to try it out in the first place. I had the fish tacos happy hour appetizer for dinner and they we cooked and seasoned well. They were really good and I would definitely order again. I was told it is off season in August, but the place was filled with locals; all very welcoming. Everyone knew everyone and if they didn't (like me) it didn't take long to feel like one of the locals. Great service, too. Will definitely go back!
