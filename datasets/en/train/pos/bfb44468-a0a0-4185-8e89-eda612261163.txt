Amazing! You come up to this place and you know it is special. Run by a very nice group of women and they make different items each day. I had the three item plate with Kale and Peanut salad, curry and coconut brown rice and pinto beans with squash, and then my friends and I split some oat and apple bars that were delicious. 

You can try anything you want out of the cold deli counter and prices were reasonable for food that is not only good for you but made from scratch. I love this place, can't wait to go back!
