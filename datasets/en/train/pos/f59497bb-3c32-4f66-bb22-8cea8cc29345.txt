Was here for a wedding a week ago, great wedding, with a really picturesque setting. Quite beautiful at night. 

Service was good, the venue was very cool and the food was quite good as well, which is rare for wedding catering. I can't talk much about the hotel itself, but everything came together really nicely. Bar service at the wedding was very good, and they had a huge selection of beer, wine and liquor which is always nice. The made to order pasta bar was a nice touch.

For a wedding venue, it seems like an awesome place, and if I had family or friends visiting that wanted a nice place to stay, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend The Buttes.

I hope I have a reason to come back here at some point, especially if it's a night event so I can see that view again.
