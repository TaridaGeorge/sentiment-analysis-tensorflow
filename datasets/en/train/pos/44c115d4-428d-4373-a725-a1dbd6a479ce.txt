Had dinner there with family on Saturday. Celebrated an anniversary with my in-laws who love this restaurant.

I had the biggest pork chop I have ever seen. It was delicious and really hit the spot.

I tried the Carrot soup which had ginger and coconut in it. Outstanding. 

The wine selection was great and our table had a few bottles to compliment the dinner.

The view there is terrific and the service was great as well.
