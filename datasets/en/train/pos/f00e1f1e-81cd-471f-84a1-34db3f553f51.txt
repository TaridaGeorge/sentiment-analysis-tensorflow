Um...FUN!!! And affordable! Took my 4 year old nephew here, to ride the "fast race cars" and he loved it! The go cart track is fun as can be, and the 2 person go carts even had a second "steering wheel" that he could pretend to use (other go carts don't always have the second wheel, and he is very serious about steering). Anywhoo, we also did the bumper boats, and those were just as damn fun! Wait times in line were nil, and prices are cheap. I highly recommend this place! Can't wait to go again.
