holy crap this is some good food!! :)

everytime i visit AZ i go here for breakfast... i love it!!

bacon and eggs- good
biscuits and gravy- yum!!
corned beef hash and eggs- WOW!!
scrambles- seriously now...

and of course my silly-ass loves to walk to the circle k around the corner to enjoy a 40 of bud light while waiting to be seated (because there's always a wait no matter what time i go).. SUPER!!!

hey Ian S- you should come eat here if you're ever in Tempe again soon... i'll meet you there!! :)
