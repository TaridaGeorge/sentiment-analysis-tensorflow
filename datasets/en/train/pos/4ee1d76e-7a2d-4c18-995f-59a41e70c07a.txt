Really like this location because it's conveniently located next to the Dollar Tree and they always have sales on their pet items! After my initial visit, I switched my cats food selection to Blue Buffalo per a cashier's recommendation.  At first I was skeptical looking at the size of the bag & its price tag but as she explained off the top of her head the ingredients and even her own cat's experience with the food, I was sold. 

Needless to say, I've been coming back ever since to purchase their food and once in awhile, toys. They have a great selection of feather sticks with any and every attachment you could ever think of. Another plus: they're all pretty reasonably priced!
