Finally found a restaurant that serves quality korean food. Had to travel a bit, but well worth it. Host was friendly and explained things thoroughly. The food is authentic with side dishes served and all. I was incredibly skeptical of trying korean food in Arizona, but this place while not the best I have ever had, was enough to quench my craving.
