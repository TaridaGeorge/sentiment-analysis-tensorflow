This Starbucks location is always fast, friendly, & clean! I had an issue with an expired drink for the Starbucks App (Great App) and one of the baristas saw that I was disappointed in the fact that it had expired without my knowing. She was very polite and apologized and offered me a coupon for my next visit! That's great customer service...especially during the busy Holiday Season!
