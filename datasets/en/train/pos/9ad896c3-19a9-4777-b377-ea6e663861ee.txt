This salon is a real find in my book!  It's conveniently located, the service is excellent, the quality of work is outstanding & efficient.  My "pink & white" acrylic nails are always awesome.  Often I get a pedicure at the same time as my acrylic nails and can be on my way in only one hour!  The atmosphere is really nice because the owner and salon employees work together as a team.  Scottsdale Nail is my nail salon forever! LT
