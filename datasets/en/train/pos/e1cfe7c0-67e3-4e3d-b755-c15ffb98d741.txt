Best dentists around. Everyone there, from the receptionist, to the dental hygienists, to the dentists, treat you like family.

The office has all the newest technology and therefore a quick turnaround on things like crowns.

You feel very comfortable (which is not always easy in a dentists office) from the moment you walk in. You can watch tv (any channel you like) while getting your procedures done.

I recommended them to several friends and everyone agreed once going there that they would never go to another dentist. I now live in CA and drive back for any dental work.

You leave feeling confident in the work you had done, and truly feel like an individual they care about rather than just another patient. Highly recommend this office to anyone.
