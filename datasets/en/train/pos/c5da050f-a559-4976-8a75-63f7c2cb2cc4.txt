Loved this souper salad! By far the best one. Looks wise is gorgeous. Nice and clean and new. Better then the other one I was going to on stapley and the 60 ( whatever you do, don't go) 

The staff was super friendly. I even got a to-go cup free to take home with me. 

The food display was gorgeous. Lot more veggies in the salad.. Good pasta, amazing pizza! 

They also had a really good tiny section to make your own lil icecreams. But the strawberry shortcake is always my favourite. 

A big thanks to Rand H. for going to this place and making a good review. He is the king of buffetts lol. 

I will be coming to this souper salad once a week. I'm so glad it's here!
