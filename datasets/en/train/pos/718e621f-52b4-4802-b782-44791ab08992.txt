Looking for a nicer Asian-style restaurant? Do you need a break from your standard Japanese and Thai fare? Then check out this place.

My husband and I started with the samosas, then I went with the Jumbo Prawns Coconut Curry. He went with the Jumbo Prawns Curry. Sounds like a minor distinction, I know, but the two main dishes, served family-style, tasted quite different, and he went with spice level 2 (I stuck with the still-hot-for-me level 1).

The servers were very kind and attentive.

I definitely recommend it.
