We stayed at the Valley Ho for my birthday in September. I am a card-carrying member of the unabashedly poor, collegiate demographic, so the bill I racked up hurt my feelings (and credit rating), but it was totally worth it.

Despite recent renovations, the Valley Ho retains much of its retrograde splendor. The bathroom was perfectly designed to nurse a post-celebration hangover - I was prepared to live in the gigantic bathtub, which came equipped with sufficient railing for stumbly-drunks like me. The open patio outside was furnished with the most comfortable chairs and overlooked the lavish courtyard, occasionally affording us an unceremonious glimpse of our neighbors. Nice, cozy bar - pricey, but you'll feel so luxurious while you're whittling away at your bank account, that it won't even matter how many overdraft fees you accrue the next day.
