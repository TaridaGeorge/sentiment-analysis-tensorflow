The sushi is great and the prices are unbeatable. Their happy hour is half off of almost all sushi and the happy hour is available almost all of the time. Each guest gets free miso soup, sesame dressing salad, and edamame. You can have some ice cream at the end if you have room left. The service is good and everyone is friendly. I highly recommend the Mido roll and the Fried Jalapeno Yellowtail roll. The Gyoza roll is also delicious.
