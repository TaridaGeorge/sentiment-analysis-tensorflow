I have been here a half dozen times but realized I hadn't written a review after my last visit. I love Tarbell's, plain and simple. The food here is always spot-on and they have some of the best comfort food selections. The spaghetti and meatballs are so good I have had day dreams about them!  Their mac and cheese is smashing as well, we usually get an order of it for the table to share. I recently got the scottish salmon and it was top-notch. For dessert, their creme brulee is amazing- wow! 
It is definitely a treat to eat here!!
