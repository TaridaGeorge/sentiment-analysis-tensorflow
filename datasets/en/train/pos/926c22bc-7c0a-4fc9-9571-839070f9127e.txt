My gf and I came for date night and we had such a good time. I'd been here before, but it was her first time. From walking in through the kitchen, to sitting down for dinner, our experience was 5 star. I made our reservation from Yelp (easy as hell) and even though we were late to dinner, we were accommodated in every way.
