So far I've had the Chipotle Egg Burrito and the Huevos n' Chorizo. Both were phenomenal and had everything I love in a breakfast meal. Simple ingredients with a good amount of spice and served piping hot. Portions are on the larger size, especially for the burrito. I enjoyed that it came with a side salad, it irrationally made me feel better about eating such a loaded burrito so early in the morning. During both my visits this place was moderately packed but the line moved quick and my friends and I never had a hard time finding a table. Also, their Bloody Mary's are only $5.
