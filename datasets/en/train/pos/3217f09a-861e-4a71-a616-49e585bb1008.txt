I love this restaurant so much that it has become a weekly routine for breakfast. The breakfast is amazing -- my favorites are the cinnamon french toast and any of their skillets.  They recently added chocolate chip scones to the menu, thanks to my recommendation! I have only had one of their sandwiches and have no complaints there, either. This location is a little hard to find, but is definitely worth it!!
