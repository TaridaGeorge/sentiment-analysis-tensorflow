I've dined at the Keg twice and both times left very pleased, this last time was exceptional.
The service was incredible throughout th meal, the food was superb (I very highly recommend the rib steak), the sirloin Oscar my wife ordered was accompanied with the most excellent scallops I have ever tasted (though the shrimp was slightly over salted, my only critique). 
Again, maybe the best dining experience I have ever had, which says a lot. Well done.
