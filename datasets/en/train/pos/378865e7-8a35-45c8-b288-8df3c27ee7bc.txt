I've been going to the Cornish Pasty Co. for years now.  I love the atmosphere of this little place, it is small and cozy. The service is good... i have never had a bad experience with the service and had a couple of really good ones. I actually wrote a poem about one of the waitresses but I'm not going to go into that. 

Now with that out of the way I can talk about the food. I love these little Pasties! My personal favorite is the Pilgrim... but the Chicken Rosemary, Stake Rosemary and Cajan are wonderful too, not to mention the Bangers & Mash, and Shepard's Pie. 

After all this... one of my families favorite this to do is just order a half dozen pasties to go and bring them home and just smorgasbord!
