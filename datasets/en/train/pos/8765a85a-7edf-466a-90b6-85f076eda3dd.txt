Some of the best Shrimp tacos I've ever had. Beer battered, everything made fresh. Great authentic Mexican vibe, lot's of Dia De Los Muertos related art throughout. An extensive salsa bar with many clever flavors, many more than most places. Cilantro lime cream sauce, pecan salsa, seven pepper salsa... etc. You get the picture. This place deserves all the hype. Really nice service, very original ideas and flavors like you will taste no where else. Go check this place out for yourself. I personally will now be a regular here.
