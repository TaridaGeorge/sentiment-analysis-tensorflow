This is a "Must Attend" charity event!  Ever been to the Scottsdale Culinary event where every skinny person is afraid to eat in public?  This puts Scottsdale Culinary to shame.  They don't call it Devoured for nothing.  Everyone is friendly and no one is afraid to eat.  It's an all-you-can-eat and drink fest with all of the the local valley restaurants and bars.  Sunday was too busy but Saturday was pleasant!  Don't miss it next year!
