Everything was great, the appetizer, I think it was the fried egg and bacon dish that won me over.  From there the entrees, seared tuna, lived up to expectations and finished off with donuts and 3 different dips.  There was a surprise of cotton candy at the end of the meal that you can't help but finish off even if you're done.

I'll be back again.
