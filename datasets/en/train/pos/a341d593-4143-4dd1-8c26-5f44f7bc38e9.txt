Typical Quizno's menu, restaurant is clean, service is good, but can get real busy around lunchtime. The parking lot its tiny with about 10 slots, and is shared by 3 or 4 other businesses on the corner. Best solution is to park off indian school, west of the restaurant, in one of the neighboring businesses. Is just south (across the street) of the hospital, on the southwest corner of indian school and 7th street.
