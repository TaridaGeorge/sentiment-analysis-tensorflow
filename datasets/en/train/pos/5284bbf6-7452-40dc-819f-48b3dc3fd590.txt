This absolutely earned 5 stars from my husband and I. The food, the service, the atmosphere were all outstanding. The beef medallions with shrimp were served with vegetables that were perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned, and accompanied by a rice pilaf that is every bit as delicious as Mama makes.
