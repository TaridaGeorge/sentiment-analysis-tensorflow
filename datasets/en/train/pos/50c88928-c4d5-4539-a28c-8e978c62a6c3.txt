the vets here are fabulous as is every solitary, single person working there. we especially like dr. kristen levine. she's a relatively new vet, but her empathy, skills and intelligence are top notch. almost a year ago, one of our dogs became critically ill.  dr. levine fought to save her life from the kidney and liver failures and she did save her life. it was a long, hard fight for 2 1/2 months, but frankie survived those health issues.  every time i've called with a question or concern, they respond right away. you can always get in the same day for an appointment, as they have several great vets on staff. i cannot recommend them highly enough.
