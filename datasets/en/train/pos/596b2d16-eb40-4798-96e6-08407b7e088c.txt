What's not to love about this place?  You have to love the food - I've had an excellent quesadilla (shrimp and pesto) and a great burger(Carolina burger, with BBQ sauce that's out of this world), and loved every bite.  The service is among the best I've ever received, ever.  The ambiance is nice.  The prices, while not a steal, are quite reasonable.  At risk of sounding like a whiner, I wish they had more happy hour beers.  For the price, I shouldn't complain.  And the dessert?  Best brownie sundae in the history of forever.  Awesome.  The whole package makes me want to move around the corner so I can come here every day.
