Lately, I have been making more and more visits to Hoodlums.  Part of this is my own move towards a more vinyl-based music collection.  Hoodlums has a respectable vinyl section, and I can always find two or three I like each time I'm in the store.

The staff is still friendly.  They still honor the old "music junkie" cards, despite discontinuing the program, which is a nice gesture.

The best part is all the free events they have.  There's not always a lot to do on a Friday or Saturday evening in the East Valley, so the free shows and movies they organize are definitely welcome.

Hoodlum is still the best record store around, and they're doing all they can to turn me into an even bigger music junkie.
