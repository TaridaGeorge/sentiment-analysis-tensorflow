My Mother's Restaurant.  If you want amazing food, attentive customer service, and old time ambiance, this is the place to be.  From pot roast to lasagna to prime rib, every dish is fantastic.  Whenever my husband and I go here, he likes to order the big grandfather's cut of prime rib.  Grilled.  It's delicious and filling.  
Don't forget to buy a pie or freshly baked bread,  to take home.  
When we lived in the delivery area, My Mother's Restaurant was our weekly take out meal.  How many places do you know where you can have pizza and prime rib delivered to your door?
