i really like this little place. the servers and bartenders are always super nice, and the sushi is on the same "signature" rolls you would see at Ra. they also have other stuff like rice dishes and such for non sushi fans, and it's cheap!

they do HH from 4 to 7 and 11 to 1 every day, sweet! oh, and they have a free video jukebox. you get a list of some vids kind of like your sushi card, mark the ones you want to see and give it to the server or Dj and viola! you get to see and hear your song. pretty cool.

inside and outside seating, very hip-ly decorated, def catering to the younger crowd (same as RA).
