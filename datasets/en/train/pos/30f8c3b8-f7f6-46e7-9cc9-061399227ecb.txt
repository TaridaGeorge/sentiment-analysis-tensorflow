Who knew?! This place reminded my friend and I of an old hotel lobby on the inside. It had an interesting entrance with a few main seating areas to the left and right of the lobby. They have lots of tables, which they keep really clean. 

If you like Thai food, eat here. The food was delicious! Great portions too! We ordered Phat Thai with veggies. It had the right amount of everything! We also ordered a veggie curry. If you are not a big eater, each dish has plenty to share. 

The service was friendly and attentive...even when we were the last ones there at the end of the night.

I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!
