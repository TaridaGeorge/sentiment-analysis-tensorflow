Cheap! Fresh! Flavorful!
That's the important stuff!

I love trying new things and Breadfruit did not disappoint! I was a big fan of the jerk chicken, grilled plantains and fruity juices! 

Pros: small cute setting, BYOB, $10 plate, every dish had a couple of sides that came with. 

Cons: street parking, service can be a bit slow.
