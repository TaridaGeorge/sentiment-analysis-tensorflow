This place is awesome! The atmosphere is nice and the service is great. The food is amazing and reasonably priced. I think this place is great if you love sushi but don't want to spend a fortune. Also they make good drinks, my gf especially loves the watermelon martini! So yeah, I definitely recommend this place for sushi lovers!
