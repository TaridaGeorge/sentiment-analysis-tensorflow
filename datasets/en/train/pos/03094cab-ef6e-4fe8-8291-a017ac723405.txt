We are from Venezuela and we Love this restaurant!
We couldn't find our typical food in Az, but this Restaurant bring us the opportunity to experience it again.
I have brought Colombian and Venezuelan friends and all of them love it!  Specially the Arepa de Pabellon, Cachapa and the Patacon!
And for drink you have to try the Papelon con Limon and the Chicha.

Friendly owners and staff !
