Met a friend for Sunday brunch and sat at a table outside.  The atmosphere was outstanding, quiet and peaceful.  I had the sausage and cheese omelet that came with a biscuit and hash browns, all smothered with white gravy.  All I can say is, "Incredibly delicious!" 

Yoli herself waited on us and was wonderful.  No waiting to be seated, served or for coffee refills.  One of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time.  We are new customers for life.  What a find, thanks to yelp.
