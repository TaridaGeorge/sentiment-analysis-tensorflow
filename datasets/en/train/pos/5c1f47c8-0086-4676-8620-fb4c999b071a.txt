I know everyone is going the way of Netflix these days, but I still really love Superstar Video.  They have a great selection of indie films and blockbusters, new releases and older movies.  And I love the 5 movies for 5 days for 5 bucks deal on the older videos.  It makes it so easy to rent an entire season of a TV show.

Their new releases aren't too expensive, somewhere around $3.  No cards to remember to take with you either, you just give them your name.  And, you get to support a local business that deserves your patronage.
