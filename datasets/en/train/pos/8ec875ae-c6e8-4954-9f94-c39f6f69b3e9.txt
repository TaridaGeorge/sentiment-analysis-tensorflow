I was really impressed with the tour! We went on the 90 minute tour that's their most popular tour (there are several different tour options), and we for an awesome overview about the architecture, history, school, and Wright himself. Yes, the tour is pricier than most historic homes, but I truly feel it's worth it. We saw inside several of the buildings and enjoyed the exteriors as well. You won't see inside all the buildings because this is a functioning school of design (would you want a tour group snapping pictures while you were trying to work in your drafting studio at school?). The gift shop is fun to browse around and is full of awesome books and everything Frank Lloyd Wright. I`m glad I splurged on this tour and went today.
