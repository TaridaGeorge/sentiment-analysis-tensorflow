Is it weird to love an optometrist? Because I do. I love the office staff. I love that a visit is quick. I love that they remember me and are friendly. I love the office as a whole. I've been seeing Dr. Greene for a while now and I think no matter where I'll live in the valley...I'll see them for my eye care. They really are just that fabulous.
