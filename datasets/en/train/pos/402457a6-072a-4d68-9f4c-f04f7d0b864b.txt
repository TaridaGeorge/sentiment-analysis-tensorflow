My puppy loves to come here.  Not only did she get a lovely bath and haircut last time but we always find wonderful treats and toys.  This trip she got some great bones and a new collar.  If you need a gift for a pet lover, this is the place to come!  I got a friend some of the pup-cakes (dogfoodie cupcakes - super cute) and a doggy toy for a newly adopted pet.  And I love getting to see and pet the 2 kitties that are there - since I can't have a cat :-(
