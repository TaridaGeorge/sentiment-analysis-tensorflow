Ah, the little things I miss about living in Arizona.  For instance, the Chicago Hamburger Co.

What a gem.  You'd drive right past this place without blinking an eye, just another dive place branding itself  "Chicago" or "New York".  NOT!

This is the best slider I've ever had.  Holy crap they are good.  Reminders of White Castle and Krystal burgers, except these are better.  In other words, it doesn't have to be 4am while trashed to make them taste great.

The fries???  PERFECTION.  That right combo of crispy on the outside, yet nice and soft on the inside, not overcooked, not undercooked.  The perfect fry.  It's beautiful.  It's art.

Where is Dorothy's slippers???  There's no place like home...there's no place like home...
