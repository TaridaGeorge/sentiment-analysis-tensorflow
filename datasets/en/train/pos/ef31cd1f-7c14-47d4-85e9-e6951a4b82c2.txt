As far as cheap chinese food goes, this place does it right!  Ken and Karen are always friendly and serve up satisfying food in a flash.  I really like the teryaki or house chicken, although the mongolian beef is a close third.  Favorite menu item: the curry beef roll.  Best thing about Chopstick: the prices.  5$ lunch combos make this my number one lunch destination!
