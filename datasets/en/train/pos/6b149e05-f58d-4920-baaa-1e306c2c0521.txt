Stopped by for dinner after going to the Phoenix Zoo.  This was a great find!

We had two large thin crust pizzas and orders of bbq and hot wings.  The pizza crust was the thinnest I've ever had and it was wonderfully crispy.  The toppings were great and fresh parmesan tossed over the pizza after it was served to the table made it perfect.

The hot wings were some of the best I've ever tasted.

Outdoor seating in the courtyard was neat with overhead heaters, but we had a party of 10.  Long wait for outdoor seating made us decide on an inside seating.  It was still great, although I think the outdoor seating would have been even better.

They don't take call in reservations, by the way.

Great service, great food.  We'll go back again for sure.
