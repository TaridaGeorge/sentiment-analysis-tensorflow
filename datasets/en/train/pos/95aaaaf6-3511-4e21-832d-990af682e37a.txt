I was referred to Lowell through my guitar teacher. I brought him in a JCM800 50W combo I had recently bought. Not only did he swap all of the cheaper components Marshall was using at the time for top-grade ones, he (at my request of course) basically altered the circuit to be more like a Marshall Plexi. Now I have tons of clean headroom and have a wonderfully punchy, beautiful sounding amp. Additionally, he made those alterations in a way that can be easily reversed if I ever wanted back the JCM 800 circuit. Lowell is professional, responds quickly, and certainly knows anything and everything there is to know about making your amp sound the best it possibly can. 

Thanks Lowell.
