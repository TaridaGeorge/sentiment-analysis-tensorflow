Props for Phil and his shop.  Phil does nice work.  This is a great guy's shop without being a too "TOTALLY EXTREME SPORTS MUSIC SUPER COOL FOR MEN" shop, too.

The hot towel is the best.  I hate haircuts, but this is a place I'll actually go back to every month.  Very good shop and a place worth supporting.
