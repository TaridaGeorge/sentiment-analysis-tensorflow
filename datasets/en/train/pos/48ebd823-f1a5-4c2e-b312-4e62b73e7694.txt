This place is a GEM! I've been going to Alice Rae off/on for years and they've always demonstrated outstanding customer service. Bra shopping isn't always fun, and the owner (Julia) is kind, compassionate, and exceptionally knowledgable about her products and how to successfully items to each woman's unique shape. I've never left the store disappointed, and I've sent friends to over the years who are also Alice Rae converts. I wish more people knew of this store because you leave feeling good about yourself and your body.
