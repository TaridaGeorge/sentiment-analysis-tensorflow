I haven't eaten sushi outside of the Phoenix area, but still feel safe in saying that Toyama has the best sushi in Arizona.  In fact it stands right up there with the best sushi I've had in Japan.  Their fish is always incredibly fresh and consistent, unlike other (usually very good) restaurants.  If you're in the mood for something cooked, the saikyo yaki is really outstanding and goes very well with a glass of sake. Chef Mo and his wife Mimi are incredibly warm and friendly, and I really miss dining at Toyama.
