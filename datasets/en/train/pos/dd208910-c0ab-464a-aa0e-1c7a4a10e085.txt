5 stars for freshly cooked to order food, healthy options and low prices. The chicken is much better than the beef and I love that they include fresh fruit with the plate. My only gripes are that I asked for brown rice and they gave me white rice and the veggies arn't as plentiful as the description makes you think. *Update, I just realized I ordered the plate without veggies instead of the Works plate which does include lots of veggies.* Other than that Chix has very good service and they accept coupons you can find online from the My Sundevil Handbook or whatever. I would come back to Chix and order just a couple of sides of chicken instead of ordering a plate next time.
