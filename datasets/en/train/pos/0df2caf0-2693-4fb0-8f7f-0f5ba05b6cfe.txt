I had a problem with a pc that I purchased from the Microsoft store. Worst case scenario, or so I thought. I contacted customer support. I spoke with a few people who were all very helpful and pleasant but could not fix the problem. I  was the put in contact with William Zollicoffer a support  agent. I was able to return my pc with out incident. The agent followed my problem start to finish via telephone and email.  After having many customer support problems with other companies this was a great breath of fresh air. Microsoft seems to hire employees who care about the customer. I will use the Microsoft store in the future and recommend the store to my friends and family.
