The husband and I had dinner here recently, and we were so pleased with everything that we are already planning another visit!

Service was excellent.  We ordered the NY Strip and the Top Sirloin.  Both were AMAZING.  They were cooked just the way we wanted and seasoned just right.

For dessert, the creme brulee was heavenly.  Highly recommend this place.
