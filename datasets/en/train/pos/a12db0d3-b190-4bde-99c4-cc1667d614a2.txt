I was skeptical that the desert could possibly be home to one of the country's finest sushi houses. After experiencing course after course of great contemporary sushi preparations, I can only say, "WOW."

We ordered the Omakase tasting menu ("decadent" version) and the chef visited with us to find out our likes and dislikes so that he could prepare a menu to delight.  We were not disappointed.  Every plate was beautiful and every bite was fantastic.  The nigiri and sashimi plates melted in our mouths.  The pork belly was a must have.  The grilled shishito peppers with dancing bonito flakes was a surprisingly good interlude.  The tempura lobster -- decadent.  And of course, the Wagyu beef, served with several different salts, was amazing. Service was attentive but not hovering.  Their Hani and Kudachi Cooler cocktails are both delightful.

This was a two-hour journey to remember.
