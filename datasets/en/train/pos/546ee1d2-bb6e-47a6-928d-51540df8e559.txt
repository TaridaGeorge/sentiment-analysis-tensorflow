The best shrimp EVER! Perfect stake, excellent service, and OMG to die for apple cobbler.

We were told this was the "diner" type restaurant in the area. Good, because I just got off a plane, was starving and didn't feel like putting on makeup or a dress. So we went.

The inside reminded me a bit of a slightly darker version of Cheers. The seating area had overstuffed leather booths that made me want to sink in and stay for a while.

If I ate wheat, I'd be able to tell you if the honey glazed Croissant they brought out with the salad was as good as it smelled and felt. Light, fluffy, and just out of the oven. Nearly irresistible.

If you're looking for good food and great service, this is the place! I'm totally going back again tomorrow! It was that good.
