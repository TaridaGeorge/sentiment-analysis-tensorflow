Let me start off by saying I LOVE Benihana. There isn't one in the area where I live so whenever I'm out of town I try and go there for lunch or dinner.
 
My family and I had a reservation and they were ready to seat us when we arrived. The waitress was cute and super friendly, our chef was also great. Now what everyone is waiting for, the food was EPIC! I don't know if I've ever had a better meal at Benihana. 

If you're looking for an awesome meal plus good entertainment and you're willing to spend some money to treat yourself, I would definitely recommend dining here.
