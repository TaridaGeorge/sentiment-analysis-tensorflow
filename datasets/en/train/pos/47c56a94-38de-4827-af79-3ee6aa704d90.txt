Went back AGAIN and I cheated AGAIN!  

This time, I had the Harvest Kale Salad and AGAIN my deepest desires were fulfilled.  Yes, I was moaning as I ate...but I couldn't help myself.

Kale, roasted sweet potatoes, apples, BACON, pumpkin seeds, walnuts, green beans, apple cider vinaigrette, and so much more goodness on one plate.

I think I need a giant A to wear on my shirt!  Hell, I'll just wear a big W for WILDFLOWER!  She has become my mistress!
