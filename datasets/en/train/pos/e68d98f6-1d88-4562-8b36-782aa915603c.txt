My father adores their meatloaf. However, having just seen "Forks Over Knives," he has been trying to adhere to a more plant-based diet. So he wolfed down the spaghetti squash with equal, if somewhat wistful, aplomb.

I got the new Thai chicken salad, without chicken (good little vegan I am now). Wow. It was stellar, even without its central ingredient. And huge - it's enough for two meals!

Definitely coming back for this again. Like tomorrow.
