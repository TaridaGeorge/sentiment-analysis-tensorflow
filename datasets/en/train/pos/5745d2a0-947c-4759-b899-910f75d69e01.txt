Plaza is my home away from home! The atmosphere is so warm (not just because of all the dancers-lol) and comforting. It is certainly a smorgasbord of dance, music, laughter, and just pure love, for the art of the dance language and "sisterhood." If you haven't been here before, you need to stop in, even if only to see the merchandise (mucho variety!!!!).
