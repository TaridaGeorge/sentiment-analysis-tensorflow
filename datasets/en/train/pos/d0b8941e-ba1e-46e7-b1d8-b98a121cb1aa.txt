I must admit I fell into a bit of a funk when Malee's, my go-to Thai place within 10 minutes of home, closed at Desert Ridge. Where else could I get great Thai in a short drive? Luckily, I saw the Yelp praise for Thai House and tried it for lunch today. This place is authentic and delicious! The pad thai and panang chicken were both stellar! The full verdict will be in once I try their Tom Kha soup, but it was too hot for that on an AZ summer day. The service is quick and the atmosphere is nice (very light and contemporary for a Thai place). Thank you, Thai House...you are my new go-to!
