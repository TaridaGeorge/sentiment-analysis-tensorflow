I have never been impressed enough to write a review on Yelp for anything, but this place has to get my highest praises! They called when they said they would, they explained everything they were doing, and with a sense of humor about it as well.  The shuttle to work was a very welcome amenity, too, Mike was a very friendly driver..  Most impressive?  My car had failed emissions, so it was in there to get a few things repaired to help it pass.  I was dreading another long line at the testing station.  To my surprise, they took the car through for me, something I never expected.  And yes, it passed :-)  One place had quoted me $300 just to diagnose it.  These guys diagnosed it, fixed it and took it to emissions for the same amount.  I am happy, happy, happy!!  Thanks, Bob and crew!
