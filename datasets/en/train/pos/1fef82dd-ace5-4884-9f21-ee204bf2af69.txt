Excellent family style thai dining! 5/5
Osha Thai has been our favorite restaurant in the past year! This cozy and family-style restaurant never failed us everytime we dined there. They have very authetic thai food that is comparable to those in Thailand (I grew up with Thai food in Southeast Asia). They have everything from your typical pad thai, seafood somtum (green papaya salad) to gourmet cashew duck. The price is very reasonable with this kind of quality! Service always excellent!
