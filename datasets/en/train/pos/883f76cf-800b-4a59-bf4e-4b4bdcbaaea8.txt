When we arrived they got right to work.  We had a quarter size hole in the front windshield.  They were done in record time. You were all a great bunch, very attentive. Janie, who we made the appointment with was very nice.   The price was better than we expected.  Thanks for all your help.  If it happens again we will be back.
