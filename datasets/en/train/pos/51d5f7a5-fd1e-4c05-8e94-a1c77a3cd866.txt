It's really hard to beat the food quality, service, and value you get at Oregano's. Susan and I patronized the Flagstaff location weekly for years and now we are fortunate enough to live in Gilbert and have the Gilbert restaurant to visit. A little wait sometimes is part of the experience that makes it worth while... you wouldn't be waiting if it wasn't good. The salads are probably our favorites. Always enough for two people to share. Try the Italian Wedding Soup... supurb!
Good job Oregano's!
