We hosted our rehearsal dinner here in June, and the service was exceptional.  The owner (manager?) Zoran met with us earlier in the week, and we were able to custom create our event menu with him.  The night of the event went perfectly.  As it is the slow season, he shut down half of the restaurant for us to hold a coctail hour, and as our 30 guests arrived, we shuffled into the banquet room. Everyone had a full glass the entire evening, the food was fantastic all the way around, and the service could not have been better.  They were especially attentive to our table (bride and groom and our families).  I'm no longer in the foodservice industry, but having served many years, I can say with confidence that Zoran and his crew have found the perfect balance of science and art in their large party service.
