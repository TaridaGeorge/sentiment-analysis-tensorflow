It is really time for another visit to The Munchies. Gotta love a place that fresh preps everything possible, the owner serves up his fare with gusto and makes you want to try everything. The Gyros are served on amazing pitas, not dry... perhaps al dente, with excellent fries on the side. Chicken Schwarma is delicious, dolmades, and hummas cross my table often. Everything I have tried in several visits is worth a repeat. I enjoy introducing friends to my favorite spot in Tempe.  And you can stop by after everything else has closed... until 3 a.m. Really!
