Oh my gosh, what a great place to eat! We made it in time for happy hour and were very impressed with the deals. Great selection of beer. The Iceberg Wedge was a terrific beginning. We followed it up with a 'happy hour' size Pepperoni , just the right size, and a regular size Margherita. Both were so tasty; I'm sure because of the brick oven and wood fire. Whole heartily recommend!
