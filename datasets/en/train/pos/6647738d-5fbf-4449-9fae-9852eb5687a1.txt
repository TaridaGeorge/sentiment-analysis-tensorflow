We've been to En Fuego three times and practically had the place to ourselves, which I don't understand because it's ambiant, the service is great and the food is exceptionally good. Husband enjoyed his tapas of short ribs and shrimp; the broccolini was perfect -- bright and crisp. As a vegetarian, I get a little tired of pasta with vegetables, but all three times, the chef (last night it was Victor) has oblingingly made a vegetable plate that is a delectable work of art. Garlic mashed potatoes with perfectly grilled roma tomatoes, eggplant, zucchini, young asparagus, and a peppery red onion. Rebecca played the perfect server, attentive but not hovering, polite and amiable. She responded to every thank you with "my pleasure." Indeed, the evening was OUR pleasure.
