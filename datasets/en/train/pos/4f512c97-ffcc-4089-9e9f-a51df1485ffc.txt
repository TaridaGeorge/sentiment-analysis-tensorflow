Carly's, I owe you an extra star.
After talking smack about your not-quite-stiff-enough martinis, I went back and had the most marvelous, intoxicating martini of 2009. And then our wonderful server suggested a drink called a Death in the Afternoon. And...well...I'm sorry, Carly's, for my absinthe related behavior that followed. I hope we can still be friends, but if you don't want me anymore I would understand completely.
