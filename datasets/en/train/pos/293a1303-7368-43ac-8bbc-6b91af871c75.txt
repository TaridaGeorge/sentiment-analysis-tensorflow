Love this place... can you veal me people!  Can you veal the love in the air?  Best bar menu in Scottsdale, no veal, but all great.  Very good meatballs, best egg plant parm on the west coast, and did I mention veal?  Eat here 2x/year and these guys can handle groups.... get there early or make a reservation as the word on the value is out to the medicare crew....great outdoor space too, but I am more focused on the food and corktailz..... need a lunch fix of this joint?  They have a side restaurant that is awesome.   Wish this was near my home.   Uncle Sal, you rock!
