Great for families and couples! The garden has amazing flowers and views of the Arizona mountains in the background. I took my family here since they haven't experienced too much of the Arizona landscape, cactus, wildflowers, and such, and they were amazed at all the cool things we saw. The butterfly pavilion was open, so we spent a good amount of time in there snapping shots of all sort of species that displayed such vivid colors that we didn't want to leave. We also enjoyed the hummingbirds as well as the cactus gardens. This is definitely a nice place to go on a relatively warm day (I probably wouldn't enjoy this as much deep into the heart of summer) and the trails are not that difficult to get through. We spent probably around 3 hours here. Bring your student IDs if you have it, it's half price that way!
