Soo excited that I finally went here. I loved everything about it; the atmosphere with the candles and awesome music playing on the juke box, the service, and the food. 
Last night we went and sat out on the patio and I was in heaven! the weather was perfect, Heidi the owner was great, and I was so releived to finally find a cool place with good food by my house. 
I got the spicy asiago chicken pasty and it was great; and I think I might go back already today, and get the Rosemary chicken! yay finally a place with a little culture :)
