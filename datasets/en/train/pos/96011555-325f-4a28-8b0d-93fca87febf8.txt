It's been a while since I was in Arizona, but I still remember the Olive and Ivy.  I was in Phoenix on a business trip and went out for dinner at this place with a bunch of work people based on a recommendation from a local.  We were not disappointed.  Firstly I want to say that the decor and outdoor area in this place is just fabulous.  We sat outside and enjoyed a delicious meal.  The staff were professional, welcoming and accommodating.  I enjoyed the experience so much that I brought the gf along for dinner when she arrived that weekend.  Both times I was extremely pleased with the food, drink, level of service and the ambience of the place.  5-stars for mine.
