I recently bought a Living Social deal to try out this place and now I am addicted.  For 60 minutes, you are put through an intense workout that will definitely put a shake up to your workout routine.  I love the challenge of the workouts and they make me push myself further so that I get the best out of the workout.  This place offers a group workout split between treadmill work and a combination of rowing machine and weights/TRX.  If you are looking to mix up your workout, Orange Theory will push you to a new fitness limit.
