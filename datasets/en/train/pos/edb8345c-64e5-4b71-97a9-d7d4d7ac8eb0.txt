We love this place - it's our "go-to" sports bar. Cozy atmosphere, tons of televisions to watch the game, and for a sports bar - the food is actually REALLY good! Try any one of their focaccias - their my favorite. 

Really good happy hour specials, too! Love that we can get two huge beers and dinner for under $20.

My only wish: That they had 2 shuffle board tables. We are here all of the time and it is always taken!
