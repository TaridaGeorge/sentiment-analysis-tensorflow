Located behind Arcadia Ice Arena, everyone is skeptical of this place until they go.  Midwestern-style bar to the core.  Annie the bartender is kick ass as is the owner Daryl.  Cheap drinks, Molson on tap (available in small and large pitchers), metal tip darts, several flat-screens behind the bar, a pretty good jukebox and the entertainment of watching kids fall down on the ice from adjacent ice rink.  They often have free food available (brats, queso dip).  Tons of regulars.  My favorite local dive bar by a country mile.
