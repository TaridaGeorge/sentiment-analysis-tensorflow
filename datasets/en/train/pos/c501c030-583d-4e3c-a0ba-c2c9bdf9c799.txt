Chanpen is one of a number Thai places up near Thunderbird and ASU West - but it is by far the best.  I frequent this place for lunch and it is always busy with a steady stream of locals, Glendale cops, students and professors.  Lunch specials are dirt cheap and range from $5-$7.  The service is decent, and the food - well the pad thai and chicken curry are flavorful and delicious.  Beware, the decor and booths are a bit dated, but remember you're there for the food. It's a bit of a hike for most, but definitely worth the trip.
