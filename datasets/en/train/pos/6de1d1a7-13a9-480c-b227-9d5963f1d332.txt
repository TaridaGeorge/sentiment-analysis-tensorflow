WILDFISH is my favorite restaurant in ALL of Scottsdale. ((my best secret date place too, all you ladies out there ;-)) After my experience Saturday Night, I had to post a RAVE review. The food is PHENOMENAL and i mean ALL of it. Great atmosphere, I just love this place. For a Sat- i recommend calling in advance (480-944-4040) -get a reservation and ask for TONY's section. He really is very wine knowledgeable, pleasant and respectful. So is the entire staff, for that matter. I always feel like a V.I.P.

I have to say, I love the Asian BBQ Salmon. It is truly an AMAZING gourmet dish for only $25!!! I always take my family and friends here when visiting from out of town because I want to experience the best overall dining experience while here in Scottsdale! We LOVE Wildfish!!!!
