Boxty, boxty, boxty. 

How tasty and wonderful yet simple... It's just a thick potato pancake wrapped around some scrumptious filling like guinness braised beef or broccoli and cheddar. This is my uncle's favorite place to eat when he's in town (he's VERY PICKY and likes simple stuff and not too many veggies), and every time I bring someone there they really enjoy it. I love the cozy pub feel on the inside, and if it's a nice day it's great to have outside seating as an option too.
