I love going to this location, by far the most friendly, cleanest and a great distance from my house. The girls in there are so nice and always make you feel comfortable. The only negative which isn't to bad is the parking. I usually walk there so I normally don't have to deal with it. I will always go to this location when I need a cup of coffee.
