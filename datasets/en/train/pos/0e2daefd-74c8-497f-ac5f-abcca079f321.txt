My husband's favorite place to eat, and I love it too! We have never had something here we didn't love but our favorites are the Fez burger, and the Chicken Tan Tan (I think thats what Its called!) The food is so great, and the staff is always very friendly. When we first started coming here they played Finding Nemo on a big projector, it is silly and trivial but I loved that! It was so fun!
