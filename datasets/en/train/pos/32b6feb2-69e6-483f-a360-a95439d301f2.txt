This is a great bar on a weeknight.  Drop in and you can brush elbows with the proud and the few who don't think downtown Phoenix is lacking in culture or things to do - Arizona democrats, starving artists, veteran weirdos.  Although the Leaf does lack a tap, the beer and wine list is great, especially if you like strong beers.

servers are always friendly and attentive.  art is always nice.  when there is live music, it is always good.  also, their toilets are made of solid gold.

I hate to criticize a place for it's popularity, but during the weekend and especially during artwalks, Lost Leaf can get crowded really, really quick, and the space is small enough that conversation can get drowned out pretty easily.  No worse than any other bar - just a heads up!
