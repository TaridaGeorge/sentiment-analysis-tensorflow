One of the best restaurants I have been to in awhile.  Each course was better than the last.  Started with Melon gazpacho, charcuterie, ceaser salad and pasta with sausage. The food was truly outstanding!  The service was great.  We sat outdoors on a beautiful December day.  So refreshing to get such good food at a hotel!

I almost forgot...the bread budding!  To die for!  With dulce di leche on the side.
