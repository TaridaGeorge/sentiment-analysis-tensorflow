I use to take a bit out of every sandwich I made for my kids school lunches.  It was my way of saying I love you.  Well to my delight and my sons there is a bite out of every popcsicle.  Ok so it is the mold but still quite a nice touch.

I has balckberry and and a touch of lavender in mine.  My husband and son had strawberries and cream which was delicious.  My sons girlfriend had cherries and cream.  All four were yummy in our tummys.  I will be back when I visit again.
