really enjoyed my experience here.
food is really good.

 filet mignon medium rare is cooked perfectly.
the Elk is also very tender. 
I love the mix berry desert it's really delicious not too sweet. It goes really well the 
the 20 year desert wine on the menu.
service is outstanding.
the only thing I didn't like is the steak soup, it's a bit too salty.
