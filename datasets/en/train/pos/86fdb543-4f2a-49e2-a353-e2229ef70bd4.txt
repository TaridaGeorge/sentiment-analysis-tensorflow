Freaking love the QT's 

It is nice to hear them welcome you everytime, it is nice to get through the line quickly. 

Most of all I like the drinks. I use a little bit of vanilla, cherry and then some diet Dr Pepper. I use a QT reloadable card so I can just hand it over, slide the card and walk out. 

I have also purchased a sleeve of 32oz cups, lids and straws. Perfect for a party or a road trip.
