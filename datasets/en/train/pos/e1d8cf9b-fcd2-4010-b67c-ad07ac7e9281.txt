I just visited this fantastic local salon- small and intimate, it's tucked away on Vernon.  In the past few months, I've switched to organic shampoos and have been wanting to explore ammonia-free and healthier options for styling and coloring my hair too.  I am so glad I found Pure!!  With great cruelty free and vegan products, I will never go back to the burning and eye-watering stuff at my old salon :)
