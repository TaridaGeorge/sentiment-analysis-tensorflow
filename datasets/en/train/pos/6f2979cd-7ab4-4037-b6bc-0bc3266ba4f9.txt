Do you LOVE good deals? Do you LOVE a hotel which offers rooms to sleep up to 8 people, including a full kitchen? How about a hotel which includes a free hot breakfast every morning, freshly baked cookies in the afternoon, a pool area, and workout room?

The price was DEFINITELY right for our bachelorette party, and the location couldn't be beat. We were just block away from all the downtown action of Scottsdale. 

I would definitely suggest this hotel to all of my friends. Friendly and helpful staff!
