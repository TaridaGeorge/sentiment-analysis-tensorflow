This is a great little hidden gem! From the outside, it looks like just a dive but the inside is surprisingly nice. 

The food here is great and they are willing to make things to your taste when it comes to ingredients and spice level. 

The waitstaff are also very friendly. They came by while we were eating just to make sure we were happy with everything even though this is an "order at the counter" place.

Another little bonus is that they have a drink station where guests can help themselves to free refills which definitely comes in handy in Phoenix!
