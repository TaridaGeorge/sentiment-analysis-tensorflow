I have been to FnB three times since it opened and each experience has been great!  Food is fanatstic - propers to Charlene and Pavle! This is a restaurant not to be missed! From hand-crafted cocktails to entrees that sing and vegetables that every kid in America should eat -- what is not to like?! 

Also, the late night (10 p.m.) daily dinner special will not disappoint!
