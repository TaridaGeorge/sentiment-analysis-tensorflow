My husband and I LOVE this place.  Quick service, wonderful fresh food, cool coke machine and good fun.  I read a few reviews of this place below -  I don't mind the people outside because I don't notice them when I'm here.  Hey, its Tempe, get use to it.  I love Tempe!  The only few bad things are only two restrooms and a line at the super cool coke machines.  Please people just push the buttons.  It's like your touch screen phone.   LOL  Recommend this place very highly!!!!
