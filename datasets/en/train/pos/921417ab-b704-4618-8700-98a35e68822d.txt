This was, by far, the best dining experience I've had in Arizona, let alone anywhere else in the country.  The courses are small and they flow one by one so that you can enjoy each and every flavor before moving onto another dish.  The building itself is stunning and the staff are so friendly and really take the time to make you feel welcome and at home.  They explain every dish and are always nearby for water, sake or shochu (a Japanese vodka-like liqueur).  My personal favorite was the miso marinated black cod.  WOW!  So tender and incredibly moist!
