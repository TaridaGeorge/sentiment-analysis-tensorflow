I've been here twice, and both times I got the St. Louis style ribs because they were so good the first time. My fiance also got a similar dish when we went back, because his brisket was amazing. Macaroni and cheese is also amazing. Corn bread, roasted corn, and other sides are good but not outstanding. The free donuts at the end of the meal add a nice taste of sweet without going overboard on a huge dessert. One time my sister got the pizza, which looked like it could have come frozen from a supermarket. I'd say stick with the BBQ meats and you can't go wrong!
