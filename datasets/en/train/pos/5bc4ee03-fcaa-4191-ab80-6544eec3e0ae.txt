This is my absolute favorite pho restaurant, and the prices can NOT be beat.They have a cute little place with a big fish tank full of fresh crabs and lobster and the pho is amazing. I recommend the #25 Its a beef rice noodle dish topped with crunchy spring rolls, lots of veggies and their sauces are divine. No, it's not actually a Pho dish but it's amazing and slightly sweet and they bring it out in record time! We tried the Salt Brown Lemonade last time we were there, let me say that was an ODD drink. I usually go for the hot green tea, I like my own little pot o tea while I Pho-get. Check this place out when you're in the area, I guarantee you won't be disappointed!!
