Cibo is our favorite! The setting is elegant, yet casual enough for one to feel right at home. The quality of the ingredients makes the thought of eating pizza anywhere else unappealing. Whether you choose to sit inside or on the patio, you are in for a relaxing evening. I haven't been for lunch yet, although I plan on going this week. 

The price is what makes Cibo truly exceptional! My wife and I are completely satisfied sharing one $13 pizza, although we recommend going with friends to expand the variety.
