I'm going to make this short.
1. This is not your typical chinese restaurant.
2. They serve Sichuan styled food, and their american menu indeed sucks.
3. If you like sichuan styled food, this is a great place to go.
Unfortunately it is not the best for anything else but they offer what they have very well (if you know what to expect).
