I recently visited the Road Runner Sports to buy shoes for my father-in-law, who used to be an dedicated runner and fitness fanatic.  Unfortunately, he suffered a broken hip and can no longer run...in fact walking can be a challenge these days.  So, we went to Road Runner Sports for new shoes and we met Trace.  Trace was outstanding, helping us find appropriate shoes while being compassionate, patient and professional. She provided us expert recommendations and exceeded our expectations! Thank you Trace!
