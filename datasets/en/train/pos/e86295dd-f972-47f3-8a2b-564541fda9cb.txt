I'm pretty shocked at some of the poor reviews of this place. In the last 2 days we've eaten both breakfast and lunch there. For breakfast, we had pancakes with caramelized bananas and the special breakfast burrito. Both were fantastically prepared and delicious. The service was super friendly and everybody was treated like old friends. The owner came out to greet us and have some conversation. I guess if you don't like this behavior, then you would be happier at Einstein's, where they serve the world's worst bagel. 
For lunch, we had the Lozaya, a sandwich with wonderfully seasoned grilled pork, caramelized onions and sweet red peppers. Fantastic! We also had the Perky Turkey salad, everything fresh, well assembled and very delicious. 
We would go back to this place at any opportunity.
