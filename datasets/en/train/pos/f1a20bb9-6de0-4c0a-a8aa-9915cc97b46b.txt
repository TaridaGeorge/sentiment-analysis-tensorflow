Been a member here for 7 years.  Its kinda my home away from home.  I'm there 4-5 times a week (at least I try to be) during the evenings.  Even during its most busy time, 5-7pm, it's never too crowded.  Their equipment is brand new and the gym has a great layout.  It's less of a social club than the big one on Shea Blvd. which is what I'm looking for.  Still, you get to know the regulars that work out there if you ever need a spot.  The staff is great.  They are friendly and helpful, but not so talkative that it gets annoying.  Locker room (with steam and showers) is a bonus.  Also, its nice to watch some live hockey action and grab some cold air in between sets.  See you there.
