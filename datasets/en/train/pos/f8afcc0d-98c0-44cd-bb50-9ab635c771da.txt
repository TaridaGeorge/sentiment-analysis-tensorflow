Absolutely LOVE this restaurant. The lasagne is incredible. I've been 5 or 6 times and can't seem to order anything else on the menu. It's quiet, romantic and the perfect place to go if you want authentic Italian food. It's very reasonably priced and never too busy that you have a long wait, although it's a good idea to make a reservation.
