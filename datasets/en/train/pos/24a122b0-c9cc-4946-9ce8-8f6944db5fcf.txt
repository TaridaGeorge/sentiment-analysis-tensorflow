This is a kid friendly chill out cafe with lots of the same food that Anna offered at the Downtown Market. We're so glad to have this restaurant in downtown with great choices for breakfast, lunch, or an early dinner.

My son's favorite is the Gypsy Stew, a wonderful blend of fresh vegetables, squash, and garbanzo beans. The panini sandwiches and quesadillas are also a big hit. We're looking forward to trying one her new breakfast menu items on our next visit.
