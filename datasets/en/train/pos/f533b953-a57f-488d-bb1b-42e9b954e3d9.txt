All I can say is this place is phenomenal!  We came here on a whim while in town and were amazed at how great the food was and service.  We even used a restuarant.com coupon.  We have told dozens of our friends to stop by here if they are in town.  GREAT PESTO with the bread.  Yum.  Hubby had cheese ravioli which was to die for (and I don't even like the stuff).  

Don't pass this place up, it was great.
