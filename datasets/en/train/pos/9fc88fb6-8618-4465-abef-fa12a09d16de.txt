Great Mexican street food! Well ok I should say great burritos because to date that is all we have had here, they are addictive.
I order the shrimp burrito with no beans and I ask for cabbage, they are freaking incredible, the shrimp burritos are more expensive at $8 but are worth every penny.  My husband orders the beef burrito with no beans.
No there is no rice, sour cream or cheese in these burritos, if you want that go to your local crappy chain Tex Mex fast food joint.

My husband speaks Spanish, but I'm sure you are fine ordering in english.
