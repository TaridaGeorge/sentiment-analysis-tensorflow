I was here for a work event that lasted for a few days.  The staff and facilities at this place are amazing.  They are extremely attentive and the resort is picturesque.  

There's a strip mall across the street from the resort but as a first timer in the resort it was a bit confusing to get off the property to see where the strip mall was located (even with directions from the staff).  Once I figured it out, it was really easy and each subsequent time that I needed to head out to the strip mall I wondered why this seemed challenging!

Great place overall and I'm sure if you were going for personal (rather than professional) reasons it would be even better!
