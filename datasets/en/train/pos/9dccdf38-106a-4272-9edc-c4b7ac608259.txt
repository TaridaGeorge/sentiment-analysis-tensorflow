DeFalco's Italian Deli IS as good as it gets.  It is truly a snippet out of NYC! It's a great little authentic Italian deli with an incredibly great selection of foods behind the deli counters and a great selection of other Italian foods out and about the deli.  Not only do they have THE BEST cheese steak in AZ, all of their food rocks, at least all that I have and that has been almost everything on their menu.  I usually go with friends and we...I order for us, 2 whole sandwiches so we can do half and half.  The last round was the cheese steak and hot Italian sausage!  YUMMMMMMMMMMM!  By the way, their cannoli's are the BEST, not filled until ordered so the shell is nice and crunchy.  Gotta go, I'm hungry!!
