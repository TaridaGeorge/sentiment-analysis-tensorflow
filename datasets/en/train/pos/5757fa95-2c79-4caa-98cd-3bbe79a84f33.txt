I cannot believe I have never reviewed The Spur!
The is hands down the best "have a great time" bar is Old Town Scottsdale.
It is located in the old bank and the vault that once held money now keeps the beer cold.
They have live music every day and never charge a cover. They serve lunch, but plan on eating dinner elsewhere.
The best time to be here is on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday night when the Psychobilly Rodeo Band plays. They are great! If you are easily offended this is not the bar for you. The place is tiny and gets packed quickly. The good thing is that if anyone even thinks about getting out of hand they are quickly removed.
This is a great place to day drink, night drink, well anytime drink.
Go and see the last real cowboy saloon in Scottsdale.
