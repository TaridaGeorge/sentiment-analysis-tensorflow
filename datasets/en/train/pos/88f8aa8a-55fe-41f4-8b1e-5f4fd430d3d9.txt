Wow...tasty, tasty, tasty! The variety of hummus is amazing...warm, toasty pita...the lamb was so tender and the spices were amazing! My friend who's shy about trying new things dabbled in everything, but most of all loved the flaming cheese, Saganaki...OPA! We usually pass on dessert but who could pass on the baklava cheesecake! The staff was so polite and just so on top of everything! The owner came over to chat and it was wonderful to learn he was Greek and we really appreciate the Ouzo shots...talk about Greek hospitality! I wish we had one of these up in Flagstaff. The food brought me back in time when I was in Mykonos! Can't wait for my next trip to Phoenix to try something different at My Big Fat Greek restaurant and to enjoy the nice patio!
