This place always took care of my sporting itch.  Especially on college football saturdays.  The whole upstairs is a University of Michigan watch party. GO BLUE! Other than college football they always broadcasted the games from the east coast and midwest, which is a plus being from Michigan.  This place always made me feel like I was home.   Standard bar food, and good service. Free WiFi.  Not the mention the Off Track Betting!
