16 taps with about 4 locals (Four Peaks, Papago, Santan). 45 bottles and 18 cans of mostly good to great craft brews. Bartender/beer captain knows his beer and actively manages beer selection.

Happy hour features The Standard Dog and a draft for $7 as well as $4 for any draft beer and a $6 CB&CB Burger (reg $10).  Good deal and tasty food.

Tables feature condiment packs of Sriacha, Wasabi Horseradish, Ketchapeno, Kerchipotle, A-1, Tabasco, and Cholula! Wow! 

Nice patio area. 

Only complaint is the 4 32" TVs above the bar have a glossy screen and face windows so there is a glare from the TVs that makes them almost unwatchable.
