We attended a business session in Scottsdale that ordered lunch in for us, and it was from Paradise... the food was outstanding, DIFFERENT and fresh! So, when we went to the airport to fly home, we were thrilled to see they had a restaurant in the terminal! The service here was outstanding! Best smiles in the airport! Great food, great cookies, reasonable prices! I sat and ate next to Starbucks and kept telling people to put down the ready made food from Starbucks and eat at Paradise! Can't wait to travel back to Scottsdale and eat there again! Unless they want to open one in my town!?!? :o)
