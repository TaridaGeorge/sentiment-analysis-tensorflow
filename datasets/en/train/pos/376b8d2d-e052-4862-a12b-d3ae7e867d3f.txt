What a great find.. I've been searching for years for a place like this.. sketchy from the outside but worth the wait and that you will do. Ordered chicken tikka marsala. (6 on spice scale, could have gone to an 8) and the lamb vindaloo (also a 6, more fairly spiced) with the garlic naan... oh la la, that hit the spot.. the restaurant is dim and loud from nearby tables but cute and comfy..we will be back and I'm not sure I would even waiver from my original selection it was that delicious... feel safe with this selection on flavor and atmosphere but step out of the box for more flavor with the spices.....
