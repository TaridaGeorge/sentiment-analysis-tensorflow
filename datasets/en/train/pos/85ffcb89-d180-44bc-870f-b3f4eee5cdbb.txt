A cozy little gem of sushi restaurant in a strip mall. Felt comfy from the moment my hubby and I walked through the door and sat at table on a Monday night.
Nice selection of sushi named in the menu, reasonable prices, very fresh fish, great quality, quick and attentive service and super tasty! Just had the basic scallop sashimi, volcano roll and shrimp with crab in soy paper roll. We enjoyed our meal immensely. Great selection of sake available as well.
We will be back and be sitting at the bar.
