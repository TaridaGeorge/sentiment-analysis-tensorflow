Stop in for hot chocolate when its freezing outside in Downtown Phx. Great artwork on the walls especially the flower lollipop near the hostess and also the pink and purple and blue lighting on the glassware in the wall cabinent is quite lovely. Those circle paintings on the round wheels could maybe be turned into something more interesting as also those boring blase' flower paintings towards the back. Rest of decor is modern and nice to look outside the big windows for people watching while safe inside. Whole dining area has safe, tucked away inside feeling.
