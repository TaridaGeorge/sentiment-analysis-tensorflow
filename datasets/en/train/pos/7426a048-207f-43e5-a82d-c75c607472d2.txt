Wow......this chicken has got to be one of the best chicken I've ever tasted.....it's nothing compared to KFC...it has a nice kick to it and a little zingy too!! It's always pipping hot and it beats making them yourself!! Also try their fried okra if you like that!!! Yum Yum!!! I'm getting a craving rt now!!!  Pllsssss bring Church's to SF!!!!
