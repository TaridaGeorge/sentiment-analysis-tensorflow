I should be ashamed of myself; I have lived near this restaurant since it opened but only recently tried the place. On my first visit, I tried the sausage sandwich and the leak fries. The Italian sausage sandwich is served on baguette bread with grilled onions and homemade Italian sausage. The food was excellent and nearly enough for two. The leak fries were great and served with green onions and a dipping sauce which had a trace of olive. 

While there, I saw a guest come in just for an order of freshly made bread, which looked incredible ($7.35 out the door; the loaf was huge). 

Prior to leaving, I ordered their two most popular deserts: the tiramisu and pistachio cake. Both were AWESOME; however, I thought the tiramisu was just slightly better. 

I will be back; perhaps tomorrow!
