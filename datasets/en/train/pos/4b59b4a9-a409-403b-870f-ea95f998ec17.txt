Great little thai spot!

Old Wendy's restaurant that has beeen converted into a quaint, nicely decorated, dimly lit little spot.  I have tried 5 dishes from here and they have all been FABULOUS!  Full of flavor and spice.  I've tried the Pad Thai, Cashew Chicken, Shrimp Basil, Thai Green Curry and Choo Chee Seafood (oh and the Crispy Thai Rolls) and they have all been great.  

Hard to come by good Thai in Phoenix, but I hope this place sticks around!  Excellent service as well. My only complaint would be that the music they were playing could have been a little more upbeat for a Friday night  :-)  Will be coming back again and again.
