I don't understand why they have such a low rating. I worked here for a quick minute my freshman year of college and I ate some damn good sammies during that time.

Plus they're open late night for all the drunkos leaving the bars in downtown Tempe. You should be thanking Silvermine. And their broccoli cheese soup. I wish there was one in Orange County or Los Angeles - I'm always at a loss when it comes to late night dining. Even pizza places stop delivering before infants go to bed here. 

Silvermine, I back you.
