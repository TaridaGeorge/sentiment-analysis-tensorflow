Went there last night for the first time. I actually loved everything about this place. The service, the vibe, the food, the whole bit. LOVED it. If you want to go to the all-you-can-eat Chinese Super Buffet, please do. This is not it. It's not about volume here, it's about smaller, shared portions of tasty and well-prepared food in a great atmosphere. A relaxing, friendly and comfortable place with no attitude. Our server was GREAT. A gem in Scottsdale.
