First time there today. I had the oyakodon bowl, which was fantastic.  As close to real Japanese food as I've eaten since living in Japan years ago.  Can't wait to go back for some authentic yakisoba. My mom had the teriyaki chicken w/rice and an egg roll, which she said was great.  

The very kind man at the counter is Chinese from Malaysia, so no need to try out your Japanese.  Great service & prices.  Will be back for sure.
