I tried this restaurant out with some friends. I hadn't heard of it before so had no idea what to expect. Decor is awesome-modern and a bit edgy but also very comfortable. Food was excellent. I ordered the Osso Bucco. It was delicious. Very different than other Osso Bucco I have had before. I also tried the Short Ribs and Macaroni and Cheese. All were delicious. Cocktails were inventive and tasty. I ordered the Chocolate Bacon S'more- I felt like I had to try it.  A little goes a long way but it was tasty. I tried the Pecan Pie with the Cream Cheese Ice Cream. The ice cream was unbelievable! The meal was delicious...such good food in such a great environment. What an unexpected surprise. I'll definitely be back.
