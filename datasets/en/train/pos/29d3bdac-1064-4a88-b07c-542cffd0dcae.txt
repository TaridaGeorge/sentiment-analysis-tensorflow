Were able to check out Johnny and Linda's latest culinary adventure, having missed Sens since they moved uptown to Thomas and Central.  Same predictably good food as Sens in a very pleasant setting, with the always friendly staff.  

We went after only the first week, and they seemed to have ironed out the opening jitters.  As with Sens, Sochu will be our go to restaurant for Asian cuisine.  The Tapas menu was expanded and updated from Sens, and they've added some entree items as well.
