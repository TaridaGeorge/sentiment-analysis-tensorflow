I loved this place. I can't believe I hadn't checked it out sooner. The concept is hilarious and the food is really good. I got The Kind (bacon, turkey, swiss, and mushrooms) and it was delicious. The guys that worked there were really warm and friendly and joked with me. They even have Kool-Aid which I think is awesome. The sandwiches don't need mustard or mayo; the oregano and oil and vinegar give it enough flavor. This has easily become my favorite sandwich shop in the Tempe area and I look forward to eating here again as soon as possible.
