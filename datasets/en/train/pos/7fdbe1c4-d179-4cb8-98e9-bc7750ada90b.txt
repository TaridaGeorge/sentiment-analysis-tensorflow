Went with my wife and her sister for lunch.  We shared a plate of calamari and it was perfect, to say the least. Crispy with a light batter and not over cooked. I had a Vietnamese spicy beef noodle bowl and was immediately won over. My wife had a crispy chicken and egg noodle bowl and couldn't say enough about how great the lunch was ... If we lived here it would be a regular stop for us. Hidden away, great staff ... No way you can go wrong.
