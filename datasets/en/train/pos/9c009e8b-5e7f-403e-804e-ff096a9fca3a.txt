My husband and I brought my nephew here for something fun to do.  What I really enjoyed about the place is that it's pretty hands-on and caters to kids (but is still pretty fun for us adults too).  I came in here thinking that my husband would love it but my nephew and I would be bored.... but I was also under the impression that it was museum-esque with a lot of "look but don't touch" exhibits.  I was very happy that this wasn't the case :)

At the end of the day my nephew even wanted to stay longer which was awesome.  It's fun for everyone :)
