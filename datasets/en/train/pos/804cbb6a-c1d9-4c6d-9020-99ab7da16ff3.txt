The place is really good and so cute!! Went here for lunch with my aunt portions are great! You get free fresh croissants and the service is excellent. Limited parking and the bathroom when I went was inside the restaurant since we ate at the bistro. Very busy place. Reasonable pricing for the food and the venue! I will be back :)
