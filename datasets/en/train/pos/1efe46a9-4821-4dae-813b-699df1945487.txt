For me nothing beats a great hot dog and that what Ted's is all about. The charbroiled dogs there are the best in town and keep me coming back over and over. The onion rings also will knock your socks off if you're into fried tasty goodness. The burgers are legit too, but get a dog and you'll never forget it.
