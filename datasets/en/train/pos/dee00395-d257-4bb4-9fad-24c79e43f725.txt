After a week in North Scottsdale we found Tontos' and decided it was the best spot we had tried.  Loved the classic old western decor and atmosphere and the food was the most interesting we had in the area. The short ribs were amazing and served with the stacked sweet potato dish made for an awesome meal. My husband had the German pork snitzle with warm potato salad.  Was a little leery about ordering a classic German dish in old west type of restaurant but he said it was the best he had ever had. Inside, or out on the lovely patio, a charming place to spend the evening!  Look forward to going again on my next trip to the desert.
