What a beautiful hotel/resort. I had the pleasure staying 5 nights while attending a conference and was totally impressed with just about everything.....service, comfort, decor, golf course, pool, conference support....and the guy in a kilt playing bagpipes every evening on the golf course next to the outdoor seating area was a perfect touch.

I would recommend everything here except maybe Deseo, the upscale restaurant on the property. My business partner enjoyed an excellent bottle of Argentinian wine, ceviche appetizer (excellent), but had to return our bone-in rib eye steaks for being overcooked. 

The hotel is also perfect for families with kids. The 2 pools are huge and the hotel has lots kid stuff going on.

I will definitely be back and would recommend the Westin Kierland to anyone spending time in Scottsdale.
