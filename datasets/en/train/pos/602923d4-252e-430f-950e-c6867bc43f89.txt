Oh, you little broker of sushi you. how fun you are. whats that? you dont like sushi? well. dont fret. they also have sliders. yeah. like chicken. and beef. and probably a spicy tuna slider also. but only if you ask nicely. 

i've only ever been for happy hour, and it hit the spot! we tried about 5-6 different menu items, all at least 50% off ($20 roll for $10? yup. 2 please). drinks are strong; who doesnt love that? probably the same person that doesnt like my reveiws because my witty banter is lame. ha! 

seriously though, its awesome. try it. you'll love it. trust me cause im trustworthy.
