Love love love this place - the only bad thing is they have 1 location -
I drive all the way from N Scottsdale to downtown Phoenix for their fresh deli sandwiches.  I always get the poor boy with everyhting...they always put the right amount of dressing and veggies and of course fresh meats - it's huge ! so come here with a big appetite - one of the truly REAL New York style subs...going to get one right now ;)
