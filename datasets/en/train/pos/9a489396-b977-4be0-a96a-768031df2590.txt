I had the fine pleasure of having a Monday off and decided to enjoy a great breakfast and Liberty Market was the place to go!!
Of all the great items on the menu, I went the Blueberry Pancakes and a Bowl of Mocha!! Yes, it was a bowl from one of the best coffee bars in the Valley!! If you're feeling adventurous, check out the pastries!! Great atmosphere for a sit down meal with family/friends or even alone people watching!!
