Really wonderful spa.  I had a voucher for the best of Bliss package, it was good Mon-Thurs and they let me use it on a holiday Monday which was cool.  It included massage, triple-oxygen facial and manicure and pedicure.  All were wonderful.  The "locker room" area was really nice, clean, and full of Bliss products (It made me wish my own bathroom was full of never-ending supply of bliss shampoo, soap etc) as well as water and snacks.  I'm surprised to see the review that said rude staff, everyone was incredibly nice.  I will definitely be a repeat customer.
