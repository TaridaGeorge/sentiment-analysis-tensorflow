This review is for the auto shop. 

I have gotten my oil changed at this location for the past 3 years. My wait is usually between 30 minutes to an hour, not bad. 

So it is not attached to the best mall in town, but some browsing makes the wait go by faster. Or I can grab a few groceries while I wait and by the time I'm done my car is ready. 

They say they will call/page you when your vehicle is ready but I have yet to have this happen. When I drop off my car I ask how long the wait is and come back then, my car is usually done by the time they say and parked outside. 

I have no complaints about the service. They do a good job and I appreciate that.
