Mmmm. Yummy Hawaiian Food!!! Just like in Hawaii. One of my favorites is the Crispy Shrimp. Another is the Seafood Mix, another is the Hamburger Steak. Well you get the idea. I have never had a bad meal here. The plate lunches come with Rice and Macaroni Salad and Veggies. The Macaroni Salad is yummy too. They also have mini meals, family meals that serve 4 and do Catering. it's worth the drive.
