When I first moved to Phoenix I lived by PV Mall. I had nothing better to do then lounge by the pool, shop at the mall and wait for my roomie to call to meet him for happy hour. So one day I met him at Ra at Kierland. It reminded me of my Fisher Price little peole village I played with when I was six. Ok, seven. Alright, I played with it well into junior high! Wow! Hello Kierland. Good bye PV Mall. I love the street side parking and the upscale/small town look. I love that they have a French Connection and that candy store! I would have lunch at North and then hit the shops. A great place to stroll around, people watch and increase your debt!
