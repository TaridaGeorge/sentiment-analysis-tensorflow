This place is adorable! I was very excited to try it after hearing great reviews. Went in for lunch yesterday and ordered almost a lil of everything on the menu. Started with the wings ($9) in fish sauce. OMGGGGG best thing I ever ate. I would come here alone just for the wings. MUST ORDER. they were crisp and flavorful and made to order. Ordered spring rolls fried and not fried one with ahi tuna, mango, avo and other with chix and basil. Loved the tuna one more. Husband ordered the banh mi pork sandwich we were stuffed at this point. Huge sandwich $9 comes with choice of fries or ...We got the garlic fries. This place is fab I will be back to try their soups and other spring rolls.
