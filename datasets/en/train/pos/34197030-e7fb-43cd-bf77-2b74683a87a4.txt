If you want decent fast food at a decent price, In N' Out is definately the place to be!!! The menu is very basic: burgers, fries, drinks, shakes... and I think this is smart because it keeps the long lines (the one downfall of In N' Out) moving. All in all the quality and taste of the food is great!!! No complaints here!!!
