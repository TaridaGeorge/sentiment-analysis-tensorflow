Another nasty auto day...and another raving review of Claudia and team at We Fix Ugly Bumpers.

So we were driving a van that just simply died right in front of an intersection...Claudia coincidentally happen to be pulling out of a nearby plaza and some how recognized the distraught people stranded in the middle of the street as former customers...she pulled right over and tried to help...she and her partner even went so far as to drive to the nearest gas station and brought us back some gas in case the problem was simply that the van ran out gas...alas that wasn't the case and we ended up calling AAA for a tow.

Claudia then gave us an ice cold bottle of water to tide us over while we waited.  What fantastic people.
