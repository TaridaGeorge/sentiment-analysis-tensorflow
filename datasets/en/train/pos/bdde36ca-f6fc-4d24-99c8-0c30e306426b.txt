This place is really fun.  Small hole in the wall place.  The bar has board and card games to play.  I come here to grab one of their awesome micro brews, play some darts and trivial pursuit  Plus you can always grab a cold 6 pack of something new and fun from one of their many fridge units in the bar. 

As for the food. its not the best, nor the worst. would give the food a 3.5 star review. but overall a 5 star review because this place isnt full of clowns like oldtown or mill. great dive for me.
