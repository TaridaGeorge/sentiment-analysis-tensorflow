FedEx has always delivered. I use frequently and highly trust. I can spot the amateurs who are trying to ship. Yes, the clerk does need the correct address, someone does have to read your handwriting. For the pros, we can use on-line and print out forms. I normally try to drop off in the early morning or early afternoon. They close at 6 and the lines are long. They have a plane on the runway at 7, so if you are procrastinator and think you can get in at 6:15, you are out of luck. I don't want you to delay my package, so get your act together.  Also, save some money and pack it yourself. Don't think UPS is any better, both FedEx and UPS use high speed belts, so get bubble wrap and pack it good.
