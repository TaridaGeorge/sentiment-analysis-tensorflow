Great place to hang out with friends or family. The good is great, the atmosphere is relaxing. The best thing on the menu I think is their Tower Burger. I almost always get it. It literally is a tower! Their pizza is good too and is good even when it's not conventional pizza. 

Their coffee bar is great too. They have some excellent brews too.

I highly recommend L.M.!
