For a quick serve place this place is 5 stars!!!  Speedy, fresh and different!
The un sandwich is wrapped in lettuce and is a fun change!  The chips are crunchy and mighty flavorful.  Even the drinks are special...the ice is really fine ...so the drink is like a slushy...also...drum roll ...they deliver!  This one is near my office...but a girl can dream that one will open by her home one day:)
