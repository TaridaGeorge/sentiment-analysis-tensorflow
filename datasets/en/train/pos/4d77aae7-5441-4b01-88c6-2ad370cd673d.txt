This place is great!
If you talk to anybody they have a suggestion for a great flavor.
You can bring in food from another place to enjoy and just enjoy a great atmosphere.
With the music that someone has an issue with you can just talk to the DJ to get a suggestion they are MORE than accommodating.
They have a great happy hour prices! 
Overall great prices, great people, and a great time! If you have the right mind :)
