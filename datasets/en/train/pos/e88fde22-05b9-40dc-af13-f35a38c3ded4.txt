Best joint in the terminal.

ATMOSPHERE: The ambience of a high end downtown bar with very comfortable lounge style seating.

SERVICE: Friendly, attentative and goes over ingredients to verify we're okay.

FOOD: Top notch for an airport restaurant, could do very well as a stand alone  in the city. The Barfly Burger tastes very similar to an In-n-out burger. Fries are crispy and just as tasty.

MENU & PRICING : Limited to sliders, salads and burgers ranging from $9 - $13. Very few cocktails and beer as well.
