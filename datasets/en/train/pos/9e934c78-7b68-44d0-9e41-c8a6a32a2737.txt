Who knew there was a Neiman Marcus' cafe?? It's a bit hidden (near the Men's department) but the menu options are great!

The popover was fantastic and they bring it out with a strawberry butter. DIVINE. 

Ordered a fancy grilled cheese sandwich that came with a side salad. The portion was perfect for lunch. 

Seats are a bit limited indoors but they have a nice patio outside. 

Service was perfect.
