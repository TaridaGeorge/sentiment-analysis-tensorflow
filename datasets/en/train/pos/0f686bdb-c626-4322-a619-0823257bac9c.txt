Greatness in the form of food, just like the other locations. 

The service was particularly good at this location. We sat at the bar,and while the other customers were mildly annoying, the late night bartenders were up beat, witty, and very personable.

The atmosphere was par for the course.

All in all, if you are reading this review, get your directions to this location, close the browser, and go eat!
