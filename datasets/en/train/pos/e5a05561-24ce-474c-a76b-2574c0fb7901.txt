Was referred here by the owner's of 1st Class Reflexology for a late lunch. I ordered the salt and pepper squid, pea shoots stir fried in garlic, and the HK style beef and gai lan chow mein. Everything was excellent and piping hot! The owner, Choi and her son were very pleasant and friendly and I will definitely be back!  They do not have any live seafood, but they told me that if I call ahead, they can make fresh lobster and crab for me. I would highly recommend this place for some good Cantonese cooking! It is not fancy, but the food quality was very good and the prices reasonable. I wish I lived closer as this would be somewhere where I would definitely order take out all the time!
