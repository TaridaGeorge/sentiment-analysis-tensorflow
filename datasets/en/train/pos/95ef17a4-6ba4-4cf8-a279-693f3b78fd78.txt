I have been going to this dentist office for a few years now and would recommend them to anyone. They are very flexible in scheduling your appointments and  they call to remind you of them. They also call to remind you when you need cleanings. That personal touch goes a long way.

Mandana Kheshtchin and Navid Javadi are both extremely gentle and personable. They are down to earth and reasonable in their prices. I have been to a lot of dentists that recommend unnecessary procedures to make money, these two are the opposite. They have often told me of procedures I need (fillings, root canal, wisdom extraction ect) and told me which ones were the most important to take care of and which could wait. 

Their staff is friendly and their offices have TV's you can watch while you get your mouth worked on.
