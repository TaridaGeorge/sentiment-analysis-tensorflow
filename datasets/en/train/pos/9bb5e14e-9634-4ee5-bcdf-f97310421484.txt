Great food and very well priced for the portions.  We tried the spring rolls, green curry with chicken, and pad see ew w/ Beef.  All were some of the best I've had in years, and certainly some of the best in the valley.   

Update:

We've been back here at least 10 times and it's always great.   The north scottsdale location however isn't as good, get to the shea location.
