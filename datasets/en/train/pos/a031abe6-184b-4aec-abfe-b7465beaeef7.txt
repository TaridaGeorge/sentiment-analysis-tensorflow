Full disclosure, I have not purchases anything from PHX Metro Retro, however, I love the place and certainly will buy once the right item comes through their doors. I know what I'm looking for and while I play the waiting game I'm more than happy to pop in once or twice a month to see what's new. The place is great.

Heidi and Doug have always been great to talk to. I see them as stewards of the PHX modern/retro community. They love to share their knowledge and have always been super friendly.
