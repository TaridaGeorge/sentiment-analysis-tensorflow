Went for dinner tonight and they added a new pizza to their buffet...a loaded potato pizza! It had shredded hash-brown like potatoes, cheddar & mozzarella cheeses, REAL bacon and chives on top. It was delicious. 

And as always, the sauerkraut pizza and the spaghetti pizza were amazing.

I love this place!
