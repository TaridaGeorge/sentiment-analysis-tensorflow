My Oasis in the Desert when in the hellhole that I consider Phoenix.    SRCM is my escape.   Infiniti pool, excellent cuisine, top rated service, and bungalows redolent of a true desert spa experience....huge tubs, polished concrete, private entrance. 

Kick back on the deck in the evening with a cool drink and watch the sun set over the blast furnace landscape....very enjoyable.   I don't stay here enough.
