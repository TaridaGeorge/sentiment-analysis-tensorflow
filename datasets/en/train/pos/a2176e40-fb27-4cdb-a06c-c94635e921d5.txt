Our irrigation system was shot, so I contacted 3 firms to completely replace it with PVC, a rather major job. Dave @ AZ Landscaping was not the low bidder, but it was obvious he was very experienced and knowledgeable, so we went with him. He & his crew did a terrific job, showed up on time, worked hard and were thoroughly professional. A minor problem arose when two landscape lights were broken during excavation (they were very brittle & fragile due to years of sun exposure), and Dave replaced them without hesitation. Oh, I should mention he also met the lowest bid and didn't grumble a bit. We're completely satisfied, and in fact he's coming back in a few months to spread 14 tons of decorative gravel for us. I highly recommend this firm, and they'll enjoy our business in the future!
