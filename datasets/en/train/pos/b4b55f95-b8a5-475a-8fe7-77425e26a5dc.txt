Pappadeaux and Mammadeaux too~ This place is kicken for Happy Hour Mon-Fri 3pm to 6pm with crazy good food at great prices. Start off with the Blackened Oyster Fondue (under $10), Cold Boiled Shrimp (under $5), Fried Alligator (under $5) and a tall Blue Moon or Swamp Thing! The place packs up around 5ish and the Happy Hour prices only apply to the bar area. A band plays every Friday starting at 6. Good times!

The main restaurant is a great place for groups, however, can be a little loud for intimate dates. The menu is extensive with a lot of great choices.  Check out the website for menu details.
