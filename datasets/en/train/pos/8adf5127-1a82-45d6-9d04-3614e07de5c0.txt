Yes! This is what every fancy restaurant should be like. 

The service was AMAZING! From the waiter's sexy voice to the side dishes arriving at the same time, and hand served by the staff. Impressed! Now that's getting what you pay for. 

The food was delish, I had the bone in steak, the chef special, "rubbed with 27 different spices" and yes he/she rubbed it well. LOL

For desert we shared "Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake" this cake was pure insanity, it came with hand whipped cream and fresh strawberries.

I can't comment on price because my boss treated his staff to this glorious dinner. I'm sure he would say it was well worth it :)
