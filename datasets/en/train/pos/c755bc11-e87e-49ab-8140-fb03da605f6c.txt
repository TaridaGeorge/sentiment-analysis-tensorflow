I'll be sad that I can't stop in to my local neighborhood storefront for the best BBQ in phoenix, 

but I'll get over that since I can go down to the Downtown Farmer's Market every weekend for a fix.

I'm downright inconsolable about not being able to see as much of my two friends, Grady and Carolyn.
