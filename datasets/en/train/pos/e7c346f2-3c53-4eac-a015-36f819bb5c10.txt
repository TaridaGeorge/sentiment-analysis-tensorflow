This show is a ten-week show that is open every day from the end of January till the beginning of April.  It seems like there are about 80-90 different fine art artists who have working studios/galleries. 

The artwork here is diverse and beautiful. I saw contemporary and traditional artwork. The show has bronzes, jewelry, photography, oil painting, kaleidoscopes, acrylic paintings etc. 

There is also a cafe that serves coffee and tea, sodas, water, breakfast, lunch and snacks. I ate a cheeseburger and it was very good. 

I also saw some information that there are free art classes for veterans. The day I went, the veterans were learning to sculpt for future bronze pieces.
