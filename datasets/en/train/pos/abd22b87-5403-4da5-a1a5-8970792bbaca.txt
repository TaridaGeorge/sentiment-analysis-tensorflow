WOW! Ok so went fro the first time and I have to say I was impressed by the minute we walked in, and I love to see the managers and the servers checking on us at least 4 times though my meal, I actually like it because I would rather have them interrupt me for a min to see if everything was ok, than ignore me and then I end up hating something and I wasn't able to have it resolved. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE and FOOD!
