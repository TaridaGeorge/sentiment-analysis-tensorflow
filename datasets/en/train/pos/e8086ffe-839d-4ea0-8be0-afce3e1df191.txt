I cannot put into words how good Mr. Goodcents really is. Where I used to work I couldn't leave for lunch so I ordered from them everyday for over a year. I tried EVERYTHING on their menu, and EVERYTHING was delicious! You really can't compare a Mr. Goodcents sub to Subway or Quiznos, they're practically a category all their own. :)
