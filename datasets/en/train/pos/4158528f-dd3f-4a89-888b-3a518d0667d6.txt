I just learned that our favorite ice cream parlor is closing this weekend!!! 
I'm extremely sad and disappointed to see this happen. 
My children love stopping in every Tuesday and Thursday to get a treat. 
Plus, Karen's Kreamery is a rare business in the West Valley. It's one of the only places that reminds me of my own childhood neighborhood corner store where I bought ice cream, candy and chips. I'm going really miss having Karen's Kreamery.
