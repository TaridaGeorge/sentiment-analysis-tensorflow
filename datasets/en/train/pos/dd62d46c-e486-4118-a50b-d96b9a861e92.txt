This place...this place....just too damn delicious. Vegetarian taco is my specialty while the Chorizo taco is the boyfriends. It is complete heaven: humongous frybread, slathered with beans, meat or vegetables, cheese, and huge sodas. Lunch time it is PACKED, but after hours it is always calm and relaxing. The food is prepared quickly and they never miss a beat.

*Conan and Andy advertised it for their live show* This demonstrates the pure power of the Fry Bread House.
