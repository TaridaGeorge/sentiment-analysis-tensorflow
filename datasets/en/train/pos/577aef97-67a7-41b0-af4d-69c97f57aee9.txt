This is a great coffee house. I work next door and am there every weekday. 
The staff is always friendly. 
They have text ahead ordering and you can even get curbside delivery. How cool is that?!!?
They have delicious pastries, including gluten free options. My favorite is the cinnamon roll (not gluten free). 
They also have live entertainment in the evenings.
