You forget how lucky you are until you try other places. 

This MCD went through a Renovation a couple years ago and still looks brand new inside. They have the coolest decor, it is all Americana. 

The service is usually quick and I cannot recall a recent time where something was screwed up. Seriously That deserves 5 stars now-a days. 

No play land... yeah! 
Double drive through ... Yeah! 
Coffee thing with all the special stuff.... Yeah! 

oh and the occasional crack head... viewing pleasure i guess.
