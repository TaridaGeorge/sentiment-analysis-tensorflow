We went to Durants for our anniversary.  The service was amazing, the food was incredible.  We shared a steak that was out of this world.
Then to top it off they brought us some sort of strawberry desert of which I'm still having flashbacks.

Had gone to Durants many times for drinks.....this was my first dinner here and it was awesome!
