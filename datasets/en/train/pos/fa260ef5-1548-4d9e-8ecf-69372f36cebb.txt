When I am in Arizona visiting family, a highlight of my trip is going to QT. Kind of strange, unless you have been in a QT. 

Let's see, they are clean. Like, sparkling clean and if there is a mess, there is someone already cleaning it up. The selection of drinks is AMAZING! The staff is always friendly, always. 

ps. they have the best ice ever.
