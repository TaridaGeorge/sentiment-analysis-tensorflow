This is by far my favorite shop in the Valley.  Every item I have purchased here has quickly become a favorite in my wardrobe.  I would classify the clothing here as trendy/sophisticated and wearable.  Maybe I'm biased because it regularly stocks my favorite lines (Rachel Pally, Alice + Olivia, Trina Turk).    I don't know.  What I can tell you is that the girls here have always been amazingly helpful and genuine.  This store also has a great selection of jeans.  They also offer a service called Closet Therapy (they come to your house and weed out your closet for you and help you put outfits together) and host fashion previews and truck shows.
