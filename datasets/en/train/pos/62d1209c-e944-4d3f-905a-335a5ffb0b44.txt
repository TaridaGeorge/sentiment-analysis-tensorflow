i won some money on the slots and i treated my husband and I to the sunday brunch today. I sampled the shrimp, kobe steak, few breakfast items, yummy mini desserts and of course the mimosas. 
loved wandering horse atmosphere, it's a modern and open restaurant. i was impressed with the large buffet offerings!  everything was delicious and fresh. it's comparable to the nicer vegas buffets.  It's too much food to eat in one sitting but It's so worth trying your favorite items.
