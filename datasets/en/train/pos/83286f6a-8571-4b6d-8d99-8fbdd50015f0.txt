Paul was extremely helpful and explained everything he was doing and why. He didn't replace things that didn't need replacing and told me where I could buy the filters myself if I ever wanted to do it on my own. He didn't seem bothered that my dogs were trying to "help" him. I wouldn't consider anyone else for this type of work.
