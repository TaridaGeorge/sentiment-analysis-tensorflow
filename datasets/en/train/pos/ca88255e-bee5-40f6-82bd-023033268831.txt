We had a party of six who went for a birthday celebration.  Awesome drinks, awesome service, awesome food!  The prime rib was as good as the reviews said it was, the blue burger (made with prime rib) was so juicy the bread did get a little soggy but oh so delicious, the prime rib sandwich was amazing and the au jus was delicious.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
