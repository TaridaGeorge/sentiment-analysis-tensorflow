Love,love,love! thats all I can say about the Cornish Pasty Company, My brother took me here  a while back and Ive been having cravings ever since,My favorite is the Mexican..its spicy and delicious,kind of tastes like an enchilada.....the best enchilada in the WORLD! but seriously if you havent tried this place out you need to go....like now! if I didnt live so far away I would be there right now gobbling down my mexican!
