My girls love this place.  They are 2.  Its the perfect age.  We just went to the Thursday Story Time and its one of the best I have been to in Phoenix.  The leader is amazing and its very interactive.  I would say its more music time than story.  And there is a great drive thru coffee shop in the parking lot which you can bring into Imagination Avenue with the kids.
