I go hear often enough that employees recognize me and know what I'll order.  Great place to stop in and have a quick slice of pizza.   They also have my favorite soda there, Jones soda.  Good sized menu with organic pizza, salad and noodles.  Has 5 or 6 four person tables and 2 two person tables on the inside as well as stool seating along the wall.  Some more tables are just outside.  You can see the employees making everything through a glass window.  

The pizza is really good, which is all I ever have there.  I'll usually go out and eat there, but when I'm tired or just lazy, they deliver!!
