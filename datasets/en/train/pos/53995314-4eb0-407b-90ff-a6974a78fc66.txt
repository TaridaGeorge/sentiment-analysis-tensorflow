My family and I have been going to Thunderbird Internal Medicine since 2007.  This practice is always fast and efficient.  You never have to wait too long to see your doctor the majority of the time.  

If you have an appointment you can rest assure that you are going to be seen on-time.  Our favorite, Dr. Edgecomb, left the practice in May but they have plenty of other great doctors that you can see.

www.thunderbirdim.com is their website give them a try !

Thunderbird Internal Medicine is as good as it gets !
