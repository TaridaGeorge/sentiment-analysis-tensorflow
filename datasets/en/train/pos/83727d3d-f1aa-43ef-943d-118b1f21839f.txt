I still love Switch!! I dine here more or less weekly!  It is a great spot to hang out with friends and have a couple glasses of wine at night, or to meet up on the weekend for brunch.  Gabriela is my favorite server there!  She is always very nice, and always on top of things! I always request her when I dine here.
