I wasn't going to write a review for Old Town Farmer's Market but the more I thought about it, the more I thought it was awesome!!  I didn't get a chance to look around much but what I saw looking like the most amazing of local goods.  Of course we hit the Sweet Republic truck.  We sampled some toffee and Simply Bread.  WOW!  All these great local products in one spot every Saturday morning?  Seriously?
I am definetly going back!  This is worth getting up early on a Saturday!!
