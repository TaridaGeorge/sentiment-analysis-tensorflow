I have nothing but wonderful things to say about Kale's.  Every person that I spoke with on the phone or in person was friendly and helpful.  I had my brand new (2 week old) car keyed by some unfriendly person.  They scheduled me right away, and it took much less than they originally planned. The best part they even were able to give me a loaner car while they had my car.   They worked directly with my insurance.  It was a very painless and simple process.  I highly recommend Kale's to anyone that needs auto body work done.
