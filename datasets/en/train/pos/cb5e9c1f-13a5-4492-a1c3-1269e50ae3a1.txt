I had breakfast there last Saturday, they had a great special that my friend ordered.  She said it was amazing, I had the waffle with cherry butter, delicious is all I can say.  Our server was great, along with all the staff that morning.  

Oh, coffee was perfect.  I recommend a visit if you're ever in Old Town Scottsdale.
