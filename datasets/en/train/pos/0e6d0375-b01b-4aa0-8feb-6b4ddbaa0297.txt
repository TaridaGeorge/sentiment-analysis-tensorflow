We competed at this event this year (Little Miss BBQ) and we thought the location was absolutely incredible.  This is their 4th BBQ event and the only major issue this time was the heat which is out of their control.  Teams had samples the whole time and the area wasn't cramped like it was over at the Waterfront location.
