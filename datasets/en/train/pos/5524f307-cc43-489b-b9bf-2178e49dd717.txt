I've never been to a piano bar before but this was great. I was mesmerize by how talented the people were jumping to different instruments after every song. Piano, guitar, drums, piano guitar and some pretty good singing. Couldn't believe there was a human karaoke machine playing the piano to every song.  There was a cover charge, but free if you are student (this was a saturday night I believe.) We were able to get seats, but the place was packed! You can definitely request songs along with a gracious tip, which they will notice more than the two or one dollar bills.

If I ever come back to Phoenix, this is the place I would definitely like to come back to.
