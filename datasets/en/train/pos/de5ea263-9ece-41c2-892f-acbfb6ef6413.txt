Eaten here twice. Very cool atmosphere and decor. Excellent wine. Outstanding food. Attentive staff. Save room for dessert! Our favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Sit at the bar so you can see the kitchen staff cook on the grill if you can, its worth the wait. All the flavors were delicious. Savor every bite.
