OMG!  this bruscetta is to die for!!!  how I have not been to this place before, I don't know.  Great selection of wines and boards...get a pretzel rod when you go...to die for.

the brie/apple/fig bruscetta and the artichoke are just amazing...

great atmosphere in the old arcadia post office which is VERY cool with the glass garage doors open!!

lots of servers always milling around casually so you are well attended to...
