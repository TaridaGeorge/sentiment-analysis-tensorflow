Railfair 2009 is always a fun event to attend.  The new model RR building will be a welcome addition to the park. I liked the new Live Steamers Building and storage sheds.  The Cabooses at the new entrance really set the stage for the park. The new Museum in the railroad station with displays of railroad items show what it took to run a railroad. The weather was just great.
Thank you Railroad/ Park Staff for another wonderful year.
