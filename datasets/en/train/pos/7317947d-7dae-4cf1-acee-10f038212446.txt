To us this is one of those gem's you hear about. We have gone to Mu Shu many times for lunch and never had a bad experience.

We usually get the the stir fry its a great deal and always have leftovers. This trip we were with a friend and ordered off the reg menu. Once again they did a great job.

The place is always clean and staff friendly.
