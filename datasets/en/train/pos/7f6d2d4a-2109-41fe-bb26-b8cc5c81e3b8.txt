I have to whole heartedly disagree with the other diners here. I think this place is fantastic! We had reservations and did not have to wait at all. The service was prompt and our waiter was attentive, although he could have been a bit friendlier. 

We had the spaghetti and meatballs, the pork chop, and the scotch beef. The meatballs were some of the best I've ever tasted and the pork chop was definitely in the top three pork chops I've ever had. The scotch beef was very good too, although it could have been seasoned a bit more. We had the bourbon bread pudding for dessert. Heaven! Absolute heaven! 

We will definitely be back every time we are in the Phoenix area!
