I was in town and found Bel View Barber Shop on Yelp. This is a solid barbershop! I'm very particular about where I get my hair cut and was hesitant at first but was very pleased with the service and attention to detail. 

Ask for David, the owner. He's been there over 13 years and values the art of an old fashioned barbershop and scissor cut.  The price for a haircut is $14. Other places charge twice as much for the same service and lack the character and originality of a family owned and traditional barbershop. 

A regular haircut up the street at Groom Room at the Biltmore Fashion Park will cost you over $30. 

Keep it real and pay David a visit.
