I have been here twice now- once for dinner and once for brunch.  I love the space- the outside is cozy, warm and inviting.  My wife and I had a drink at a small table by the bar with our own fireplace. It was very relaxing. We followed this with dinner on the patio. I had the ribs and they were surprisingly EXCELLENT.  They fell off the bone and were super tasty.  In addition, I have a dairy allergy and the waiter went the extra mile to ensure everything I had was dairy free.
Brunch was also excellent.  I had the egg sandwich and it was also very tasty.  It is a great location, great atmosphere and I have had 2 great experiences.
