We love Cartwright's!  I've lived in Cave Creek for 5 years and have dined here many, many times. The food here is superb and the service is even better. My absolute favorite is the beef stroganoff. The lobster bisque is great and you can't beat their wine list. They have a great happy hour too. Their black bean hummus is super yummy. Even if I didn't live in Cave Creek I'd make the drive.
