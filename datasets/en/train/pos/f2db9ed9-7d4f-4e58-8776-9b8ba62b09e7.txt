Sit at the bar - ask for Brooks(what a great bartender) - order any of the great cocktails or ask what the have for liquor (some amazing Bourbons!)  Then, order the brussel sprout/pancetta flatbread with the thai bbq ribs (which comes with a side of gouda mac n' cheese), and you're in heaven!  Loved it.  Been twice, and will definitely be going back.
