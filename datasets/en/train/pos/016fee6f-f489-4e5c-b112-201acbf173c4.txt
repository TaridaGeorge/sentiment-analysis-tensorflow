Love this place!  I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it yet.  The service is friendly, the place is cute and comfortable and the food is delicious!  I usually get their pancakes which are really good and my boyfriend alternates between the chorizo omlette and the corned beef hash both are yummy!!  Joe often comes out from the kitchen and chats with the customers when he's able.  Anyway, I highly recommend this place!
