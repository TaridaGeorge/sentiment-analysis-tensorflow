FANTASTIC little lunch/brunch spot! Went here with the family while visiting Scottsdale and really enjoyed it! 

We had the Tuna Melt, which was delicious with their spiked cottage cheese! 
The cranberry chicken salad made into a sandwich was DELICIOUS! 

The omelets and scrambles looks great - I didn't taste, but then again, there was nothing left on the plate! LOL 

Smaller place so could be busy during peak hours, may call or try and hit an off time. Service was ok, wasn't anything special but the food was really cute and made for a really cute little lunch spot!
