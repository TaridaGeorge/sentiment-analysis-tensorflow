People who don't like the Tee Pee didn't grow up in Phoenix in the 60s. Yup, you have to sit at 2 adjacent tables if there are more than 4 in your party, the decor has really never changed, the wait is long (so grab a pitcher of margaritas), and it's NOT Tex Mex! It's the simple Arizona Soronan unique to the area. Oh, and the Mary Lou was named for my mom..
