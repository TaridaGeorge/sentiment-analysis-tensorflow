Critter Ridder did an excellent job for us on a tough problem.  A squirrel had gotten into one of our interiror walls and died there, causing an awful smell in the house.  We called Critter Ridder and they came out within hours.  They found the squirrel using a tiny video camera attached to a long scope and removed it quickly.  The smell immediately went away.  Critter Ridder then came back out and sealed up the house so that no more rodents could get in the walls.  They were fast, professional and very reasonably priced.  Critter Ridder is a great company.
