My lovely bride and I visited on a nearly perfect day in Scottsdale (not hard to find).  We had lunch around 2:00 on a Friday and were astounded how busy the restaurant was but soon learned why that was the case.

Enjoyed an ice cold Peroni along with their bread and pesto dipping sauce.  Just ridiculously good.  I literally could have had the bread for lunch.  Light, airy, slightly salty.  Pesto was perfection.

We then shared the Mediterranean Salad and Chicken Pannini.  Salad was very, very good.  The Pannini was literally one of the best sandwiches I have wolfed down in a very long time.  Moist, simple, filling.  Unreal. 

We found the service to be very solid.  Friendly, attentive but not intrusive.  There is not question that we will return.  The nice part is I already know what to order, as well.
