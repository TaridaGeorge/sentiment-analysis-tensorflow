Top Shelf Alcohol, Cigars, and indoor and out door lounges. (IN A CASINO) what the heck is not to like!!!

You walk in and it is a very warm feel, the bar is some where you can relax and get a good conversation in, while the lounge (indoor and outdoor) is comfortable with really cushy chairs and sofa's. 

Yes it will smell like smoke but it is not overwhelming in the least and the pizza they have for appetizers is quite tasty.

I would highly recommend coming here for a relaxing evening with a fine cigar and glass of scotch I was thoroughly impressed!
