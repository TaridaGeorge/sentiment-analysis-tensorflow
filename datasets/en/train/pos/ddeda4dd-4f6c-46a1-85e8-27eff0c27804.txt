We hired Dizzie for my daughter's birthday party.  They turned 6 & 9. He was very easy to work with over the phone.  He asked lots of ?'s about my girls over the phone.  He showed up on time and once he walked in the fun began.  He not only entertained the kids, but the adults as well.  He made sure every child got a cool balloon creation but interacted with them too.  Dizzie was open to all the kids requests and he delivered some spectacular balloon art!  Do not hesitate to hire this gentleman, he will make your party a hit.
