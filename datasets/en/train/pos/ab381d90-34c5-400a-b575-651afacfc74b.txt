Ok, I know I know, I don't live in Phoenix anymore. But holy hell this place is amazing! I moved away 5 years ago and I still think fondly upon this place.

They have the best gyro, in my opinion. Their hummus is fresh and made with love. I like that their children's menu is simple and healthy. All the good things kids need!

Their wood-fired pizzas are to die for. I come down to visit when I can and I always make sure to visit Pita Jungle. I wish the NW, of all places, had something like this. You would think this belongs on my streetcorner here in Seattle...but nope. It's in sunny Phoenix. Well done Phoenix for putting something tasty and healthy in the desert!
