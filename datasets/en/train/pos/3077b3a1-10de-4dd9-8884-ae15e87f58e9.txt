Yay I am fan too!  I saw this place open recently and knew I would get in to try it eventually.  Well last week was my chance... I actually came twice last week that is how much I liked it.  The owners are extremely nice and attentive and the sandwiches are spectacular!  I have to say I am a condiment hater... manly just one kind of condiment mayonnaise or any variation of that:)  What I loved about this place is they have a tuna salad with no mayo!! it is awesome!  they also add capers to the tuna salad which add such a great flavor.  I had them add some pesto and olive tapenade to my sandwich... it was sooo good I basically had to force myself to stop eating it.  I will definitely be back... cant wait to try a different sandwich and some crepe's too!
