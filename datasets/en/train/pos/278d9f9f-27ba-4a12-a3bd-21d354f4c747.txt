The BEST Bagels in the Valley???

YES!!!

--------------------
Located on the Southeast Corner of 15th Ave and Deer Valley...snuggled on the very corner within the aisles of business complexes....it's easy to find!

They (I assume were the owners) are VERY proud of their Bagels here! They were so kind and cordial too, they even gave me one extra bagel with my order. (They do have a thick accent and didn't smile, but it did remind me so much of the authentic NYC charm that I so adore!)

The bagels were a  nice crisp on the outside, dense, and chewy....mmmm!

If I lived closer, I'd be eating their bagels everyday (and probably would weigh a bajillion pounds from it too!)

I look forward to trying their sandwiches on my next visit.
