Great little place. We were visting the local outlet mall from out of town and I found good ratings for this place on Yelp. We called 20 minutes before closing and they said not a problem.  Low number of seats, about 75% taken, and still busy with local families having dinner.

Fast and courtious service, wonderful Thai Ice Tea. We had some yummy food, and the soup was served in this cool dish with some flames comming out of the middle..

Can't go wrong!
