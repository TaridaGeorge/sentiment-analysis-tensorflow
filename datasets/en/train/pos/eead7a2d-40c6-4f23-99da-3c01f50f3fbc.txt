I was here for 4 days with my hasnand and each day we could not wait to go and have breakfast here.  He had the jalapeño chedder bagel and I had the asiago bagel breakfast sandwich.   Both were supper yummy.   The only thing he mentioned is that it was only a hint of jalapeño  and he wished for actual jalapeños.   Coffee is great and they state when it was brewed.  The last day I went healthy and had there oatmeal.  Yummy.   It had strawberries and pecans.   I feel ready to take on the day.   Angela came by to check on us and was great to tell us a little about the place.  I have left the best for last.   The have the absolutely best cookies.  So moist and perfect flavor.  I hope you try this place out and have the same great experience.
