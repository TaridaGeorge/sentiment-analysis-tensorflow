Four Peaks is great on all levels but one.... parking.  Don't go there after 5 expecting to have an easy time parking.

The beer is great, but don't expect any other beer than the ones they make.  The food is terrific and the atmosphere is one of a kind.  I haven't met anyone who didn't love this place.
