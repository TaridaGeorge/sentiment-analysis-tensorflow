The food is excellent. I recommend a few items in particular:

The Commuter breakfast sandwich -- the very best breakfast sandwich I have ever had, anywhere in the world. Eggs, bacon, fresh tomato, cheese, on a fresh-baked English muffin. I can't describe the taste -- it's just really, really good.

Mia's pancakes -- they're going light on the cream lately for reasons unknown, but it's still an excellent breakfast.

Chocolate raspberry muffin.
