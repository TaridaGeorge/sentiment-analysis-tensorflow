This restaurant was suggested to us by the gal at the Roaring Fork, as they were not open for lunch. I had the turkey sandwich, it was like having Thanksgiving between two slices of bread! It was awesome! The staff was engaging, not taking offense to our preoccupation with trying to figure out why some people got white napkins and some got black napkins. Turns out their white napkins are "linty" and they have had people complain, so they give out black napkins to anyone with dark pants on. Why anyone would complain to a restaurant  about lint on their trousers is an entirely different question. This place has great ambiance too. Check it out!
