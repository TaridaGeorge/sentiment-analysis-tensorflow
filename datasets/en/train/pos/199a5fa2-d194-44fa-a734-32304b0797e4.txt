Amazing food and service.  The Chicken Salad was amazing.  Gluten free pizza with squash was amazing.  Chocolate pudding....well you know....delightful.  The pizza was ordered without onions and was prepared with onions.  They recooked the pizza quickly.  The manager stopped by the table to apologize and comped the pizza and a desert.  We didn't expect or want them to comp anything.  They went above and beyond.  Again, the food and service were top notch.  Eat here, you will not be disappointed.
