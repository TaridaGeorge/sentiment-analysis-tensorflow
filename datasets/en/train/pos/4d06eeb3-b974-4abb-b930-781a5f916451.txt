The menu selection was fair and food was authentic.  Their price for Korean BBQ was cheap compare to other Korean BBQ restaurants. Service was good, they noticed and asked me if I want more free side dishes that came with the meal when they spotted my empty plate before I even have to ask. 
It's my new favorite Korean restaurant for sure!!!
