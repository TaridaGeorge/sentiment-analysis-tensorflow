Absolutely wonderful. Very modern decor and friendly service. I have had the eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy and both of the breakfast burritos. You order at the counted, take your number and they bring you your food. Everything I have eaten here was delicious! Well flavored and a huge portions. The staff is also very nice! I also love their naturally flavored teas.
