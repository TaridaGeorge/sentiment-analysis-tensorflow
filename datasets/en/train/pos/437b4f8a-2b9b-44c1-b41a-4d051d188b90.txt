This is my favorite sushi in the valley! I have been coming to Shogun since I was a kid and it is delicious. The portions are large, the quality is excellent. I love all the chef's, but Alex is our favorite! We just tell him to go for it, and we eat whatever he puts in front of us. He has never ceased to amaze us. Shogun rocks! Try the surfer roll if you're hungry; you won't be disappointed!
