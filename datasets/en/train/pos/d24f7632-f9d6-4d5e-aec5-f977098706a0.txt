I had other piercings done here and then went out of state and got my nose pierced with a friend and when i got back I was having problems with it. I went in and talked to them and they changed out the stud for me gave me a discount on the jewelry and were really fun, friendly, professional and very informative. This place is top notch. Won't go to another place for my piercings again! No way! It is very clean, and these guys know their stuff! Really impressed...I could go on and on! I won't get my jewelry anywhere else either...they have a a great variety and if they don't have something you want they order it, easy peasy. Love it!
