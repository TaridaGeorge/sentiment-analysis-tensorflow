Absolutely awesome!  Let's get back to basics here - when you go to a restaurant, although its great to have good service, ambiance, etc, the real reason you go is for the food!  

We did have great service and a really nice time, but to rate this place anything under a 5 - just for the quality of the culinary experience, would be unfair!

The bottom line at Fuego Bistro - although service was very good and the place is really cool - is the food.  Everything we had was incredible - the prawn entree, the pork entree, and the sides - cornbread casserole, creamed corn, maple carrots, all super delicious.

We'll DEFINITELY be back
