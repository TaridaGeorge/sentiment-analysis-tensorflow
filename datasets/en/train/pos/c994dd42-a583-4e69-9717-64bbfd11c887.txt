impeccable service. delectable food. this place delivers.

the husband took me here to celebrate our 3rd anniversary.... and albeit pricey, every penny was well spent. We went for the 5 course tasting menu and sat at the bar, which I highly recommend. The precision and presentation of each course is incredible. 

My favorite courses were the nigiri course (best fish EVER), the grill course (wagyu beef!!!), and the dessert (panna cotta). Everything was amazing, but these were my favorites. 

Save up your money and have the experience of a lifetime here.
