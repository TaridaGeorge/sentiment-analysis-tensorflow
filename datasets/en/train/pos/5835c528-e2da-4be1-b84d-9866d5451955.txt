We have been going here at least once per month for over three years now.  Never disappoints, and often surprisingly good.  The soup, for instance, is absolutely fabulous, always.  I grew up super picky and because of this restaurant, I now eat veggies.  Love the grean beans, fettucine with broccoli, and all the veggie soups.  Their traditional Italian cuisine is better than most I've tasted, even in Little Italy, NY.  They make a wonderful steak (rivals any steakhouse, espeically with the gorganzola cream!) and their salads are amazing.  I cannot recommend enough - love it!  Plus, they have great bartenders.  :)
