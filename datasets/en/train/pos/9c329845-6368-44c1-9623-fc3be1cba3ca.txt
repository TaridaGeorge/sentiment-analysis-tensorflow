Fanciest most fun burger joint I have ever been to.  At midnight, the place was bumpin'  The burger was out of this world and was topped off with a great basket of fries served in a small shopping cart and complimented by a great mayo sauce and ketchup.  Washed it all down with some Fat Tire.   I can't wait to go back!
