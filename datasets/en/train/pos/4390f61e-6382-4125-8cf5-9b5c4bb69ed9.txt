I am so lucky to have met Stephanie, aesthetician at Dr. Geoffrey Leber's office.  She has helped my skin tremendously!  She has been my skin expert for the past year.  I now get compliments all the time on my skin, and although it was not bad before, it now smoother than ever with a healthy glow.  I love the level of professionalism and knowledge on all skin treatments and products.  I am always confident that I am getting treatments that are in the best interest of my skin, rather than what is best for their bottom line.  I would highly recommend a consultation so you can learn about all the cutting edge options they offer.
