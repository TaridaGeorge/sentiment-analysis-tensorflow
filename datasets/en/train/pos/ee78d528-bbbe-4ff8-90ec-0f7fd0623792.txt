I've been going to Z'Tejas for many years.  The menu is varied, food is cooked to your specifications. . .your item doesn't have to be hot or too spicy as they cook to order. The cornbread is outstanding. . .fresh baked and it  comes with your meal. If I need to get a gift card for relatives, take-out for the family, or have  guests in town,  this is my first choice.  I've never had a bad meal there!!! I love this place!!
