I love ducking in here for a great glass of wine and some live jazz.  The ambiace is cool and classy.  The decor has that old world feel.  The staff is knowledgeable about their wines, and should be so.  I have enjoyed the flights they offer, better to taste a few at a time.  There are so many wines to chose from, doing the flights is the idealic way to go to.  Enjoy yourself here, and be whisked to another world for a few hours, you'll be glad you did.
