Chef Porter has done it again with this fabulous addition to the Old Town food scene!  This intimate, small restaurant is a welcome change to large, overwhelming and sometimes overly fancy restaurants.  We sat on the patio by the fire with tons of lovely flowers everywhere.  Our server was extremely knowledgeble about both wines and food.  The mussels appetizer was fantastic, but I always love mussel, so not yet quite a true test.  I asked the server what their signature dish was, and he recommended the duck.  So, I ordered the duck, and let me tell you, you haven't lived until you have eaten this dish.  I think I have had duck a couple of other times, but it definelty did not taste like this!  The sweet corn cream sauce was to die for!  Overall, this restaurant went above and beyond expectations and I will be returning!!
