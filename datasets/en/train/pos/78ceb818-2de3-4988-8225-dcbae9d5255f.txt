Whats not to love about Costco?  Costco is the Target to Sam's Club's Walmart.  It's just cleaner and has a better feel.  The people are always helpful and if they don't have something you want, suggest it...they might order it for you.  The "Kirkland" brand is Costco's "house" brand.  The products are always of high quality.  They have an Excellent dog food  (Better than Iams).  Best of all if there is something you don't like...they will take it back without any issues.  If you're REALLY smart, you will get a business license from the state, and sign up for the Business Amex ... 5% cash back on gas!!  During the high prices, I was saving over $0.15 per gallon!!!
