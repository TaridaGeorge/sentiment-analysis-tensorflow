BEVMO!  Back home on the east coast we have no such thing.  We have Total Wine, which I thought was great, but now......I'm a BEVMO man.

This place is like an adult candy store. (NOT like Castle, different kind of adult candy haha)

Keep an eye out for the cheap deals they do, buy one get one for a nickle anyone?  They've got a great selection of not only wine but beers.  I've found some beers here that I haven't been able to find anywhere else short of ordering it over the internet.

Great customer service too!
