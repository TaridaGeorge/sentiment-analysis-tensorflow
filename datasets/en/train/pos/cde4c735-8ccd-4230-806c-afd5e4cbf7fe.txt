My husband and I had an awesome dinner at Ticoz! Our server Andrew was excellent too! We order the Blue Corn Enchiladas and Coconut Curry Rice both were amazing! The place was busy and they still had us served withing 20 min. Parking was a bit tight...but well worth it! We use a living Social deal this was our first time. We will be back soon!
