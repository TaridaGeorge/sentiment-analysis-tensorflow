Best Indian food ever!!!  I lived in NYC for a while and couldn't find anything quite as good as Udupi.  Great prices (hubby and I can get out of there for under $20 bill).  The Aloo Gobi is perfect and I love their assorted appetizer platter.  Fried goodness!  The staff is very friendly.  I've done the lunch buffet, too, which is fun and great for mixing it up if you find yourself ordering the same thing every time.  Only $8.95!  Took a group of work friends (even some hardcore meat eaters) and everyone left happy and full.
