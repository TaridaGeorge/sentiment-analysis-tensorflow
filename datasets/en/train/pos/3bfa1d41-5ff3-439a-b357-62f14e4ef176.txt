We were in town visiting for Spring Training and liked this place so much that we went twice in two nights.  It's a cute place--the desserts are delicious but I don't know about any entrees.  It's pretty crowded most of the time but that'll happen when you're serving yummy ice cream at a good price in an adorable little parlor.

The staff is friendly, too.  I'd go back again in a heartbeat.

Two thumbs up!
