Ditto what Corianne S. said. After all, we went together and had the same things and were in love with the food.

Basically, I would eat whatever Johnny Chu put in front of me. The man is a genius and I have been following him around since the Lucky Dragon. Ok, so I only ate their once, but I remember how good the food was (years later) and Fate was absolutely amazing.

Johnny Chu, we love you. Yeah, I know. Sounds like a man crush, but when a guy can cook like that you can't help yourself.
