I can't say enough about Dr. Fry and his staff. From the first time I went to his office to my ongoing visits I am treated with such care. Dr. Fry takes his time to talk to me and answer my questions. I have a complicated illness and Dr. Fry has been able to treat me so that I can live a normal life.
