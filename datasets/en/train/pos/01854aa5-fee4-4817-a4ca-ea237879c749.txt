i love this church!! I found it before i moved to phx and saw that pope john paul went here, how many churches have been visited by the pope in america not many!! Made my three wishes, and love that the door is always open to pray. Also the stained glass windows are amazing!! I go here after my downtown hospital rotations or if I'm in the area!! I also like that they have afternoon mass at 12 and a mass for the deaf how great is that!! love this place a must see phx jem!
