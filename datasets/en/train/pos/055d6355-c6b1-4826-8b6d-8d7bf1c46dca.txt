What a great new place to have in Old Town Scottsdale. As I understand it, Sunshine is NOT a P.F. Chang's concept, but a stand alone neighborhood restaurant that happens to be owned and operated by a guy (Rich) who started up Chang's with pal Paul Flemming back in the day. So, the quality is equally amazing both in flavor and surrounding. The staff is not your average. A gentleman named Montgomery is at the door to make you feel cared for and directed to an evening of comfort and great Chinese food. The dinning room window's will be a treat when they fully open to the placid air around spring. My favorite dish was the Chicken Soft Noodles w/ an over easy fried egg. The vegetable's were fresh an not overcooked. Style, comfort Chinese in a hip Old Town Scottsdale setting.
