This is literally the coolest bookstore I've ever been to!  It had books of any and every subject you can think of!  I especially loved the cook-book section :)  There were also tons of cute little gifts and metaphysical trinkets.  It's also right next-door to Wildflower Bread Company (the 2 are connected), so you can sit down for some food with your newly purchased books and just hang out :)  The staff is very helpful and friendly, and the have lots of good recommendations based on the types of books you like.  I also love that they give you a frequent buyer card (I easily spent $60 on my first trip here, so the card has come in handy).
