Tracy and his staff are phenomenal! Always a fun atmosphere. The food here is great! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the chicken nachos and the tots. Best tots around! I never have to wait, the staff is always having a good time, and they keep the beers coming! Parking is tight, but the complimentary valet makes up for it. There is a little area for children that is tucked away, always odd to see kids at a bar, but Arcadia does a good job at keeping them away from the bar area so families can come in for a bite to eat.  I would highly recommend this place as a great bar to watch games at, grab some great food (not the average bar fare) or to just hangout and enjoy a few adult beverages. Two thumbs up!
