Yes, this place can be a bit pricey, however if you catch them at happy hour or on "girls night out" it can be very affordable. The atmosphere and the "specialness" of the melting pot is unbeatable. I have been there for intimate occasions, and family birthdays. Food is wonder, especially the cheese! The menu has changed a bit over the years, and there are some oldies I would love to see return (the mushroom salad), but there is nothing that beats this place for any special occasion
