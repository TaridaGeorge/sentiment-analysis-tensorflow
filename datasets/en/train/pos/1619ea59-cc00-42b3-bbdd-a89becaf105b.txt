This store is amazing! I go in here on a regular basis. Charlie is usually there, and he knows everything about everything! I've purchased great furniture, including an awesome vintage chair for my living room, all the way down to the duck cookie jar that reminded me of my Grandma's house. I can always find something, and even when I'm broke I can still splurge on a one dollar wall hanging or a 3 dollar jewelry box. This place is one of my favorite spots in the area. Great value, super finds, and always a friendly smile when I walk in the door! Oh, and it's HUGE! A lot bigger inside than it looks on the outside!
