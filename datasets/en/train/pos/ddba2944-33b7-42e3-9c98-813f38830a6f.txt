We definitely enjoyed our stay here! If the staff was any friendlier, it would have been obnoxious, but every person we encountered was extremely nice and helpful. The massages at the spa were great. We had dinner at the Blue Sage, which was excellent. Really enjoyed the pools/lazy river, and the Starbucks right inside the hotel. It's great to get away for a weekend.
