Saturday mornings are now my favorite. I've given up the hangover mornings to come to the open air market and shop the locals. Everything you need is right here.
There are sweet potatoes the size of your head. Tomatoes the size of a small baby. Brussels Sprouts that look like tennis balls. Goat Cheese that melts in your mouth  Jams that will have your guests wondering where you found such a unique blend and plenty of local art.

So, get up, get going and get out to the open air market! You won't regret it.
