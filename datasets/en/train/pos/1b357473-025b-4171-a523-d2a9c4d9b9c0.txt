Just a quick Update to say that I still love this place & shop here all the time.  Yes, you may have to hunt around in the store for what you want, but what you get in return is excellent quality merchandise at unbelievable low prices!!  (Remember too that they allow you to "Double Dip"... buying something that is on sale & also using one of the 20% off coupons that appear in many magazines.)

This is a great, great company to buy your tools (& much more) from!!     :-))
