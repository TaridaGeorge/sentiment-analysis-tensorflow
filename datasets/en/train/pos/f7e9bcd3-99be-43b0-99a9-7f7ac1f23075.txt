Oh how I love this store.  Can't wait till it comes to Denver.  Always have to make a stop when I am visiting. My trips would not be the same if I didn't get wine, ginger snaps, seaweed and candy of some sort.  This time I bought cookie dough spread.  I was so exited to bring the jar home and try it out on bread, apples or just out of the jar.

Oh wait TSA confiscated it on my return to Denver.  I was so bummed and still am.  I asked why and the guy said it was a liquid.  Really.  I left my coconut water at my sons because that is liquid.  How is this spread liquid?  Please tell me.
