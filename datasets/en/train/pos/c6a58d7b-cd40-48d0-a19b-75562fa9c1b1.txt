I loved this store.  I am not sure what the other reviewers were expecting, but I am glad to take the store for what it is and not what it is not.  It has an amazing variety of educational toys.  Having a child that required some OT and Speech therapy, I wish I had known about this place before.  THere are so many items I could have gotten.  I love that they have a free craft for kids 3+ every Saturday.  Of course, they know you are not going to come out empty handed.  I ended up spending about $60.00.  I used my $5 check in coupon.  Thank you, Yelp.  They were so nice.  They told me I could organize a craft day with my twin group.  Can't wait to go back.
