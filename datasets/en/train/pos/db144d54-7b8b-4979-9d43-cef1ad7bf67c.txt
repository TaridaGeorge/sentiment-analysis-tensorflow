I love this place. It's got a nice atmosphere, although it can get loud easily since it is a smaller place. The service is always friendly and quick. I never leave broke and I always leave pleasantly full and with a take home, that heats up well I might add. I've had the pastas, the salads, and the pizzas, and have never been let down. Its a good place to go before a movie,split a pizza and when you get over to the theater, you don't blow money on snacks :)
