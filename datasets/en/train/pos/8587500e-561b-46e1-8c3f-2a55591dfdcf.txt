LOVE the physical attributes of this studio...by far one of the most beautiful studios I've been to...the high ceilings, the floor to ceiling windows and the industrial design make it an interesting and peaceful place to do yoga.  My favorite instructor is....well, maybe I shouldn't say because then there will be a waiting list for my class!!!  Decent prices, especially if you buy in a package and really awesome boutique in the front where you can buy some spectacular handmade jewelry and lovely yoga accoutrements.
