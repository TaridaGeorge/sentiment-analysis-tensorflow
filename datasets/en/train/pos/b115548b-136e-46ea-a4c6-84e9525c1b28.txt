I wanted to update my review and say this place is still a top notch Thai place in Phoenix.  

For starters I had the Crab Wonton's which are a must.  They come with an amazing dipping sauce and have a generous amount of crab not Krab in them which is what makes the difference from a lot of these cheap places in town.  

For the entree I had the Seafood Hot Pot which is full of Shrimp, scallops, clams and calamari with tomatoes and sliced fresh mushrooms in a hot and sour lemon grass broth. I ordered it Thai hot which was great to open up my sinuses and keep my tummy warm : ).  

Everything from the food to the service at this place is top notch.  Don't miss out on this one.
