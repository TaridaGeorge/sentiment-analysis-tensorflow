Called on New Years Eve because I had a leaking water heater. They came out right away and confirmed it was the water heater and not any other plumbing problems. I asked if they could remove the old heater and I would like to install the new one myself. They didn't give me a hard time like other companies will if you say you want to do some of the job yourself. In fact, they gave me some pointers and warned me of some potential pitfalls. I asked for the bill and I think I was charged a very reasonable price. I will call Paramount again anytime I need plumbing help.
