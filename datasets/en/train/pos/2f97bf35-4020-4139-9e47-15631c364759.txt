This is really one of my favorite places to get some good cajun food!  Their fried catfish is nice and crispy, their blackened catfish is juicy and spicy and their red beans and rice are quite tasty.  

Let's talk about their gumbo....hmmm....hmmm... good!  They offer three different types: chicken and sausage, seafood and duck and sausage.  I really love the seafood gumbo, but don't sleep on the duck and sausage.  It has a different flavor, but it's wonderful.  

If you're in Phoenix, you have to try this place.  You'll feel like you're in the Big Easy!!
