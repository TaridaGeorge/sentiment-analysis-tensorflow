It was behind a Mortuary off 48th street and Indian School for decades before it moved to the last location.  You think it was good then, You should have seen it before in the 60's, 70's and 80's.  It left that location just after Thanksgiving in 1994, although it wasn't called the Monastery at that point as there was a fight between all the owners.  The Monastery had relocated around '91/92 or so.  The party was pretty much over after that.
