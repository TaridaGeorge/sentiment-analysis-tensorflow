My husband and I ate at Cibo when we visited Phoenix.  The pizza is excellent.  I'd have to say it is either the best or the second best pizza we've eaten, and we eat a lot of pizza.  The crust was not thick or thin, it was just right.  The ingredients were fresh and the cheese was delicious! We waited about 1 hour to finally score a spot at the bar, which is first come, first serve.  Be sure to get there when they open or you're in for a long wait.  Definitely worth it!
