The Junk Guys are fantastic. I used them recently to dispose of a couch my dog decided to use as a chew toy during his puppy stage. The crew showed up promptly and were very friendly and professional. They took care to clean up the debris falling from my mauled couch as they removed it, which I thought was a nice touch. I appreciated that they were willing to pick up a relatively small load and were flexible with scheduling on my tight timeline. I would definitely use The Junk Guys again!
