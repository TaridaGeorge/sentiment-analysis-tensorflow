This resort is amazing! The grounds, pools, restaurants, workout facilities and spa are beautiful. Yet the best part is the customer service. From the front desk to the bell boy to the valet to the maid service to the restaurant staff. Everyone is willing to help however they can while wearing a smile. And the place is  totally decked out for Christmas which is a huge bonus. We will never stay anywhere else in Scottsdale.
