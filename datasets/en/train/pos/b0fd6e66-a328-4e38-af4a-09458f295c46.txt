There is a place called Heaven, and it is a Bosa glazed donut.  The donut holes are the best and a real deal at 12 for $0.99.  It's not a quick stop though, Arcadia loves them some Bosa so there is always a line in the drive through.  But the wait in line for a fluffy pillow that is a Bosa donut is soooooo worth it.
