I was in town for a quick trip and needed a place to grab a late dinner.  From the Yelp description I only knew it was a pizza place with good reviews - I didn't realize the atmosphere was so chill and modern.  
Pesto's is not just a little hole in the wall with white walls and pizza sauce stains by the floorboards.  Instead, it's a very nice spot to take a date, or to just belly up to the bar solo (as I did).
Service was friendly and fast, and a good selection of alcohol (especially liquor) is on hand.
Great atmosphere, friendly service, and delicious calzone. Drenched in sauce and absolutely delicious.
