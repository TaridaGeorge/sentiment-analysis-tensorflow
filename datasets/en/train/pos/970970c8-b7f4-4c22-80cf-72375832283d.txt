Dear Slush Puddles in the South End,

I'm so sorry to hear you are getting 10 inches of snow on New Year's Eve.  I know how much of a pain it is to have an awesome outfit all planned out only to have to prepare it for the snow.  I know that getting a cab on a night like this can be an impossible feat.  

May your closed toe shoes not get messed up, may your hair style stay in place in the snow and wind, may the bouncer at the bar/club not make you wait for long outside and may you not step in any slush puddles over a foot deep.  Chin up, NYE only means 4 more months of winter!

Happy New Year!

Love,
