I am a huge follower of Karl Kopp.  In fact, I live in Chicago and manage to make it up to Elsa's atleast twice a month, which is one of their other locations.  I cannot express enough much my partner and I enjoy going here when in town.  The food RULES and the rotating art installations are breath taking!!!!
