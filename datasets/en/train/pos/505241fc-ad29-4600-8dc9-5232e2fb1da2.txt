I decided to try it out, I'm celiac and therefore can only eat gluten free...
They have an easy to understand GF Menu with anything you can possibly want.

I placed my order online and picked the exact pickup time. I cam and my food was ready for me. Driving home the smell in my car was so good I could barely wait to get home and try it - true umami!

I got home and dug into the delicious spicy chicken and rice with sugar snapies and carrots. It was superb! For $9 I will definitely try this again! I did see a huge line at the store, so try doing an online order and pickup forsure!

p.s. they even include GF soy sauce!
