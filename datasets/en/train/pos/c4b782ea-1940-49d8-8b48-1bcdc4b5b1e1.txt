what a beautiful place. although we only saw a fraction of it (it was the site of 2012 Phoenix Devoured), i was highly impressed at all the art pieces we did see. the area was completely spacious and at times, seemed utterly expansive. the courtyard was immaculately groomed, with lots of paths and even the museum showcased some food for the event. 

their food options were exceptionally tasty and would be a dining option even if you didn't go to the museum itself. i especially liked the big bang sculpture in the lobby and the giant red dinosaur out front.
