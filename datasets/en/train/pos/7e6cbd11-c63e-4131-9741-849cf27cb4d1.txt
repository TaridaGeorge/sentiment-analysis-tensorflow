Where do I start?  As a shopper, writer and publicist I love Pink House.  Danica, the owner, is amazing.  We used her apparel on a few morning show segments for our models and fell in love with her store. 

The staff is laid back and friendly, the store decor is fun and flirty and the apparel is trendy and affordable. Some jewelry and shoes are pricey, but you won't see anyone else wearing it, so its worth the price. Basically, you can find an affordable outfit and a unique piece all in the same place.

My favorite part of Pink House is the home decor items placed throughout the store. From unique decor accessories to full sized eclectic furniture...its definitely worth the visit. 

Unfortunately, Pink House is sooo far from where I live, but when I am close I always stop by.
