Camelback Inn's Spa is quite possibly the finest, most luxurious spa I've ever visited.  It's set up in the desert oasis of Camelback Mountain.  Delicious body, facial, and massage treatments are only a short drive from central Phoenix.  Be prepared to pay for your luxury, though.  Along with your spa treatment, you have access to their workout facilities, gorgeous Olympic lap-pool, jacuzzis, and steamrooms.  If you're visiting Phoenix, especially in the summer, this place is a perfect getaway from the heat of the city to the soothing and calming environment of Camelback Mountain.
