A great place to buy wigs, half wigs, cocktail wigs, extensions, and more. The young woman working there is extremely knowledgable and friendly. She is the best one that has worked there since I started going there 5 years ago. Prices a good too They will order anything you want that  is out of stock and get it to you fast. Only thing I don't like is they have very few blonde items. I want to send friends there but most are blonde and that selection is skimpy.  Some nice nail supplies. Only ones who sells Non Hypoallergenic nail glue.......the BEST! Can't do with out it!
