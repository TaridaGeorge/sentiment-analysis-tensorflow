Behind the Mask is the best hockey store in Arizona hands down. Randy and all of his guys that work their are very knowledgeable about hockey and all the new equipment. Last time I went in I needed some work done on my skates and a 20 dollar mouth guard, something that would cost about 80 bucks at the other pro shop in my area, only cost me 40 at BTM.
