I love this bookstore! Used and new titles at affordable prices, helpful staff, lots of fun gifty items. I love bookstores where the fiction section has large tables filled with great suggestions - I don't think you can leave this place without buying something. There's a great religion/spirituality/new age section (I even got to see some random dude meditating and blocking the hallway. You know it's a great bookstore when there are men criss-cross-apple-sauce deep in thought blocking the isles.) The bookstore has a very grass-roots-helping-local-businesses-succeed atmosphere. I will buy here (and trade in) often.
