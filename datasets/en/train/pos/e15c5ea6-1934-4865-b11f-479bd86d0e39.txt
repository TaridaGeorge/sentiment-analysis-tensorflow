I had my air conditioner stop working and needed assistance immediately for my home. This business was able to assist me within minutes of my call and the technician was extremely professional. He was honest about what was wrong with my unit (major concern) and fixed my air conditioner the same visit. The young man stayed to verify that my home was cool again and went the extra mile to make sure I was a satisfied customer. I couldn't thank this High Country Comfort enough. I would recommend this place to anyone....friends, family, co-workers and neighbors.
