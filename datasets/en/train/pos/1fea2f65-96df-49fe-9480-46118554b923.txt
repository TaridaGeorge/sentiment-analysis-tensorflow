Cute place, not fancy but comfortable.  Huge beer selection and knowledgeable bartender.  I had the bacon wrapped shrimp and penne pasta.  Pasta was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor.  My boyfriend had the bacon cheese burger cooked to medium which is to done for me but I had a bite and it was still juicy and delicious.  My lunch also came with choice of soup or salad and I chose the Caesar.  Fresh parmesan plus they added sun dried tomatoes, best Caesar I've ever had. This is a great place to chill after a hike or bike ride.
