Get the home fries get the home fries get the home fries.

How I never heard of this place before is beyond me. Found it by accident over the weekend and have never been so happy.  Ive been looking for a good greasy spoon breakfast place since i moved here and this place is great.

Its small, there will be a line, but its so worth it.  I got the 5 spot (SUPER thick bacon, REAL eggs, onions, cheese on a roll) and my boyfriend got the griddlecakes, it was delicious.

The waitresses were nice, the place was clean which i imagine is a chore considering the cramped quarters, and the food is just awesome.

Its casual, you should show up early, and 2 people can eat very well for under 20 bucks.
