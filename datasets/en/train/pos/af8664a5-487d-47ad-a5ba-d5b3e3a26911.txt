I was with a friend for random chase for Mediterranean cuisine, and we ran into this little grocery store/mini restaurant.  Chicken gyro for $4 is unheard of these days.  The size of the gyro is almost like a burrito and is extremely filling.  The full plate comes with the meat, plenty of rice, hummus, and salad for just $7.  The tastes are very flavorful and authentic.
