FEZ!!! You have redeemed yourself! I love you again. 

Service this time around was amazing!!! Thomas, the general manager, is super fun! Monica, our server, did a great job. 

The food was delicious!!! I had the lamb chops. To die for! My friend had the rib eye. Also very good. 

Oh Fez, I will come back to you again and again.
