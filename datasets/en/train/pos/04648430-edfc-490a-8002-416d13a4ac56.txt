Love this place to eat and drink!!  This was a great find.  My favorite point is that they have organic chicken on the menu!  So hard to find.  The food in general is delicious.  I obviously got the chicken which came with mashed and green beans, and my boyfriend got the Sheppard's pie, which he also loved.  The service is great.  They have a ton of t.v.s, as well as pool, darts and video games.  It is very big and draws a nice crowd.  Highly recommend!
