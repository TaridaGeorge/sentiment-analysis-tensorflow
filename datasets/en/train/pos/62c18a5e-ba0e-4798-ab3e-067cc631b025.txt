It's been a while since I've been here to eat, but what I remember, the food is awesome. Tropical style with fresh flavors like mango and coconut. Plenty of fresh fish. The decor is modern tiki like the name says. The patio is great especially when weather permits. Their happy hour specials are great and the uniqueness of the drinks is a fantastic plus. It's always nice to sit down at a bar and strike up conversation with the guy 2 seats away as well as the bartender. The staff were definitely friendly. I wish there was one of these closer to the East side.
