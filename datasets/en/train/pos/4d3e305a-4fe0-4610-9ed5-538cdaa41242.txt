One of my *all time* fave B'Fast places!

Food is great!  People are personable.  Ambiance is pleasant.  Place is *clean*!

After my second time, I've always been greeted as a friend -- not just as a "regular".  AND, Mike will cook my waffle [thanks for the heads-up Milee S.] the way I like my waffle.  I don't have to eat it the same way [golden brown] that most everyone else wants theirs.  I get it the way I like it -- charcoal-y [that's how I like a waffle. you get yours the way you like a waffle].

Great place!  All thumbs up!
