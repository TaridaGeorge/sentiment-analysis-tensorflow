I have been to jojo's many times and it is my choice for great pizza on the northwest side.   The pizza is fresh and consistently good. Reminds me of my pizzeria that I owned back in NJ.  I have had the salads, chicken parm, eggplant parm and it's all good. The food comes out quick considering they are usually busy and the staff is knowledgable and attentive. Even though I pass two other pizza places on my way to JOJO's ....it's worth it. I give JOJO"s    8 pizza dough's outta 10 .....
