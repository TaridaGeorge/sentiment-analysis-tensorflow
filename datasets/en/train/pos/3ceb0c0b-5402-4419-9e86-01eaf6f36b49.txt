How do I drive past this place every day and never stop?  Now that I've tried it... I won't make that mistake again!  D'lic has a great menu of fresh breakfast items including several vegetarian and gluten free selections.  Good bye starbucks, I found my new favorite coffee,  I'm so hooked!  Just beware the drive-thru is not super fast because all the food and drinks are made to order, but if you plan for a 10-15 minute wait you'll be fine.  The food is not cheap, but reasonable for fresh ingredients cooked to order.  Definitely give this place a try, great hang over cure after a nice out in OT!
