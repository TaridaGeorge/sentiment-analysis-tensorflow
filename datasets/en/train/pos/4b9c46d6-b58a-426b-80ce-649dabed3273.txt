Cafe Bink is one of those specal places that offers unique preparations using only the freshest organic and locally grown ingredients. I know I'm paying a little more because I expect a little more, and At Binks I always get more. I am never disappointed.   Inside the seating is very european, so it seems natural to have friendly conversation with your neighbor, if you choose.  Outdoors, there is a nice patio wtih up-close views of Black Mountain...a lovely place to have a quaint romantic meal.  At the bar you can expect great Martini, and a great selection of wine.
