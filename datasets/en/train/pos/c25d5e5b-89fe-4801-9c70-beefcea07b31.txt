Just got back from a showing of Avatar in the 3d and was blown away, not just by the movie, but by the theater it's self.   While I've been to an Imax several times in the past, I'm always amazed at the theaters.

They get 5 stars just for having enough room in front of the seats so that people can walk past you to the bathroom without having to get up  and make ackward grunts as their hip briefly grinds against your hip.
