Discovered this place by accident. Didn't want to go far from our motel, didn't want anything too fancy, and didn't want fast food. This became the perfect choice. 

While they don't claim to be an authentic Greek Restaurant, they do claim to be an authentic Chicago Restaurant. I've never been to Chicago, but I have friends from there, and they would love it here. 

Good, friendly atmosphere, great Gyro meat, the best Kalmata olives and really good Beef and Lamb Shawarma. And the best, second to none, pita bread, anywhere.
