I really like the fact that this is a straight piercing joint. They don't try to mix tattoo's in like so many other places. The people that work there are very professional (Ok so my grandma would cross the street if one was walking towards her... but don't judge a book by it's cover gramma). The jewelry selection is awesome and they keep books of pictures so you can see what all sorts of freaky deeky piercings look like. I've been pierced and stretched and both were very pleasant experiences.
