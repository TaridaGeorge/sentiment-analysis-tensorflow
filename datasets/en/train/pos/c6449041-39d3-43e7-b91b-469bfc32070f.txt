Love this place! The falafel and hummus is delicious here! Be sure to ask for the whole wheat pita, it's healthier and tastes way better. They also used to have an item called a "medchilada" same concept as an enchilada  but way tastier, the portion is pretty large (I eat a lot so when I say it's huge, believe me) so I would suggest sharing it with someone. I always get it with tofu, tried it with meat but it just wasn't the same. 

Now although this is no longer on the menu, you can still order it. All you have to do is ask :)
