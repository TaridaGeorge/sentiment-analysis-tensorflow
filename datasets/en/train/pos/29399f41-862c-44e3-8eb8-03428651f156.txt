I ate here for the first time the other day. I was a bit nervous that it'd be busy because it was a Sunday morning but there were still spots in their baby parking lot. Their drive thru is poorly placed for other drivers trying to park but their ordering system makes the line go pretty quickly. My friend and I ate on the patio. They was plenty of seating outside but little seating inside. The food and drinks were great! I had a breakfast croissant sandwich and an orange glorious smoothie. 

All in all the restaurant is appropriately named. The food and drinks are indeed d'lish.
