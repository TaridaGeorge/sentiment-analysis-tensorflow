Seriously.. Maggie H. Should be stripped of her elite status for such a mis informed point of View. I LOVE RESTAURANT DEPOT because unlike Costco or Sams Club, It is exclusively here for people to conduct restaurant Business,This is restaurant Owner Mecca.. No crowds, just lots of Slobo's and Eastern Slavick Europeans who smell like the restaurant business..Hard working restaurant people.. Restaurant owners size each other up secretely by looking at how large their carts are, Its like a total Sub Culture, a club if you will for the hardest working restaurant owners in the valley..I meet some of the coolest people ever here, and the prices are truly about 20% less than Sysco or Us Foods...
