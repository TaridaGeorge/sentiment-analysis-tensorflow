I had my wedding here and I must say I didn't need a wedding planner with these guys.  Husband and wife owners and they treated my event like it was their own.

The outdoor area was big enough to handle out 100+ crowd.  Speaker system worked nice so everyone heard the whole ceremony. It was just flat out GORGOUS with the decor with the fountain and red brick and this is just the outside.

The inside was 100 time better than the outside giving it that outside cafe in Italy look.  The food was EXCELLENT all around.  Just the experience was top notch.  All the guests said we picked a great place and a couple of my friends are having their weddings there.  A lot better value than some of the other venues, more bang for the buck.
