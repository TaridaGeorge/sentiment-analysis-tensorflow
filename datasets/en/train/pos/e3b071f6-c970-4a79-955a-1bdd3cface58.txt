this is the perfect time of year to visit DBG.

in spring they start their spring jazz in the garden series (every firday night) with food and cash bar beverages.
you can take painting classes, just stroll around, and now they have this awesome art installation piece made of twigs that you can actually go inside of (completed Feb. 23).
i've been coming here since i was a little 'un and i love coming back. especially if you're a native, you'll love the "desert rain" ... machine? it's basically a strainer with creosote and other desert plant leaves inside, and you turn on the shower fountain head and get an instant whiff of true monsoon season desert rain smell...it's amazing!
