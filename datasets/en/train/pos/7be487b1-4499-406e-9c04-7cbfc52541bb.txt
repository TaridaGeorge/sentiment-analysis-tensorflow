I've been meaning to make it out to Haus Murphy's for a long time, but it is just so far away from the East Valley where I live. Then when I saw it featured on a re-run of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, I decided I needed to make a trip. So today when I was in the neighborhood, I decided to swing by to re-live the good old days I spent in Austria and Germany.

I stopped in for lunch and had the Paprika Schnitzel with German Potato Salad. It tasted exactly as I remember it from Germany and Austria. 

The service was prompt and thorough (Thanks, Tara!), and the atmosphere took me back. - A little slice of Germany in old-town Glendale.
