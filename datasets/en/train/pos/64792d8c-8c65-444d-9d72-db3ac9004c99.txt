I love this place...I prefer it over Jamba Juice!  I have been going to this place since back in highschool...I love the orange freezes and I like to add the whey protein...they are always very nice and are pretty quick!  They always seem to be more fresh!  I wish that there was a Robeks right next to my house and I would be a happy person!
