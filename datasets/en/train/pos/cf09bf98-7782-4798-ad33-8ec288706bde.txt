I knew I'd pay a little more here, but knew I'd get a quality, trustworthy cut.  

Got my 2012 holiday haircut from Steven.  Excellent job, high attention to detail, paid attention to fine points like squaring up the edges of my hairline with a trimmer, and slicking off the final furries with a razor.  Plus a vibrating shoulder massage.  

The final result reminded me of my dad laboring over the flat tops of his four sons, his Oster clippers buzzing, a comb his level, so focused his jaw was clenched and slowly grinding, little beads of sweat glistening on his chin as he sweated the details, making sure the tops were absolutely flat, sides smoothed down, not a single hair standing taller than any other.  

Steven accomplished the same effect, but more like a Zen master.  Calm, knowingly, precise.
