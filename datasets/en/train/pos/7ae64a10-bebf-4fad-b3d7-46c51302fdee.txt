This is such a fun, family-oriented place! Last Thanksgiving my whole family hauled out there for my cousin's wedding. I would definitely put it up there as the best family vacation we ever had. Everyone instantly treats you like family, the home cookin' is real hearty home cooking. There's tons to do from hiking the Bulldogs and riding horses to heading out on Saguaro Lake. If you get to know the staff, they'll likely introduce you to kick ass tequilla and corn bombs. And don't forget the lasso lessons! 

The cabins can be a little cramped, but it's fun camp-out-in-the-desert living. Regardless, I can't wait to go back this Thanksgiving!
