Hanny's makes one of the best martinis in the valley hands down... but it also comes with a rather steep price tag! The atmosphere here is unrivaled by any other spot in downtown Phoenix, so if you're looking for that swanky night out, or want to impress some out-of-towners, this is the perfect spot. The kitchen stays open til 1am every night and the dining area offers ample seating, even after the Suns game ends and swarms of people flood the streets and bars!  

If you live downtown, this spot should be a regular hangout! If you're just visiting, don't leave without stopping by for a cocktail at Hanny's!
