I stopped by for dinner last night assuming I could eat a healthy dinner of fish and veggies but unfortunately all they have here is fish made with butter and sides that are not diet friendly. I settled on the Wildfish salad made with jonah crab, gulf shrimp, tomato, avocado, blue cheese and walnuts. $18 is steep for a salad but I enjoyed every bite. My friend ordered parmesan crusted sole. I took a bite and made a mental note to order it next time I dine at Wildfish. Service was fast and friendly. If you're looking for a nice seafood dinner I highly recommend Wildfish just make sure you're not counting calories!
