The best Urgent Care I've been to. It wasn't busy, I waited no more than 30 minutes tops after filling out my (SUPER EASY) paperwork. The service was quick, I didn't feel rushed, and it felt like the entire staff genuinely cared about making me feel better. I walked in with a 103.8 degree fever and body aches, left with a perfect 98.6 degree temperature and antibiotics to cure my strep throat! The generous doctor even waived my strep throat test fee! Definitely going back there if I have an emergency like this again. :)
