i was really, really, really impressed and surprised at Spinatos pizza. 
we ordered a large sweet pepper and onion at a friends place last night. it was over the top scrumptious. 

plenty of cheese and a generous sprinkling of oregano on top lended an absolutely delicious pie! this one goes under my favorites....perhaps up there with Grimaldi's.
