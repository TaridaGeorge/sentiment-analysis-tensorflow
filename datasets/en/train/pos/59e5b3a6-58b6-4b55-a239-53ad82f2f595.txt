Very good tour with professional and knowledgeable tour guides. Horses were great and my 8 yr. old felt very comfortable. There was also another family with an 11 and 9 yr. Old and they liked it as well. Sonoran desert is very pretty. We went on 10 am tour so it wasn't hot at all. Very happy! You can get $5 off each rider if you book online.
