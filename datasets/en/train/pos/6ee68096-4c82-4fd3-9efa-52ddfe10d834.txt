I've been to Taylor's Cafe on several occasions... both for breakfast and for lunch.  Breakfast is served all day, and there is plenty to choose from.  As Shannon wrote, there is a variety of healthy options including several veggie omelettes and design-your-own as well.  
Servers are consistently friendly and even when the restaurant is crowded, I've never had to wait too long on my food... 
Taylor's is good for groups but it works for solo diners as well... guys may think it is a little bit 'fru-fru' but they will not complain when their food arrives - indoor and outdoor seating available.  My next visit will be one night for dinner - i think they have live music from time-to-time.
