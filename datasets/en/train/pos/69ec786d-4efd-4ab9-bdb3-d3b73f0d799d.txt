Love this place.

Happy hour specials include a Thai sausage that is incredible.  Imagine summer sausage mixed with Thai spice.  

Fish:  I've eaten catfish all over the country, and the catfish here is some of the best I've ever had.  Very light breading, spicy, with a host of vegetables as a compliment.  Love it.

Meat: Lamb and steak surprisingly well prepared and delicious. Short rib is phenomenal.  Minced chicken is also superb.

Dessert:  The coconut ice cream with fried banana's and honey.  Do I have to sell that?  You could slop these things on a plate with no forethought and it would be delicious.  

I find the place is reasonably well-priced, particularly for a spot in PV/Scottsdale.
