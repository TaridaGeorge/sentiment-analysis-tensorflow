I went here last week on the hunt for wedding shoes. This was the last stop on my list. I went in feeling very discouraged as I had been looking all day for shoes. Then i found a pair of ballet flats that were just perfect. Although I do not know the sales mans name he was the BEST! The are in the process of moving locations and he looked and looked in the back until he found the shoes. He was so great! I will for sure be a return costumer!
