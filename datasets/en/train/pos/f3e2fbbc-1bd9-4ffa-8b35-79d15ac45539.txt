Was fully craving Indian, and was fortunate enough to be directed here by a few friends that have recently moved to the States from India.  Can't stress enough how good this place is.  Complex flavors and delicious sauces.  Service was great, portions were solid and price was right on.  And, if you like spicy, you're in luck.  Go for 'Chef Hot'...they don't hold back. 

Definitely part of the regular rotation moving forward...
