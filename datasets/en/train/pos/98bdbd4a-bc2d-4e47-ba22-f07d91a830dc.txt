Wonderful food in this historic, family owned deli. We (the wife and I) love going there for lunch on random Saturday afternoons. There is no other place in Phoenix like it and the menu will show it, most of thier food is from europe and fresher than any AJ's. It's been here for over 60 years and run by the same family. My favorite sandwiches are the Bismark or the Haturo, you cannot go wrong eating here!
