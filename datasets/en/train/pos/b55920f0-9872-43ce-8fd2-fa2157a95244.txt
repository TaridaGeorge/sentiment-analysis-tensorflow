El Encanto will always have a special place in my heart since this is where my husband and I had our wedding back in 2006.  It was our favorite restaurant which also happened to be visually beautiful and so unique.  We love the food, the pollo fundido is the best Ive ever had, the margaritas are outstanding (we had a margarita fountain at the wedding, so fun)  Everything Ive eaten there has been great and the atmosphere is so nice especially if you have opportubity to sit outside.  This was always our go to place for out of town guests as well.
