This is the perfect european neighborhood bakery.  They have different types of bread to take home (the foccacia is fantastic), yummy muffins and the BEST CROISSANTS EVER!!!  Regular or chocolate, they are amazing!  If they happen to have the apple foccacia, get it!  They don't make it often and its fantastic.  Their sandwiches are delicious too.  Simple and fresh.
