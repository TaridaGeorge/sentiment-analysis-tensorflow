I  have never been to a restaurant with better customer service.  The staff at this location are out of this world.  The food is amazing as well.  Everytime we go we have had delicous prime rib and sirloins.  Happy hour is a great time to test it out, but you wouldn't be disappointed for dinner.  We love going during the week on Monday or Tuesday when it isn't very busy.
