Voted BEST in the area for everything! The Raspberry Chipotle Boneless wings are SO Yummie! . The menu is varied-- whtever you are craving , it's there. The portions are more than generous; you won't leave hungry! The kitchen is open late---The staff is very friendly and attractive. We really enjoy the live music at CK's-- especially Chuck E. Baby and the All-Stars--
