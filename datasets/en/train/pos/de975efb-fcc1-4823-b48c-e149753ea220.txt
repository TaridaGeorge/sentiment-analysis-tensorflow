We had our first visit to the Mellow Mushroom today and we LOVED it!! We had the stuffed portabella which was amazing. Followed that with the house special pizza which very quickly disappeared. We cant wait to go back and try some more of the delicious sounding menu. Quite an impressive selection of beer as well! The customer service was great! Our server, Ashlie, was one of the best servers we have had anywhere in a long time! She even made sure our dog (sitting on the other side of the patio gate) had fresh cold water to drink! Above and beyond! Thank you Ashlie!
