Talk about great pizza! I had a Thin Crust delight that was right up the alley of a classic Italian/Mediterranean pizza. The ingredients were fresh and the presentation was tantalizing. 

The decor was perfect for an old school style Italian eatery (i.e. movies playing in the background that starred famous Italian actors). What stood out most about the menu was the classic Italian offerings fused with some South Western delights.
