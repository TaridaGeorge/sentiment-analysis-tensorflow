I have never stayed at the hotel, but I have gone to the spa several times and I LOVE IT!!  

I've been to several spas in AZ and I think this is one of the best, if not the best. The facilities are great and you can truly make a day out of it. Love the changing/waiting area as well as the sauna, women pool and outside patio. The food at the spa restaurant is very good.

I had gotten the massages and the loofah treatment's....You have to try the loofah treatment!!! Your skin comes out softer than a baby's butt, plus is very relaxing. The warm shower and the lotion afterwards, heaven I'm telling you.

To make it even better, the prices are  reasonable, which is a very welcome surprise.
