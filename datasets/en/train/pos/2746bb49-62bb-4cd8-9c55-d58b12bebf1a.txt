I thought I was sooooo clever writing about this place and being all useful but Max A. already beat me to the punch. 

Shop here any time of the day or night for groceries and you will be assaulted with the highest concentration on eye candy in the known Phoenix-Metro area. It's better than the Safeway near ASU. It's completely rad. I've never successfully picked up a lady in a grocery store because, frankly, I don't look very wholesome and that's a place where it seems like you need to be to be successful, but if you're a guy in a suit or work out clothes going to or coming from the LA Fitness up the road you might have a chance. 

It's usually clean and well stocked too, but who really cares, aren't most grocery stores? 

Don't pretend like you don't like staring at hot people...
