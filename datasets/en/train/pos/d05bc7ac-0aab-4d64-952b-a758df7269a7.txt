Saw this place driving through downtown Mesa so we came and checked it out. First of all the interior is nice, minimalist in style. The guy at the counter was very friendly and answered all our questions enthusiastically. And then there was the food! I ordered the roast beef pressed sandwich while my wife ordered the grilled veggie pressed sandwich. Both were excellent, the baguette they use is outstanding, providing crunch without being crazy hard. The roast beef was excellent and paired with the horseradish spread. My wife raved about her sandwich and said she will have a hard time ordering anything else since it was so good. I on the other hand am excited to try the other flavors they have to offer, especially the prosciutto and fig jam sandwich!
