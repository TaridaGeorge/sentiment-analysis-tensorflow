I really like this place. I have tried every Thai place around ASU and Tasty Thai is probably on the top of the list.
I love Thai really hot (hotter than Thai Hot) and they can actually take care of my addiction.
Last week I had the Spicy Noodle and it was probably the best noodle dish I have ever had. They had fresh crispy green beens and mushrooms in it which gave it fantastic flavor.

I highly recommend this place, not to mention it is very nice in side, and the people running it are very helpful!
