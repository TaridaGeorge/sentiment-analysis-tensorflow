This is my new favorite Indian restaurant.  Anywhere.  I had the lunch buffet, which was delicious, and after that I have mostly ordered Palak Paneer with naan and rice.  Their's is fantastic!  So delicious!

I love this place because it tastes so good, and because it is close to home, but the reason this place stands out among its peers is the service.  This place has really, really good service by any standard.  Waters get refilled promptly, waiters are helpful.  Orders are accurate and the staff is really friendly.  

Yay!
