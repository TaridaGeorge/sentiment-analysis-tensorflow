My second time going to this restaurant. Was in the need for a good burger and received a great burger. They recently added a new corn salad to the menu which was juicy. Finished of the meal with their white chocolate cheesecake. Unlike most cheesecakes, theirs is light and fluffy. 

I also think that the service is great. Very attentive and they allow their personalities shine. I like when the staff believes in the restaurant and e food that they serve.
