I can dissertate on less than good allergy treatments, sinus surgeons and their styles, quack cures for peculiar diagnoses, and the misery of it all when it goes bad.  

I worked very hard to find Dr. Schroeder's Office.  It's been an excellent experience.  Consistenly on the list of Phoenix' Best Physicians.  Publishes in Elsevier medical publications, spent a lot of time with me as we got established in my treatment regime.  When people have allergies, I tell them to head here.    Sometimes I meet people I already knew coming in for their allergy shots.  Since a requirement is waiting 20 minutes to check for bad reactions, I get in some nice conversations.  They also have pretty good magazines.
