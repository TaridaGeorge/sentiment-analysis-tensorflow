Worth every penny... 
Kashman's is the most reliable deli I've found for great breakfast, brunch, and/or lunch in North Scottsdale.  It's fast casual - you go up to the front and order and then they give you a number and they bring you your food.  The menu is huge and there is something for everyone!  On beautiful days, you can sit outside at either location.  Staff are accomodating and friendly.  

My favorite menu items are their greek omelette, atkins plate (if I feel like watching the carbs), yogurt and granola, tuna melt, egg salad sandwich, and the chopped farmers salad (with which I usually add turkey and/or avocado).  The bagels are delicious and so is the coffee.  They also have several flavors of iced tea to choose from.

Whenever friends or family are in town, Kashman's is a must...
