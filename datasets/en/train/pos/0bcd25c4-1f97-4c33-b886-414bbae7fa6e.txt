It is very simple. What do you want Sunday morning? A nice breakfast. The great part is that you don't have to wake up early. On the weekends, the breakfast is served up to 1pm. I'm sure the lunch is good. It all the same fresh local and organic ingredients. But I come here for the green flannel. It is the best corned beef hash(topped with jalapenos) in town. It is the perfect blend of hot, salty, spicy and savory. Which goes with a nice crafted breakfast beer. If that's not your thing. Then a breakfast cocktail, like a tequila sunrise, will hit the spot.
