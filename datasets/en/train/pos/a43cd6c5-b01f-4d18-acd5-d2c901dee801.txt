I love this place, we actually went twice this weekend!  

They have some veggie options on the menu which is nice, and they are happy to change anything around to make it vegetarian if you'd like.  The service is friendly and the prices are great.  

The meat eaters at my table said that the meats were fantastic and we all left very happy!
