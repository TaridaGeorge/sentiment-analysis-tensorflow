A brand new place we discovered.  The decor seemed industrial chic, yet warm and comfortable.  We ordered a few different pizzas and shared.  I couldn't pick a favorite they were all so good!

But the very best part was the beer.  I tried a few samples before choosing their pale ale with dinner and their brown for desert, some of the best local beer I've ever had!
