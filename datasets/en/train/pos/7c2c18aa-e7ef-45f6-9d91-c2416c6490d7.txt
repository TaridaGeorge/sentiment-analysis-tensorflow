I went to DE, at my friend's urging, after being sick for over a week.  I am not a fan of doctor visits so was pleasantly surprised by the pleasant surroundings and personnel.  Although I was miserable, the visit was short and the staff really worked to make sure I was comfortable.  I have since been back to consult with them about a refill of antibiotics and they were very helpful and accommodating.  The facilities are clean and pleasant, without the usual crowded conditions, the care is professionally delivered, and location is convenient.  I highly recommend Doctors Express to anyone needing immediate medical care,
