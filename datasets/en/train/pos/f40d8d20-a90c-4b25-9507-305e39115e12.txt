Coming from the east coast, I am a bit snotty when it comes to sushi. Every place I tried in Arizona didn't even mildly live up to my standards. Then I found Sakana's. They have the freshest fish in town, decent prices, and really good service. They even have the grills to do it up Japanese steak house style.

Try the mahi mahi tempura roll, it's my favorite. The baked scallops roll is phenomenal too. I definitely suggest sitting at the sushi bar the first time there, the cooks are really entertaining and a lot of fun. 

Also, if you're a big beer fan, this place has asahi black, which I normally can't find at many restaurants.
