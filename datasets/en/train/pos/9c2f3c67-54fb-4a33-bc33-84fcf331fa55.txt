The atmosphere here is so warm and inviting.  Both the inside and the patio are large and open.  This place is always buzzing, and usually has a wait, but is always worth it.  My favorite salad from here is the brussel sprout salad, which initially sounds like a turn-off.  However, at the time I was not even sure if I liked brussel sprouts. Turns out, this is one of my all-time fav-salads and is a go-to item for lonely take-out nights!
