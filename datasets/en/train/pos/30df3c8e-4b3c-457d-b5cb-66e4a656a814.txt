This is our go to chinese place. I have never dined in, but always carry out. They may deliver but I am not sure as I've never asked. The food is like chinese back east. They have great wonton soup, the best eggrolls I've found in Arizona and very friendly service. Call ahead and your food is ready for pickup within 15 minutes, and always steaming hot. My only complaint is that the only spicy mustard they have comes in packets and isn't that good. If they could get real spicy mustard the egg rolls would be even better. Also, get the pot stickers or crab rangoons. Amazing!
