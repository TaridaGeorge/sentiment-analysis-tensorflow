The Fish Market has been here awhile, and it is still going strong.

For the price this is one of the finest seafood restaurants in the city. I adore their clam chowder (white), and just about everything else on the menu. That have a fantastic fish selection with several fresh catches to choose from. The scallops are wonderful, and the shrimp is sooooo fresh.

The staff is super friendly. The manager let my daughters pet the lobsters (in fact, he invited them to do so).

Two thumbs up!
