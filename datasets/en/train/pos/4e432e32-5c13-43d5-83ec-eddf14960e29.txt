China China is the best chinese food in the valley and basically anywhere as far as I'm concerned. It is fresh, inexpensive, delicious, and the service is always friendly and fun. They always remember us when we come in. The flaming volcano bowl is a must try. My favorite dishes are the Kung Pao (shrimp, scallops, beef, chicken... anything really), the crispy garlic shrimp, and the house pan fried noodles. I can't say enough good things about China China.
