mmm... Cibo. 

Historic house turned best pizza... EVER. Charming and lovely, Cibo is a great first date place, appropriate for business mingling, and even the kind of place you'd want to take your mom to. 

You're paying for quality here, so go big or go home. My average ticket is about $30 per person - including wine and yes, it's totally worth it.

The space is quaint, so if you've got a large party, make reservations and if you're not sure what to order, ask your server, they're excellent!
