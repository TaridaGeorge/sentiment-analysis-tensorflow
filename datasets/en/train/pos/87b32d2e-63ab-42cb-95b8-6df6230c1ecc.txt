I was looking for a repair shop close to my house and found Mike P's review and thought it was worth a shot. I have had my '96 Chevy truck there twice for two different situations and now my Subaru STI. They handled both repairs quickly and got me the best price they could with no pressure to repair additional items. Their shop is nothing fancy but they know their business. Great people to work with. Highly recommended.
