Came here for a work event my husbands company was having. There were about 20-25 people and we had our own room with pool tables and dart boards (bring your own darts cuz they only have 1 set). 

The food was all preordered so we had a lot of different things, which were all very tasty. The waitress was always walking through getting drink refills and was very helpful giving suggestions once she told me they don't carry blue moon. 

They had a guy singing for part of the night, he was ok, but kept to the same type of slow songs so it got a  little boring after a while. 

The decor was very cool and the atmosphere was great. 

We will definitely be going back here.
