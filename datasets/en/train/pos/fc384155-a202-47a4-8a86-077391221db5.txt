A great bunch of guys willing to answer any and all questions you have about your bike. I typically only ride my bike to/from work. My bike is simply a Towny. My questions were basic, yet they made me feel valid. I got a sandwich while I was there. Excellent. Not sure where they got their bread, but it was delicious. Fresh meat and a potato salad recipe like none other I have had.  You can't find a meal deal like this under 10.00 in many sandwich shops in town.
