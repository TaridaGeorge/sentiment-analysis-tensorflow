I love Sun Up.  If I had my druthers, I would eat here every week.  I think they have excellent beer.  All of their cask conditioned ales are awesome.  The food is above average bar food and everything seems to have a little zip (spice) to it, which I like.  My favorite item by far is the wings.  I have always found the staff to be friendly.  The environment is relaxing and quiet enough to easily carry a conversation.  

If you like good beer, try Sun Up - you won't be disappointed.
