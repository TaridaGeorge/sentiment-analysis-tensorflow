I have been wanting to try this place for years and I'm sorry I hadn't sooner!  The 3 of us split the atipasto salad, which was amazing, along with a L'Italiana pizza.  The pizza was marinated spinach, cheese, and roasted red pepper in a great red sauce.  We added jalepenos.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit!
