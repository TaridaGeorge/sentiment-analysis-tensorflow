So, according to Martin's brochure, he does everything and anything having to do with your yard.  

Cleanups, sprinklers, monthly services, landscape design, etc etc

I called Martin after finding his brochure on my door knob.  That's how I choose my landscaper.

My yard was like a jungle.  Overgrown grass, weeds, trees, blah! (I've been out of the country a lot the past few months)

Martin and a team of workers came over to my place, and for $100 bucks they took care of EVERYTHING.  And I mean, EVERYTHING!  They even netted my pool clean!  And they emptied a small trash can I forgot about!  

So after being thoroughly satisfied with the work, I hired Martin to come out on a bi-monthly basis for $70 per month.  

A steal, all things considered, because my yard is big and a painnnnn

Hooray!
