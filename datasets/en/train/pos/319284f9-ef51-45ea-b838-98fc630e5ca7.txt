I've been going to Four Peaks on a regular basis for about a year now.   One of my favorite places in Scottsdale.   Great prices, great food, great service, great atmosphere.    I've never been disappointed.   As far as recommendations go, 90% of the time i'll order the Quesadilla's with Blackened Chicken.   It's easily the best Quesadilla i've ever had.   I'm also a fan of the Salmon BLT, Oven Roasted Turkey Sandwich, and on the rare occasion i'll order the Chicken Strips which are fantastic.  The Fries, sent straight from heaven.   And about a month ago I went with a few people and we had a Margarita Pizza....and Wow, was i surprised.  It was fantastic.   I would highly recommend this place to anybody.
