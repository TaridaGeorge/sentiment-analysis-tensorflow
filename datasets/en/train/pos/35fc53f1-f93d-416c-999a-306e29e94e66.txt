First, it is not fair to go by the first review.  New owners took over within the last year and they are fantastic.  David greats you and makes you feel so welcome and offers you something to drink.  Andy is an absolute perfectionist and artist.  The feel is comfortable, bright and clean.  I have been getting my nails done for over 20 years and have only become a regular at 3 salons.  This one tops my list!  GO!  You won't regret it.
