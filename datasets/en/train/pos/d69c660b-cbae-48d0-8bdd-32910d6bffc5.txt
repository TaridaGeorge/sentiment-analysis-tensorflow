Any restaurant with a mechanical bull automatically gets 5 stars from me! Not to mention, as a lover of ahi, seeing 4 ahi items on the menu sent tingles through my soul. I decided on the ahi salad and couldn't be more pleased with my decision. It was probably the most flavorful ahi salad I've ever had.
In addition, the drinks were relatively strong. I ordered the sweet tea vodka with lemonade, and the waitress sugeested adding peach shnapps which I must say was a splendid idea.
The decor is awesome. Reminds me of Texas. There is something hung on every square foot of the walls, and there are cute slash funny little cowboy quotes burned on wooden signs.
The service was good, food was delicious, and atmosphere was festive. I highly recommend.
