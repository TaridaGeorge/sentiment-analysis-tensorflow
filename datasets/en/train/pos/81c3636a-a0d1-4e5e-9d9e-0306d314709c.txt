Excellent , very upscale jewelry boutique.  They will custom make anything and did a wonderful job on my wedding ring.  They were very patient through the process and I was impressed.  

They are only open 9-5 M-F so you really have to live a life of leisure or something to shop here.  They just happen to be across the street from my office so I could go at lunch.

Just as a hint of the customer base, Muhammad Ali is a regular and I saw him once while getting sizing done.
