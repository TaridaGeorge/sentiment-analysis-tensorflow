Just ate here for the first time on Saturday and totally loved it. Some friends had been recommending it to us, and we had seen it driving by, but it wasn't until Saturday that we actually got out there. I was totally impressed by the atmosphere (we sat outside because the weather was nice and the scenery beautiful, but there is inside seating also). I had the bacon burger and it was delicious -- can't wait to go back!
