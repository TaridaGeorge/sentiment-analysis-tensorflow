Just did a summer staycation there. Everything about this place is wonderful. Outstanding customer service 100% of the time -- wonderfully accommodating staff everywhere. The steady stream of free goodies poolside is delightful (Otter Pops! Vanilla Iced Coffee Shooters! Cucumbers to eat, or for your eyes! Evian Facial Mist! Fresh pineapple!). Just little touches everywhere that you don't find anywhere else. Great place for adults, as there aren't too many kids running around. Even the cheapest rooms are beautiful, with nice views. You'll pay for the privilege, but you'll struggle to find a better experience.
