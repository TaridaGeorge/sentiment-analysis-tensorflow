BEST Patio in Oldtown!

This swanky place has great food, drinks and atmosphere. YES, I did say great food... not always the case with Pubs, I found their food surprisingly fantastic.

In addition to those greats, with it's prime location in Oldtown, Kelly's has managed to create it's own style and atmosphere that I believe sets it apart from the typical Scottsdale scene. I have been here for a night of fun with friends (awesome HH) and taken my dad for dinner. All ages and styles welcome- this place is GREAT!
