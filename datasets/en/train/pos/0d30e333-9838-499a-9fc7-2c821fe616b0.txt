I received a cup of beer when I got there for happy hour - pleasant surprise! My lavender scrub/massage was wonderful. The scent of lavender is very relaxing. The scrub was followed by a quick rinse in the shower, then back into the room for the massage. Then I had the steam room to look forward to. This spa is always a fun experience! They should call it "Hawaiian GREAT Experience Spa"  ;-)
