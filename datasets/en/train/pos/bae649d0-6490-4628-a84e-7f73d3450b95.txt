Don't really have anything original to say here, just another big win thanks to Yelp! The roasted corn pizza was indeed the best part of the night. GET IT. Avocado pizza with lemon zest was also good, but we'll probably switch that one up next time. Split a pitcher of white sangria between three of us, definitely yummy. Not very strong but great flavor. We were way too full to try the gelato but plan on that next time!  We had a lot of fun walking through the grocery beforehand as well, lots of unique and fun things, as well as AMAZING smells. Oh, that homemade pizza crust...yum.
