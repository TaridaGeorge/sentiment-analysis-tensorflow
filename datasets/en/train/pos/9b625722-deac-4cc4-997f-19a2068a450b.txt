Finally a raw food cafe that isn't in Tempe.  Love their drinks and raw food menu.  Just wish their prices would come down bit.    

This is the type of place I could eat at everyday.  I know it is good because the afternoon lull doesn't happen to me when I eat here.    

I do NOT go daily, due to pricing, but I would like too, because I would simply live longer eating here.  Your body buzzes with clean energy (non-caffeine) after eating here.  

If you are a person who wants to be nice to your body.  Splurge and give your body what it craves....Enzymes.    

Who knew raw food was the answer to avoiding afternoon coffee.......?
