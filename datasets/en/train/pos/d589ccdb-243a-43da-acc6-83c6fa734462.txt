This is the best pizza I've ever had. Just had it for the first time and can't stop eating it. This is what my friend brought home:

L'Italiana................................................... 7.50 | 12.25 | 17.50 | 22.00

Fresh baby spinach carefully marinated in Mamma Spinato's 'Secret Seasonings', then baked with fire roasted red peppers and a blend of feta and mozzarella cheese! Our award winner!

This pizza is phenomenal. He added meatball and ricotta. I can't wait to order from here again!
