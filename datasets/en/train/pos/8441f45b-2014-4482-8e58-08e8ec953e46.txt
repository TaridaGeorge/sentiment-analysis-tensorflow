Simply fantastic. Not a huge menu, but it is quite diverse with both raw fish and traditional Italian cuisine. 

You can order each item as an entree or combine several (3 for $30, 4 for $40...yes, you get the idea). My date and I ordered three each, and the chef prepared them one at a time, allowing us to enjoy each dish. It really gave us an opportunity to eat at casual pace without the tastes of each dish interfering with one another. 

The veal and the risotto were phenomenal!

Not a big desert connoisseur, but if available, try the cake soaked in olive oil.  Great ending to a great meal.
