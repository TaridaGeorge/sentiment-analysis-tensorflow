Holy hell this place has stolen my soul many a time. Something about the irresistible $3.50 specials and four peaks hefe on draft just instantly ruins the subsequent morning. I love the patio, very cool surroundings-aside from the occasional meat-head hitting on me or the girls wearing short shorts just to show off their new super cool thigh tattoos. I've never had a problem finding a table...maybe I get there too early (good sign or bad sign?) and have always had fantastic experiences with the servers. The servers always seem very down-to-earth and amused at our antics so that's a plus. When one drunk guy made a shitfit and threw a plate at my friend's skull, the server was awesome enough to join in on yelling at him. 
Note: Do not throw fire in each others mouths, the owner does not like that. Who would have known?
