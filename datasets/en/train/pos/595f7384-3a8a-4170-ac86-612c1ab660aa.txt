Came home from a long trip to find my pool looking like a swamp.  Even though I'd wanted to take care of the pool by myself, I knew I needed help on this one.  Was pretty weary of dealing with a pool guy due to a previous experience, but Enterprise was a breath of fresh air.  Phone calls answered and returned promptly, appointments shown up to in a timely fashion, and a friendly demeanor - the little things that add up.  Also, as the other reviewers have mentioned, Mike knows his stuff, explains it clearly, and doesn't give you that vague sense of "Am I being ripped off here?" that I get with many house service guys. Overall great experience, and I will be using this service again for my future pool needs.
