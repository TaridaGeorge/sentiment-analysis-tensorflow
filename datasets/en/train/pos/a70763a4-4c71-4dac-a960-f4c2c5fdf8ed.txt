Worth every penny. Best steak I've ever had. I had the Kona sirloin and my boyfriend had the fillet and we were both in heaven. Steaks were perfectly cooked and seasoned. They melted in our mouths. Be prepared to spend about $40/steak. We shared the mashed potatoes and they were so creamy. The Caesar salads were ok. The wine list was a little overwhelming (well for us) but our waiter made some great suggestions. For dessert I had the flour-less chocolate cake, which was rich and my boyfriend had strawberries and ice cream (forget what it's called the Capital Grille or something like that) which was so good.
