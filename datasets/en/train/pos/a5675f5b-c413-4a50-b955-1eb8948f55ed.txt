This place is awesome..we happened to spot it driving around and decided to stop in..we were def like two kids in a candy store. Easily got over two pounds of just crap and spent about 20 bucks. this place has anything you could think of, things you forgot about over the years and things you didnt even know existed. If you take your young ones in here, be prepared for them to go absolutely nutso! this place is better than Halloween..you can fill your bag with all your favorite sugar and pay for your own cavities! def a must stop if you ever pass by this place. So fun!
