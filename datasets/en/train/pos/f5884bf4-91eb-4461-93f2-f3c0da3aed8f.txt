I think Elite Nails is wonderful.  It is spotlessly clean and they will accomodate you for anything you want.
They have awesome pedicures, the high end one is about an hour
and a half.  They are fast, polite, and everyone speaks English.
It is best to make an appointment because they can get pretty booked
up.
Try them, you will be happy you did.
