Love, love, LOVE Cibo!! I think it is the best in the Valley....(sorry, Pizzeria Bianco.)  It has a great, intimate and romantic atmosphere.  It is located inside a cozy old home in Dowtown PHX with a great patio equipped with twinkling lights....can you say "first date spot??"  I can't wait to go back. The pizza was superb and the salad was delish.  Everything sounded great....I had a really hard time choosing.
