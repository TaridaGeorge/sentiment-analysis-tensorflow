The first time we ate here; we waited over four hours. One might think that is nuts but we had a few bottles of wine and bonded with the other waitees. The food was fabulous. Fresh, Fresh, fresh! Love the pizza with the arugula.  Everything about it is right on.

Our second time through we went late afternoon and enjoyed it all over again. I am so proud this place is in our city. It inspired us to try the other Bianco eateries, stay tuned for those reviews.
