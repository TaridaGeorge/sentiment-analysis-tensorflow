chaparral dog park is the best. currently under some construction but still awesome. the grass is green and lush they have 3 parks. and water and trash cans and shade, and benches. and they rotate out the usuage of the parks so the grass can grow back. 
Havent seen any bad fights here and no stupid screaming kids. Its al adout chill adults and their awesome dogs just chillin after work
