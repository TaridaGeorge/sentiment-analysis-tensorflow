I am an event planner and finding the perfect venue is so challenging, but The Legacy Ballroom is just what the Valley has needed for years!   The space is filled with natural light and is elegantly designed inside and out.   I love the travertine courtyards with the great views of the Phoenix Mountain Preserve.   I also love the gorgeous silk drapes, crystal chandeliers and Waterworks style bathrooms in the ballroom.  It feels like a resort, but their prices are reasonable.  Can't wait to host my first event here!
