Spent 6 months trying to find a new salon to go to since moving to Goodyear. After reading the reviews, I tried Vega Salon. I am so glad that I did. I didn't have an appointment, but they fit me in for a cut and color. Carmen was awesome and so was Joe. They helped me pick out the perfect color for me and the haircut that Carmen gave me was perfect. Everyone was very friendly and professional. I will definitely be back.
