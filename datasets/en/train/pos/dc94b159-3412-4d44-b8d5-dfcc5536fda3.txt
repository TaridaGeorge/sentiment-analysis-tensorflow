A great place to celebrate and laugh...the patio is gorgeous with open fire places and lots of beautiful trees. The food by Chef Kelly is, well, to die for. For a certain chicken dish I might commit murder. It's called the Ballantine Chicken. Imagine if you could make chicken into an orgasmic experience. A crispy skin that oozes juices as it is pierced with your knife. The stuffing made with brioche and all presented on a puree of fresh butternut squash. OMG! The raspberry iced tea is delightful, as is their wine selection. Sometimes it's nice to find a place in the middle of the city that makes you feel as if you are on vacation. The historic houses that make up the indoor seating are adorably rustic with modern twists. Take someone you love here...
