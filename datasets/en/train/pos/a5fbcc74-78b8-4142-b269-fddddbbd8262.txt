Great place! Stayed here on a whim of flying to
Phoenix ('coz the weather's good, compared to foggy
San Francisco) in the middle of moving into a new
house.

We were pleasantly surprised of the pool staying open
quite late. Also, they made killer mudslides poolside.


Rooms were spacious and neutral, yet not boring. 

I'll definitely stay there again. Two thumbs way up!
