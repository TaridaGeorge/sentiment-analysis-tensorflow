I love this place. I've been here about 4 times in the past 2 months and have yet to be disappointed. Yes, the strip mall is not pretty but the restaurant is clean, well-decorated, and always nice and cool in the summer. 

The food is what it's all about though. I'm addicted to the hot and spicy noodles with beef, would marry them if it were legal. I'm also a big fan of the soups, especially lemon grass. My boyfriend, who is picky about wonton soup, love theirs.
