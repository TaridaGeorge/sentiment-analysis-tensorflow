This is one of my and my husband's favorite restaurants in town. Every time we take someone there, they love it, too! And every time we try something new, it's better than the last thing. I typically get the Pad Thai, and my husband's fave is the Phad-See-Ew. I'm also a big fan of both the red and the green curry. You really can't go wrong here. 
They expanded maybe a year ago, so it's been updated a little, but the place is still small and doesn't look like much from the street (or the strip mall it's' in). Still, the service is always good and fast, and it's BYOB. Don't miss this hidden gem! 
PS. I like spicy, but a 2 ther (on a scale of 1-5) is still pretty hot.
