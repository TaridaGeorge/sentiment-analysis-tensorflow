I don't live in Phoenix anymore, but man-oh-man do I miss Lalibela. I've spent four years trying to find comparable Ethiopian food in the San Francisco Bay Area, and I just can't. Who would have thought that Phoenix has better Ethiopian food than San Francisco?

I always order the shorba (soup) and misir wat (spicy lentils.) The other vegetarian dishes are good too, but the misir wat really stands out. Also, for some reason, the iced tea here is unsually good ... maybe there's something special about it. 

I'm coming back to Phoenix for a visit this summer, and Lalibela will definitely be one of my first stops. It deserves all five stars for sure!
