I have never been impressed with Peruvian food, but this place was excellent.  Wonderful and genuinely friendly service.  I had the white fish ceviche.  Sometimes ceviche can be heavy on the garnish, and light on the fish.  Not so here: plenty of fish, and even a little spicy, which I love.  I wish there had been some more of the yam.  The dish also came with these huge corn kernels.  My dining partner's dish with beef was also quite tasty - the beef was well marinated and so tender.  We liked the purple corn drink too - a little like jamaica with cloves.  Not too sweet, either.  We will definitely be back!
