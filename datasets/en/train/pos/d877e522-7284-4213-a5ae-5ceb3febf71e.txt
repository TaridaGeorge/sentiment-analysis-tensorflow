While visiting the Phoenix area, we checked out their 'Chinatown'. Small as it is, I was surprise to find a 99 Ranch Mkt. Coming from the Bay Area I wasn't at awe with the store; its typical like all other 99 Ranch I've shopped at.

It received a 5 star because of its location in the Chinese Cultural Center plaza which is cool to explore.
