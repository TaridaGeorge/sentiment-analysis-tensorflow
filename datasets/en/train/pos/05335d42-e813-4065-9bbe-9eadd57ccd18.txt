How can you not love Target!!  Great location right on 44th street and Thomas.          Great Pharmacy, and now they of course carry food..... Seems as if all the Targets are starting to carry food.  They have really good fruit and vegtables....so it is almost like one stop shopping.  The stafff at the Pharamcy is really good always happy and always helpful. There is so much you can get here. Lots of parking in the lot.  They have really great hours as well.
