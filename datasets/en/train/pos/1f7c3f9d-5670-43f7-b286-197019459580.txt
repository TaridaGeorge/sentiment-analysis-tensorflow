This is the perfect spot to stop for a quick dog. They have standard and exotic varieties, make their own buns onsite, offer lots of side options, and have a fully loaded condiment bar. I tried "The Phoenix" a bacon-wrapped dog loaded with fixings including Jalape√±os. Next time I will get a plain grilled dog and go crazy with onions and peppers at the dog bar.
