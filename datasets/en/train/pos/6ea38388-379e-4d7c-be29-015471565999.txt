Food was fabulous.  Service was outstanding.  The fried calamari was really good...not outstanding but really yummy.  The heirloom salad was delicious but tiny (as expected).  The salmon and pork entrees were fabulous.  The meal was completed with a complimentary chocolate ganache that was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal.  The outside door where the wait staff entered and exited did provide a really chilly breeze that was slightly irritating but it was an unusually cold night.  Besides that issue the atmosphere was wonderful and romantic.
