Wow! The remodel looks amazing! I feel like I'm in Disneyland!

This place is huge and there is a large separate space for their Pink line with pretty much everything you can find online in this store, win! The decorations and lighting are beautiful! The staff is all really friendly and helpful. All of the employees I spoke to about the renovations were equally as excited about it as I am. Oh and the the dressing rooms are so pretty! I just want to spend all my time here rolling around in all the goodies they have to offer. 

Just as a note, there are fun chairs for all you dudes to sit in and wait for your girlfriends to finishing shopping (or you just might sit there and watch me with a huge grin on my face frolicking through the store).
