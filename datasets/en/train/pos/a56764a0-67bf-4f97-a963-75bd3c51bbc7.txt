Hot Yoga Ahwatukee is amazing!  The wife and I totally enjoyed our hot yoga sessions!  We felt renewed after each one!  The instructors are great and willing to help you with your individual needs and motivation.  The heat is like nothing else.

Make sure you drink plenty of water before, during and after!  Bring a towel for your mat, a headband/bandanna and a hand towel.  Trust me you will need them all!

We can't tell you how wonderful it is, you have to experience it yourself. Hot Yoga Ahwatukee gave our yoga practice an added change to motivate ourselves.
