Excellent pizza.  I had it twice in two weeks in fact  :)

Friendly staff, quick food and the pizza was very delicious. 

 My second pizza was a Pepperoni and Ricotta and  the Ricotta was put on a little thick for my taste, but overall was still very, very good. I also ask for it to be a little crispy as well, which I liked more.
