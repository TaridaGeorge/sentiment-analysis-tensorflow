I've never stayed in Arizona before.My boyfriend and I took his family there for dinner.It was so awsome.Everything was good.They served us "All you can eat" and we have big eaters in our family.The ham was great,the ribs to die for.All the food was good.The service was amazing.Friendly servers.I could go on and on.And they have  a gift shop!! OMG-I got the cutest earrings and all kinds of stuff for my family to bring back!! Never had cactus fruit jelly.They let you take it home,I love it!! Thank you mining camp for our great dinner.We'll be back.
