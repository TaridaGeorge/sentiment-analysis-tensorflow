If you like interesting and innovative soups, salads, sandwiches this is the place. Fresh and healthy choices with daily and seasonal specials. The handcrafted artisan bread to-go is fantastic - 9 grain was my choice today. Staff was friendly and service was quick.  A welcome change to traditional drab & predictable sandwich shops.
