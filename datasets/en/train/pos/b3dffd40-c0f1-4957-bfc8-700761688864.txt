Amazing shop! Best experience I have ever had at a piercing or tattoo shop. My piercer was Kevin and I get really nervous around needles, but he put me at ease and involved my friends who had come in with me in conversation and let them all come back with me. 

I got my tragus pierced five months ago here and it has healed wonderfully thanks to Kevin's instructions. I live in Southern California, but if I ever want another piercing I will try coming back here first. Kevin was also able to recommend a shop in my local area they trust for a jewelry change as well.
