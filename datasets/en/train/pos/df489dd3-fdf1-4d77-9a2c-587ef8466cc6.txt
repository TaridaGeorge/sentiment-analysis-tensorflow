This place gets five stars for several reasons.  First and foremost, it get's a great review for the large portions, fresh ingredients and incredible taste!  Hole in the wall type restaurants usually scare me because the quality and cleanliness is questionable, but after several visits to this place I am wary no longer.  Time and time again the food has delivered on all levels, not to mention the price.  The man, who I assume is the owner because he's always there, is very kind and provides excellent service.  He often stays open later to accommodate customers.  If I had one complaint it would be that it's not open later because I crave it at all hours of the day!
