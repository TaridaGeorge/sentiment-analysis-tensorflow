I absolutely love Panda Garden.  This is my favorite Chinese-Inspired restaurant in the valley, the pricy sit-down, dress-up places in Scottsdale and Downtown phoenix notwithstanding.  Every dish I've tried has been delicious, and the service is very fast (normally under 5 minutes for a table of two) and extremely friendly.  If you find yourself fiending for a Chinese fix, and are in the Ahwatukee area, you must stop by Panda Garden!
