Love love LOVEE Spinato's. Their red sauce is to die for, perfectly sweet and tangy! 

Calzones are fabulous as well, especially the spinach, garlic & tomato one. Wards off hoardes of vampires, I'm sure. Warning - these don't reheat well. Plan on eating it all fresh.

Normally multi-meat pizzas make me want to ralph from greasiness, but their "Get Meaty" is really good, the sausage (I think?!) has a nice smokey flavor that goes well with the sweet sauce.

I go to the location in Tempe, but I believe they make their food in one place, so you shouldn't get much of a difference as far as quality goes.
