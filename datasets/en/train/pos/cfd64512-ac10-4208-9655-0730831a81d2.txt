Captain Ted and his rental business is the best in town. He's extremely knowledgeable and very helpful. His rates are fair. To keep his inventory fresh, he frequently sells his boats and equipment at a good price.  He can modify the seats or practically anything else on the boat to meet your individual needs. for example, I wanted a more comfortable (read padded) seat for my Swifty kayak. 

I paddle with the Southwest Outdoor Club down the Salt River about six to ten times a year. I recommend Ted and his rentals to all my friends.
