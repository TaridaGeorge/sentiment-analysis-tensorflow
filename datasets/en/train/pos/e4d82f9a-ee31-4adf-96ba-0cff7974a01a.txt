YUM! YUM! YUM!

I went here the other night with a friend of mine who suggested it.  We did wait for about 25 minutes for a table but it was WELL worth the wait.

We started with edamame which was pretty good... then we had some sushi and it was incredible.  I had the Rainbow Roll and it was TO DIE FOR!!!

For dessert we had these crunchy apple tempura bites with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream... HOLY SMOKES!

Service was amazing and I will DEF be back for more!
