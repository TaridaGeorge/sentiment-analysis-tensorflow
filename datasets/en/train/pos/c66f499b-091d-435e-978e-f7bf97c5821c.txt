I had an awesome experience at Tom's Tavern on Sunday. I live nearby and decided to visit for the first time with my girlfriend. We had the brunch buffet that had some good breakfast foods along with some munchies to enjoy during the games. Although we weren't drinking, the bar has happy hour prices which I'm sure many others enjoyed. 

During the game, a pair of Arizona Cardinal cheerleaders came in and started fraternizing with fans which was an awesome addition to the experience. I will definitely be returning.
