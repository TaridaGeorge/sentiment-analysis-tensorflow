I have been shopping at New Tokyo a few time a year for about 12 years now.  Growing up my family hosted Japanese students and when i was in high school I spent a summer in Japan.

New Tokyo reminds of the little mom and pop markets located in the neighborhood I stayed in while in Japan.  It's not a huge store but it's got what you will need.  Rice, Yakisoba, Tofu, bean past, frozen fish, Eal, Udon Noodles, masago, lots of snacks, and instant noodles.   They have just about every thing you would need to fix a traditional Japanese meal and much more.

The people here are always very friendly and helpful.  Don't hesitate to venture in and ask for help if your not sure what you are looking for.
