I always seem to order the same thing...pesto pizza with chicken please!  The chicken here is so delish!  I don't know what they marinate it with, but it is very very good!.    I am constantly looking at other peoples orders because everyhting looks so good!  The hummus trio is great too!  I just wish the tables were spaced a little farther apart.  I always feel like I am imposing on my neighbors conversation :)
