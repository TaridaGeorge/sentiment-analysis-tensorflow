Tyson is one of the most creative photographers I have seen in a long time. I was introduced to Tyson's work long before I knew Tyson. Tyson has a great eye for seeing past every day life and really delving in deeper. 

Tyson has several art series he has produced centering around various cities within Arizona. Each of his pieces would look fabulous hanging in a living room. His pieces will spark conversation between your guests. 

Tyson has worked several events I have attended and his images really tend to capture the true feelings of the event. 

In addition, Tyson has worked with my family for senior portraits for our son. I get compliments every time I show his portraits. 

Tyson is a true professional and I would highly recommend him for any photography job you have for him!
