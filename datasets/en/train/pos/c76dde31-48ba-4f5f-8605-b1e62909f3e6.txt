Come here for the sweet treats!! Forget everything else.The frozen custard here is a-mazing!! It's so decadent that you can easily make a meal of it. 

My favorite so far has been a concrete mixer with Reese's PB cups and Marshmallow sauce or wait maybe it was the two scoop sundae with Andes mints and hot fudge? So creamy and delicious that I don't even care I'm lactose intolerant. So worth it....If you join there email list they send several great buy one get one free coupons for sundaes and mixers.
