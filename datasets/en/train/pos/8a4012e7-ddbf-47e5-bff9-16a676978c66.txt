OK, UUUUMMMMM Hello? I laugh when people think Sprinkles is good-yuk. I love Fairy Tale Brownies and other bakeries around town. However, then--- hello----- I died and went to heaven at Yelp Pleydate. These cupcakes are so crazy delicious! The best ones I have ever had! They do not have a store, sorry guys. They say they do catering only. I want to find their costumer list and stalk a wedding or something, like right out of Seinfeld or Friends.  "Yeah sure. Of course I know the bride. We went to Kindergarten together. Now leave me alone I am eating the cupcakes."  My advice to them, please open up a store and do it now! The White Russian one was the best but Shhhhhhhhh! I tried a lot of them that night and they were all fantastic!
