Nobou is incredible, awesome simple, yet extremely flavorful Japanese food.  Served in tapas style so you can try everything... which is highly suggested.  Everything from the shishito peppers to the pork belly are delicious, Nobou is also is master with a knife so try the different shashimi dishes.  If you haven't tried or heard of Chef Nobou's food.... do it!  Also they have a great selection of imported Japanese beers and sake!
