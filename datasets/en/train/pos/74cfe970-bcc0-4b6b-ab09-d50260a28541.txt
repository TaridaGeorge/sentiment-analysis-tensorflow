I found this company through the BBB site.  Looking for someone with a good setup, and no major complaints.  All I really needed was for someone to mow down all weeds in my yard, and ensure that the weeds wouldn't come back.

After filling out a form on their website,  I was contacted that evening.  We had our initial discussion on what I wanted, and I was able to get an estimate within a few days.

The price was very fair, and they did exactly what I wanted with my yard.

Prompt, concise and fair.   My kind of business.
