I first heard about Bertha's Cafe through a friend of mine who gets their work lunches catered by them.  It's been 2 years since that day, and I've been going there almost every weekend since.

It's a nestled little spot just off of Indian School next to a tire shop, so it's pretty hard to spot from the street.  Once you park and enter the shop you'll notice the awesome Cheesecake's and side dishes on display in their outside cooler.
