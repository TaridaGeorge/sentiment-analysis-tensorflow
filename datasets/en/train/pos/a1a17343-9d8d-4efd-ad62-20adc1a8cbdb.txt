I disagree with the previous review, although to be fair, I was assigned a room in the facility's primary (two-story) building.

My family and I stayed in the Executive Inn during a long-weekend Spring Training trip.  I was pleased with a great many things about the facility, including its wonderfully friendly staff, spotless accommodations and campus, and availability of free snacks and sodas, 24 hours a day.

Staying in the Executive Inn and Conference Center was a terrific value, and I'd recommend the facility to anyone!
