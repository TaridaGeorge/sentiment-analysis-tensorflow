This was my first visit to Chase Field.  Unfortunately, we were in the Press Suite over home plate, which has ruined my desire to ever go again as a commoner.

Now I like baseball to an extent.  At one time, I was a die-hard Dodgers fanatic.  In fact, I can still almost name every player circa 1982.  But now, I get a little bored after the first few innings.  That's where the Press Suite comes in.  I can get up, walk around, sit on a couch, mosey up to the buffet, order a drink, choose something from the dessert cart, or watch the game.  My only little complaint is there was a "glass" partition along one side of the viewing area, and it would be nice if they washed it once in a while.

But other than that, 5-star experience!
