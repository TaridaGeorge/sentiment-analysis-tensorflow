In Short: Simply delicious, great ingredients and atmosphere. Awesome combination of imagination and temperance.

To say I loved this place would be an understatement.  I read the reviews before going and I had high expectations, and wasn't the least disappointed.  Location and atmosphere is great, there's outside seating if you'd fancy that.  Great selection of wine list and the beer selection is surprisingly robust.  Try the Lion stout if you are into a chocolate-caramel-creamy stouts.  We tried a couple of glasses of wine, before we descended into the menu.

The real star is the brushcetta, the combinations are pretty tasty.  I loved the smoked salmon, fig/mascapone/prachuto, salami, brie/honey/apple, and smoked peppers/goat cheese.  They also have seasonal selections so don't forget to enquire.  There's a lot of stuff to check out, the panini selection is amazing as well.  Great place to hangout with friends or for a date.
