I went here for my birthday on Friday night and it was A-mazing. I love the dark theme, the bodies on the dance floor. I adore that it wasn't over packed with a bunch of idiots wanting to fight. The girls are beautiful, the men are stout and we had just a whopping good time. Cover was 5 bucks, which most of you will spend more on a cheeseburger than that. Well worth it and will ABSOLUTELY go back!
