This place is amazing! My hubby and I were visiting Scottsdale on vacation and both wanted a little pampering without dropping hundreds of dollars at a spa.  This place just wanted our tired bodies needed. My husband got a chair massage while I received a foot reflexology massage.  I really liked how they put us together in a private room, a nice little touch.  If we were local we would definitely come back again.
