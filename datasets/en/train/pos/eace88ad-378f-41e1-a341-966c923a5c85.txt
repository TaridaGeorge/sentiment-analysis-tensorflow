My boyfriend and I decided to go to Copper Star Coffee after reading reviews on Yelp.  It wasn't a hard sell because I'm a huge fan of cupcakes.  And many of the reviewers were raving about the cupcakes, so I had to try one.  We both loved the coffehouse.  Great drinks, great prices, and yummmmyyyyy cupcakes.  My boyfriend read his book and I did some work on my laptop.  The environment was cozy and comfortable.  I definitely will be coming back again.
