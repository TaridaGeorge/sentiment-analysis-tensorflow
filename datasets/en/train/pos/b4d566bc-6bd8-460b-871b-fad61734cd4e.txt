Oh my, the place I love. I'd love to live in a Condo here when I'm older. Only problem is parking can be bad here.

Well, let's see here. Mastro's Ocean Club. Morton's.  Ra Sushi. PF Changs. Cheesecake Factory. Chloe's Corner. J Crew. Cold Stone. Barnes n Noble. Bose Store. A Nice Barber Shop. And many more shopping options. Then right across from that, we get thrown Scottsdale Quarter. I can spend every day in this square mile. 

Get over to Kierland and just eat somewhere, many great restaurants!
