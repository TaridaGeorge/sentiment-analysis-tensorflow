Went for the first time yesterday for lunch. It was soooo good! There is a wine / beer bar adjacent to the main retail / deli area. Lots of unique gifts,  artisanal cheeses and more! I was amused that they take your lunch order on a brown bag and put your lunch in it. Had an excellent roast beef sandwich and sat out front (note for summer: they only have outdoor seating). Clean, friendly and delicious, check it out!
