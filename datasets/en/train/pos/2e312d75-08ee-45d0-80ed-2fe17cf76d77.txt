Think Andy of Mayberry meets Flo's diner. Great breakfast place in the heart of downtown Cave Creek. Huge menu with lots of choices and just really good basic not fancy food. The pancakes are truly some of the best I have ever had, especially the German Apple pancake. Homespun good ol boy type service and the countrified atmosphere make this a must try destination that is well worth the trip into Creek Creek. PS only place I've ever been where you can actually get extra crispy hash browns....yummu!
