I have a beautiful rescue dog who is very fearful ,and because of this, I didn't have a picture that showed his sweet personality as well as his unique beauty. This all changed once Brinkley and I met Michelle. I couldn't have asked for anyone better than Michelle, who took the time to let Brinks come to her, smell and check out her camera and bag, as well as someone who was willing to go on a morning walk with us, in order to capture his most relaxed and happy self. Thanks to Michelle for truly caring and listening; I am thrilled with the pictures that I have always wanted.
