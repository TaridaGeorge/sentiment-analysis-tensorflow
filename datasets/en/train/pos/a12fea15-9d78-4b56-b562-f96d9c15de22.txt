If you are making a night out in Old Town, whether you're a tourist or local this is the place to go to get that real high-end-cowboy-western-rattlesnake-desert-cactus-boots-ten-gallon-stetson-down-home feel.  Beer, grub & music are all great.  Get there early if you want a seat. Don't plan on chit-chatting because this place is popular, crowded and noisy . . . but oh sooooo fun!
