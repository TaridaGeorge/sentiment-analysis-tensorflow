This donut shop is great. Very clean with friendly staff. The donuts themselves are massive and very tasty! You could pay less at Dunkin Donuts but the size and quality simply doesn't compare to Lamar's.     Some great donuts here are: original glazed, maple bar, devils food chocolate cake, old fashioned glazed just to name a few. In my opinion I have not yet found a better donut than Lamar's. The only downside if any is the price which for donuts is steep at nearly $10 a dozen but for something you enjoy in moderation these donuts are worth the gold plated price.
