We have been in to this Brake Masters location several times over the past 5 years with several different cars.  With each experience we are more convinced that Travis and his staff are truly concerned with the customers situation.  They have always relayed the alternative repair (when there is one) and given us the decision of how to proceed.  We never feel pressured to "trade up" to a larger repair than is required as we have felt with other Airpark garages.  We rate this shop as professional, helpful (occasionally we have needed to be driven back to work) and honest.  While car repairs are never a "fun" expense, we always leave Brake Masters feeling good about the work they have done.
