My girlfriend and I looked at apartments, condos, and houses for rent all over north Phoenix, north Scottsdale, and in downtown Phoenix.  We couldn't find a place that fit our needs.  We briefly stopped at Residences on High Street to pick up a floor plan sheet.  We went back one more time a few weeks later and found Tina to be so helpful.  

Ultimately we chose this place because the location is perfect, the management and staff are so nice and helpful, and the apartment itself was our perfect layout.  

I look forward to staying here for quite some time.
