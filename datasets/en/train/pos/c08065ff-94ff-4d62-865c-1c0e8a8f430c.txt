What a gem! Any beer lover MUST go to Sun Devil. My life would be a better place if I had this place closer to my home, but alas, I only make it to Mesa once a year. DO NOT PASS UP the opportunity to go to the bar in the basement- an absolutely BRILLIANT use of a space which could have been simply storage but now hosts a beautiful bar with room after room of over sized and ridiculously comfortable furniture in a cool (as in "escape the AZ heat") and relaxing environment.
I have to say it again- if you like beer- go to Sun Devil- the selection is truly mind boggling.  
Oh and PS- they have a drive though.....freaking awesome.
