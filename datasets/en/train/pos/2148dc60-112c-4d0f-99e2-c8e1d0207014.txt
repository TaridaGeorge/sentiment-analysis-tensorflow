If we didn't have a kid, we wouldn't be coming here, but since we do, it's a paradise for the little one. Consider becoming a member--it'll save you money in the long run...if you have a little one that LOOOOOOVES trains.  They have ramadas here, which are especially nice for birthday parties.  The new building of little trains is beautiful and mesmerizing.  The holiday lights are WONDERFUL!
