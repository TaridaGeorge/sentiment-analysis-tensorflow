I'm disappointed that I did not know that BLT was in the valley until last week.  I am a big fan of BLT Prime in NYC.  We attended a birthday party there the other night and the dinner was spectacular.  

The menu was set and the dinner was served family style.  For appetizers we had crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, spinach salad, chicken liver pate and cheese popovers.  The main course consisted of short ribs, steak, swordfish and free-range chicken.  sides included grilled asparagus, creamed spinach and augratin potatoes. Finally for desert there was strawberry Sunday's lemon meringue tarts, and Chocolate cake .  Everything was outstanding.

The decor is contemporary and comfortable and the service was as good as the food!
