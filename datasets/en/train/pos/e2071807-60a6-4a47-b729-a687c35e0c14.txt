I went here for my birthday dinner on a Thursday night.  Walking into the place it was very well laid out and a nice mixture of swanky lounge feel and then football games on the surrounding tv's.  The server, Jordan, was very good.  Most places bring you a scoop of icecream or something small for your birthday, this place wend the extra mile and let me pick from anything on the menu, nice touch!  I got the cajun shrimp and sausage skewers with white cheddar grits and decided to mix the two together for a little shrimp and grits action.  My girlfriend got the salmon and onion bread pudding, also great. Great choice for a nice night out; I will be back.
