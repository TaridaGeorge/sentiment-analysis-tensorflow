Going to the Railroad Park is my idea of fun and cheap outing in Scottsdale. The park is nice and big and well kept with lots to keep you busy. The rides are fun for all ages with train rides and carousel rides for only a dollar each. There is also a fun little train museum located in one of the old trains on the property which is really interesting to check out. The park has two playgrounds, and one is in the theme of a western town. There are also concessions and a few gift stores that are sure to please any train lover in your life. Perfect place to take kids, or have a get together!
