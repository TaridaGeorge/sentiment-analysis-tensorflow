I opened up a Yelp account specifically to rave about this salon! The staff is friendly, Jennifer is just great, very accomodating and sweet and my stylist Cassie is probably the best stylist/colorist  I've ever been to! I went the first time after purchasing one of those online deals for a keratin treatment and cut and have never looked back! I always leave there feeling great! I find the salon to be clean and quite sanitary, and the pricing is more than fair! I am a customer for life!
