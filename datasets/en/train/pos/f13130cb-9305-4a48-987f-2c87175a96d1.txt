They changed my life.

I never have been a huge fan of burgers. But after going there last week my life has been flipped upside down. I went at 1 am and the guys who came with me, complained that they didnt want to wait 10 minutes for a table or shell out 9.50 for a burger, so I opted for takeout. When I finally got back home the bun was soggy and was luke warm, but even through all the faults I could taste that I was in love. If a soggy burger can get me going I know this place is fantastic. Moral of the story I wont be taking those friends with me out anymore and I will with out a doubt be eating in next time. I cant wait!
