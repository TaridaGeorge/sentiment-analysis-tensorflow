I hate hate HATE going to the laundry but I've moved to an apartment that doesn't have facilities. Or rather the crap equipment it does have isn't worth trying.

I love EcoLaundry. Period. It's almost painless to go do laundry now. It's always clean, well-lit and staffed. I've only seen one machine down and the repairman came while I was there. Plenty of space, the machine sizes range from regular top-loading singles to front loaders that hold 6. Plus there's plenty of rolling carts and work spaces for everyone. Even the bathrooms are clean.

There's multiple TVs for entertainment if you don't bring your laptop to use the free wi-fi (and power plugs along the back wall).
