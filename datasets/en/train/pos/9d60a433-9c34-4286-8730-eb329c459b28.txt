This is a beautiful property with nearly any amenity that could be imagined.

Hiking in the desert?  Check

Beautiful Golf Course?  Check

Multiple pools, spa, steakhouse, luxury accommodations?  Check, check check...  You get the idea...

The rooms are large and well appointed with balconies overlooking the pool complex, the golf course or desert...  Beautiful views everywhere you look.

The staff are all highly competent, accommodating and always ready to assist.

The conference and meeting spaces are modern, quiet and the catering is extremely well done.

I'll definitely stay here again...  Remember this is a Starwood property so make sure you leverage your SPG status at checkin.
