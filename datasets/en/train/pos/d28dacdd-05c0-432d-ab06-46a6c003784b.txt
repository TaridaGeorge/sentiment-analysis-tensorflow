Being health conscious, I love that I can drop into tasti d-lite and feel good about enjoying one of their fabulous parfaits.  I can even get a little work done using their free wifi. My husband and I also often drop in after dinner for a delicious light dessert. Also, there are so many flavors that they will custom blend for you in addition to the six flavors of the day. My favorite is the caramel. I am always impressed with how spot on the service is. You know they care about their customers.
