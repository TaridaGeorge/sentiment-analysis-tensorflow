I'm a healthy eater.  I love the low carb pizza, salads, and buffalo chicken in a whole grain wrap.  The staff is fun, delivery is timely.  Also, I have used them for catering 3 big events in the past.  The food has always been complimented by my guests, and they immediately become customers.  The staff that attends the catering is very professional.  I highly recommend them to cater your next corporate event.
