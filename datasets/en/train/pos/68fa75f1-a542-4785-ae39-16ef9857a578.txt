I ADORE this place!! It is right by my house, i can walk there and not have to worry about anything!!! It is super cool atmosphere with great music and a good mix of people. the bartenders are the best, big shout out to Becki!! the prices are low, the ceiling is popcorn glitter prob with a lil asbestos mixed it, but hey it is a old building!!! Friday nites are the best and then of course Saturdays!!! Gooo there!!!
