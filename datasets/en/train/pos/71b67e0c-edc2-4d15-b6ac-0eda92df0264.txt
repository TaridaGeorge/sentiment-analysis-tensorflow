Excellent breakfast!  This place actually serves a big omelet.  Why is it so hard to find a big omelet??  These places that specialize in breakfast, and give you a tiny, flat, skimpy omelet??  Why??  Anyways, I digress...

The eggs are perfectly cooked... and generous, very good rosemary potatoes, and great coffee.

Excellent, excellent service!  Fair prices.  Very clean!!  A gem for breakfast!
