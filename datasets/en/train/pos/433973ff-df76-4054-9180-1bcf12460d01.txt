We had a reservation for 6pm on Mothers Day and didn't get seated until 7:20 pm. We had asked for a half booth when we had made our reservation and for our party of six a regular booth is to small and we didn't want a table. The manager, Marybeth Garrett bent over backward to accommodate us. When we were seated she had made sure that appetizers were sent out to our table right away, we had a great waitress, the food was excellent and Marybeth came to our table at the end of our meal and informed us that our meals were on the house because of the reservation problem. Outside of the wait we had a great time, and enjoyed our Mothers Day Dinner.
