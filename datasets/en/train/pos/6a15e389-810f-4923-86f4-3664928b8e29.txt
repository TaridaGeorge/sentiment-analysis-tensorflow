This is the best Gelato I've ever tasted.  It's fresh and creamy, and the prices are reasonable.  

If there are any negatives about this place (and there really are none) it's that there are too many delicious flavors and you'll have a hard time deciding what you want.  Seriously.  When I come here EVERYTHING looks good, so it's really hard to pick.  I try to have something different every time, and I have yet to try a bad flavor.  Plus their service is great.  Even times when they are extremely crowded they somehow find ways to make the wait pleasant.  Good job guys!
