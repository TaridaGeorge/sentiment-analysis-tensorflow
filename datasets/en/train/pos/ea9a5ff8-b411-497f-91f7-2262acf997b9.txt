Out of all the bbq restaurants in Phoenix, this one by far is the best one I have been to.  My boyfriend and I are from KC and, of course, claim to know bbq.  Bobby Q's isn't as good as some of my favorites around the country, but for Phoenix, I give it an A+.

Many of the establishments in town have ok meat, but horrible sides.  Bobby Q was great all around!  From the corn bread, to the bbq sandwiches and finally the mini-donuts for dessert (that were even hot) everything was fantastic.  

The venue is a bit more upscale than most bbq joints and the parking lot and restaurant itself are gigantic.  Don't worry about getting a spot on a week night, there is plenty of room!
