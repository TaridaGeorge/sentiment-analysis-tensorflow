We were addicted to Freddy's when we tried them in Texas.  Then one day they opened in Glendale, AZ and we would drive all the way from Gilbert to eat there.  Then they opened one in Gilbert and we moved.  So on a recent trip to PHX I researched and found this location.  All of that to say - we love this franchise.  This location is of the same caliber.
