The Disney Store is our go to store when we have time to kill or need a break from shopping at Stride Rite and Gymboree.  The Disney Store seems to be slowly morphing into the Magic Kingdom with tunnels through plush toy displays, a tunnel through a princess castle, and my favorite, the tree and obscures section of a wall that proudly displays animation sequences.  There is also a coloring area complete with Disney Movie.  Some training is provided by animators.  Funny thing about the movie, I didn't see any DVDs for sale.  Just plush toys, more toys, Cars toys, Marvel toys, some collectibles, lots of diaries, and clothes.  Or were those journals.  There are also suitcases.  Hint, hint!!
