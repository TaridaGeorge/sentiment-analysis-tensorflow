Bathroom that makes you want to crap into a hole in the floor?  Check.
Jukebox that has a cornucopia of blissfully crappy hairband rock? Check.

Dirt parking lot? Check.
All in the heart of Scottsdale?  Check.

Yes, the coach house was brought to my consciousness by none other than Kathryn L., who isn't a yelper but should be, and her two lovely friends.  Dive bar perfection.
