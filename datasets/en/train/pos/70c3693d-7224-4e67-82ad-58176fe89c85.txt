Of course, like everyone else our a/c decides to die on one of the 1st hot HOT days of the year! So I called a bunch of places, and American Dream was the only one who answered and actually made an appointment with me for first thing the next morning (I called on Saturday evening). Terry was my technician, he was very thorough and he found the problem right away. He didn't do anything until he quoted us the price, and we felt it was very reasonable. We highly recommend this company, especially if you are in an emergency situation.
