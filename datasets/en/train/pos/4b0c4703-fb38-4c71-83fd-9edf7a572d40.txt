When it comes to great food the Texaz Grill is not bested by any place I've ever visited. I'm not sure if you're like me but I have certain dishes at different restaurants and that's what I get every time I go there. But for some reason I've had at least a dozen different meals at the Texaz Grill and each and everyone was great tasting.

Don't expect some stuffy, twitchy server at your table side but you will have what seems like a lifelong friend being attentive. Come casual, loosen your belt (did I mention that most meals portions are quite large) and enjoy your visit to your friend's because that's what it will feel like.
