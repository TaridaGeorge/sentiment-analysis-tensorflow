The pizza is amazing! We usually get the white pizza with chicken and artichokes, try it.  I also recommended getting a dessert, try the Tiramisu or the cheese cake. The prices are also phenomenal for the quality of pizza. If there was any downside to this amazing restaurant it is that the wings are just your basic wings, not bad, but now WOW like the pizza is. The people who work there are nice and friendly and the service is quick.
