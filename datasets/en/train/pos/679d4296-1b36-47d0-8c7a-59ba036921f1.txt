I love joes! They have some of the best hamburgers around and I'm not much if a fan of burgers. I know a ton of people rave about the pizza but I don't think that is their best item. If the weather is nice, sit outside and enjoy the atmosphere. 
Side note about the flies- yes in the summer they can get bad. It has FARM in its name though, so I'd you don't like nature you might want to skip it.
