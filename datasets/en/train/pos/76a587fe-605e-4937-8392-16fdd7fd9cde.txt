spent 3 days at this great resort.  although i was here for buisness i felt like i was on a mini vacation while on the grounds.Set amidst flowering cactus, breathtaking sunsets and framed against the majestic McDowell Mountains, Hyatt Regency Scottsdale Resort and Spa features a 2 1/2-acre "water playground", 27 holes of championship golf, world-class tennis, Spa, the Native American Learning and Environmental Center, an international art collection and four distinctively different restaurants. and
more .  not cheap but worth every penny
