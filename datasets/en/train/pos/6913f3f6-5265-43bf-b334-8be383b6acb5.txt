I made a reservation for 9:45 (the latest there is), but because of the boxing fight we (two people) arrived at the restaurant at 10:10, the kitchen closed already... However the manager decided to seat us anywaz n we had two orders of Filet Mignon, best steak ever! Greatttttt service!!! I would leave 10 stars if possible.. Gotta try it!! We sat at the patio on a warm spring/summer night, with their lighting and music, it was sooo romantic!
