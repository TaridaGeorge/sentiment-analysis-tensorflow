What do you want?  Nee House is a real Chinese hole in the wall.  I am from L.A. and that is the only place you want to find.  You don't go to Nee House for a warm and friendly feel...you go for fresh, delicious Chinese food.  Jerry Sienfeld would agree...if they had marble rye I would be running down the street too.
