I can't say enough good things about this place or the owners. My 1st time at Liberty Market, my friend and I ended up chatting with the owners (Kiersten and David) for a short while before eating. On our next visit, weeks later, they remembered us AND our names. Impressive. Not only that, we came in as they were closing and they still accommodated us. Talk about service. 

Every single thing I've ordered from their menu has been amazing. The pizzas are really great, especially the White pizza. The Italia salad is also delicious. Portions are big, sharing is caring my friends.

Side note: Make sure to check out the bathrooms. Each stall has a different theme and music to go along with it. We made sure to lock ourselves in each and every stall to get the full experience.
