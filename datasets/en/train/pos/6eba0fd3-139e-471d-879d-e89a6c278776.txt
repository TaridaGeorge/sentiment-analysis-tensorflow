This local hole-in-the-wall, is the best Thai restaurant in Avondale (well ok it's the only one). It easy to miss but once you find it you won't forget it. The menu is a bit beyond the standard Thai eatery, offering bold, authentic Thai flavors. If you love Thai food, this is the place to go. If you don't get Thai food, this is the place to go. For the spicy dishes they can make it as Thai as you would like or it. The service is very good and the owner and staff make you feel very welcome. You owe yourself a short trip to this humble, great restaurant.
