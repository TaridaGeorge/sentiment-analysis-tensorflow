Peppersauce Cafe is one of my favorite places to eat. Though there are many amazing dishes here, my favorite is the pulled pork sandwich. It is topped with onion rings and is FANTASTIC!. I discovered this restaurant about 3 years ago when I was working in the area. I have taken many customers and friends there for lunch. It's a real home cooked meal for just over the price of what you would get fast food. The staff is courteous and remembers who you are. I think that's important for businesses.  Anyhow, Peppersauce gets two thumbs up from me!
