Wildflower is a great unique place that serves up excellent breakfasts and lunches. Their portion sizes are large so come hungry or be prepared to take some home with you. They are so much, and I can't stress this enough, so much better than Paradise Bakery. They even have delicious baked goods. One of my favorite things to do is go on a bike ride with my girlfriend and stop there for lunch or a late breakfast, then go grocery shopping at Trader Joe's, which is right next door. They also have great coffee so go to them instead of a Starbucks, which I'm sure there is one around the corner. My favorite sandwich is the Chicken Pesto which I usually customize to suit my particular needs, my girlfriend says that I'm kind of a food snob.
