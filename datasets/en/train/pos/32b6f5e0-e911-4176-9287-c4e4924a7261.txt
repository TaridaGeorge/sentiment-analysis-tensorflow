Let me begin by saying Timo's is the place to be! I love it there! Im 20 minutes away and the lil drive is worth it! Every- one to two times a week, I'm there! The staff is great! Especially the bartender AMY! I enjoy her great service and wonderful, cheerful personality! She makes my day by having me leave with a smile! One of the cooks which his name is DIEGO, knows exactly what Im going to order and never disappointed! I love the food and always plenty leftovers for me to take home! Please stop by and check it out, you won't be disappointed! :-)
