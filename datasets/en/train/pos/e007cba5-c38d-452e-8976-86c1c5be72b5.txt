I purchased an arrangement online from Tulip Tree from here in Seattle to be sent to my mother in Phoenix for her retirement. My dad sent me a picture of them upon arrival, and they looked great! I also received good customer service (a nice lady called to clarify some details of my order and make sure it was what I wanted), and for the price I paid including delivery it was an awesome arrangement. I will use them again if I ever need to send flowers to that area.
