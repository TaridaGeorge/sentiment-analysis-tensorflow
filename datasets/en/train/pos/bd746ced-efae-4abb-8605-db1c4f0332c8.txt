Just moved from Southern Cal and didn't transport the booze so we needed to re-stock.  We found the perfect place, though completely overwhelmed by how much there was.  

Ended up leaving with 6 bottles of wine, some Jack Daniels and root beer.  Picked out the wines by reading the descriptions.  See how that works for me.  

Loved it, can't wait to go back.  Gotta get my drink on.
