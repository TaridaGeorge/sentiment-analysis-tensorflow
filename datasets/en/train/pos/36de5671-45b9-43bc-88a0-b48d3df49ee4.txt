Frances is quite lovely. I stopped in when Christmas shopping to pick up a pair of TOM'S for my sister (yes, they carry those!) and  was mesmerized by the whimsical jewelery display, the clever books, beautiful stationary, creative knick knacks and aromatic candles. The staff is quite friendly and helpful too.

Although smaller in size, this place is perfect when you need unique gifts for those hard to please people in your life, they even have gifts for men, babies and pets. The only downside is that... as boutiques go, they are a bit pricey. Can't wait until I have extra cash on had so I can go and splurge!
