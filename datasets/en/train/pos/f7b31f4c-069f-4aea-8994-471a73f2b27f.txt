I second Helen Y.!! This is certainly one of the finest farmers markets in the valley! So many cool things my hands were full of bags! So much to chose from! Even found brussel sprouts still on the stalk! It doesn't get much fresher then that! 

Rancho Pinot was there serving focaccia sandwiches made the braised greens, whole grain mustard and Schreiner's Fine Sausage, amazingly good! 

Oh gawd, there was the little old lady selling pickles and preserves, ForgetMeNot Catering.. I ended up buying her pickles and a jar of Strawberry Rhubarb preserves, out of this world tasty! Slather some on a slice of bread from Phoenician Bakery.. it rivals good sex! 

When you get a chance, check it out.. its not close to being anything like what you would find in San Francisco but for Phoenix/Scottsdale, its perfectly awesome!
