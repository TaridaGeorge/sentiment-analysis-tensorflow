I think it's such a shame that I'm seeing several negative reviews on here. Su vino is one of me absolute favorite places to go. I have never had a bad experience. The staff is always knowledgeable and friendly. Some saturday nights they have entertainment in the form of a man with a fantastic voice! I love love love the wine and if you're looking for a place to do a unique event, this is it. We did a wine bottling for my sisters bridal shower a few years ago and it was fantastic! Everyone had a great time!
