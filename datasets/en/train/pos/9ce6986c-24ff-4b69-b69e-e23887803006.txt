Technically named Fresco Juice, anyone-who- is-anyone simply knows the place as "BingSoo." A small, simple spot in an inauspicious Chandler strip-mall, Fresco's has the corner on the BingSoo market in the Phoenix area. Come to think of it, I don't think there even is another BingSoo place in Phoenix... But if there was, Fresco could beat them blindfolded and with it's hands tied behind it's back. 

What?? You've never heard of BingSoo? Then friend, you are in for a better-than-sex (sorry, honey) taste sensation. BingSoo is an Asian-inspired dessert made of shaved ice, your choice of fresh sliced fruits and fruit sauces, and frozen yogurt or ice cream on the top. Fresco's sports a Starbuck's-style ambience, plus the Korean music videos projected on the wall. The sandwiches are fresh although nothing too spectacular, but the quality of the BingSoo alone deserves the 5-star rating.
