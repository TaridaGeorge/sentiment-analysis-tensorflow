My friends and I meandered into this place Saturday night at 11pm... starving.

We're huge huge HUGE fans of soup dumplings, and were pleasantly suprised to find out this place has reverse happy hour on food and drinks, and the soup dumplings were discounted!
YES!@!!!!

We ended up with 7 orders of soup dumplings, a sugar can pork, and two duck confits.  Everything was AMAZING.
So happy/lucky to have a place like this in Phx
