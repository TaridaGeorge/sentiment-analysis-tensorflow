great place for atmosphere and interesting food.     if you can, sit at the chefs table !      Razz, the chef owner, will continue to place spectacular food in front of you until you can not eat another bite.   He is guaranteed to entertain you through the entire dining experience.  One of the great chefs in the valley!
