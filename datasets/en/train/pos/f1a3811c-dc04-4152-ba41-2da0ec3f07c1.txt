omg, the grandma g's pizza with rosemary chicken and potatoes was soooo good! I came here with my parents and we also shared a mediterranean salad, which was also delicious. Tried the Four Peaks Kilt Lifter on draft and it was great. Seems hard to go wrong here. There was a huge line, but totally worth the wait.

Oh yeah, I got carded w/ my parents and I'm turning 31 in four months. lol! Apparently I look *way* young. YESSSSSS ;P
