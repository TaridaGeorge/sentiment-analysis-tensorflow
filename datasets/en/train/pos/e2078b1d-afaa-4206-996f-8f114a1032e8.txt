Siphon Draw is an incredibly scenic 4 miles round trip, winding up the small canyon known as Siphon Draw. The first mile of the hike starts with a relatively gentle grade leading from the trailhead to the foot of the 1200-foot vertical cliffs. From there it gets steeper and sometimes requires rock-scrambling and the use of both hands. But the rewards are so worth it: lovely high-desert vegetation, interesting rock "hoodoos" and the jaw-dropping views!

Lost Dutchman State Park is located 5 miles north of Apache Junction, off of AZ 88 (old Apache Trail) at the base of the Superstition Mountains. There is a small parking fee.
