Spending a lot of my childhood in Canada led to a quick obsession with boba tea.

However, in Arizona, a really good boba place is hard to come by but then I found Eba a few years ago. Their drinks are so refreshing and as good as you can possibly find in this area. Plus, the boba come out just right, not too hard or chewy, which seems to be a huge problem for some places. I recommend the almond milk tea with boba, which is my personal favorite.

I almost cried when I thought they went out of business after they closed their old location but they ended up relocating so go to this one and try it out!
