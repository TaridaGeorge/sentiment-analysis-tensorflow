This might be the best pizza I have ever eaten: traditional crust with sun-dried tomatoes and pesto.  Crunchy thin crust, top-notch ingredients, delicious flavor... Perfect with a Peroni beer!  Right off of old-town Scottsdale and within walking distance of some of the best art in Arizona, this is a perfect place to have an excellent pizza.  Kid-friendly too!
