We really enjoyed our meal at Chelsea's Kitchen! Fresh ingredients, enticing menu and we didn't even know that kids eat free everyday off the kids menu from 3-6pm! It was a nice surprise! Staff was super friendly & the patio was great! Try the organic rotisserie chicken or the short rib tacos, you won't be disappointed! Grab a free cookie on your way out! A sweet way to end a fabulous meal!
