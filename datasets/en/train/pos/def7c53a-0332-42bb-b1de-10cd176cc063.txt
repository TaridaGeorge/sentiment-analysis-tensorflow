Red Hot Robot is a fantastic little "urban culture" art store. I don't know what else to call it.

Sure, it's full of cool vinyl toys, but also prints, books, cards, local art... things the the owner has carefully selected and arranged with a keen eye.

Even my wife has been swayed by the Robot, who usually doesn't like to follow me into stores like this. She's gotten interested in the vinyl toy movement, too!

I've always had great service, and parking has never been an issue for me.

My favorite store in PHX.
