I think my fellow Oreganymphos would agree; this is single handedly one of the greatest places on earth to gorge yourself with some of the most delicious pizza, pastas and desserts AZ has to offer. 

If you wanna take my word for it, dont even look at the menu and order my usual orgasmic order:

Appetizer: Calimari
Dinner: Big Rig Pasta w/ Chicken 
Dessert: White Chocolate Chip Macadamian Nut Pazookie

FYI: Whenever your taste buds feel like going on a culinary roadtrip, make sure you hit up any of the various Oregano's locations located around the state; my personal favs are the Flagstaff and Tucson locations.
