YES!!! and YES and YES!! too bad i don't live closer. I really love this place.

They get a huge four stars off the bat because they are supporters of Pedal Craft. I love that!!

Boulders has a great tap selection that fluctuates often. The food is good. Not great, but the atmosphere easily makes up for it. 

It is a dive that you could go to every day and even take a casual date to without feeling like you're slumming it. 

Dive bars = win

Bars that love cycling = 5 star win.

I prefer this to the big brewery places closer to that community college down the road...

BEAR DOWN!!
