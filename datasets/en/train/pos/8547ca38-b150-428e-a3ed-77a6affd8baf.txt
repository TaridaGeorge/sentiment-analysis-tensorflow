Where do I start. Okay, I love this QuikTrip - how's that for starters. The employees here are SO friendly and while I can honestly say that every QuikTrip I have been to is friendly, this one beats them all. Employees get my door, wish me a great day and they always say "see ya again soon!" I walk in and feel like I have friends - oh and another thing, they are super quick checking people out and multitasking. Plus their gas is either the cheapest or close enough to pay a little extra for the quality of people. I love knowing my money is going towards such friendly people.
