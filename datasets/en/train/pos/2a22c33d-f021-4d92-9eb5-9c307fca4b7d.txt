I am officially giving 20+ stars!  This is an awesome brewery and the food was amazing.  I had the street tacos (chicken, pork and beef); the flavor is wonderful.  Our server was Olympia and she was the best server I've had in any restaraunt since I've moved here.  She was engaging, friendly and knew her beer!  I had the Devil Ale and was very pleased...Bar none...best place / server in Chandler.  Also has lots of shopping and a winery down the street.  I can't wait to go back and bring other family and friends.
