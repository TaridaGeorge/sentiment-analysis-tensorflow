Ditto all the previous reviews, I've been to this place 3 times now and have never been disappointed.

This time I shared the Bartlett Pear and Black Forest sandwich.
And of course potato pancakes.
For dessert, we shared an apple strudel.

Absolutely Scrumptious!

I've had the Hefeweizen before...yummmm.

I love the new place, and can't wait to go again!
