Good service. Excellent value. I went for the "All You Can Eat" deal they have from 2-9 PM and was there for a few hours. I'm not fat or anything, I just felt like finding a good place to study and eat for a bit. The server was pretty attentive and the kitchen staff was pretty fast. I was kind of disappointed that the menu for the all you can eat deal was missing many of my favorites from the regular menu, but there were still quite a few good choices.
