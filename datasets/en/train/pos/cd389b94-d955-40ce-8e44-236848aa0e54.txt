WOW! 

The hubs and I were meeting up with a friend and her lad, she suggested TMI and boy am I glad she did! 

TMI is a super cute historic house with tons of charm. The staff was extremely friendly and quick. The pricing was very reasonable. 

We ordered some olives to start, the citrus on them kinda threw me off a bit, but they were still tasty. For my meal I got the grilled cheese with a side salad. The salad was fresh and light. The grilled cheese freaken RULED! I don't know how I am going to go back to this place and order anything different, seriously folks, this might be the grilled cheese to end all grilled cheese sandwiches. 

I cant wait for better weather so we can sit out on their cute patio!
