After craving boba tea for weeks I finally looked it up here and saw this place as the closest. Walking up to the restaurant was a little intimidating because of the outside appearance but once you step indoors its clean and cold. The clerk immediately greeted us and asked if we were here for boba.
He was incredibly kind and the entire place felt very welcoming. I got the almond milk tea and Vince G. got the black tea with milk after the clerk's recommendation. Both drinks were perfect and I drank it all instantly. 

After reading others reviews, I'll be back to try the food! XD
