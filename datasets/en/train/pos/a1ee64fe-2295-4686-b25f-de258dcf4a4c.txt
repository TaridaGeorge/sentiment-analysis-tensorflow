Nothing better than watching a great movie (or even a so so movie) in a nice small (48 seat) theater. The owner is fantastic and the staff are all movie geeks like me. They are always friendly and welcoming and make every visit to the Royale a pleasure. I am looking forward to many years of attending "quirky, independent films" at the Royale. SUPPORT LOCAL BUSINESS!
