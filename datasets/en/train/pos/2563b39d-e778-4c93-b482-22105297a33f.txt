this is by far my favorite lunch spot in the valley. The fact that it also is a grocery store only adds to its charm. All the ingredients are fresh and the servings are big. I reccomend the itialian sausage and there cold chicken pasta is wonderful. Highly reccomended for anyone who wants a nice little lunch spot. be warned though, wait times can be very long. If your willing to wait though this is a great spot.
