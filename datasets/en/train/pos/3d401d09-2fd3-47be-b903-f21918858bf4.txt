My boo and i go to U.S. egg all the time because they serve breakfast until 2:30 pm. This is not just any old breakfast joint, this place is delicious! I personally recomend the protein pancake, but my boyfriend always gets the protein waffle with eggs on the side. 

The decor is very friendly and all-american. The servers are friendly and all-american. the food is friendly and all-american. I think you get the gist..
