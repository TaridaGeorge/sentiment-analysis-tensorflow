Just left from Lola's and finally feeling like my eyes are open! why haven't i been here sooner? I will no longer be lazy and sit in the drive though of..well, i wont even say the name of that huge company (you know what I'm talking about.) Lola's is very attractive, great prices and has beautiful pastry's. I did not have time to sit down, but there is plenty of space for that, with interesting books on the tables. WiFi, and real coffee cups! The cute girl behind the counter was very nice. She treated everyone like they were a longtime friend. Lola's is great!! See you there :)
