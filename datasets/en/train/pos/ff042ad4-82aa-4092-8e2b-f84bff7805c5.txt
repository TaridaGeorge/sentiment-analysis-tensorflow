I got try try this amazing concoction the other night at Yelps Ultimate Science Fair.... and it was by far one of my favorites at the event! 

I sample two flavors, and they were amazing. The liqueur in the ice cream gives it that extra "something" that most other ice creams you have lack.

I can't wait to get down to the store and try some more!
