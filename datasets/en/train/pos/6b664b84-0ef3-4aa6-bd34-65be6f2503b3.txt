Dang so many haters on this place. Maybe I came on a good night or something because I really enjoyed my time here.

Yeah this place is retarded crowed, its a chain and the servers aren't perfect but come on now. Did anyone taste the pizza? We had the Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage and Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato and they were both fantastic. They have a good selection of beer, nice outdoor seating area and their pizza comes correct. Also, if you have any room left get the pizza cookie.
