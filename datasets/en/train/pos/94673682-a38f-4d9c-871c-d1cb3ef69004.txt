Stopped here on our way out of town after a long weekend in PHX.  We could not have been happier.  This place rocks!  Not only is the food great, but we loved their dedication to growing their own fruit, veggies & herbs and sourcing locally.

We had the fabulous Insalata to start (love those crispy Chick Peas!) and the Funghi pizza (truffle oil & goat cheese!) as well a Pepperoni one.  All was fantastic. In fact, we took our leftovers home in our cooler safely tucked on ice for the 6+ hour drive home! The remaining pizza slices were devoured the next day.

All I can say is that I wish we had one of these in our neighborhood.  Then again, maybe it's better that we don't!!
