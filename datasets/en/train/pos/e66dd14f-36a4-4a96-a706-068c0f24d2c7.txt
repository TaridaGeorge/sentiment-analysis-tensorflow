I hit the True Food Kitchen on 4th of July, because I received an email for a 25% off discount at a Fox restaurant. True Food is one of my favorites, so I called up my best friend and we headed over. 

I highly recommend the tomato and watermelon salad. It's so light and refreshing. We also ordered the lemon tart. It was delicious as well. 

Every time I hit this restaurant, I receive excellent service! The food and drinks are always beyond delicious as well.
