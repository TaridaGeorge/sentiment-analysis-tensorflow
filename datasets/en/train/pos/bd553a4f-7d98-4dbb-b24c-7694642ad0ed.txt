I'm a big fan of Leaps. Their frozen custard is wonderful! I enjoy being able to get a small portion because it is good enough that you don't have to eat barrels of it to feel like you've had a good dessert.
The atmosphere is very nice. They have tables, but also leather chairs and a comfy couch. Even better, they have FREE WIRELESS INTERNET! Yeah! I've seen everyone there from high school volleyball players to business people making huge financial deals. It's a great spot, especially in the summer.
