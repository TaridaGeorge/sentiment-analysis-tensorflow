My recent trip to Snowbowl had a bus breakdown half way through. Of course not DSC's fault as anyone can have a breakdown, but still made us lose time & they had to deal with a bus full of unhappy customers. They handled it very professionally, provided partial refunds and discounts on the next trip. They provided extra beverages & did a good job at making a bad situation better. They played movies up & back, and all in all it was pretty fun. I'll never drive to snowbowl again - this is a great service and I for one will tell all my ski buddies about it. Sure the staff is young - but they're also alot of fun too. Thanks guys!!!
