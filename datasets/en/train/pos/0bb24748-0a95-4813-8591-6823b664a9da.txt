I went here recently with a Japanese coworker. Three things I learned:

- "Sakana" means 'fish' in Japanese. My friend laughed at a restaurant named Fish - like, not even Best Fish! but just...Fish.

- Sushi restaurants in Japan are comparable to Irish pubs in Ireland - friendly waitstaff, lively environment, and a bar with lots of alcohol. The ambiance here really reminded her of home.

- Sakana's food is absolutely outstanding. Deelish. Portions are huge yet affordable. I paid $18 for 4 nigiri selections and a roll, and it was so much food that next time I'll just order half that. And just so that this comes up in a Yelp search, I have to mention HUGE TAMAGO!!!

What a find, this restaurant called fish.
