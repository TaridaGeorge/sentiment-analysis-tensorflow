What I love so much about this place (Other then the Gelato) is the management. The same day I posted my initial review, I had a message from the owner, and the manager. If an operation cares this much about their business, it must be a great place to be. I must've just gone in an off day, but either way, I now can't wait to check them out again. 

Thumbs up for The Gelato Spot!
