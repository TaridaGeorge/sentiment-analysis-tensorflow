The only good thing to come out of my experience at the bridal show was seeing this bridal shop. Their selection of dresses were so beautiful and unique I was drawn to them and immediately booked an appointment. My bridal consultant Kristen was so sweet and helpful. She gave great personalized attention to me and my family. After trying on a few dresses she suggested one I never would have picked out for myself. I ended up choosing the dress Kristen suggested and couldn't be happier. It is perfect and can't wait to wear it to my wedding. She also suggested accessories that complimented my dress but she wasn't at all pushy and helped my choose a veil as well. I would definitely recommend Iris D bridal for their attentive service and great selection of wonderfully unique dresses. Amanda
