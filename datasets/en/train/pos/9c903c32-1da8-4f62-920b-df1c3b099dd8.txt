Lookout mountain is the best hiking workout. If you are just starting out you can hike the circumference around the mountain. 
The more advanced hikers can go straight up to the top and get a great view of downtown before a nice trail down
The trails are wide and well kept for the most part.
Almost never crowded and you can take your dog.
