My Granddaughter just turned two last week and I still didn't know what to get her for her birthday gift. my husband and I took her to the children's museum yesterday and she had such a great time the entire time we were there we became members. Happy Birthday Chloe I know we will be there every Sun and the membership is flexible so her parents can take her or I can take a guest, its really a great deal. Cant wait to go back.
