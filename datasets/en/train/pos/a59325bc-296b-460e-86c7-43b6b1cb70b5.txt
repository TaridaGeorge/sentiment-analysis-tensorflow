I was unsure to expect when i arrived here since it was my first time. The guy at the front was very helpful because i told him it was my first time and had no clue how to order.  I chose my broth which was the spicy one and added beef, corn etc.  It was huge and more than i was expecting.  It was really good.  We ordered Gyoza for our little one and edemame which was a great choice.  It is very nice and clutter free inside.  I ate everything in sight because it was so good. I will definitely be back before i move out of town. I hope to find a place like this in CA.
