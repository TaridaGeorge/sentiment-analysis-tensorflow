Everyone loves Sprinkles Cupcakes, but now I REALLY do!  We ordered some as a Thank You gift for another department and they were supposed to arrive at 1pm.  Around 1:15pm, I decided to follow up to see where the courier was.....within 5 minutes I received a call back from Order line letting me know he was very busy and unfortunately running behind but that he would be here in 20 minutes.  With three minutes I received a call from Lauren, the store manager in Scottsdale, apologizing for the delay and said they would comp the delivery fee of $35!  Talk about GREAT Customer Service!!  Yay Sprinkles!  Yummy Cupcakes as well as fantastic customer service!
