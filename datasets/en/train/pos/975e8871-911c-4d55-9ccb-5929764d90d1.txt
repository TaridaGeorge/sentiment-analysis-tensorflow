So we got carry out from here, and when I walked in it smelled funny and I was worried. I should have been, because the food was AMAZING! Shaved noodles in OX tail soup was to die for, as were the steam dumplings of heaven! My husband got the hand drawn noodles in XO sauce and just loved it. Really good price too! I recommend the shaved noodles myself for a yummy chewy noodle, but the hand drawn weren't anything to sneeze at.  I would like to eat in, you can watch the chef prepare the noodles which sounds fun!
