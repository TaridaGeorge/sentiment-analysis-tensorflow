I know a lot of people now a days are against chains, but this is one you should definitly get behind.

Ive never had a bad experience here. The service is always fast, and nice.

The pizzas are great, and the cheesecakes, which change often, are oh so worth the bloated "ate way too much" feeling afterwards. My husband recommends the Heath bar one, while Im a cheesecake purist: classic w/ strawberries & chocolate drizzle.

They have a great beer selection and its a perfect place for a Sat. lunch between errands, or a dinner w/ friends.
