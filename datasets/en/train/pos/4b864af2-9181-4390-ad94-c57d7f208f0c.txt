I am not sure where this place is, since a buddy just dragged me here.  I am from Denver.  Anyway, this is great pizza.  We had a X Large sausage, peppers and onions and a large plain.  Cut in squares (apparently Chicago style).  According to my friend they fly in all the ingredients from the Windy City and also have great sandwiches.  If you live in the area, this is a good hole in the wall and you should frequent.  Or at least, give it a shot.
