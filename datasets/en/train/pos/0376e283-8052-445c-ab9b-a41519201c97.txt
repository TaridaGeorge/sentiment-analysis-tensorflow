I always feel like they check me here at security because I'm a minority, but I'm always a minority when I'm in Arizona.  This place is clean and the security line goes pretty quickly.  The Southwest computers where you can print out your boarding pass is right next to security on the second floor, which makes it really convenient.  This airport is great!
