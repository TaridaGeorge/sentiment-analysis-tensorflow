Fantastic hidden gem. From the outside it looks like a little dentist office, but inside is a traditional sushi restaurant, half actual sushi bar, half sit down restaurant. The sushi chefs are authentic Japanese, and the ingredients are extremely fresh. Rarely have I found a sushi joint this far from the sea that has Ahi that has ZERO fishy smell. They are flexible with adapting if you want a custom roll. One of the chefs even turned a regular ahi sashimi dish in to a rose for me and my girlfriend. The prices are fair and they have several Japanese beers that are delicious. If you are a sushi fan, you owe it to yourself to check this place out. Sit at the sushi bar, its great to watch these guys work.
