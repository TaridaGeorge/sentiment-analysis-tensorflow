Beautiful building, tranquil atmosphere...its almost an escape from reality to visit this library! 

Throw in a good book and it doesn't get any better.

I love this place...most new books are readily available. Free WIFI, great AC... they even have passes for free admission to museums in town! And its all free!

Go grab a good book and tell them that Steve sent ya!
