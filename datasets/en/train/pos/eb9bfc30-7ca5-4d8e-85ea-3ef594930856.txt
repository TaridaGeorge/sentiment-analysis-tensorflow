My favorite Thai in Tempe!  Their Tempura veggies are really really good.  Particularly the sweet potatos.  My favorite dish is their signature dish - Lemongrass Chicken.  My friends like their dishes spicy spicy and Lemongrass does it up right for them!

If you order take out they pack things up nicely for you and have a comfortable bar seating area for your short wait.  If you order a large Thai Ice Tea to go you get it in a ridiculously large cup - a great lunch time treat that will last you through the rest of your work afternoon.

If you are there for dinner get dessert - sweet sticky rice with coconut ice cream.  Very very good.
