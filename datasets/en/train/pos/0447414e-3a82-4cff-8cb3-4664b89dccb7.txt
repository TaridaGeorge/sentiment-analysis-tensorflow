Best breakfast in town for quick & easy! I love the hash brown potatoes and the Ruben on rye is really good for lunch. Never ben disappointed. Food is always served fast and fresh.

You can also take your dog there and sit outside. They will bring your dog water and you can order a meal menu item if your dog eats human food.

Hey, breakfast with your best friend, can't get much better than that!
