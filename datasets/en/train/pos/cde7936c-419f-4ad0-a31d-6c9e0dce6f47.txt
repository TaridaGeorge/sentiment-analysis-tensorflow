Yeah, it's a chain and I'm not normally a fan of chains, but Houston's always hits the spot and I've never had a bad meal there. I think Houston's is the most consistent restaurant that I've ever been to and I've been dining at various locations of Houston's since I was a kid. Since I've lived in PHX, the Biltmore location has been my home base and I eat there several times a month. Most of the time, we come in for a late dinner and sit at the bar and let Tom and Al take care of us. These two are among the best bartenders in the Valley and will remember your drink of choice and other preferences after just a few visits.
