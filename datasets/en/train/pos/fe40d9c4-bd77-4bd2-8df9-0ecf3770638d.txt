I love lux! This place has all the things you need... Wifi, coffee, food and a bar. I have to say, their coffee is not the best I've ever had... but I give five stars because all the bartenders and fantastic and the drinks are simply fabulous. When you order a drink, it's not generic. A good amount of time and effort is put in... fresh ingredients.. drink don't just take a minute.. its a process! and well worth it. Can't think of enough good things to say!!
