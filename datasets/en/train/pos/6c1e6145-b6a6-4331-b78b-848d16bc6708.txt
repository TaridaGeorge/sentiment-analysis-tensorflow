I tried the Singapore noodles today and they were excellent!  Next time I will not ask for double curry as it was too much....not their fault....most places I order Singapore noodles do not put enough curry....that is not the case here!  Service was fast and friendly.  Noodles and a water $9.75 plus tip.
