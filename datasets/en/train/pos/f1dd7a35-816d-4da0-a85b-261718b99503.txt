Really Great!
Extremely nice staff!!
Amazing hours! 
Loved the chai tea w/ espresso (great flavor, not sweet!).
Made to order sandwich (mine: tuna fish, egg, tomato, avocado, spinach, provolone, on wheat = so good!).
Free wifi (wasn't slow like some places!)
I liked the music videos.
Desserts look great (Going to get a chocolate chip cookie soon!)
2 big couches, 8 tables, plenty of electrical plugs, + outdoor seating out back! If they get busy, they really have plenty of space to bring in a few more tables.
It is really easy to miss this place when driving by; it is in the middle of a little strip of stores. Front parking is very limited, but there is a big side parking lot. 
~enjoy!
