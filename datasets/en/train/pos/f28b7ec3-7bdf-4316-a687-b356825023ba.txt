Hey guys :) 
so I really wanted some featherlock extensions and couldn't find them anywhere!! Finally I found out that the Life Spa at Lifetime fitness had them. Random?!? Yes. I found a couple other places but they were too expensive. So I decided to give Life Spa a chance. I was reluctant because it was in Life Time Fitness and not an actual Salon standing alone. Anyways I really liked it there. I saw Jessica. She was GREAT! really friendly and easy to talk to. I had my hair colored black and got some featherlock extensions! I LOVE it! I wish I had some more feathers but I just couldn't afford it yet. other wise I would recommend it!! Ask for Jessica!!
