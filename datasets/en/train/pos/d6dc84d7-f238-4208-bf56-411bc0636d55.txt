This is the location I signed up at and although it is not the closest to my house it is the cleanest and newest location. The place is fairly large and offers more machines that the one closet to me. 

At times yes it does get busy at peak hours but it tends to not be too bad and dies out quickly . I never have to wait for a machine and there isn't too many roid junkies screaming and scaring people. The staff is nice and always helpful. It is clean and seems very new still, I always see a cleaning person there cleaning in the evenings. 

This is my gym of choice and go out of my way for this location everyday. Some other locations close at night on the weekends but this one is open 24/7 365.
