Hi, I really like to drink!

Top's is pretty much the best liquor store ever.  They have nice employees and a bitching selection.  I'm pro-any place that is pro-drinking.

They also recognize that ball-point pens don't write very well on hard counters, and they have set up a taped area that allows one to sign a credit card slip in peace.  Top's is tops in my book.
