I LOVE TOTAL WINE! 

I come here often when I need to stock up on my favorite kinds of liquor - the prices are pretty good and the selection is so vast that I always end up buying more than I wanted to. Another good thing is that people don't give you dirty looks if they happen to see 3, or 4, or 5 bottles of alcohol in your hands :p In fact, they might look at it as a good thing! 

One thing I really like are mini bottles of alcohol that they have. SO CUTE!!!
