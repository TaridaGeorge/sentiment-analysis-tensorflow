Ok, now that the weather is cool(ish), I've had the veggie pho about a half dozen times. Some days the broth is better (more richly flavored) than others, but its always good. The noodles, mushrooms and green onions are great, as are the fresh bean sprouts, jalape√±os, and basil. My not request would be to throw in some cilantro too. Everything is better with cilantro. All in all, I still live this place. Love it a little more for take out than dine in due to spotty service, but the food is awesome.
