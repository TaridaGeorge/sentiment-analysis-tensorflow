Chef Beau McMillian is one amazing chef! He left me with one of the most memorable dining experiences I have ever had. The lobster bisque was fantastic! The seafood platter had the biggest shrimp I have ever seen. and the peanut butter chocolate dessert was sooooo glorious! Not much more I can say but wow! fantastic food and and great service I can't wait to go back:-)
