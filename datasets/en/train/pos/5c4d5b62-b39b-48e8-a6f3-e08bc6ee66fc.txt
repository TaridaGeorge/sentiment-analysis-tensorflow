1. They offer Rogue on draft.
2. They have umpteen billion different pasties.
3. It's not in North Phoenix or Glendale (read my reviews of places in those locations) so you are almost guaranteed to not dine next to redneck, lifted truck, white trash.
4. Service is really friendly.
5. Great soundtrack.

I wholeheartedly recommend it. I can't say anything that hasn't been said already so I'll leave it to that.
