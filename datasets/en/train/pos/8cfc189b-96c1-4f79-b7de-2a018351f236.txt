Copper Star is my go-to coffee joint. Their coffee is great, their iced tea is great, and their sweet treats are great.

The GIANT rice crispy treat is gooey and buttery and delicious - just like it should be.

Nice counter staff & baristas. The owner is super nice too.

Can't beat the location and the price - and the free Wi-Fi. 

Also the band that plays on Sunday mornings is AWESOME!
