I booked an appt here for a blowout and hot tool style just before my maternity photos.  I arrived slightly early.  Very cool atmosphere. Sexy and swanky.  My stylist (Candie) was ready to go right at the time of my appt.  She was courteous, efficient and my hair looked so fabulous by the end of the appt! This was my first time ever getting a blowout and I'm afraid to say they may have hooked me into a new addiction.  It's been 3 days since my service and my hair STILL looks good!  My photographer showed me some teaser photos and my hair looked awesome in all of them.  

Thank you Primp & Blow!
