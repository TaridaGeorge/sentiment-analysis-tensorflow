Amazing ice cream. 

Anyone visiting the Scottsdale area should try this ice cream joint.  It has interesting flavors and the service is great. 

Upon arrival the employee told us that we can sample.  So, I sampled.  It'll be hard to explain considering their flavors are unique and infused with many different ingredients in different combinations. 

I opted for the pint.  7.50 and you can mix two (or more but it was suggested that two was the maximum mix) flavors.  Mango lassi and Peppermint was my choice.  

The Mango Lassi tasted almost exactly like a mango lassi beverage you can buy at an Indian restaurant.  Peppermint was mixed with real peppermint canes.
