Great atmosphere, informed bartender, unique specialty beer selection...but most importantly, the burger was outstanding!  Every once in a while, I  need a good, juicy burger.  I have tried Delux, Blu Burger, and Indulge.  In terms of a sirloin burger, this was the best!  My husband and I split a burger with point reyes blue cheese, and bacon on his half.  We ordered the burger medium and it came out cooked perfectly - still pink in the middle - and it was not greasy.  We also had the half and half side of regular and sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries were wonderful - even my husband thought they were good an he doesn't even like sweet potato fries.  Overall, it was a great dining experience.  My only recommendation would be to add Bison to the menu.
