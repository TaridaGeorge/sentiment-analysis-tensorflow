Brought 5 homesick, cafeteria overloaded students here last night and it was fabulous. We had at least 12 rolls including the spider, caterpillar, and sedona, and the sushi was fresh, delicious, and beautifully presented. We also ordered off the menu, and my udon was great. The broth was flavorful and delicate, noodles not overcooked at all. The sushi chef was really quick banging out our orders (I guess we looked hungry!) and I was just very impressed how neatly it was presented AND good too. I guess I have been to too many sloppy sushi restaurants and am a little fed up with so-so efforts. I know that this will become one of our go-to spots whenever we come to Tempe/Scottsdale.
