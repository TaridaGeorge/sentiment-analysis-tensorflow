I am far from a food critic, more like a foodie in training. But I do know what I like to eat....Wow, not knowing much about cheese, I was welcomed by Lara and her staff with open arms.... This was a great experience. They explained to me the different cheeses and wines during the tasting tonight.  I had no idea what a cheese curd was... And guess whos heading back tomorrow to buy fresh cheese curds??? ME!!!! I came home with proscuitto, goat bleu cheese and fontina for dinner. If your a cheese lover, this place is a must see in Central Phoenix. Its a one of a kind place that has huge potental. So go, show some love and eat some cheese!!!
