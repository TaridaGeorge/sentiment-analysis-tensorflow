One of my favorite restaurants!

Absolutely the best Italian restaurant in Scottsdale in my opinion.The food is of excellent quality, fresh, deliciously prepared and healthy, and is presented beautifully and simply, with attention to detail. Try the Bucatini, its out of this world!  The wait staff really knows how to wait tables -- they're respectful but friendly, and have perfect timing. And considering the quality and quantity of the food, the price can't be beat!
