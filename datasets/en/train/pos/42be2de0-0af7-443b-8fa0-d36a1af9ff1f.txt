This place has the best tandoori chicken that I have ever tasted. It is so flavorful... They also have tandoori spicy chicken wings that I recommend. I have never had problems with their service like some of the other reviewers. Some might think it is a bit pricey but my motto is that you can't put a price on good food.  I love their garlic naan. Their chicken saag is also very good. Everything I have ordered here  has either met or exceeded my expectation. The menu is ala cart so if you want rice then you need to order it on the side but they give you a lot.
