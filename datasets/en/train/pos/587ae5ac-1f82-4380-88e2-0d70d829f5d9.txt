The service from Unique is excellent, I stopped calling another shop in town as they were impossible to get on the phone. These guys took care of me.

I went in to have my seats upgraded, the factory seat cushions were terrible and they did a great job in adding more foam but keeping the seat shape. We had a small part that broke on the side of the seat, but they took care of it with no hassle. I have no hesitation recommending the shop to anyone.
