I had a pierogi craving and this place hit the spot.  Our waitress (who I assume is one of the owners) was wonderful.  Very pleasant, helpful and polite.  She was sure to make us feel welcome, which I liked.  

This food was exceptional.  Stuffed cabbage was excellent, bigos was delicious, and pierogis were the best!
