I was not really a fan of the cupcake, that is, until I tried the cupcakes for Butter & Me at the Citadelle Plaza's Twilight Farmers Market.  The Owners enticed me with their beautiful presentation: desserts and cupcakes in glass and attractive serving pieces and she wears this adorable cupcake apron.  I bought a sampling of all they had to offer and thought maybe my daughter would appreciate the cupcakes.  My husband ate them on the way home from the market!  The following week, we got our own (no sharing!) cupcakes and they are light delicious and not too sweet, which is the best part to me.  It's become a family addiction.
