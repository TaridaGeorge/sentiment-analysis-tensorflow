This place is just magical.  The garden has thousands of desert plants and Cati that you've never seen before or could imagine exists. It really takes you into a different world.  The landscape goes on for miles, with all sorts of winding trails that makes you feel like your on an adventure hunt. The staff are super friendly and helpful.  I've gone during the day and for the flashlight tour... Flashlight tours are really different and put a little adventure into finding animals in the dark, but defiantly go during the day time to be able to enjoy all the pretty blooming flowers.  If you are a photographer you will never want to leave.  If you live or are visiting the valley do yourself a favor and visit..
