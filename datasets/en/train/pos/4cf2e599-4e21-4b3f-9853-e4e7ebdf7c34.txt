I think there are enough reviews for everyone who has not been here to figure out what a great restaurant this really is. This was a recommendation from a fellow yelper, and I am eternally grateful. 

I might suggest changing the name to House of Treats which is exactly what happened to my palette with each bite I took. 

The flavors and combinations were unique and delicious. Everything that everyone in our party ordered was devoured and thoroughly enjoyed. A fine dining experience. I have never had the opportunity to try ricotta black peppercorn grits ~ YUMMY. 

I would love to return on a night when outdoor seating might be more completely enjoyed. 

The only negative is the REALLY small size of the available indoor seating area. It could not accommodate a group larger than 5 people.
