What a gem! All the positive reviews are spot on. Since the weather has finally reached the time where we can take advantage of sitting outside, we did. Not much of a view @ nite, but the patio is very nice & well-appointed. But the food/libations are the start. The shrimp scampi won't disappoint. Very flavorful sauce, a bit of a spice which was very nice. Zesty clams in white sauce was a hit, too. A lot of options on the menu from pastas to flatbreads to pizzas and salads. And the beer offerings & wine list are impressive as well. The place is owned by the same people who own Sacks & they take great pride in their culinary offerings. If you haven't been here, make it a priority! I know we'll go back, and often.
