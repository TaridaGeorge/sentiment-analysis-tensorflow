I LOVE this Fry's!!  Why can't the Fry's at the corner where I live be just like this one??  Why can't it also have a:

-bulk section where I can buy chocolate-covered ginger and coffee beans, and glazed pecans?  (Granted, the prices of these items are SIGNIFICANTLY higher than the prices at Whole Foods.  Yeah, bet you didn't see that one coming!)

-a lounging area complete with leather couches, a wide-screened TV, and an attached dining area with nice-looking dining furniture and hutches?  

Even the gourmet deli, cheese, and bakery sections are "jazzier" than the one at my corner of the world!

Now if you'll excuse me as I'm going to have to visit my Fry's customer service to fill out some request forms...
