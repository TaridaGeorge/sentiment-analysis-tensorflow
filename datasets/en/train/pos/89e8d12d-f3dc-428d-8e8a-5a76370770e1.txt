When I consider the one food that I would eat, barring all others, the Jalpeno Cilantro Hummus with pita bread is the one. It has everything going for it: great flavor, protein, carbs, etc... We used to make special trips here to get this as a take out. The pita alone is worth the trip! You must try this.

Each location is always busy and loud, but the service is almost always busty and prompt. I'm not kidding, each locations has the same servers, I swear!
