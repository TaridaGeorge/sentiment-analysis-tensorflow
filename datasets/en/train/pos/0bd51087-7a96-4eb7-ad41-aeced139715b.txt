Went here for a work function today. What can I say, this place is awesome! A great variety of meats all cooked to perfection. My favorite was the bacon wrapped filet, yum!

Nice salad bar with good variety as well, instead of bacon bits, they have a bowl full of uncrumbled bacon.

Lastly a slice of cheesecake with strawberries, mmm.

Simply awesome stuff! Taking the wife when I can.
