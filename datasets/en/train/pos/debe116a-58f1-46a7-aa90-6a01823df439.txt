Have just been once because we just got a puppy and were having him looked at.  They were very friendly and helpful. The vet seemed very happy to be working with my dog, and gave me a lot of information. It's an older building so it may seem a little run down, but I didn't get any feeling that anything was dirty or unkempt. Very happy to be taking my puppy there again.
