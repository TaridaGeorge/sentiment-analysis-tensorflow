Yes, can I get a latte with those brake pads and new inner tube?  Cool.

Seriously...cool.  I can get my bike fixed and have coffee and a scone while I wait.  I'm going with cool here, all the way.

I tried Trailhead after they posted a Groupon offer on a bike tuneup.  Checked them out on Yelp and went for the deal.

Cool.

This is one of those bike shops that doesn't make you feel inferior if you don't roll up 200 miles every weekend and have the names of your regular peloton tattooed down your calf next to your scar from that wicked road rash.  Cool.
