We stayed at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch during spring break and had a fabulous time. We ate at SWB for lunch and enjoyed it so much we ordered dinner that evening to eat in the room with our kids. My husband ordered me the chocolate caramel tart which turned out to be one of the best desserts I've ever had. I tried looking for the recipe and couldn't find it so I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. Surprisingly I received an almost immediate response from the hotel that they would let the chef know. Within a few hours the recipe from the chef was in my e-mail with additional tips! Now I call that customer service. We loved the hotel and loved the restaurant. Looking forward to going back someday.
