Nigiri sushi, this is usually why we go and have sushi. This places nigiri is amazing. The finest cuts of fish, the best edamami (if that is how it's spelled,) and the greatest service. 

I know that it is in a lackluster mall. There is not a huge air of pretension surrounding this place. And it is definitely not trying to "keep up with the Joneses." This is EXACTLY why I love this place!
