This is a really great library and probably the best in Phoenix! Among the beautiful architectural elements, this place has a pretty descent selection of books and music. There are different levels of the building that gives a great separation. There are lots of areas that allow you to sit a read all the different books. There is also a really cool teenager room that provides a cool hangout for all the young folks. Haven't had any bad experiences yet. Overall a great place to go!
