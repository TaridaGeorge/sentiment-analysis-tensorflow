So I must comment on the great service that I received from one of the Sunflower Market managers, Tony, a couple weeks ago.  I was overcharged for a couple of items.  I understand that it can happen but I didn't realize it until I was almost home and my daughter (a 2yo) needed to go potty so I couldn't just turn around.  I called and explained my situation.  The gentleman on the phone (maybe Nick?) was kind and understanding.  He said I could come see Tony the next day.  I went back and met with Tony.  The store was very busy and needed him but he was prompt, kind and courteous to me and my situation.  He was able to reverse the charges for me no problem.  Although I wasn't a regular customer before that situation, because of the great customer service, I have been back TWICE.
