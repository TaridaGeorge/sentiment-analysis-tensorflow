The best dang coffee in town and is my preference for a jolt of caffeine hands down in scottsdale. The chef is amazing and always goes out of her way to say hi and make sure you are happy with your food. If you want good food and a cup of Joe that is good and not the typical corporate burnt Starbucks bean, then try Jolta Java!!
