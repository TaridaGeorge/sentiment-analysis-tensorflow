Yupha's was featured on CHECK PLEASE, ARIZONA (great show on PBS) and we love this restaurant! This is our "spicy Thai" restaurant, and it never disappoints! Recommended: the papaya salad and the Pahd See Ew... both are better, and different, than I've had anywhere else. You can't go wrong with whatever delicious specials their chefs have created each day, and their teas and desserts are always wonderful too. AND, even better, they are just doors down from the Tempe Cinema's (the Tempe $3 movie theater), so you can have a gourmet dinner followed by a movie just steps away. ENJOY!
