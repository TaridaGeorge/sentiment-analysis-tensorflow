Come on, it's Chick Fila, how can you not love it? I eat here at least 3 times per week (sometimes 5 if you count the stopping just for ice cream). This place rocks!! I like the fact you can get Coke Zero and Diet Dr. Pepper. The spicy chicken sandwich is my new fav menu item. If you get waffle fries, I suggest eating them at the restaurant or while driving. Don't wait till you get home as they go from excellent to soggy pretty quickly.
