If you think all smoothies are the same then you have never tried Robeks!  When I worked in the Biltmore area I used to get their all fruit smoothies for lunch all thie time, but now only go every once in a while.  I stopped in with my son this morning and was soon reminded why I loved this place.  It is owned by a super nice couple who are always really friendly when I come in.
