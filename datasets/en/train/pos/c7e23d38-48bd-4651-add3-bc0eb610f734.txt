I wandered down after ordering at Yupha's; happy to see that someone had moved in the bakery again - I had a sample of the carrot cake cupcake and it was all over - picked up six cupcakes but at least I had enough willpower not to eat before my Panang dinner - had the peanut butter cup one first - actually tasted like a peanut butter cup (which isn't always the case with 'peanut butter cup' desserts) - nice thick, tasty frosting...
