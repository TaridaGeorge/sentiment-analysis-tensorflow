I've been working with this gym awhile.. I recently just recovered from a broken wrist and brenden have worked with me very well in making up my own work outs or incorporating different exercises in lieu of others for the WOD. I fully recommend this gym to anyone who is interested! If you are big or small or "think" you are fit come check this place out!
