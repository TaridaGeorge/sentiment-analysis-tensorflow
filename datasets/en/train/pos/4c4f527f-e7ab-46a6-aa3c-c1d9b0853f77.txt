Be seen in 30 minutes or less guaranteed?? I would have never believed it but Yes its true, I was in and out within 25 minutes with a thorough evaluation backed by a doctors 100% assurance.

I'm so thankful that Lindsay L. recommended this place.

Dr. Trang was wonderful, the staff and office was much better than any urgent care facility Ive been to, it just had a totally different feel to it.

I felt better immediately just knowing that an actual certified M.D specializing in internal medicine had taken the time to treat and diagnose me properly, and  all in 30 minutes.
