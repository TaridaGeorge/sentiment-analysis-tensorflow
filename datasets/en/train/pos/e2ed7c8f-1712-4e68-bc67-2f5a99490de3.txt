I ended up here a few weeks ago in the ER for a migraine that made me go blind in my right eye and my stomach sick with nausea. I have to say that I have not been to a hospital in YEARS that made me a priority or took care of me so quickly and sympathetically. The staff, especially my nurse, Ellen?, took such good care of me. The CT scan techs were professional and caring. My doctor, Dr. Sworen, was very thorough and listened to me. The facilities were clean and everyone simply amazing. 

My bill ended up to the tune of $6000.00, but you cant put a price on good care, great bedside manner, and piece of mind that I was in good medical hands! 

Thank you John C Lincoln hospital. You calmed me, treated me, and made me very grateful for your services.
