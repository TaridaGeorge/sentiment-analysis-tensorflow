This place is really great if you have a small dog or a cat.  Not only do they try and feature either local products or sustainable products but their prices are reasonable.  The owner does a great job knowing the details of his products which really helps if you have no idea what you are looking for.

My favorite part of this place is that they have a sale section where you can get some amazing deals.  We got our dog a rain coat for Seattle for only $10...and it is made of recycled water bottles!  How cool!
