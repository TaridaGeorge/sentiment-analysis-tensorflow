After picking my mom up from a l o n g cross country flight from NY one morning, a hearty breakfast was first on her list.  I took a look at what my fellow Yelpers had rated high, and nearby.  Harlow's Cafe came back loud and clear!  

My mom had the super sized, ultra delicious Belgian waffle.  It of course came with butter and maple syrup.  As for myself, I went with the regular stack (5) buttermilk pancakes.  These hotcakes were easily 1" thick if not more!  I always come prepared with a monster appetite, but sadly, I was defeated by the flapjacks in this semi eating challenge.

To sum it all up.  The meals were both giant and delicious, the bill total was under $20, and we left the cafe happy campers.
