I am SO SAD this closed! Their food was delicious and prepared with great care. My favorite breakfast in Phoenix...I too hope that the new owners will take care with the menu and perhaps ask how the previous owners made the home fried potatoes! I hope they closed to start a new adventure...Abundant Success to you!
A perfect corner for Live Music...we are looking for new hang outs for happy hour, hoping 4th Ave and Fillmore will be IT!!! Big Band Music would be AWESOME!
