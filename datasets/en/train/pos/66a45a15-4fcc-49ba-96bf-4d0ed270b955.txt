This bar is fantastic. I love the staff, and the people. I have been in there daytime and at night. I love, the food! I think its nice to find a neighborhood bar where everyone knows eachother, yet they are friendly to the new people. Gena, by far is my favorite. She is a great bartender and she knows how to make things happen!! I wish I lived closer or I would be there all the time!!
For now Ill settle to have my burger, (best. THING. EVER.) monthly instead of weekly!!
