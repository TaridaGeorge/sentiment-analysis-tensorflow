My boss asked me to find someone to clean the office windows (about 50 large panes) inside and out, so I got in touch with Brad.  He was very professional throughout the experience, and his mastery of this craft is phenomenal.  The windows were crystal clear within a few hours; he did a very thorough job.  Punctual, efficient, and easy to work with--his rate was very competitive, and his work is worth every penny!  The office looks brand new.
