I took my sister and 14 month old nephew here while they were visiting.

This is such a cute place. Lot's of grass and gazebos for picnics and parties. Cute gift shop, snack bar and playground areas.

Train rides for the whole family and a carousel too!

You don't need a kid to come and enjoy this park, pets are welcome too! They'll even let you bring your dog on the train!

5 stars because I'll be back with my dog!
