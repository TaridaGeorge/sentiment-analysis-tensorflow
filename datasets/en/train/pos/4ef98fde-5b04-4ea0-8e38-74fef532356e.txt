Upscale Thai food.

The restaurant is very nice and clean.  The owner came by and made sure that we were happy with our meals.  My wife and her friend got the Tofu spring rolls.  They said they were very good.  The "peanut sauce" didn't taste like peanut butter (which is very good) and had a nice bite to it too.

Yellow curry with Tofu (uber spiced) was very good as was her friend's eggplant (also uber spiced).

My Musaman Short Rib had GREAT flavor...only problem is that there wasn't more :)
