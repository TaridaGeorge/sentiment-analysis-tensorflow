i've been taking both my dogs here for over 2 years.  they're great about fitting you in, and have long hours and open on weekends so it works for people who work.
we typically see dr. watson and really like her.  she's great with the dogs and they're very comfortable around her.  the office staff is great.  they are always helpful when i have questions.
they also have something called pet portal.  it allows you to keep up to date on when your dogs need a visit for shots or whatever.  you call also use it to schedule appointments, and then the office calls you to confirm.
