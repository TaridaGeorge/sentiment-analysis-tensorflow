This place is great. I have two bunnies, and I had called all over for prices on spay & neutering. Every place was quoting at least $130 for just the neuter, and as much as $200 for the spay. I was worried I wouldn't be able to afford it, when I came across AZ Spay & Neuter Clinic. It only cost me $58 for the neuter, and $70 for the spay.  
I was nervous about the quality of surgery with a price so cheap, but it has been two weeks since I took my bunnies in, and they have not had any problems at all. They haven't shown signs of pain, there was no swelling, everything went perfectly and for half the price of other places.
