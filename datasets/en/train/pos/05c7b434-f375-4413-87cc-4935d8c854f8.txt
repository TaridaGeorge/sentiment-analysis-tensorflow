I  really miss this place since we moved to California. It is owned by a lovely couple who treat you as though you are their only guest even when they are really busy. The shrimp korma is my fave and my husband favors their chicken tikka masala. I can also never say no to there Aloo Gobi. Definitely worth checking out.
