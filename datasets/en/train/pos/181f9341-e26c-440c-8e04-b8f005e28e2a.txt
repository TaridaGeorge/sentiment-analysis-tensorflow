I have to say good greek food is hard to find their souvlaki and their gyro platters are the way to go!  The lady who runs the shop is super nice and she says they are a chicago style greek place.  I have not had greek food in Chi-town but having worked in greek diners, bakeries etc. They hold it down over here.  I usually order to go but they have a small seating area go enjoy this diamond in the rough.
