Fresh ingredients, one of a kind sandwiches, and accomodating staff. Don't let a long line scare you away, it moves really fast. I recommend trying the daily specials, always interesting and absolutely delicious. Large menu to chose from, or create your own. And that free cookie is a perfect sweet ending. (Vegetarian friendly, just let them know!)
