If you want a fantastic breakfast with great food and friendly service you must eat here. The chorizo omelette was to die for. The biscuits and gravy are great, as are the pancakes. Everything is made from scratch  with local ingredients. Make sure you try the organic strawberry jam. Joe is very attentive and friendly. Intend to go back often.
