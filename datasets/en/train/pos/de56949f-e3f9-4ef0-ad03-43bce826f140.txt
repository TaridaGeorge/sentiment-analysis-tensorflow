When I moved into my apartment, I couldn't understand why this adorable little restaurant was sitting empty.  My husband and I were very excited to see people working on it and even more excited when we found out it was a coffee shop.  

The staff is beyond friendly.  The assortment of drinks and their creative specials are always tasty.  I haven't tried anything on the sandwich menu, because the breakfast is so good!  My fav is the Early Bird Sandwich - egg, avocado and bacon.  

It's a great addition to a neighborhood I've grown to call home.
