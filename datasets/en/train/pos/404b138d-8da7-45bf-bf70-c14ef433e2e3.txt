Funny thing about Phoenix: you never know where you can find a decent bite to eat.

Every year my buddies and I head down for a long weekend of Spring Training and lap dances. This year I decided I'd do some research on restaurants, as we'd been disappointed way too often.

After a long night at the Candy Store we headed to Delux. I was a little nervous about the strip mall location, but then I remembered "this is Phoenix."

We showed up around 11:30 on a Sunday night. The place was packed, but they had a seat for us. The burger was awesome, only overshadowed by the incredible shopping cart of fries.
