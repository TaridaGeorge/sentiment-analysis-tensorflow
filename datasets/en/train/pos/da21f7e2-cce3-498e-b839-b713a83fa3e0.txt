We went here after watching some fancy cooking show. We inquired about a certain steak that is prepared a certain and drawn out way that wasn't on the menu. WE just happened to mention this and our waiter went and asked about it, Fantastic, So thankful this was the best dinner I have had In years! Actually the best steak of my life! Love this place!! So thoughtful and amazing that they could make this work although it wasn't on the menu!! Total kudos!
