The Wigwam gave me and my husband exactly what we were looking for in a stay-cation.  We arrived and were greeted by the bellmen; guided to where to check in.  The front office was pleasant.  

Off to our room - a bit dated, but there are plans to update within the next year.  The property was breath taking.  Even though we are in a desert, you would never know with all the green everywhere.

We woke and ran around the property...stopping at the Farmer's Market...had no idea that there were so many local farmers :)

After breakfast, off to the spa to relax by the pool and for treatment...just awesome.  We came back relaxed and ready to start our week.
