Wow. ShamWOW! It was great. As always the service is super. I was here last year and I can say this place impresses me all the time. I had the special which was a Kansas City strip. 

I started off with the iceberg wedge with vinaigrette dressing. It was nice and fresh and not too sour. Now the main dish. The steak was nice and tender. It had a nice flavor to it. The mash potatoes were good too. 

The one waiter remembered me from last year. I think it was because he saw me take a picture of my meal and I did that last year. They didn't interrupt while talking or eating with my mouth full. That is always a plus. 

I'm looking forward to next year to try and have a great steak again. I ate the whole steak and that's rare! No pun intended.
