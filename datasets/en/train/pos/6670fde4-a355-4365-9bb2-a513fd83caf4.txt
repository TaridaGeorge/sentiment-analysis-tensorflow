Good oj. Good pizza sample. The cafeteria style is kinda cool but usually it can be so busy that its frustrating! The bacon is very thick which is a great change compared to all the greasy spoon breakfast joints. The oatmeal is good and hugely proportioned. The french toast is yummy as are the simple breakfast meals. The red potatoes are great!! It has a vegan menu as well. I usually get the iced teas they have on the counter which I think are great! The service is always great and I haven't really had any disappointing visits, can't wait to come back!
