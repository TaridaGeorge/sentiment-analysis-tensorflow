I've bought a couple of packages now from Go Figure (one was a Groupon).  These classes are amazing and the instructors are all wonderful!  I'm officially addicted.  The classes are always tough and are always small.  I've had a few wind up one on one with Kelly and they are great.  If I'm the only student, then those classes wind up the hardest because I get all of her attention.  You get a full body workout starting with a warm up then moving in to arms.  You then do about 30 minutes just focusing on thighs and your seat, then finish with abs.  The classes are great and the instructors are all so friendly.  I love Go Figure!
