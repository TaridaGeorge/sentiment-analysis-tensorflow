I would like to Yelp my awesome hair stylist "Kimba". She turned my headwreck into a masterpiece. Beautiful red highlights, cute updated hair cut. The entire staff is down to earth and friendly. It was a great experience and you don't have to pay an outrageous price.
If you want to look Marvelous on a budget, you need to contact Kimba!!!!!!
Thanks for making me beautiful :)
