This place is excellent. I beats Cibo or Bianco any day. The penne vodka pasta was soooo delicious. They put bacon in it. Genius! We also had a pizza with broccoli and sausage that was very good. To start the meal they bring you flatbread and a hearty tapenade of sorts with carmelized onions, olives, capers and eggplant. It was a bit on the salty side for me but tasty just the same. They have a pretty good wine selection. The place is a shoe box so definitely make a reservation.
