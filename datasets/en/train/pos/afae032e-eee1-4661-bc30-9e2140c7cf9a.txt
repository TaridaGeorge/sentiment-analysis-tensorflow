This place is awesome, hands down! You can not beat the happy hour/reverse happy hour specials, and there is always a ton of people there. The one downside is that happy hour specials are only served in the bar area or outside, but that doesn't bother me much, even if I do have to wait a litle while for a table. Their margaritas pack a punch and they make really great specialty drinks. Never had a bad experience here, and I love the location. Whenever we want to go somewhere for happy hour, kona grill is usually our first suggestion.
