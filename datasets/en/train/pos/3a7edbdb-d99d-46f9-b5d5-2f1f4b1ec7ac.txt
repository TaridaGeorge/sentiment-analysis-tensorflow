Thanks to my friend Michelle who is on a little Phoenix vacay while I'm stuck in Tucson, now all I can think about is Fez! The Fez burger with fries and one of their amazing bar bevies is my idea of a great time. Add the fact that the service is always spot on (at least the times that I am there) and the portions aren't stupid big, I enjoy it every time I go. I wish I were there now, with Michelle who decided tonight to blow up Facebook with delicious Fez photos, but I'll wait until Lindsey F has another large event and hit up one of my faves then!
