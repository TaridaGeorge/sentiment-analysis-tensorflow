For a fast food burger, this place is TOPS! Far superior to In'n'Out, which seems to be what a lot of people choose to compare it with. I guess it's like the whole Coke vs. Pepsi thing, except with burgers. And my choice is obvious. Tons of choices for toppings and condiments, fries are crinkle-style and tasty, and the selection of deserts is almost too much! Fresh food, friendly service, clean dining room and restrooms. Food takes a little longer than say, McDonald's, but it's well worth the extra minute. Give it a try, I think you'll be impressed.
