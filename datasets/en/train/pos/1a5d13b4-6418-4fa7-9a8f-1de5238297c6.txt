We finally came back to Switch and I am sooooo glad we did.  This time we got a fantastic server, Maria, and she definitely knows how to do her job well.  She was attentive and friendly and didn't linger around or avoid us.  I had the mac and cheese of course, which is fantastic, and we ordered the lobster crab puffs as an app.  That stuff is phenomenal!  I really liked it.  It's not very often that you get actual chunks of crab or lobster meat when you order something like this at other restaurants, it's usually unidentifiable mush. I'm glad I can put Switch back up to the 5 star that I have always wanted to give them.  One more experience like the last and I will most certainly resume my near constant appearance at this lovely restaurant.
