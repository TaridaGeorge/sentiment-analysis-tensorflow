Eggplant wins! Eggplant wins!
Eating here is awesome. The man that owns this is so nice. He always gives the girls at the table a little stuffed animal. He says for the kid in  you. Im SERIOUS!

The food is fresh, crisp, flavorful.
Makes you want to eat healthy all the time!
Great for a quick lunch, it takes just the right amount of time to come out. Not too soon where you wonder if it has sat under a heat lamp all day. 

The water is good, not like some places here where you can taste the pipes. 


LOVE THIS PLACE.
WISH THEY WOULD OPEN ONE IN GOOD OLD COUNTRY TOWN MESA/APACHE JUNCTION...HINT HINT!

Keep up the good work.
I wish they would replace all Mcdonalds with you!
