This is my FAVORITE restaurant in Phoenix. Cannot wait to go back. Service, food and ambiance and price for what you get ( price fix menu) were great. The only small issue was that it was really packed with people & some of the people in wheelchairs/walkers had a tough time getting through. They even have a cookbook!
