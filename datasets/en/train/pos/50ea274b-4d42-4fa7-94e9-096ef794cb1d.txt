Camelback is my favorite workout  and outdoor activity in Arizona. It's a really tough hike but the view from the top is totally worth it. I also love that everyone is so randomly friendly on the mountain. Douchewads, MILFS, old dudes, the lady with the parrot on her shoulder (seriously, a lady climbs the hill every day with BIRD)...etc ... we are all one on Camelback Mountain. 

And it's nice to be that way every once in a while.

Better get climbing before they build a Starbucks at the summit!
