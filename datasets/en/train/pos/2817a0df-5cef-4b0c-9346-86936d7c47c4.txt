My sister and I are obsessed with True Food.  The staff is always on par & occasionally serve up some free drinks or appetizers (which are all so tasty). Our favorites are: the kale salad with chicken, a side of the butternut squash w/ ketchup & that onion/garlic cheese tart as an appetizer.  The vegetable krudite and the hummus are both great ways to start your meal.  We ordered the butternut squash ravioli by accident, and loved this dish! The spaghetti squash casserole is also amazing.  Make sure you order their housemade lemonade and also try their desserts. 
True Food is simply amazing :)
