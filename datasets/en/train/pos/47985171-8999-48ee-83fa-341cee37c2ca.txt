If you are a sandwich junkie like I was when I was pregnant, this is hands down the best place in Phoenix. I have been coming here since grade school for their tuna sandwich, but they have such a huge variety to choose from. I love seeing the same faces in here all the time and the small deli atmosphere really floats my boat.
I love love love cheese and stuff.
