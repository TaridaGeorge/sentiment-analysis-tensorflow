Five reasons that I love this place:

Mini Sandwiches: MJ bread with a little bit of heaven in the middle (my favorites are tied between chicken and tuna).

Tiny Pie: If you go on a tiny pie flight night, don't waste the opportunity, get it. Since I'm a midget, they make me feel normal sized (notice the theme of my adoration towards shrunken food).

The decor: Redone house, great picture of baby Lisa above the mantle, beautiful artwork by one of the staff members, and a totally dope patio.

The wine: great selection and the staff is happy to tell you which ones they like.

Lisa G!: I love that the owner is behind the bar, and she makes you feel like you're hanging out at her house having some wine, fun, and food.
