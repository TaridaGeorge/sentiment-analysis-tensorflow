I attended an anniversary at the Royal Palms, and was so taken with it that I booked a room and treatments... I only live a few minutes away, and I didn't go home all weekend.

It is everything you would expect from an exclusive resort. Every last detail is perfect. The ambience is intoxicating, and the service is the best in the Southwest. The meal they catered for the anniversary was above average, and my meal at the restaurant was superb. 

Tourists who are looking for Sedona-style views, remember that Scottsdale is a major city. Locals might be put off by the Southwest decor in the rooms (it's not my favorite, though still well-excecuted here). I probably wouldn't go just for the spa treatments, but they were still excellent.
