As a Coldwell Banker agent I am very careful about who I refer to my clients. Cummings Termite & Pest Control is one of the companies that I feel comfortable referring.
Recently Cummings Termite & Pest Control hired Debbie Burnett a well known Arizona professional pest inspection specialist. This was a smart move. 
I whole heatedly recommend that anyone needing a fair, honest, and professional pest/termite inspection call Cummings Termite & Pest Control and request that they send Debbie Burnett to the rescue!
