We were living in AZ up until recently, and we loved this place. It was a late-night, gourmet standby for us. Their crust and toppings are out of this world. Heirloom tomatoes, roasted garlic... all those extra little touches that come together to make something really marvelous. Can't say enough good things about the food, service, and all that good stuff...

They make their own ICE CUBES that take forever to melt and keep your drink from getting all gross and watery, but make it icy cold. Arizona BONUS!

Go. Enjoy. The grocery/gift shop next door is fun and funky. Everything from homemade English muffins (crumpets) to t-shirts printed with old, out-of-print book covers like Pride and Prejudice and the Great Gatsby.
