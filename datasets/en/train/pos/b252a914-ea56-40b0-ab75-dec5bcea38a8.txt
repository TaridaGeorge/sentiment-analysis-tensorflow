the best in Az no doubt, fresh corn bread comes with everything , the sides are huge and very inexpensive wow!!! try the spicy fries (they are not too spicy) the BBQ sauce is amazing perfect for the dry rub ribs you can make them as wet as you want..... love it ! get to know the owner Ivan he has got some great history about his business, lots of good stories, he is in there everyday everything is always perfect and how it should be Ivan gets a strong 5 stars because even if you hate BBQ you have got to give this place some play
