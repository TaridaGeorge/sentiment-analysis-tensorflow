I love Dillard's.  I generally do not buy things here unless they are on sale, which is not an impossibility, because DIllard's ALWAYS has sales.  There is also an outside entrance to this store, so you do not have to go through the mall.

I do not really like the women's section because I feel like it is not organized well, they should put up signs to show women's, teens ect.  The kids section is good, more for the boys, I think that the toddler girls (T-6x) section is LAME, the clothes look trashy.  The end section is where it is at thought, their clothes are great, they always have great deals and they have a HUGE coat section.
