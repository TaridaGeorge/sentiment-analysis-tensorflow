Amazing! A wonderful gem in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. It is hidden from the street but that only adds to the allure - it makes you feel like it is a secret and you are lucky to have found it! Once you are there be sure to try the homemade apple cider. It is out of this world delicious! Balance that with a dish of Brit's mac and cheese and you are set, it is made with those cute little shells and topped with fresh cheese. So good! What's not to love? ;)
