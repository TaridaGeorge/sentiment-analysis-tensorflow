A delicious splurge. Went for restaurant week and I think I'm going to be going back every year for the restaurant week menu. My husband and I both got the kona crusted dry-aged ribeye....my mouth is watering just thinking about it. 

Pro's:
Superb service
Mouth watering steaks and food
Attention to detail

Cons:
Price - but typical for a gourmet steak house
They really lay-on the wine suggestions, even after you decline

If you haven't gone, I think it is one of the BEST places on the list for Restaurant Week. At least go then - it's basically 50% off the normal price. Great time to try it out if you are unsure.
