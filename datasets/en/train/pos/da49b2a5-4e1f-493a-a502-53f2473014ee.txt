I cannot say enough good things about Dr. Holmes and his staff.  My dog was a rescue and they saved her life when the rescue group brought her in.  She's had to have surgery since we adopted her and the care she received was excellent.  Dr. Holmes called several times to follow up.  Everyone there is is so kind and really loves their patients.

I wish I could find a doctor who cared as much for me!
