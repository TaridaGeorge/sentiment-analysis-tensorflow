This review is ridiculously overdue... but because the cupcakes by Butter and Me are so fabulous, I'm STILL thinking about them.  They are the perfect texture, with the perfect amount of frosting, which has the perfect amount of sweetness.  PERFECT, I tell ya!

I am dying for Butter & Me to open up a store front, so I can indulge my cravings on a whim... please, please... let it be soon!
