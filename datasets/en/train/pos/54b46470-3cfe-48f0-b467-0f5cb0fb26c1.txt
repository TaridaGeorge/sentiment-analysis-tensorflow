I had a great experience here the day after Black Friday. I went in to buy a crock pot at a special price I saw advertised, but unfortunately when I got there, they were all sold out. There happened to be a manager doing some work at the end of the aisle so I asked if there could possibly be any in the back. As it turned out, their inventory count was a little off due to Black Friday craziness, but he ended up giving me the better crock pot at the price I saw advertised. Amazing customer service! I am actually moving into a new apartment this month and I'm so happy this is actually becoming my local Target location. They may have lost a little money giving me the better crock pot, but now they have my loyal business.
