Seafood Grandeur. Reminded me fondly of the great seafood days I had in New England and Boston in the past. The fish and chips (two-headed fried shrimp, fried tilapia, french fries) is so very New England. The Blackened Mahi Alexander is so creative they put shredded crawfish on top. You may choose something other as an entree, but please do yourself a favor and order the Lobster Bisque, which isn't only brisk bisque but also generous with lobster bites. You'll be full, so don't even dream of somersaults afterwards not unless you're purging.
