Just landed in Phoenix, picked up my rental car, and headed to this place to meet up with a friend for lunch. I loved this place! A seat outside at the covered bar, the warm sun baking, a glass of cold ice tea, and a steak wrap. Exactly what I needed to unwind after a long flight.

I would love to come back to this place again, day or night, for a couple drinks and more excellent food.
