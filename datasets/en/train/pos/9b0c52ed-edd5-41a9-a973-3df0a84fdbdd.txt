Thanks for helping me to find Valley Eyecare Center, fellow Yelpers!  I visited their office as a new patient and knew from the moment I walked in that it was going to be a positive experience.  The receptionist was  friendly, the office was modern and clean, and the wait was super-short (~3 mins). I was impressed with care that was provided and didn't feel rushed when working with Dr. Eric Clyde or his assistant.  The three words that come to mind when thinking of this office are: professional, prompt, and accurate.  My visit was for a contact lens fitting, so no comment on their frame selection / service.
