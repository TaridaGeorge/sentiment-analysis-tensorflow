I love Thai. It is usually gluten-free, and can easily be made vegetarian. They finally got smaller tables and are more comfortable!

The owners are always incredibly nice and love to make sure we enjoy our meals! Thai E-San has superseded ThaiRama as our favorite thai restaurant. Everything is delicious, and they are very accommodating to your needs!
