Love this place.... Anytime, me and my office buddies go out for lunch, this is the place I want to go to..
I'm a veggie person, and I just love their Thai Basil Fried rice!! 
AND... I love eating SPICY!! So, once in a while, I love taking the fried rice with the 5* spice level. Just love it!! Caution ppl, if you're having it for the 1st time, I'd recommend breaking into the 4* first, and then dig your way into the 5*...
The staff is courteous, and the ambiance is good....
Highly recommended for lunch outings....
