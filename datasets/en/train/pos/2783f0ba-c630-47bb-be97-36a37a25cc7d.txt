This is my absolute favorite resort. I've been there several times for conferences and the place is amazing! The conference rooms are very nice and roomy. The hotel rooms are immaculate with super cozy beds. There's plenty of restaurants to choose from on property, a huge pool (with a lazy river), a starbucks and, although I have not golfed there, I hear the course is quite nice too. Like basically every other JW Marriott, the staff is incredibly nice. Ooh, and check out the spa, its lovely!

One more thing, there are adorable little bunnies all over the property and it is the cutest thing. They don't even budge when you walk by.
