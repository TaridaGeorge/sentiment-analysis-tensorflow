I was totally jonesing for Indian food, and since none of my friends like Indian food, I decided to go solo.  That's always an awkward thing, but I was undeterred in my quest!

I've been to Royal Taj many times, and it is consistently good.  The naan is fabulous, the chicken tikka masala is always tender and delicious, and the palak paneer is incredible.

It's not one of those places to go if you're looking for outstanding service or ambience, but the food is always great!
