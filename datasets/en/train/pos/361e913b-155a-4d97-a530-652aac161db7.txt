I was recommended here by my new tailor when I told her I was planning a Euro trip and needed some good clothes that wouldn't kill my pocketbook.

I was very pleased with the selection that they have to offer.  They were a little light in anything below a size 42, but good quality stuff all around.  AND CHEAP!

I picked up a pair of Johnston & Murphey shoes, a Zenga 2pc suit, a London Fog raincoat, and a watch for all around $200.  Everything was in excellent condition, except the shoes were quite beat up, but nothing a reconditioning from the manufacturer can't fix!

If you are a size 44, this can be your new haven for great clothes, as racks were practically exploding with all sorts of stuff for the taking.
