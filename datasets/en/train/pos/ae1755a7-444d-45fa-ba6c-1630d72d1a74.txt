This place is BUSY!!  Every time I drive by, there are a TON of people in there.  When you go in you stand in line like at Sauce and order at the counter and get a number for your table.  My high hopes for this place started to go away when it started to feel like a chain restaurant with the same boring food pumped out to the masses...   Happily I can say I was wrong.  They use fresh ingredients by local AZ businesses!  I'm happy to support local business and will be coming back here again! 

Costa Breakfast Burrito: Spicy chorizo, bacon, cheese, & scrambled hash brown.  ... WOW!  The flavors are incredible!!  This was easily one of the best breakfast burritos I have ever had!
