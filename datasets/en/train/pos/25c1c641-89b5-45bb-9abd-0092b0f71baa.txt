This place is VERY cool!  I went here for the 1st year anniversary celebration this last Saturday.  The entertainment outside on the main courtyard was excellent!  I also did part of the tour through the museum (it is huge); it is practically impossible to take in the whole museum in one day!  This place is very well done.  The headset technology allows you to hear instruments from all around the world as you look at them physically.  The staff is polite and very informative.  There are great interactive areas of the museum as well.  I highly recommend this place for anyone, even if you are not a musician this place is VERY interesting and unique!
