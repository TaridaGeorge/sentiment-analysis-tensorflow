This place is on one of my commute routes to work, and I've been meaning to stop but always running late and settling for my Keurig at work. So glad I finally pulled it together and popped in. Service was friendly and fast. Cafe Americano was tasty, not at all bitter but very bold and gave me quite the pick me up. The barrista said they just started making their own muffins, I went for the cranberry orange, and it was great as well. I will definitely be making this a regular stop (presuming I can get myself out the door on time again, oh snooze button, I love you so.)
