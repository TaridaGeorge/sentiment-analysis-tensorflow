Diana and Ray were so super friendly on both of my visits to this great shop. It looks like a cool art gallery inside with candles and gifts for sale along with the unique glasses. On my first stop, Diana found the exact pair of frames I was looking for in seconds and agreed that they were the way to go. Today, when I took in my prescription, Ray took the time to explain all the available options and worked out the perfect plan to have them back to me within the week. I've seen Ray pedaling his bike through the neightborhood, and he made sure to stop and say hello, which made me even happier to support this local business!
