This place just feels sexy and light, with so much light in the main area, I love it. Used to be a flower shop hence the name. Have been going to My Florist for years, although not much recently. You will see many ladies at lunch time eating their salads and enjoying the good life. Lunch is busy but there is a valet to park your car, I always just go round 7th ave to the parking next to the laundrymat and walk the alley. 
A great little place to bring a date for dinner and they have piano playing at night.
A great little niche for this part of Phoenix, that holds out against mass blight and corporate industrialization--ah Phoenix--you change--but ever so slow. 
Psst-- Wait staff is attentive as well as handsome.
