Delicious BBQ! We even got a chance to meet the cook and experience his 'Ghost Chile' mash. The few of us that did try it were experiencing the 'HOT & fiery' feeling for at least 5 minutes. Thanks Tony for a great chile experience!

We thought Big Earl's best dishes were the brisket (full of flavor and juicy), mac and cheese (it's the cheesiest) and collard greens (with pig part goodness). I also loved their cornbread with a buttery topping just melted in my mouth.

Dessert was so good I was licking the plate at the end! Banana pudding and pecan & date pie with whipped cream. Pure heaven!

The service was very friendly and attentive!
