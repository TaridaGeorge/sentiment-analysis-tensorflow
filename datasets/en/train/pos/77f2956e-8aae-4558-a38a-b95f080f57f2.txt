Favorite breakfast. Used to come here every Sunday, now it's less frequent, but the food is as good as ever. We never have to wait for a table, and the servers here are all really nice. My coffee cup is always full, which is a big plus. I haven't tried any of their lunch options, but I bet they're just as good as breakfast. My mouth is salivating now just thinking of the home fries.... Ask for them instead of hash browns. They ever disappoint!
