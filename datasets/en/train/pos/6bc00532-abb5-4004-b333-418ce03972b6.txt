Probably the best burger joint in the USA. And if you select the regular hamburger, it's one of the lowest fat fast food burgers you can get.

Regardless of time of day it typically takes 9 minutes to get your meal ready. 

Personally I think their fries are poor, so I don't buy them anymore.

Always clean, ample parking, difficult to get in and out of Desert Ridge Mall.

And for the record, I quit going to McDonalds in the 1970's and quit Burger King and Arby's in the 90's.

UPDATE: I re-checked the claimed fat content of a typical 1/4lb burger without cheese and standard toppings, and I&O is still the lowest. If memory serves, next best was Wendy's and then the Whopper. I don't eat at McDonald's no matter what.
