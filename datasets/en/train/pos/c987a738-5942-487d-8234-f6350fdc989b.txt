This place has a great atmosphere - European feel, cute, quaint, not too stuffy.  Great place for a date. The prices aren't bad and the food is good, although the portions can be small.  How amazing the food is really depends on the menu of the evening, though I have not had anything bad.  Everything has been at least good, and some things excellent.  Service has also been great.  Plus, I like the prix fixe menu.
