We love this bar!  Service is always fast - the wings are great, burgers are great and my personal favorite is the honey balsamic salad with chicken.  The chicken is really good - grilled to perfection - not dry at all -- and the salad is way more then you would every expect from a sports bar:  goat cheese, candied pecans and craisins.  The dressing is simply de-lish!!!

Great happy hour specials change daily plus late night 8 pm to close specials.
