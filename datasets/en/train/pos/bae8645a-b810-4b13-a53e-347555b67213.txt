home of the infamous man v food bases loaded big unit hot dog...which we totally split! even with all the crazy fixings (and, not to mention the sheer size), this was an awesome hot dog!

but, the real dark horse were the sweet maple garlic wings! you have to try them...seriously! overall, a great sports restaurant/bar!

"BIG UNIT"!
