I came here one night when I was in Scottsdale for school. My classmates and I decided to just walk around. No doubt this place is really hidden! But once you are inside, it is actually a pretty big very dimly lit wine bar with tons and tons of options (over 1800 wines!). The waiters/waitresses are extremely knowledgable and the service was great. We ordered a bottle of Spanish red as well as olives and cheese. I forgot what kind of wine it was but it was really good. I am no wine connoisseur but I definitely enjoy Spanish wines. 

This is a great place for a date, a group of friends for a quiet chat, and even just with one friend. Very private and intimate.
