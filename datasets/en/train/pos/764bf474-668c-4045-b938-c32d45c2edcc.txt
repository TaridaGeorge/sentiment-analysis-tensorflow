I came with a group of 28 people for a coworker. We were all worried that we wouldn't see our food for an hour, but they amazed us, our food was coming out quickly and it was very good. I ordered the Shrimp Fried Rice and it was one of the best that I have had and the shrimp were rather large. They have unseated our defacto Thai restaurant and will now become of our our regular spots.
