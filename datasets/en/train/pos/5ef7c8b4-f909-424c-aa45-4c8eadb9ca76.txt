I can't say enough kind things about the people at Foothills Physical Therapy. They are patient, funny, caring, and damn good at what they do. Their facilities are clean and modern, and the staff is very attentive, so that you know you're doing your exercises properly. 

In February I had a routine shoulder surgery that developed complications and led to months worth of limited mobility and pain.
The staff at Foothills helped me keep a positive attitude and fight through it. When my insurance said that I'd reached my max for physical therapy appointments, Foothills contacted my orthopedic surgeon and together they helped me petition Blue Cross for additional appointments.

My therapist, Jennifer, has been a godsend. She's helped me heal and gotten me back to an active lifestyle. I highly recommend her (and Foothills) to anyone in need of PT.
