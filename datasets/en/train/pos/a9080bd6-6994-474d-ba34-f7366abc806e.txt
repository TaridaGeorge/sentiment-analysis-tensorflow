I really like this place. Every time I am in the staff is friendly and helpful. There is a nice variety of vegetarian fare. The food may seem pricey but the quality and freshness is there to justify it. Today I had the stuffed mushroom cap and greek salad both great. And for dessert (and all afternoon snacking) I have a chocolate truffel cake. YUMMY!!!
