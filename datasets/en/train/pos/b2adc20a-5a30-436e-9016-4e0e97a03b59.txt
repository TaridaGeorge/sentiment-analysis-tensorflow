This place is so cute and delicious! I have gone here twice so far and I always think about it. I cannot believe a place like this exists in Arizona. Since I am from New Jersey it is so familiar and feels like how as soon as I step on the property. Its beautiful and quaint. I recommend grabbing your food in a baskets and eating under a pecan tree at a picnic bench!
