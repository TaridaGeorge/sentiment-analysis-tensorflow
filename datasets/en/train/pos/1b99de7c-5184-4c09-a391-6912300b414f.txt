I had dinner at the bar last night and it was fantastic.  I did not even make it to the Main menu between the D Crab Enchiladas and the Short Rib Risotto and 2 great wines.  All I could do was take a bread pudding to go and roll out.
Simply great.  
Next time I will grab the chopped salad deal (i think its called stetson salad) and likely their stuffed pork chop.  I may have to go back tonight.

Also loved the bar spot looking into the kitchen.
