Back in Sally's good hands after several years living a long way from Phoenix!  What a capable resource that is so reliable, reputable and remarkable in her profession.  Her facial and dermabrasion produces such nice results, which is a true gift for older and sun-damaged skin like mine.  The price is right and Sally is as easy to talk to as your long-lost best friend.  Moments is lucky to have her on the team and I am lucky to be in town to see her again soon.
