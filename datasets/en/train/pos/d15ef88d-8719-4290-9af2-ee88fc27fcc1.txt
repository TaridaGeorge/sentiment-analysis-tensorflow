My friend brought me to mariscos Ensenada. We ordered two dishes to share. The grilled chicken and fish combination was $10.95, chicken was fantastic! Best chicken I have ever had in restaurants! Sea food combination was $14.95, full of goodies. The food was delicious and amount was more than we two can handle. I would like come back to try other dishes, and I will recommend to my friends!
