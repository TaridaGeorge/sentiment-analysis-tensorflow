AMAZING! im obsessed.... we have gone the past two days because it is just so magical. Love snow cones and their ice is soo finely shaved. an immense amount of flavors to choose from and also smoothies, coffee, ice cream.  Bonus though, you can order 60 snowballs for 12 bucks! How cool is that? they put them in a cooler and you are good to go for a snowball fight! We are having one tonight i will have to let you know how it goes. This place is definitely worth experiencing especially in this AZ weather
