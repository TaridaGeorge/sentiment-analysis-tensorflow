I love love love Mojo!!

Fantastic yogurt, amazing variety of toppings. Quite a generous punch card. 
This place is the busiest establishment in City North I think! I could eat it every night I think :)
The staff is so fun and friendly, they make you feel welcome every time.

One suggestion could be more variety of flavors. Seems to have the same flavors every time I go in. Toppings are always very fresh (yummy strawberries!) and very well maintained & clean!
Please consider bananas as a topping! 

One other thing is the seating is VERY limited! 1 couch (for 2) and 2 chairs is all inside. Outside are 2 tables seating 4 each. 

Thank you Mojo for always having a great atmosphere and great fro yo to satisfy my cravings!!
