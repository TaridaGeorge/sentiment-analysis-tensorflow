I recently held an event for 250 in the Grand Ballroom. The staff from start to finish went beyond the call of duty. The tables were set before the time expected. Which is always nice when your the event planner and your worried whether things are being taken care of. We went with a plated meal and the food was served hot and presented well. Everything with the valet went very smooth. 

We had several A/V needs. Swank Audio Visuals hit a home run! Ashley, Dirk, and and Paul know there trade and bring a wonderful level of customer service.
