This park had a role in why I chose this area to buy a house.  I love hiking, being outdoors,  and getting excercise while I'm at it.  There are several hikes here, which none are to difficult, but not to easy at the same time.  The hikes are not nearly as busy as Sqaw Peak or Camleback so parking or bumping shoulders with anyone is never an issue.  This recreation area is truely a gem for the Arrowhead area of Glendale.   I will be here at least twice a week while the temps remain under 100 in the valley.
