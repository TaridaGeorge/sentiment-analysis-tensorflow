It's almost like watching professional baseball players on a really nice high school field.  No matter what, you are close to the action.  One thing that stood out the most was the amount of beer vendors.  I don't know if it's a California thing or an ATT park rule but there are no beer dudes walking up and down the isle selling beer.  Here, they are everywhere and it's great.  $11 for a tall clan of Pat the Bats favorite, bud light.  Pat the Bat didn't play that much when I was there, he was probably hungover in the dugout, icing his balls down from his last nights gash slaying fest.
