We went to this place today with our friends.  I have had Indian food all over the US and without a doubt, this is the best I have had!  We had their buffet - large selection including my fav, Chicken Tikki Masala and everything was excellent.  The service was very attentive and friendly.  It is exactly what we were looking for and I would drive the hour it takes for us to go to this place just for the food alone.
Their nan was unlike any other I have tried with seasonings and butter - YUM.  Go hungry and expect now to eat the rest of the day you will be so satisfied.
