LOVE this place! I don't buy everything here - the brown rice and sugar are cheaper at Fry's, but the pork chops and Italian sausage are cheaper here, as are the canned vegetables. 

I've never had a bad experience with the employees, but if you're having trouble you have to ASK for help, they're not going to butt into your business. And that's just the way I like it. 

My adult son doesn't mind coming here to help me carry stuff, since there's always something tasty at the samples counter. Usually it's something they make that is WAY more than I'd pay for it, but getting a taste of it is fun. 

Also - the F&E pistachio gelato. YUM! Not all the gelato flavors are 100% healthy, but that one is, and it's soooo good.
