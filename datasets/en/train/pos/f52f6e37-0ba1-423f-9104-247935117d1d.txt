I love love love Delux.. Can't believe I haven't reviewed. I have never been disappointed. Delux Burger.. fries.. beer.

It's all about the buns.. soft, pillowy buns.

Then the meat.. juicy, rare, and flavorful.

Throw cheese, onions, and bacon on that bitch, and it's over. You're crazy for this on D-
