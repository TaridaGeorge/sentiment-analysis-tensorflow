I ended up here on a recommendation from a friend.. a friend whos hair is bomb..because pretty obvious Im not going to ask the friend who has drab hair! I got in within a few days.. I love Kristen.. she took time to give me pointers on my hair.. that I had lost due to anemia and a horrible bout of valley fever..I had extensions and that made it worse from a bad technique.. She gave me pointers on the best vitamins to take.. and didnt try to push her products on me.. The cute salon is run by this husband and wife team.. and because I fly free..whenever, wherever.. I had been going to my old standby salon in DC for my hair.. ahhh this is much closer!
