Had a nice lunch with a colleague yesterday.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, the service was attentive, but not obsequious.  Alexi's is an excellent place to bring a client, as it is professional, but not stuffy, and quiet enough to hold a conversation, but not too quiet that confidential conversations are overheard.  The prices are reasonable.

My only suggestion is for Alexi's to offer a variety of side dishes, rather than green beans and rice every day.
