AZ 88 is really great at everything it does.  

Burger was one of the best I've had in a long time... get it with all the cheeses, you won't be disappointed.

I like the classy drinks, but I would only go here to have a few drinks... not for a night out on the town or anything.  Place is great to go to have great food and classy drinks, good conversation.
