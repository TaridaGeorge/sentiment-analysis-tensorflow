This upscale Biltmore bar invested six figures on televisions in the bar. The drinks and food are pricey - but you're in the middle of the Biltmore. Whaddaya expect. 

The waitstaff is attractive...no...fuckin hot is a better description.

The place is pretty crowded for happy hour and during lunch but it's a great place to catch a game. 

They have three private rooms that are first come first served. These rooms are set up just like your house - you know with your leather couches and huge flatscreen TVs and the hot chic giving you beers.
