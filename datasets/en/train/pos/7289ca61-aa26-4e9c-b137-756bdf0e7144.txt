One of my favorite booksellers.  Almost always has the book or magazine I'm looking for.  Also has a Starbucks and good music section inside.  You can go in there and read a book for a while in their comfy chairs.  

The parking there is absolutely terrible though, you have to drive around and wait for someone to pull out, or go to the parking garage on the other side of Kierland.  Their cd prices are usually overpriced, if you have a membership, then you can get very good sales.
