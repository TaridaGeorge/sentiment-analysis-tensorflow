This place was awesome. I don't take 5's lightly. Price, flavor, selection, customer service is grade A.  You MUST do the Pu Pu plater.  You will not reget it.  And you MUST finish it off with the "Fruit on Ice", not sure what kind of fruit it was but it was good

There were lots of locals eating there. If I lived in the area I'd be a regular.
