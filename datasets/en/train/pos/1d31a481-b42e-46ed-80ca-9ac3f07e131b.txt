The sandwich wars are over!  Wildflower has vanquished Paradise Bakery.  At least in my mind :)

The sandwiches here are much more intricate and creative than the other guys.  My current favorite is the turkey pastrami.  It comes on a nice toasted rye bread with a mango coleslaw.  The mixed potato and sweet potato chips that come with it are just the right side.

Always clean and the friendliest service in the Valley.

Well done Louis and team.  You guys rock!
