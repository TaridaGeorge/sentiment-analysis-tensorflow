We have been going here for about 3 years now .. Everything from the food to the service is great every time.  

Our favorites are the orange beef, sesame chicken, generals chicken, and their potstickers are amazing!  

The employees build a relationship with their customers and it's nice knowing we can walk into a restaurant and they know what we want and we know we'll be treated well.
