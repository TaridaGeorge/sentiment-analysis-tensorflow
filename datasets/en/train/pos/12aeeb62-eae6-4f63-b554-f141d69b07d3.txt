This newest Five Guys opened up the street from my house about three months ago & I finally got around to giving it a try tonight.  I ordered their regular burger with raw onion, pickle, tomato, ketchup, mustard, green peppers, Jalepe√±o peppers & mushrooms.

My order was ready in a short little while, served up by the very friendly staff in a bright, clean, comfortable atmosphere, with cool oldies playing & free peanuts on the side.

YUM, YUM, YUM!!  IT WAS AN EASY 5 STARS FOR THIS BIG, AWESOME BURGER priced at $5.59.     :-))
