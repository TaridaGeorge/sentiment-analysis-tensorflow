i guess I just miss the two stores I love shopping at in Phoenix. This is another one! Vintage, vintage, vintage! I always walk away with some lovely piece of jewelry or scarf. One must visit to appreciate Chanel, Juicy, Michael Kors, Gucci, Coach, Prada, etc etc etc. A must stop when I am in Phoenix.
