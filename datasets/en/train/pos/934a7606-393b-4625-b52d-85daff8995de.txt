We are dog stalkers.  When I visit Phoenix, I really, really miss my dog back home.  We come here to watch dogs run and play.  Sometimes we even get to play with them!  I leave feeling happier.  

Aside from my selfish reasons for coming here, this place is expansive and very well-maintained.  People are friendly and keep their dogs under  control.  There are two areas, one for nice dogs, and one for aggressive dogs.
