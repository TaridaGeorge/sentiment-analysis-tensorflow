This place is a dream come true. From the pans, to the candy molds, the cake toppers and the pre-made icings, it's pure sugary-heaven. I thought I would be able to just walk-in/walk-out, but instead, I spent an hour walking up and down the aisles, determined to check everything out. 
I absolutely adore this store, and will be making another trip VERY soon!
