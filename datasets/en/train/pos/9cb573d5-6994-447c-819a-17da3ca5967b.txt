To start with, please notice that all four people who have given this restaurant 1-Star reviews are friendless Orangeheads!  With that out of the way... I stopped in to this very nice place for lunch today joined by Mike C., & ordered a Monterey Club Sandwich, which comes with a choice of soup or salad for a side.

Of the three soup choices available, I chose "Chicken Enchilada", & it was TERRIFIC!!  Then came the sandwich.  It arrived on a big pair of very fresh & tasty slices of multi whole grain bread, cut in half.  Inside was turkey, bacon, avocado, lettuce, tomato & mayonnaise.  It was also SUPER GOOD!  

Monterey Club Sandwich & soup $8.49.  Plenty to eat, excellent value, excellent table service, 5 Stars!     :-))
