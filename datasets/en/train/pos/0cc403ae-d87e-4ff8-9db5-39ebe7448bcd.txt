The most amazing soul food I've had in AZ yet!! The fried chicken was perfect and not made until it's ordered, Mac and cheese was homemade and incredible and the cobbler....delicious!!! The best part, kool-aide was one of the drinks available. You get TONS of food for not a lot of money. It is absolutely worth at least one trip to try it for yourself!!!
