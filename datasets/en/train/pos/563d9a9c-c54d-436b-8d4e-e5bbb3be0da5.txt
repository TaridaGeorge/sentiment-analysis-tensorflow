My husband and I were visting Phoenix this past week. We looked on Yelp for a recommendation for a great breakfast place that wasn't far from our hotel downtown. 

Boy were we happy we found Matts! It was Thursday morning and the wait was only about 10 minutes. The restaurant is small and lively. The service was fast and friendly. And the food was FANTASTIC!

 I got the H & C - with delicious thick cut peppered bacon and fluffy scrambled eggs. The hashbrowns were delicous and the thick slices of sourdough toast with raspberry preserves completed the meal. The coffee was also very good. My husband had the salami scramble and thought it was very tasty as well. 

Matt's was one of the highlights of our week!
