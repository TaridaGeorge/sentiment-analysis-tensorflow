I'm sorry that dude had such a bad time. I I had a great time! I haven't been to a whataburger since i was a kid. I got the patty melt meal and it was heaven! Pure bliss. And it fast. Not cold or moldy and the service wad wonderful! I can't wait to try the breakfast. Everyone should come here. How could you not after seeing the cute commercial? Whataburger can go in my kisser anytime!
