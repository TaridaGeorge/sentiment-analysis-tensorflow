Had to update...I have now had the espresso and feel I can go the full 5 on Hava... went in for a nonfat latte... perfecto... The girl at the counter was just as nice and sweet as the guy last week... and I like that patio tables outside.. I cant knock the place for where its located.. that has nothing to do with the service or java or quality...so therefore, I wont:-) froth me hava... and if Im giving 5stars... i love you!
