Don't let the looks from the road fool you.  this place is as swaky of a steakhouse as it gets.

You are paying for the top notch food, service and atmosphere.  They were so accommodating for my request for cremed spiniach and veggies that weren't on the menu.

Had their Ribeye, which was cooked perfectly, the right thickness and great flavor.
