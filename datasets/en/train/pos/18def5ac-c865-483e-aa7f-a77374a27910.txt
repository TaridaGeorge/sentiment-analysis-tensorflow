We had a private dinner in what appears to be a wine refrigerator.  The sommelier popped in from time to time to retrieve a bottle.  He wasn't intrusive and it was actually kind of amusing.  Pashminas and blankets are provided for those who felt chilly.  

Excellent seafood platter as a starter.  I devoured a healthy serving of foie gras and had a fabulous pork chop as my main.  We shared all the sides, gruyere potatoes are outstanding.  I was too full to sample the gorgeous pie but did partake of a light and tasty frozen lemon meringue strawberry dessert.  Oodles of delicious champagne and wine.  I was a bit suspect that I would find truly fine dining outside of major metropolitan cities but am happy to report I was wrong.
