I can't remember how many times I've been to Frashers....but there hasn't been a time where I wasn't 100% satisfied.
Steak is always cooked to perfection and my started is always the fried cheese & meat ravioli's:))  
This last time my friend from San Francisco suggested I taste some of his ooey gooey cake........it was orgasmic.
George...always look for you when I'm there.  Missed you the last time.  LOVE YOUR PLACE!!!!!!!!
