So I have been back a few times now, and this place is perfect everytime. Yesterday I had the ribs and the dish was amazing. This dish pulled out the heat, and I loved it. These aren't like a rack of ribs, more like boneless short ribs. I was brought out a flan after lunch and it was amazing also, a big pumpkin taste which was surprising. Easily one of my favorites restaurants in the Phoenix area.
