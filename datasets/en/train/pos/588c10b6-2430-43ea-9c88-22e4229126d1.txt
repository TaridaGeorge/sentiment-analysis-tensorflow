For $5 you really get a sparkly car wash.  I have never once been disappointed.  Of course, you have other higher end options to chose from.  Sometimes you really don't have time to stand in the sun for 30 minutes waiting endlessly while you watch your car get patted down.  So this is a GR8 alternative to have a clean car in 5 minutes for $5 :-).  

They have a fantastic deal happening rigt now: i think it's $20 for a full hand wax job - amazing - reminds me, I'm going to try that this afternoon :-)
