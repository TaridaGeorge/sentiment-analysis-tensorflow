If I could give it more than 5, I would.  Sweet Pea and I live down the street, literally DOWN THE STREET, from this bar.  We waited for it to open for what seemed like decades, praying that this was going to be the type of place that could become our local.  It has exceeded our expectations.  The atmosphere is amazing.  The drinks are amazing- every last one of them- but the margaritas are the best I've ever had.  They tasted like a fresh squeeze of sunshine that makes me happy inside.  Margarita Mondays- $4 margs AND free food?  Happy hours are amazing.  New Year's Eve last year was amazing.  The 1 year anniversary party was amazing.  But most of all, the owner and staff are some of the coolest peeps that you'll ever meet.  Go here.  You will love it.
