I've been going to Twins for about 1yr now. FYI. My profile pic is one of those hats with hair on it. Not a twins job. Lol. Anyway, I get a high and tight skin fade. They always use a straight razor to perfect it. You walk into most haircut places and ask for a skin fade using a razor  and they look at you like you have 2 heads. I have never got a bad haircut from anyone. I don't wait for a specific barber.  Never been let down. Really purveyors of a dying art.
