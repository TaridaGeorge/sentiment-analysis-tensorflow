I've been ordering delivery from this place for a few months now, and cannot find a better curry in Tempe! My favorites are the green curry with chicken, ginger mussels and the pineapple chicken fried rice. Spice levels range from 1-5 (5 please!) I have yet to dine in, but their delivery has never let me down!
