Vince Medina and his customer service make all the difference.  Appointments are easy to set over the phone or on-line and I have nothing but good things to say about my experience here at Berge Mazda.  I have been a customer here for two years since switching from another dealership and have never looked back.  I am happy here and will be a customer as long as Vince is  there.
