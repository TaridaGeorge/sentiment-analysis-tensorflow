I frequent this place at least once a week to enjoy the wonderful affordable AND low cal fro yo at Golden Spoon. I LOVE this place. They have all the standard toppings and even carry seasonal flavors like Pumpkin (my personal favorite). The fro yo does come out soft, so I sometimes take it home and freeze it so it gets icey. All this considered, it still deserves five stars. 

How can it be that we live in the scorching hot desert and there is only a handful of fro yo possibilities in the area? Of all the strip malls full of nail spas, tanning salons and every random franchised experience under the sun, why are there only a few jumping on the fro yo lovin train?
