LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!  My husband and I are regulars for the all-you-can-eat sushi and have referred just about everyone we know.  The owner and staff are friendly and provide excellent service.  The always ask about our 6 year old daughter on the rare occasion we don't bring her with us.  When she does go, she actually eats the sushi and even asks to go there for her "treat" after a good week at school.  We have been to a number of other restaurants in the East Valley for sushi and this by far is the best from both quality AND price perspective.
