In late March my dad and I went to spring training and we stayed at a nice hotel nearby. We passed by the place on Sunday evening on our way to the hotel and it looked different than something we'd find in San Diego. Later that night we go and sit at the bar. The bartender greeted us right away and offered us drinks right on the spot. No wait at all. The cool part about the place is it's informal. Customers can eat peanuts and just drop them on the floor. Even the workers were wearing sports wear. That's how cool it was. 

The food was quickly served and delicious. We spent under $25 both times visiting in the 4 days being there. Next spring training were definitely going back.
