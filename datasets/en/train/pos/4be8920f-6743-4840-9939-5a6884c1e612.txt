The best pizza in the Valley, hands down. The deep dish pizza is the best. The atmosphere is fun and charming but be prepared for long wait times because the dining room is tiny and they are SUPER MEGA BUSY all of the time!  I highly recommend the garlic cheese bread - it is an excellent starter.  The salads are first rate. The deep dish pizza is FANTASTIC!  The dessert cookie rules! The service is attentive and friendly. Its a fun atmosphere coupled with a great menu which means that you are bound to have an excellent time with friends and family.  There is a reason why both tourists and locals love this place-its AWESOME!
