Wow!  I disagree whole heartedly with the negative reviews!!!  Better than the old Blue wasabi, and more reasonably priced too!  We use to go to Pure but not after meeting the owners of Banzai, Scott and Greg.  We were made very comfortable and welcome...something most other restaurants have forgotten how to do.  We sat for hours...not rushed and enjoyed the NEW best sushi in town!  Try it!
