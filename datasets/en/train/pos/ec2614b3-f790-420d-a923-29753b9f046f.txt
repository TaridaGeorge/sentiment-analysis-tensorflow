A client had a last-minute opportunity to participate in a major trade show but the venue did not allow for hanging signage or a booth.  With one week to go, we needed a high-quality table throw printed with the company's logo and URL.

After putting a call out on Twitter, Blair and his team responded that they could make it happen.  They gave us a great price and guaranteed the throw would be done in time.  We sent a logo file, they had a proof back to us within two hours, and within a week the throw had been produced, shipped and had arrived at my client's hotel the day before the show.

I can't say how wonderful Splinter was to work with.  They were responsive, flexible and professional.  I'll use them again in a New York minute.
