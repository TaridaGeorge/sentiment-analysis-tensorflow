Woohoo indeed.  I love visiting Phoenix and finding these cute little places that are in remade old houses.  TMI has a simple menu with excellent mac & cheese and good salads.  Their beer list is pretty good, with more than half of it being AZ brews, which I definitely enjoy trying.  Also, the prices on everything are fair, even cheap.  Even though the place is small, it was not totally packed when we were there and there is plenty of parking in their lot.  They have music playing late at nihgt, so it gives it more of a bar feel than a restaurant.  Yay for The Main Ingredient.
