A family owned restaurant that has great prices, great food and a great atmosphere.

Someone mentioned that the inside is kinda "meh." But when you go into this place you will understand that it is just a mom and pops place. It has a lot of character and most importantly THEY KEEP IT CLEAN.

Their crust is always crunchy and their pizza is fresh. They are kind and love what they do. Try their calazones and their hot sandwiches. To die for.

Priced right for lunch or dinner and great to get for sport events at the house.
