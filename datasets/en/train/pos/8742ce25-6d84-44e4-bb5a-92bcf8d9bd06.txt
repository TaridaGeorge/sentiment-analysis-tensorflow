We have been here twice (fabulous both times)

I love music, and copper blues showcases great bands IMO...a band called nine ball was playing, they were super tight, played great tunes I enjoyed the gig.

I also saw another band on another night and we danced the lindy. Total blast! For me a place has to have good music and a nice look about it...CB has it.

Were there some plastic obnoxious people, yes, however it did not stop me from having fun and I won't lessen a five star rating from me either. 

Tons of brew and decent noshes round out the night.

Copper Blues, I dig ya!
Happy to add them to my 5 star list! 
Go!
