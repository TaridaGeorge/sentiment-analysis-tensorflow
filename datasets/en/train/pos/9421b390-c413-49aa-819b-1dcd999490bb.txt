Great pizza but the restaurant is hot.  Take out your ONLY option.  The crust was chewy and the sauce just right.  Great Jersey Pizza!  As a side note there is NO A/C which is why you really should only get takeout.  In he winter and more mild times can sit in small inside area or small little area outside.
