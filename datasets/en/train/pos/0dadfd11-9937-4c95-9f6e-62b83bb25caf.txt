i absolutely LOVE maxim and i have eaten there approximately 2 times a week since i learned about the restaurant a year ago.  the atmosphere is pretty awful, but the food is amazing.  i get a #86, which is a noodle, tofu, and vegetable soup (the broth is meat based).  it is comforting and cheap and always improves a bad day.  everyone i have taken there has enjoyed the food as well (though they tend to enjoy the vietnamese dishes more than the chinese ones). highly, highly recommended.
