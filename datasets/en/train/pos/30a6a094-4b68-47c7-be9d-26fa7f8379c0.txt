Decided to have a family dinner there Saturday night.  Got there at 5:00 with NO reservations for 9 people.  They were very accommodating and sat us in 5 minutes.  We had two waitresses watching over us and even though 2 in our party came in late and ordered after us, our meals came out at the same time.  Everyone in our party raved about the food.  Must say it was a great experience and we would not hesitate to go back SOON!
