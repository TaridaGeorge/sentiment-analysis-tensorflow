The best.  My 2 young girls can't stay away and it is often something special that we do when we have a friend over or have just had a really bad day and need gelato to tun it around. My girls also collect the cute flutted plastic cups that they serve the gelato in. Great place, (atmosphere is simple)  but product if superior. Very friendly staff too.
