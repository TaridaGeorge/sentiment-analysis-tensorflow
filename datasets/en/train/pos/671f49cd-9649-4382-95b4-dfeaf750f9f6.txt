Bertha's completely over delivers! What an amazing find.

Stopped next door to get an oil change and didn't pay much attention as Bertha's is buried in the corner of the strip mall. But the place is very charming and inviting once you walk through the doors. Bring colors and copper pastry case are quick to catch your attention.

Best of all was the Brioche Egg Sandwich. Light and fresh ingredients...like the sandwich could just float away. Walked away completely satisfied.

Knew it was a great place the moment I sat down and realized all he casual business meetings happening at 9am. You can tell this is where people come to impress their clients.

Local business at its best!
