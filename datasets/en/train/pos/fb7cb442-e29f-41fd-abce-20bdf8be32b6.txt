Located on the southwest corner of Broadway and Lindsey in Mesa, this little mom and pop diner is the perfect breakfast place.  Its SUPER cheap and quick and the people are always welcoming and friendly.  

My favorite is the "giant breakfast" with eggs, hashbrowns and your choice of meat and toast.  

I've had lunch here too, the burgers yes, are giant, and delicious.
