I love Mitch's and usually trust his judgment but I'm not too happy with his last recommendation (that I take my car to the Aamco in Scottsdale---see previous review).  

Otherwise, if I still resided here, I would continue using Mitch's to service my car.  How can you not love an auto shop that has a library in the waiting room?  Very cool.  And Mitch has an...interesting sense of humor.  They'll even give you a ride home, that is, if you live within proximity.  Not sure how they deal with those further out.

Aside from the lousy transmission referral, I highly recommend.
