Recently moved into a new house, and had a long list of projects to do.  Working with Travis was one of the best experiences I've had with a contractor.  He is easy-going, knowledgeable, professional, and takes pride in his work.  He was sometimes more punctual than I was (!) and communicated with me really well throughout the process.  I had several bids for the work, and Travis's rates are absolutely fair.  Thank you, Travis, for making my move-in as easy as possible.  I'm keeping a running list of projects for him in the future!
