Simply the best sandwich you will ever eat.  This place GETS it.  Customer service that remembers your name and your selection.  It's not uncommon for them to ask where your missing lunch mates are if they don't show up.

The sandwich secret is the incredible mayo/mustards they put on them chilo mayo or dijon mustard to DIE for.  Add to that the PERFECTLY toast bread and you are in heaven.

To add something special they have great hand made fresh fruit smoothies.  Not this Jamba Juice crap, but real home made goodness.  You are hand presented a jumbo straw out of the coolest serving container.  

You will remember your visit to Coffee Island.

I don't know if their coffee is any good, but I suspect that it is.  I often ask why its not called Sandwich Island though.
