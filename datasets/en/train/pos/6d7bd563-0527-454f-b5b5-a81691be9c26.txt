Don't judge a book by its cover - the outside looks like any other hole in the wall, low-quality, crap place.  The inside is so much different - very cozy and the staff is super nice!

I got the spicy orange chicken lunch combo which came with an egg roll, crab puff, and fried rice, all for just $4.50!  I'm not a huge fan of lots of breading on my meat so I was thrilled that there is a pretty minimal amount of breading on this dish.  My husband ordered the kung pao chicken which came with the same sides.  This was also very tasty and we were both amazed at how fresh and crisp the vegetables were, almost like they add them near the end of the cooking process.

Overall, best Chinese takeout I've ever had and they delivery too!
