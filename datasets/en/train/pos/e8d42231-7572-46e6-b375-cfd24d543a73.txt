I love this outdoor shopping center. I can walk around to different stores and can feel relieved and not irritated. It's a family orientated shopping center, but you can find all walks of life here. Also there are some pretty good eatery at this center. 

If your not shopping for anything, grab a bite to eat or catch a movie. Or even just bring your little ones to play at the play/splash area. It's a cool shopping center to go to.
