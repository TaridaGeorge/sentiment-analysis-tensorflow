What a great place - small funky and right on time. I love this place - its old school charm with your mama's kind of cooking - huge portions, excellent food - sloppy joes - no way - WAY!  Not fancy - but I love the tight quaint atmosphere - reminds me of a neighbor joint in Chicago. Try it - you'll lie it! Historic area of the Phoenix Downtown area. Very reasonable - and REAL food!
