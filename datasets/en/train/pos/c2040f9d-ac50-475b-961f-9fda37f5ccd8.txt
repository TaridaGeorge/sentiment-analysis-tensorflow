I've been going to this carwash for a few years now. It's a bit hard to spot out unless you're looking for it. I was referred by a local since I only work in Scottsdale. 

Consistently good service, done quickly, and always super affordable. When my girl needs a quick rinse, they have a $4.99 wash/blow dry. A full service wash/vacuum/hand dry is about $15 with all the little extras (i.e. air freshener, tire shine, etc.). 

Everyone is super friendly as well.
