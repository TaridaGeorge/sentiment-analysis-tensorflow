Hot subs, hot sauces, million mix a match Coke machine, and friendly service with a smile and eye contact.  Wow, like this place for sure.  Nice simple menu to keep things going, good choices though, including a hot veggie sandwich.

Located on SE corner of 67th ave. & the 101 next to ACE Hardware.  Can't miss it.
