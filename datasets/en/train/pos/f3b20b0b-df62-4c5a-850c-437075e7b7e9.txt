Candace and team from Arizona Taste, YOU GUYS ROCK! Food, service, professionalism, timing, attention to detail. You guys did and had it all. 

Catering service from Arizona Taste is highly recommended. I used them for my wedding reception and will be a returning customer for future events. 

Candace is truly a delight to work with. She is on top of it from planning to execution. With my venue being outdoors and no chef's kitchen, one of my biggest concerns is the common disappointment of cold wedding dinners. This was NOT the case. Everything was piping hot and delicious. AZ Taste also kindly set up a hot tea station for my guests that was perfect to keep everyone warm. 

AZ Taste did not miss a beat and should make it on every brides' short list.
