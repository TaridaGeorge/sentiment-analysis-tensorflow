we keep driving by this place thinking it was just a coffee house. but after reading some of yelps reviews, learned it was much more. it's so cute and trendy inside. they have so many yummy and healthy options, we didn't know what to pick. so we decided to go with the veggie breakfast burrito.

it was light and filling, much to our surprise. and superbly tasty. and best of all, not gigantic. more places should do that....offer reasonably priced food, that tastes great, in manageable portions. that way, you don't stuff your face with a giant food plate and then feel like an obese slob the rest of the morning. 
we'll hit this place up again for sure. awesome staff too!!!!
