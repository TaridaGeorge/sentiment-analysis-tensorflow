I love this place.  Get there early because it can fill up by 1145am for lunch.  I don't understand the reviews that seem to view that as a negative towards the restaurant.

When I worked downtown we used to go there once a month or so.  Now that I don't work there, I still make a pilgrimage a couple of times a year for the food.  

Service is always pleasant.  Yes, it's busy, but the staff always seems to handle it well.  

Love their Gyros and Gyro Salads.  The french fries are also great.  Love, love LOVE Crazy Jim's!!!
