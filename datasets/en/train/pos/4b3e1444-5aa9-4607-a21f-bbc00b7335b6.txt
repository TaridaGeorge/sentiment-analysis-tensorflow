We tried the pulled pork and beef brisket sandwiches.  The beef was as a tender as butter - no need to even use a knife.  The pulled pork was a great variety of smokines and slighly crispy ends--yum!  They have four selections of sauces and we mixed and matched to our content.  Very nice owners and definitely the best BBQ we've had in quite a while.  We wish they were open on weekends!
