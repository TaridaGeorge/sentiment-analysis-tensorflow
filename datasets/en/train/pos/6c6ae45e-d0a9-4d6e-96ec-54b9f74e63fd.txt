Laser tag is just fun.  Period.  Despite this being in a horrible location (bad neighborhood next to a biker bar) it's a great place to play laser tag.  Not sure why they always put these Laser Quest places in bad areas of town.  Probably because it's cheaper.  That's good because my "Ironman" (twice as long as a regular game) game of laser tag was only $12 and a lot of fun.  It was a full load of people and facility is huge.  There are tons of ramps, walls, mirrors and holes to shoot out of.
