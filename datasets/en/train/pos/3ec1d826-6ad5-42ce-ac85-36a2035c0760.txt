This is one of my farovite places to go near my home ~ great wine!  Their 'shrimp on the barbie' is the best!  The menu is very unusal ~ never had a disappointing meal.  The owners and staff are sooooo friendly.  Always feel appreciated when we go there . . . and come away feeling great.  Blessings to them . . . I hope more people discover them . . . sometimes during the week they are a little slow with customers . . . but on Friday and Saturday you have to go early to get a seat.  Blessings to them.  : ) KC
