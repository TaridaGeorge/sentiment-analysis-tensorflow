A trendy spot to hit up. I am not a big fan of wine, but gave in to coming here with my friend that loves wine. I hear there is a $20 bruschetta and bottle of wine on Mondays and Tuesday. Well last night (Monday) we got the $13 bruschetta (with 4 pieces you choose) and a $30 bottle of Grayson, a cab, all for $20. I mean what a deal.

Dark atmosphere, good food, good variety of wine. Definitely a great local business to support. Parking is probably the biggest problem you'll encounter.

Oh and they have a "People Love Us On Yelp Sticker"!
