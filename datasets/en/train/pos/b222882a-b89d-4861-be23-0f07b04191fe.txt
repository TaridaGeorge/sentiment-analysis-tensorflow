We went to the Sunday brunch last week and left wondering why we didn't do that more often.  Everything about the property is first class: the grounds, the food, and the service.  We ordered the breakfast buffet and feasted on shrimp, crab legs, home-made prosciutto, grilled vegetables, an omelette, and a variety of other dishes and desserts, and each was better than the last.  Our server was gracious and attentive.   Whether we're out for dinner, drinks, or Sunday brunch, this is my favorite place in the valley.
