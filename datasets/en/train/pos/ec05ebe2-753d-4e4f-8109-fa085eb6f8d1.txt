Well you would usually find me getting my hair done at sport clips, however I thought I would try something different. I was recommended by a friend to go to Amanda Banovac at pure elements and she is wonderful! Full of energy and very talented at what she does. I would recommend calling and scheduling an appointment because she books up fast. She really does help out the community by having people leave with a smile and regain confidence just by the fantastic work she does with hair! I will definitely be back no question about it!
