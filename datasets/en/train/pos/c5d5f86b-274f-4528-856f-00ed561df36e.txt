Our experience at Seasons 52 for lunch today was excellent.  I had the Ripe Plum Tomato Flatbread and my guests had the Lemongrass Salmon Salad and the Grilled Chicken Caesar Sandwich.  Each dish tasted delicious and was presented creatively and beautifully.  The service was excellent.  

It was hard to believe that each dish had fewer than 475 calories and that the Seasons 52 is part of conglomerate that owns Red Lobster and Olive Garden.
