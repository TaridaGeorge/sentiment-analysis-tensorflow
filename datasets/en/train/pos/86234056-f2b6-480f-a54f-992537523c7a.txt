This office is so friendly and welcoming! They are great over the phone and in person. Dr. K really cares about peoples' pets and is available to talk many times over the phone. Otherwise, he calls back right away. He is very detailed and asks questions and has been very helpful with our cats' issues. I would definitely recommend this office to anybody!
