Now they have a small grocery section near checkout so you can wander through the food selection and have some vanilla frozen yogurt! Why does a furniture store always smell so good!!!
They did away with most of the self checkout lines and now have more associates at the registers, which speeds up the process a little. 
Returns still quick and easy.
