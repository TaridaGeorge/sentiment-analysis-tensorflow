I recently started working in an office building next to the Ladybug Cafe office. A few of my coworkers would occasionally eat at the cafe, so I tried it one day and fell in love. The owners are always very friendly and helpful and the menu is fairly diverse for a small office cafe.  There are several healthy and very tasty food options. I usually grab lunch there once a week. I tried the vegetable soup last week and it's pretty much the best vegetable soup I've ever had. A little bit spicy with a wide range of vegetables. I also always grab the fresh vegetables in the fridge to add as a side to my lunch.  If you're in the area, I suggest trying it. It's kind of out of the way, but I think it's better that way. Kind of like a hidden gem.
