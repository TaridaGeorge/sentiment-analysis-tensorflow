Helen (the owner) knows a lot about the food she sells.  Sometimes I'm in there too long talking about the variety and options, because my guys are picky and so am I.  She knows about the companies that make them, etc.  They also have great supplements, homeopathics, etc.  She also gives recommendations on good local vets that other customers like.  And they have great prices.   I also buy those little bulk cookies from the bins (some are wheat free and that's what I want).  Now for the admission on my part, I am on a healthy no sugar, wheat free diet (just like my babies) so I indulge in these little cookies myself.  My guys have to fight me for them.  Seriously.  They are yummy to all of our tummies!  I tell myself it's okay because they shouldn't have too much grains.  Ha.
