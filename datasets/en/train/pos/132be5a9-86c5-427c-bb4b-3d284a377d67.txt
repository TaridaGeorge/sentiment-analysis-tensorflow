We just ate at FnB and loved it!  We had a ring side seat and was able to view the grill as the chef cooked...it was exciting...but a bit warm:)  We had a burrata salad(type of fresh gooey mild cheese) and a savory pana cotta salad...both were unique and flavorful.  For the dinner course...the past was excellent although not house made, had loads of fresh interesting mushrooms and house made ham and a pork chop over corn that was juicy and delicious.  We were pretty full but we ate the chocolate pudding with salty cream and enjoyed it.  Must have reservations...this place is small and fills up quickly.  The wine is nice as they serve all Arizona Wines.  Enjoy and support this nice local place!
