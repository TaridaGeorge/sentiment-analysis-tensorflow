I love the "hi" and "bye" when you enter and exit the store; not because I feel welcomed, particularly, but because I appreciate the business model and human psychology behind it*... it's a prime example of GREAT leadership and well-thought out business practices coming to fruition. 

Also, there are always cops there (which I think is a great thing), it's very well-lit, and it always pretty well-stocked. I also really love the ice selection (one of which, in a certain part of Texas, is called "Snowman poop". Seriously. Denton, Texas.)

And, Thomas, it means QuikTrip. Durrrrr

*In retail, the more effort you exert in making individual, verbal contact with a customer, the less likely they are to vandalize, steal, or otherwise decrease the bottom line. Also, it increases the consumer's confidence and trust in an organization by giving a face to the relatively faceless mass that is corporate America.
