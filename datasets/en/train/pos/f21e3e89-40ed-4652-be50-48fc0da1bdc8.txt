I don't know much about rating food, but the food here is so decadent that it gives me stomach aches afterward, which I guess one can take as a sign of high quality.  I think it was the super creamy sides that did me in but they're phenomenal.  The atmosphere was great, and the open windows letting the breeze in were a treat in May.  We were with a large group in one long table and the combination of the loud music with restaurant chatter made it difficult to make conversation, but I think everyone preferred to stuff their face with cream corn anyway.  Also, you can dress fairly casual, despite the tuxedo'd waitstaff.  My husband had on shorts and nobody kicked him out (five stars for that alone).
