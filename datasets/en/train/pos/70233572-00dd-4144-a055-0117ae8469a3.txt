Good BBQ, great price! I got a full slab of ribs, 2-meat plate w/ brisket & hot link, 2 sides of coleslaw, potato salad, and apple cobbler all for around $50. Their coleslaw is the best, I think they put apple slices - so refreshing! And their desserts have a homey taste to them. Service is also great. I needed help carrying my trays and the lady behind the counter came out to assist.
