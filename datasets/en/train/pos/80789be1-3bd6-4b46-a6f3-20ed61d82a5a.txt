I LOVE this little restaurant. It's very clean and bright and the service is top notch! The food is always so fresh and smoking hot when it hits the table and most importantly? It's delicious!! My husband loves the Pho and I dream about the Crispy Lemongrass Chicken. The potstickers are great and so are the spring rolls. 

Pho Chandler really is one of my favorite local restaurants. 

And I can never say this enough: Please support your local businesses! They appreciate your business and it shows!
