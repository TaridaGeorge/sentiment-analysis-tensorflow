I have been to a Brazilian steakhouse before and this one was just as good as the one I went to in DC. The service was outstanding. The food was unbelievable. All the meats were good but my favorite was the filet mignon. It just melted in your mouth! I am drooling just thinking about it. We ordered a bottle of red that was so good. It went perfectly with all of the meat we were eating. How we had room for dessert is beyond me but the hot molten cake and the tres leches, wow!  The cheese knots were addictive and my waiter even snuck me a little box full of them at the end of the night. I will definitely be going back again.
