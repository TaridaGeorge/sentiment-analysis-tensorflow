I have to say, I really enjoyed having dinner here the other night. My girlfriends and I wanted to hit up somewhere close to home for some good food and drink. We did not expect our evening to be so enjoyable, tasty, and fullfilling. We enjoyed a bottle of wine, some apps, salad, and wedding cake!! The portions were generous and full of flavor. Come to find out, this place has been here for 25 years. The 2 sisters were our servers, super friendly, and their Mom was the cook, super quick!  Hard pass up on showing appreciation to a great family owned business!!!!
