The staff made me feel welcome from the moment I stepped in the door. Clean, bright, positive, new technology - everything about this place and the staff is great, especially in comparison to my bad experience at another office recently. As a new patient, you'll get a tour and actually be introduced to everybody. I was offered bottled water and even got to pick a movie (with headphones) while my procedure was being done. I am a wimp when it comes to dental visits, but there was absolutely no pain during the x-rays, exam, and cleaning out a tooth that will need a root canal tomorrow. I am hoping this five-star review won't be filtered out by Yelp - I really had a good experience at Foothills Smiles today. Dr. Jarvis is now our family dentist.
