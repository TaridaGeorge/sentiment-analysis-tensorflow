What to do on a 110+ degree day in Mesa? Salt River Tubing!! I came here with my future roommate and it was a wonderful way to bond! We drove up here grabbed some tubes and floated away on the river!

One time the river started going too fast and these rocks ended up hitting my legs! Definitely got some bruises. What would have been better is to link the tubes together and wear sandals (I ended up borrowing my roommate's to steer and paddle to avoid rocks). It was incredibly fun none the less!

Tip: Bring String and sheets to link your tubes together. Wear sandals. Bring sunglasses and a hat (that you don't mind flying away). Also! Bring a cooler with refreshing drinks!
