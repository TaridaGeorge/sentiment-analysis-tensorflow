This is my absolute favorite place to hunt for first edition Dr Seuss books. The owners are so very kind and everytime I go they have no problem helping me dig through the childrens books and they always know off the top of their head just how many Dr Seuss books they have so we aren't looking for no apparent reason. 

I'll always have fond memories of this place providing me with my very first 1st edition Dr Seuss book ;}
