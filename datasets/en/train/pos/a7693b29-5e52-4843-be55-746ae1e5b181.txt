Since my first visit during an Arizona Hispanic Chamber of Commerce morning mixer two years ago I have been hooked. This is my favorite place to work/chill/whatch the wheels go round and round. I've hosted many customer/prospect meetings here. 

At any given moment you can run into any manner of high-level politico or business leader. The atmosphere is relaxed and welcoming.

My favorite blend is the Sumatra. Best blend in town in my opinion. My boys love the smoothies. I appreciate the knowledgeable and personable baristas.

I have never had trouble securing covered parking in the structure just west of the shop. Access is easy.
