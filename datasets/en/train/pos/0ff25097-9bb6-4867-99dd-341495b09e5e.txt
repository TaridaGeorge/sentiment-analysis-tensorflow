A couple weeks ago the clutch on my Mazda 3 started going out. So I looked here on yelp and called around to a couple of the higher rated shops. When I called Tim late in the afternoon (very close to closing time) he still was willing to listen and give me a quote. He was one of the few shops that gave me the time it would take and broke out the labor and parts costs. I was still calling around but couldn't find a more affordable quote so I called Tim back and setup my appointment. He was very friendly and helpful and had it all wrapped up when he said he would. Car has been running great since. I've got an older Sentra that needs some work and I'll be looking to bring it in here to be looked at. Good shop and nice people.
