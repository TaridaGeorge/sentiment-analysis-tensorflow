I've searched the world for the perfect pepperoni pizza.  I've searched it over and over again.  Damn it man!  I've wasted my life searching and searching to the farthest corners of the earth to find that saucy cheesy meaty delite!  Only to find that my favorite pepperoni pizza will always be Barro's,  a restaurant just around the corner from where I grew up.

I loathe you, you tasty cheesy bastards...oh, and can I have a large pepperoni to go?
