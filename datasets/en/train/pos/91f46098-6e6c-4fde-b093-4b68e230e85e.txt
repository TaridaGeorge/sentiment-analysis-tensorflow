I just love this place. Whereas many coffee shops are commercialized and fast paced, just like their coffee, Solo Cafe' is intimate and welcoming. For me, no other coffee shop actually captures the European experience. Great vibe. Amazing lattes. Beautiful surroundings. Besides, when I saw  the Hunter S. Thompson like mural on the wall, I just knew it was a keeper!

Grab a coffee, bring your lap-top, or a book, and enjoy one of the hippest coffee shops around!
