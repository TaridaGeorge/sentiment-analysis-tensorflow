I love this grocery store. Nice, friendly staff and a large selection of everything. Three things to note:
1. The beer section is fabulous. They stock my favorite beer from the midwest and I swear I am the only person who ever buys it there.
2. Their made-to-order cakes are fantastic. Go for a lemon filling. So amazing!
3. Bonus having an attached Blockbuster, just in case you are in between Netflix discs.

I have a had a few problems at this store (like the time the bag boy turned my custom birthday cake on its side to get it in a bag!) but they have made up for it every time with their stellar customer service.
