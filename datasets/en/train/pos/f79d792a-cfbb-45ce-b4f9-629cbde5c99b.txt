Cannoli's. People, if you even THINK you know what a good cannoli tastes like, then you are sorely mistaken. Romanelli's hands down has the best cannoli's I've ever had. 
Ridiculous! 

The people who work here are so extremely friendly. I dropped in yesterday at 10 minutes til closing and I wasn't rushed at all. I ordered 2 sandwiches, a pound of the macaroni salad and made my way to the register. 

I noticed they were all out of cannoli's but the lady behind the counter had 2 made up for me, THAT's customer service! 

If you ever find yourself over by Metro Center and want a sub or even some baked zitti or lasagna go give them a whirl!
