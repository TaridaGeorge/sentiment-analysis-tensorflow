Some restaurants you can go just for the food because eating is the point of having a restaurant to begin with.  Smashburger takes this experience to a new level.   You'll love what they've done to the traditional burger joint.  The atmosphere is unique and delicious.  The food is edgy, hip, and inviting.  Wait ... switch that.
