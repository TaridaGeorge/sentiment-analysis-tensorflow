Was a great joint-
I usually go to fair trade coffee down town PHX, and I must say I enjoy here better after 1 trip.

The Lil orange hair lady was kind and my coffee was yum!

Macaroons, yes please!

Music that most can listen to was being played and some books were available.

Go here to relax and yea.. Go
