Kevin is so honest and helpful.  I always get a real upfront cost.  I've had plumbers come where it feels like a game on their bidding and he doesn't do that.  His prices are fair and justified.  I feel comfortable with him in my home and he doesn't give me creeps like some of the other guys I have had work on my house in the past.  I would HIGHLY recommend him and will use him whenever I need him.
