Went to FEZ last night 1/27/12 before a show at the Orpheum. The parking lot was full but eventually  found metered parking on the street just south of the restaurant .  

Everybody we came into contact with seemed nice and genuine (Host and Server).  

The food was tasty tan-tan chicken sandwich crispy panko chicken breast with a baba ganoush spread, green olives, oven roasted tomatoes, spinach and bell pepper aioli on ciabatta.  I think a good ciabatta bread could make just about anything taste good though.  My wife got the fez kisra flat herb bread pizza with grilled chicken, spicy honey molasses bbq, red onions, spiced pears, cilantro & manchego cheese, very tasty as well menu says serves 1-2 people I think it can easily serve 2-3 we brought some home. Glad i finally made it to Fez and will be coming back.
