people are totally missing the point here. 

AWESOME COFFEE!!!

john is delightful to talk to and makes a smokin cup o' joe
great to hit up at least once a week for the jewelry sales
also there is a small library in the back. yes. library
you can borrow books by signing them out but 
be kind, bring them back.
clothing is cute, nice array of hand mades and vintage
art rotates with first fridays
cute little patio
clean bathroom
what more could you want in a coffee house?
oh that's right...spoken word. ;P
