The crab cakes are the best outside of Maryland!!!

They are all crab, real blue crab, not that stuff spelled with a "k". And there's no filler either. They also have great crab soup and crab dip. The sliders were excellent as well.

Every time I visit the Phoenix area, this is one of my stops. It might not be the fanciest of places, but you will get some of the best food and some of the coldest beer I have found in AZ. The people working there are some of the nicest around.   

Also, I love that the woman behind the bar calls me "Hun"... Makes me miss the east coast....

Oh yeah, if you like whole blue crab, you can get on their email list, they let you know when they get them in fresh!!!
