Oh Sabuddy, how I love your delicious, authentic food and friendly staff.  The mint tea is perfect without any sweetening. Hummus is good and always has a lot of tahini and olive oil in the center. The lentil soup is why this place is legend now in Tempe.

The schnitzel is my favorite dish. A sesame and paprika covered chicken breast pounded thin and fried with love, served on top of marinated vegetables, rice, salad and hummus. My last visit was with some co-workers and all four of us ordered the same thing, and I got one to go.
