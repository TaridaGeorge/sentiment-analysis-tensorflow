My boyfriend took me to Roka Akor for my birthday this year, and I have never been there before. I love it! i liked how the restaurant was decorated, all the staff was very nice and approachable, and have some of the freshest sashimi! The first time I came here, they brought us the sushi of the day, and with fresh sea salt which they freshly scraped off this huge rock, that was very cool. everything was cooked right. i got the lamb cutlets, the meat fell perfectly off the bone. was delicious. the service was outstanding. I have no complaints.

now they have happy hour from 5-close we always stop and grab some saki or even a saki-sangria or two :)
