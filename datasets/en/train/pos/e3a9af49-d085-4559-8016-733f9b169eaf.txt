Eastwind is great!  If you are looking for good, fast, and cheap lunch or dinner this is the place to go. They have awesome lunch and happy hour specials.  They have a large menu that includes sushi. I like how you just walk up and order and they bring your food to you.  Also the lunch waitstaff is suuuuper friendly and nice.
