Don't let the young, hip, judgmental people that go to Lux deter you from trying it. I took my mom to lunch at Pane Bianco and we decided a midday coffee would be proper. My mom typically drinks decaf (*hipster gasp*) coffee drinks for health reasons, and her decaf mocha was delicious. They put a nice lump of homemade whipped cream on top, by request... dessert in a cup! My cappuccino was also very tasty with a nice, well-rounded flavor. I can't forget to mention the zucchini-walnut bread either, YUM!

I can't imagine myself getting any productive work done here. The music is loud (albeit, good) and it's usually packed with people. However, it is a good place to sit down, enjoy some company, or just people watch while sipping on some roasted goodness.
