I've been going to Ted's for 10 years. It's the best grilled hotdog place in the Valley. The lines are always long, but they get you out surprisingly quickly. You can watch the grill person as the cooking is done. I love it! The buns are fresh, the dogs snap at you as you bite into them......heaven.
