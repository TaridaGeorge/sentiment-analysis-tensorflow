My wedding flowers were seriously nothing but AMAZING! 

I had a budget and Amanda figured out how to get use of every penny of it! It looked like we spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on our wedding when we didnt at all! 

Our wedding was HUGE and Amanda was totally capable of handling our flower load! 

Let me break it down for you

35 Centerpieces...yes 35.

NINE bridesmaid bouquets! 

NINE groomsmen botineers! 

ONE super amazing grooms boutineer! I mentioned to her that my husband loved suculants...and on his wedding day she found a itty bitty one inch big suculant and put it in his boutineer! 

ONE bridal bouquet that was simply breath taking! 

And dont even get me started on the flower arch for the gazino! It was dripping with flowers! 

LOVED Amanda! Loved her work! Loved her creativity! LOVE LOVE LOVE her!
