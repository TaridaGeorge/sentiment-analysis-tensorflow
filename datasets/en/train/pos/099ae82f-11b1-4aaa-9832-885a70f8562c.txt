How can the best Dunkin Donuts I ever been to be in Phoenix?  I have never met a friendlier staff.  Not like the Shell/DD in Hartford, damn you people in Phoenix are nice.  Got my iced coffee to perfection (even made sure it was so...) Boston Cremes, aya it was so good.  I went back for more (of course, I'm deprived at times) and a manager took over when it got busy, but even had time to chat to me.  Grace under 7.30am pressure.  Fucking unbelievable, but then I'm used to shitty service so what do I know.
