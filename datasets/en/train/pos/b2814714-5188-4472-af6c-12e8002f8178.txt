The weather has turned and Casey's is a great place to hang out on a perfect Arizona afternoon. This is why I love Arizona, when the heat brakes, it is just great to go out on any day and have drinks at Casey's. Call in sick people on a Tuesday and go to Casey's, sit on the patio and have a few drinks, it's awesome.
