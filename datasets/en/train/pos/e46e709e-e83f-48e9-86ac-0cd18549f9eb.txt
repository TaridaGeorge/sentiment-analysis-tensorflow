My husband and I were in for dinner tonight and I am compelled to share how wonderful our experience was. Even though they were very busy and we did not have a reservation, the hostess sat us at a wonderful table. Our waiter, Ricardo was excellent and right on spot from recommending perfect wine choices to not allowing us to enjoy our courses without pestering us. Too often waiters must turn over their tables quickly so seat another grouping. Not the case here. We thoroughly enjoyed a leisurely meal. We've been here a number of times, always with the same excellent food, excellent service. The chocolate souffle accompanied by vanilla gelato...to die for! It was a perfect ending to our evening out.
