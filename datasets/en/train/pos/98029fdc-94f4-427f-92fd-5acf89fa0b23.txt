I've been to District a few times over the past couple of months while working on a project in Phoenix.  This is NOT a hotel restaurant by any stretch.  I've eaten in tons of hotels before and this is leaps and bounds above.  From the local draft beers, to the great menu and original entrees, to ending with flavored cotton candy, it has never disappointed.  Nice bar area and the restaurant seating ambiance is ok.  You won't be disappointed.  Recommend the 3rd st Salad and the Organic Salmon.
