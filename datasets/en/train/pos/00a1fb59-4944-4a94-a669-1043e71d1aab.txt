This is the best coffee in the valley, oh so smoooooth.    Friendly people working here who I suspect are required to ask about your day but they do a good job acting interested =).    

I stop by here every time I hit the St Vincent DePaul in the same parking lot.    

Support the local guy, down with "big bean"
