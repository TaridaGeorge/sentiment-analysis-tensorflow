Amazing, I've been there several times. I usually get the #9 Pho w/ brisket & tenderloin and the egg rolls.  The broth is slow cooked daily. The herbs are fresh and the pho is delicious.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  I live several miles away but it's worth the trip even though there are several pho restaurants along the way.  Plus there is a great bakery and market nearby to walk around after dinner. They also have delicious tea (hot or iced) which is a nice break from the usual soda pop.
