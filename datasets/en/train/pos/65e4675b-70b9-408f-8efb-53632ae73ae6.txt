The staff was friendly and helpful ( printed us directions to a nearby mall that had a Dick's Sporting Goods). The food was all outstanding...we had chicken nachos, the BBQ sauce they used on the nachos was really tasty. I had the Poke Stack which was fresh and the wasabi/soy sauce had the perfect amount of kick, my wife had a summer salad with grilled chicken that she said was excellent. I sampled 2 draft beers, a local brew (Four Peaks Kilt Lifter) which was pretty good and an always reliable Smithwicks.
