Best pizza in Surprise, so yes that's as good as it it gets!  Great pepperoni pizza, nice crust, great flavors, and they give you a large amount of pizza.  A large is actually a large here.  I mistakenly bought 2 large pizzas and have enough for 2 days.  
I love the pizza here and great specials on wings and pizza if you need to feed a small army.

I only have one wish, offer delivery???  I would get pizza form here more often, but it is a drive for me.  I am accustomed to pizza being brought to me, just seems like a normal business practice for pizza now.  

So if that did not make any sense they do not deliver.  You will have to go get it or sit and eat.
