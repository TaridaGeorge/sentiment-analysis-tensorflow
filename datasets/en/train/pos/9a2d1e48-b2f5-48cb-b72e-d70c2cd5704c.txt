4/15/2012      So glad we found this store while exploring Scottsdale. My boyfriend and I went in before a round of golf so he could try the new Taylormade Rocketballz driver and one of the guys said we could check it out as a demo. Had to show driver's license and they imprinted his credit card and we got 2 clubs for 48 hrs. Ryan got the Rocketballz and I tried the new Cobra Amp which I bought when we went to return the clubs. I hit the Amp straight and farther then my old driver. Great customer service and huge selection of shoes, clothes and everything that makes golf fun.
