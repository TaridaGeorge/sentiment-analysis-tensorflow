I went to the Orpheum Theater last week (to hear Barack Obama speak).  This place is amazing!

The venue is so beautiful!  I would love to go back to see a theater production .  It would be a great place to get dressed up and have a classy, romantic evening with a "significant other".

I'm not sure quite how to describe the style... kind of a Spanish Renaissance... the place is immaculate.  Go check it out!
