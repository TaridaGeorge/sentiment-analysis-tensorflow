I really like this place! Their salads and sandwiches are really good and the employee's are always really nice, which I love. Sometimes I can be one of "those" customers, always changing stuff around. Each time they are totally fine with it and don't seem to mind. I appreciate that! Plus they give you a cookie with your meal... who doesn't love that?!
