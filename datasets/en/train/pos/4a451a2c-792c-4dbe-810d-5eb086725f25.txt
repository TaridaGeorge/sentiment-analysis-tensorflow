Crazy Otto's is a family tradition.  The omelettes are good (order the half order - I beg of you!), the bacon is great and the pancakes are fabulous.  We usually order one pancake for the table and it's more than enough.  They are quick with the coffee pot which is a big plus.  In addition, the staff are really nice.  I once saw the owner be super nice to a little boy that was being berated loudly by his Mother...the boy was just being a kid and she kept yelling at him to sit still, be quiet, etc.  David offered him some crayons and a coloring book while he waited which was very sweet.
