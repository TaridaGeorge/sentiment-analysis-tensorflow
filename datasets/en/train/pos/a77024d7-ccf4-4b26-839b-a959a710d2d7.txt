Our server Michael spent more time at our table fully explaining everything on the menu then I have seen in who knows how long. Our first experience at Eddie's House was awesome! I love how there are half portions available on the main menu items. The food was delicious. The wine list was appropriately sized. The restaurant was full, yet not too loud. I cannot wait to return to Eddie's House!
