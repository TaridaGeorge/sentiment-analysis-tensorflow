Some of the healthiest and tastiest food on Mill Ave. I love the selection of food and how often it changes. Breakfast or lunch, it's a great place to go. 

The staff always greets you with a smile and is more than happy to tell you what they have..what it is..and what its made of. Their wraps, muffins, tropical couscous, and soups are so tasty. 

They have great low-cost coffee too! Forget the chains...Eat & Drink local.
