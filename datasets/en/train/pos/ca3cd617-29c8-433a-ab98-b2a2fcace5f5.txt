I am so grateful to finally get a Wildflower in the neighborhood.  I love all the pastries there, and their hot breakfasts, soups, salads, sandwiches, and pastas hit the spot throughout the day.  Service is brisk when you order a cook-to-order item: order at the counter, sit down with a color-coded table sign, and a serviceperson delivers the food to your table in minutes.  I haven't noticed a big lag in wait time, even at peak hours.   Best of all, because of the quasi-fast food setup, it's a setting you can feel comfortable dining in whether alone or with a group of friends.

A big con: the convergence of Pei Wei, Wildflower, and Pita Jungle make the shopping plaza this location is situated in a nightmare to negotiate through during lunch hours.
