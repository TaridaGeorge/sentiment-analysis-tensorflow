Can I get a wha what?  This place ROCKS!  I like Thai food and eat alot of them but this one really is awesome.  I have my favorite foods that gives me an idea on how good a place is by ordering those my first time in a place.

Chicken and eggplant is fantastic.  Their sauces are really well seasoned and has lots of depth.  Pad Thai is always great.  Service is amazing but food really is awesome.  Chicken satay is fantastic with the peanut butter sauce which is mixed just right with other spices.  Yummo!

Check it out!  

I seem to find myself there almost every week.  :-)
