Impressive this place rocks! It oozes of luxury and service. From the moment you step out of the car. The valet guy opens your door and parks it complimentary. It is a short walk from the hotel to the spa. As you enter in the spa, there is a calming, relaxing aromatherapy scent that puts you at ease right away. 

There is a host to show you around the spa. I am still raving about their cactus fruit drink and they have afternoon tea. It's a great place to have a girls weekend.
