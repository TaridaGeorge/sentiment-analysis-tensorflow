We were in town visiting a friend this weekend and he took us to Razz's for dinner.  He insisted on sitting at the chef's table and that was clearly the right move!  Razz is entertaining, personable, and presents each couse to you as it arrives.  

I can not speak to the a la carte menu, but the chef's tasting experience was great!  They keep bringing you small plate courses until you cry "uncle!"- which we finally did around the 9th course.  Yes, I lost count.

I started with a sidecar cocktail and it left much to be desired.  Once we switched to wine life was good.  We had a halibut course with ginger that was to die for- we all agreed that it was the best one!

When we are back in Scottsdale we will be at Razz's again!!
