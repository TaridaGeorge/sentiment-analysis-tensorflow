My wife and I both grew up in the Arcadia area but now live out in North Scottsdale. We had driven by Kitchen 56 a few weeks back and decided to try it out. We arrived on Thursday the 30th of May during happy hour. The appetizers were really great and such a low price. We had fish tacos, short rib tacos and fish and chips. Really really good, the service was very good and the server was very friendly and knowledgeable. Just loved the place!
