I like this place! No, I really like this place. Shopping is my hobby and Biltmore offers the stores I want, without the crowds. My kind of place!

Saks? Check

Macy's? Check

Cole Hahn? Check

Apple? Check

Polo? Check Check!

Plus, the restaurants and deli shoppes with free wifi and the mini park in the middle add to the feast. Don't forget movie nights in the summer and yoga classes on Sunday. 

Great central location too. My only concern are the closing of certain stores and what is coming next.  Stay tuned!
