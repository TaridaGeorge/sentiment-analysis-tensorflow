I'm so glad that I finally found a replacement for my old nail place!  After being disappointed with the service at the old place, this place was a breath of fresh air.

I got a fresh new set of pink and white tips.  I told the them exactly what I wanted and that is exactly what I got.  It was only $40 for a set on brand new white tips.  That's not super cheap but it's not expensive either.  They didn't take too long either.  They look great and I will be back.
