Bloom Design and Landscape was referred to me by several of my neighbors and friends who had used them in the past.  Bloom was professional and fun to work with - they listened to us and built a backyard that we always wanted.  Their price matches their quality of work.  We highly recommend them - and I thank my friends for their confidence in telling us about them!
