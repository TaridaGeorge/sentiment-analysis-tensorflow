I love to see a concert here. It's pretty intimate for a general admission place, you can go up to the front and get up close to the rock stars. I've seen a lot of metal bands here, Static X, Type O Negative, BuckCherry, Nonpoint, and Ween. I'm still ticked at myself for not going to see NIN and Alice in Chains there.

If you like to go to a concert and actually move around and get into the music, it's really fun. If you like have your own seat and just clap at the end of each song then you should head to Dodge Theater.

On a cool side note, I met my wife for the first time there.
