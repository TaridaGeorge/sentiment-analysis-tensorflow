This place is adorable...

Great atmosphere great food..

The waitress wasn't the brightest...almost seating us 3 girls by another table with 4 loud girls....once I saw where she was headed I immediately asked to be seated in one of the many other open tables..

Besides that a couple of pizzas and a bottle of wine later...I was pretty much enjoying the good life..
