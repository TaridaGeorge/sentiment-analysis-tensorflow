i love, love, love lux coffee.  can't drink it there as the place is always too packed.  could sit on the front patio but it's tooooo hot right now.  so i take it with me which is fine.  their coffee is the best in the valley as far as i'm concerned (ok the LGO spanish latte is also dang good).  

i have learned to embrace the multiple body piercings as part of the extreme coffee deluxe picture.   that coffee, it's enough to melt a girls heart.

the chocolate chip cookies were incredible at one time.  don't know if they still are.  the woman who used to make them had her mother or grandmothers receipe.  as for the rest of their heavenly offerings, haven't had a bad calorie laden snack there yet.
