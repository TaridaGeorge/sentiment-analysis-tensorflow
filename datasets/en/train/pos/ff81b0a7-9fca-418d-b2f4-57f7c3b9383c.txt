Everything here for lunch was amazing.  Great eggplant parm sandwich (recommended by the waitress) on that saltimbocca bread.  One friend had a sausage sandwich and another friend (vegetarian) had his usual, caprese sandwich; both raved about their food.  Price is right at about $9 per sandwich.  Too bad they don't serve pizza for lunch; I'll have to come back some time for dinner. We didn't have any problem parking or getting in (maybe a 10 minute wait for lunch, not bad), but maybe we just got lucky. I also really like the setting in an old house.
