Totties is one of the best. I have easily eaten there 20 + times (mostly for take-out) and I have not been disappointed. Tottie Rolls are fantastic and one of the highlights of the menu with a variety of flavors and textures in on delectable package. The Thai Noodle dishes do not disappoint and the Pho is a great create your own adventure. As a general rule, the Thai and Vietnamese dishes are better than the Chinese dishes. The prices are generally very reasonable (from $9-$13), but for me the Tottie Rolls have become a mandatory $7 addition per visit making Totties a bit more expensive for me.
