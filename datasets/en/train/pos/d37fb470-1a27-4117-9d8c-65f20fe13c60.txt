what a cool place to hang with friends.      i LOVE the vibe.      indoors or outdoors, this is the kind of place i enjoy spending time.     i have had both lunch and dinner and the food has been tasty & savory.  (great sweet potato fries)

the staff has always been friendly, quirky, & efficient....

bloody marys on sunday mornings are a good call and there is often jazz on sunday afternoons.
