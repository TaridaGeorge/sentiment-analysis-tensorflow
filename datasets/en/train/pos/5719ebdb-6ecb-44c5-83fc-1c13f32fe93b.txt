I'm not a fan of chains. I far prefer to find, and give my business to, new and interesting local fare. That said, there are a couple of chains I like and one is Texas Roadhouse.

Texas Roadhouse does two things really well: steak and portions. I can go to a Texas Roadhouse anywhere and get a well-made ribeye at a very reasonable price. It made not be "fork tender" or the same quality as a $50 ribeye, but it'll only cost me $18 and I know it will be far superior to any other, more expensive, chain steakhouse. But before I get that steak, I'll get peanuts, bread, salad, and sides. So I'll likely have half a steak for lunch the next day.

Like I said, well made steak and portions. I'm good with that.
