I looked all over yelp for an affordable dry cleaner with good reviews to take my maid of honor dress to after my sister's wedding. Some dry cleaners in the valley quoted me as high as 15.00 to clean the dress and I just couldn't see spending that much being that I may never wear it again, but I couldn't justify putting it away dirty either... Then I found Seville! For 2.50 they spent 5 min going over every inch of the dress with me pre-treating stains, and then dry cleaned it. Now that's worth it to me! :) I have found my new dry cleaner! Thanks yelp!
