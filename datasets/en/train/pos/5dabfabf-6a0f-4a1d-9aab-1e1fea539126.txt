This gem is a great piece of wide open space for North Valley residents or visitors alike. Trails are well marked, the routes are not especially difficult, and there are several points and lookouts in addition to the mainstream summit.  

I like to park at the traffic circle edge on the West side of the Park, where Eastbound Coral Gable dead ends & turns South on 12th.  There are no Gates to lock your car in and the homes make it a safe area.
