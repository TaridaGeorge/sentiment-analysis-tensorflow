My sister introduced me to Thai Basil couple years back and this has been my go-to spot for some Thai flava.  I am giving this place five stars because the food is good to me and throughout my years with Thai Basil- it has never failed- dishes are quite consistent. 

Cute little restaurant in Bicycle Plaza, clean, service is ok- pretty good for an Asian restaurant. :)

I love the Spicy Noodles with chicken, papaya salad is what I always order, tom yum soup (need more seafood ;), the lunch plates are delicious and you get a little bowl of soup before your meal.  

I've been to other Thai restaurants but Thai Basil is the one for me. 

I highly recommend Thai Basil to first timers as well...if you have never had Thai food- try out Thai Basil- you'll love it...if not like.  I promise!
