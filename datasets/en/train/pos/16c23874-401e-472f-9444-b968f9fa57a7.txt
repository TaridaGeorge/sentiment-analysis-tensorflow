This place is FAB. I loved the landscaping  and decor around the pool area the best. Beautiful, cozy little seating areas scattered around a couple of unbelievable pools. Palms, flowering shrubs and vines, fountians running, fire pits, benches and tables and  (my favorite)...covered "Cabannas" with day beds under them! The perfect place to lounge by the pool and enjoy a meal from the great restaurant on site or read a book and relax. Check the website for great deals not available elsewhere. This place had me wishing I could stay longer! I will go again!
