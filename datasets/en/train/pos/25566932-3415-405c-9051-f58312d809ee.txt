Great atmosphere. Really wonderful seating, I particularly love their booths. The price is very reasonable, and it's even great for a vegetarian to boot! Phoenix restaurants aren't always the best for my dietary choice, but we ordered the nachos here and they were more than willing to make them without meat for us. The last time I went, we went on an appetizer binge, sharing it amongst the table. We said we wanted dipping sauces and we got every house sauce they had. The waitress was incredibly attentive and the food was great. This quickly became a regular spot for me in Phoenix and will continue to be so. Do yourself a favor and go to the Vig Uptown. Get the Vigan Wrap and dip your fries in everything they have to offer!!!
