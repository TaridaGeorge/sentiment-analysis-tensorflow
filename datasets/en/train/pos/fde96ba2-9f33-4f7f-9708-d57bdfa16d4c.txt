Been going here since high school and now my kids love it too.  Can't find better bread period!  The place and menu are pretty simple and kinda plain but the bread is to die for.  Everything that goes on it is sooo FRESH!  Nothing better than fresh shredded letucce that is crunchy on a classic sub.  An insider tip, they call their Italian dressing 'bug juice'...don't let that scare you.
