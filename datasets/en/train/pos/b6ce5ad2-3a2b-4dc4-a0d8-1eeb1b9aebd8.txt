Thank You SO Much Jacqueline!!!

Our friends enjoy Lucky Strike and wanted to have a little get together for a Birthday. The group consisted of more than 15 people. The two lanes were more than enough for all of us. There was a great seating area just behind the two lanes we reserved where the few that decided not to bowl were able to relax chit/chat and of course enjoy an adult beverage. 

The wait staff floated through the many lanes with ease which was much appreciated. I almost forgot to mention the fact that there were NO KIDS ALLOWED after 8:30pm!!!
