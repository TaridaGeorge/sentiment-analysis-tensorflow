Love this place! I live 20 minutes away, but my girlfriend and I go there at least twice a month.

Hula's has a great patio/bar atmosphere. They serve 4 different fish (and tofu) cooked 5 different ways. Tonight I had the Mahi with the Macadamia Nut crust preparation, which comes with a spicy mango salsa, sticky rice and coleslaw (which has something in it that makes you ask yourself how they make it!).

The restaurant is right off the Light Rail line and perfect for casual dinner with friends. Oh - and you have to try the sweet potato fries... yum!
