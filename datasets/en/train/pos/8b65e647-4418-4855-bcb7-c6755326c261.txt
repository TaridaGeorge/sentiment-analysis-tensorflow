Kelly has been doing my hair for over 2 years. She is an expert, and so much fun to talk to. It's obvious that her goal is to make her clients look and feel their best. She is very detailed, and she uses high-quality products to yield the best result. I love the suite-style salon she works in too. 
Kelly gives personalized, individual service to all her clients. If you're looking for a new salon, call Kelly and make an appointment right away.
