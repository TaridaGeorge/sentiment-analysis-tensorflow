The bar fitness is the best place I have worked out ever, the members and the staff make it feel like it is a fitness family. It's hybrid trainer Ryan is my favorite trainer, and will push you to your best no matter how fit or unfit you are u will reach your future goal. I would recommend this to all my friends and family.
