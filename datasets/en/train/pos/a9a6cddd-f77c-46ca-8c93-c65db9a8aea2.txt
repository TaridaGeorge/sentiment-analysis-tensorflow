Apparently, this store must have "cleaned the house",  from reading the previous reviews (by the lovely Sam O.), I almost didn't want to come and buy anything here!

While I've been several times, I've never really bought anything major other than a few home decor.  I guess we're lucky to have Amber, the wonderful and helpful retail clerk.  She was by far the best person ever to help us decide on a piece of furniture.  We were satisfied with the overall warranty and the return guarantee if we ever changed our mind.   I will be updating on how our furniture holds up in the future.  I'm pretty ecstatic.

Amber, you rock!
