I make the trip here even though it is quite a distance away from home.

The reason:  because everything about this store is excellent. 

The staff is always friendly and fast and helpful.  The food/sandwiches are the best!

I personally think this store is the best sandwich place....period!

The bread is awesome, the meats always good and of course Schlotzky's hot sauce....picked up a couple more bottles for home.
