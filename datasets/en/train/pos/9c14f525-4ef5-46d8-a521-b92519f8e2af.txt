We searched our phones for a place to go to have some Ceviche. This restaurant received some good reviews so we drove down from NE Phoenix and were a little skeptical on the location... but our concerns were immediately set at ease once we stepped inside. What a great little place with very friendly staff! We really appreciated the cleanliness too. We ordered the shrimp ceviche, shrimp in green sauce and shrimp and broccoli in cream sauce. Everything was outstanding! Even the simple rice and beans were absolutely delicious! And the tortillas,  uh-mazin!! Danielle was wonderful and we truly enjoyed her service. We will definitely come back and bring friends next time! Between the two of us, we already texted half our friends about this place and we haven't even finished eating yet! RECOMMENDED FOR SURE!!
