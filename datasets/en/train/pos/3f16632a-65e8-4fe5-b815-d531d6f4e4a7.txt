This is one of the most beautiful hotels I've seen.  Well appointed and full of rich history, this place is truly a 5 Star property!  I was here to meet a client for a business meeting & lunch.  If you're visiting during the hot Summer months, I recommend valet parking as it is a pretty long walk from the self parking lot to the entrance of the hotel.

The property is sprawled out over a large amount of acres....a classical designed hotel.  They don't make places like this anymore.

The service here is outstanding as well.  Everyone from Valet to the food servers understand what it means to provide excellent "customer service".  I will definitely be back soon.
