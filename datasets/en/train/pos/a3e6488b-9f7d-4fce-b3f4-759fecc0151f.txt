Love a fresh organic farmer offering their locally grown produce, herbs and eggs to the community.  Farmyard also teaches and sets up gardens in your backyard if you want.  They will teach you how to maintain it and maybe even sell your produce for you too.  Great for those who want a great garden but aren't sure how to go about creating one.  Thank you Sarah!
