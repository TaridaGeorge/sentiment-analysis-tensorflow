Finally!

Experienced Dim Sum and LOVED it...I just wish I had gone in with a group, because I couldn't finish everything.

What an awesome variety, also...2.50 per plate of food? Uh, yeah I'm in! 

One caveat, while the lovely older woman *did* try to be helpful by suggesting SO many things, I felt like I had to keep ordering out of respect.

For example: I ended up ordering BBQed Pork Buns, and I don't even eat pork. My roommate said they were fantastic though!

Things to try:
The Coconut Steamed Buns (oh jesus they're buttery and sinful!)
The Shrimp Rolls (simple, but tasty!)
A piping hot pot of tea with everything

For 2-5 bucks per plate you can't go wrong.
