Yumma, yumma, YUMMY!! 

I was at the Biltmore and craving a hamburger for lunch.  I decided to stop in at Zinburger.  The place was packed ; however, I found a spot at the bar and within 15 minutes the bartender took my order and my burger was right in front of me.  I ordered the Zinburger.  The burger was cooked to perfection.

I will definitely be back and I will bring others to enjoy Zinburger's wonderful burgers.
