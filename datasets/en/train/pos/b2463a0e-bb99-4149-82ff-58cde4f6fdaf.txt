For a sports bar, Goldies by far has the best food in town!  The faccocia sandwiches are to die for.  I've tried them all and love them!  I had read the reviews prior to going and mentioned to the server about some of the negative items such as not enough dips, etc.  She was so friendly and our sandwiches were covered in sauce and she brought us different flavored dipping sauces to try.  The prices for what you get, especially in Scottsdale are great!  There are TV's in every direction and they even changed the channel for the tv nearest us.  I would recommend this place and would like to eat there at least once a week!!  There are a lot of children or families, but they are only allowed in certain areas.
