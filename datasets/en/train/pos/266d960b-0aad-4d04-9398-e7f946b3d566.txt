I travel on a regular basis and have seen the best and the worst airports. I have not exactly seen it all, but enough, and Sky Harbor ranks in the top ten in my book. It is international yet has a small feel to it, meaning it is easy to get around in, and has quick security lines most all of the time in my experience. 

After reading some of the other reviews, I feel like I need to say that I have never had to connect here, so that is not a part of this review.
