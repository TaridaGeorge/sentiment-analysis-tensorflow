Great pizza!! This place was a great last minute pick!! 
We decided to bring in the big 2013 with a small get together celebration at this pizza joint!! The service was great!! We had a friendly and patient server with our undecided group. Also we loved the surprisingly good tasting white sauce on our pizzas!! Everything was amazing!! The Mozzarella appetizers and the Extreme Hot wings!! Oh so good, fatty food!! We look forward to coming back!!
