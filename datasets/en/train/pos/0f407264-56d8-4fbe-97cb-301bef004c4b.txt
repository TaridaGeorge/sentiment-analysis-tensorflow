I was fortunate to work near El Molino and have enjoyed many many lunches here. The food and atmosphere are not fancy at all but the dishes are sure to please. It's very affordable Mexican with big flavor!  I'll drive out of my way to have me some El Molino.

Be sure to try the homemade Lemonade too! For under $10 you get some of the best Mexican food around. Give it try!
