It's an amazing theater!! The theater is beautiful and the seats are comfortable.

Advice:

Avoid sitting on row C. Evidently rows A & B were "under the stage," so on row C, we were even with the stage. I've sat on the front row before at other theaters and have never been so close to have to look up. Next time I'll choose seats more toward the middle of the theater.

If you'd like a hot appetizer during intermission, order it before the show.
