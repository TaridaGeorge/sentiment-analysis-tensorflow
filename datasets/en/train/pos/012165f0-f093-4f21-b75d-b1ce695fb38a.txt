Wish I lived closer!  Love the sushi.  Made fresh and they are quite generous in portion size.  Clean (for the most part) and the staff is amazingly attentive.  The manager is very personable and obviously has figured out that customers appreciate personal attention.  He seems to remember every customer... makes you feel special in a way :)  

Only tried the Korean menu once.  Bibimbap was good, with the customary little appetizer dishes.
