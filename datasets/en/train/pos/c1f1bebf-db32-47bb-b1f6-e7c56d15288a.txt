As a gift to the bride and groom of a wedding I was in, I ordered the wedding cake, cup cakes and groom's cake. When working with a company from across the country, you tend to be a little worried about how things are going to turn out. Bitter Sweet Cake Boutique far exceeded every expectation that I had for the cakes, the flavor was to die for, and the designs were spot on. Hands down I would recommend ordering from this company and I will use them for any event I have in Phoenix in the future, either for my personal events or future events my company has. Job well done and you have a customer for life!
