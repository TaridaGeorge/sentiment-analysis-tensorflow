I would give 6 stars if it were possible. This is definitely the place to go if you need a professional repair or custom job. They can handle pretty much any music, PA, audio, or general electric repair -- new or vintage. Jeff and his employees are experts at their craft, and I always know my treasured gear is in good hands.
