I have recently started going to Dave's Astanga Yoga for Yoga Teacher Training. I am so happy that I made the decision to attend Dave's studio. The owners, Dave & Cheryl, are kind, hands-on, and really care about the students. I feel very welcome and experience an amazing energy from those around me. They've done a great job of creating a culture that embraces all levels and I am confident that the knowledge I'm gaining from them will take me to the next level in my practice.
