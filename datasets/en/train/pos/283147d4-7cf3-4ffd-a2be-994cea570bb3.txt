I love this place.  I always find great deals on things I need and things I didn't know I needed until I found them at Big Lots.  

I am in their frequent shoppers program and especially look forward to my 20% off rewards to make the savings even better.  Don't be surprised to find just about everything you need here...  I no longer am.  

Although I live right down the street from this Big Lots and go a couple times a month, I recommend going to the one on Shea and the 101.  They have a pretty good furniture department.  This particular location is limited due to space.
