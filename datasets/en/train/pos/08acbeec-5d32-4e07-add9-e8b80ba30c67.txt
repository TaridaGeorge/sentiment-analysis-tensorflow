Saving on groceries for a large family is a job in itself. It's always about making sure the prices are good and the food, both tasty and nutritious. Before Winco, the grocery shopping consisted of Sprouts or the produce stand, Safeway, Fry's, and maybe Bashas. 

Now, it's all one stop and the grocery bill is lower than I ever expected. Instead of $60 here, $25 there, etc., I will spend $60 all in one place and be done with my grocery shopping for the week. 

Highly recommended.
