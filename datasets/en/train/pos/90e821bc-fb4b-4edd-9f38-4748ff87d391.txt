Usually In-N-Out Burger is one of the first places I visit when I come to LA, and so I'm pleasantly surprised that there is location here in Phoenix.  As a Houstonian, we are unfortunately deprived of such a place.  

Definitely a must visit for any burger enthusiast, and their fries are out of this world.
