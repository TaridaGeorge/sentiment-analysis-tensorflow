Happy Hour ROCKS - the food and drink menu's get better and better. The staff is awesome and location is right in the heart of Old Town! I could eat my weight in Dumplings or Lettuce Wraps any day of the week. It will absolutely get crowded on a weekend night or if something is going on near the mall. Head to the bar and grab a cold beer while you wait!
