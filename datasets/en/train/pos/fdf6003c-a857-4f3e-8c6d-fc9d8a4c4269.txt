Still my go to when I am in Phoenix. Same menu as Houston's plus sushi. Some items may have gone up a buck or two, but still fairly reasonable. 

Service was great, I appreciate how they always have a team of people bring out all the meals meal at the same time.

The new facilities are great. The bar has plenty of seating and the outdoor patio is nice and large.
