My fifth time to Petite Maison?? Finally five stars? Yeah...This place has been one of my favorite spots to dine, love the cozy deco, friendly staff, and of course the food! 

I have enjoyed all the food I have tried, like 80% of the menu? I love that the menu changes everyday with a few different choices in the entrees. During my latest trip, while the entrees were really good as usual (salmon and braised veal), I sampled out the mussels for appetizer (finally!) which was amazing! Big plate, good to share for two, light creamy broth with green onions, and I squeezed some of the grilled lemon juice over to add the extra flavor, it was truly the best I had for a long time.
 
Souffl√© for dessert? Need I say more? :)
