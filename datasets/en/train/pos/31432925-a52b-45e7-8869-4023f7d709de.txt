I drive from North Phoenix/Scottsdale just to get my Famous Daves BBQ fix. Sad, yes but they make some hella good BBQ. The ribs are tender and juicy, the baked beans, the mashed tators, and the green beans are so good, they make you wanna smack yo momma. Well maybe not that good, but darn near close enough. Oh and don't forget about the the cornbread muffins. Always warm and yummy. See now I need my BBQ fix once again. Seriously though, I really do enjoy their food and their Devil's Spit BBQ sauce is on point! Make sure to try a skewer of shrimp or the BBQ wings. YUMMO!
