My first trip to Phoenix couldn't have been better. I went to JW for 3 nights and loved every minute of it. It's beautiful, the pools (about 6 of them) were very nice, and the rooms were very spacious.
The ONLY thing I didn't like was the parking. It's really far away from the lobby/check in area. So if you have a lot of stuff to bring in, try to up front. 
Other than that, I experienced nothing even slightly bad at JW.

Would definitely go back again!
