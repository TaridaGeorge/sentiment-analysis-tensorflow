I have purchased multiple pens, journals, and bottles/cartridges of ink from Jay at Scottsdale Pen Company. It is my "go to" place because of the great selection and service. They are certainly complicit in helping my affinity to fine pens become a full blown addiction thanks to the wide variety of pens and price points that will meet everyone's needs. :-)
