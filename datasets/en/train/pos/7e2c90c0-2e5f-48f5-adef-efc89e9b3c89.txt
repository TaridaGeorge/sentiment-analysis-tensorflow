I am shocked at how much I loved this place.  It is a small building in the middle of a parking lot.  I'm not much of a snow cone (shaved ice)  person, but this was not typical at all.  The ice was creamy and quite tasty.  The cone I had was raspberry blueberry with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream at the bottom.  It was delicious.  I think they had about 100 flavors.  You can get the snow cone by itself or with the ice cream at the bottom.  Like I said, it is not typical at all, you barely tasted the ice.  I will be back for sure, especially if stays this hot at night.
