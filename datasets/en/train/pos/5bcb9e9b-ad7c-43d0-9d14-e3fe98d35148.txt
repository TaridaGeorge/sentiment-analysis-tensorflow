This is BY FAR my favorite place to go with the family. When the waitress welcomes our table w a basket of fresh fries (she obviously saw two hungry kids) I knew I was going to love it! It's one of the very few places that I feel ok taking the kids to eat without worrying about making someone around us mad. When my infant was really small, she was entertained by the fans, tv, decorations, and balloons. Now both kids are entertained w the food, crayons, and fun drinks. Plus you can't beat the burgers and massive menu! I'll always be a huge fan of Red Robin, but this one is spotless, very friendly, and quick!
