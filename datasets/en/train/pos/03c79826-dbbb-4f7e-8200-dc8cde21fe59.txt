I have been to this location several times and they have been very helpful ( im deaf ) and kind. Once they made a mistake and compensated for that mistake greatly!!  The sushi is excellent! Prices can be a bit on the high side but the great food makes up for it. I highly recommend this restaurant for great sushi
