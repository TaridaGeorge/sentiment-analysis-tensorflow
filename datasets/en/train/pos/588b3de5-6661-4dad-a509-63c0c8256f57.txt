LOVE, LOVE , LOVE this place-as does everyone i have taken here.  The atmosphere is so great.  Big leather sofas, dimly let, chandeliers and HIGE bar in the center of the place.  it's small, swanky, sexy and has a great old school feel.  Plus ladies-i've never seen so many chic good looking guys in one place at once, it was jaw dropping ;)

Scottsdale needed a place like this-cozy and classy and reasonably priced.  So happy to have this in my backyard-a must try.
