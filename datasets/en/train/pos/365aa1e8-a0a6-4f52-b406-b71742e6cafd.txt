I have attended two performances at Ballet Arizona - Nutcracker and Giselle. Both were equally fantastic.

The dancers are very talented, the music is wonderful and the productions are top notch. The sets for Giselle were as pretty to look at as the dancers.

Symphony Hall is very nice as well. The chairs are comfortable and not too cramped like some other theaters.

I felt classier just being in the audience. Thanks for a wonderful evening, Ballet Arizona!
