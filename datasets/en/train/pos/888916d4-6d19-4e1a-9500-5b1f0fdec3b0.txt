My fiance is from the south, and when I say he knows his whiskeys and bourbons, he knows them. We love coming here for small snacks like the pickled tomatoes and duck fat fries (TRY THEM - they are so good!) and cocktails. I like their old fashioned. The bartender stirs the drink for two minutes. It really makes the whiskey softer and infuses the lemon and bitters flavors. Last week we tried the classic hamburger. I can honestly say, I don't think I could have made it taste better had a grilled burgers at home. It was flavorful, charred on the outside but still warm and pink on the inside. I love the casual, loungy atmosphere. It's a great spot to grab a bite and a cocktail or spend a whole night.
