I have shared many an awful, hungover morning with my favorite stars from the Gay Corridor. The service can be on the scary tweaker side, but it's a good, simple breakfast that doesn't stress my dehydrated mind to find deliciousness. They've also many different healthy options, not that I've ever done more than glance at those, but it's wonderful nonetheless. It's the crown and glory of Park Central, and the only reason I still consider Park Central an actual place, as opposed to the reality of it just being a bad idea.
