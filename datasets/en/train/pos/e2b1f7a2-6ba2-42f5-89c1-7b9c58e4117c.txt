Best vets EVER.

We've used Tri-city for multiple years for multiple pets. From regular check up's to broken bones to the very sad putting down of some beloved pets. We board our dogs there too. TCEVH is a world-class vet hospital staffed by world-class doctors and staff.

Dr's Cromer and Clack *rock*. The staff is first class -- friendly and professional. 

They care. A lot. 

Now if they'd just stop calling us when they get some abandoned animal in... ;)
