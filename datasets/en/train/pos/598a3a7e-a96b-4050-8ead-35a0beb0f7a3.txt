Love this place.  Great burgers and their grilled salmon and pizzas are delicious.  

Heard about this place while reading reviews on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  Is that what put this place on the map because it definately appears to be a tourist destination on weekends.

Lines can be long depending on time of visit.  Indoor seating is limited but plenty of space outdoors.  Bring a blanket, find some shade under a tree and chill out (or use one of their many picnic tables.  

I have returned often but will usually drive on by if lines are out the door.
