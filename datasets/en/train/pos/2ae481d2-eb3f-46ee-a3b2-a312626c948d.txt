Ish Salon in Ahwatukee is top notch! It's not very often you find an upscale salon that is still down to earth.  I was intimidated when I walked in but it didn't take long for the front desk person to ask me if I needed anything. Very nice people here! 
But before I go on I would be remiss not to mention Frank! What a great guy! I received an awesome haircut at an affordable price.  Not only is he talented but he is available.  He will work extra hours to make sure his clients are taken care of.  Call him!   
Oh and yes... the owner's son was the crazy guy on MTV's hit show "Real World" last season:)
