I am back in Phoenix for a little business with a craving for one of my favorite desert island foods, pepperoni pizza. I am very, very particular about my pepperoni pizzas. The crust must be thin and crispy. The sauce not too thick or too thin and the pepperoni flavorful. I like my pepperoni pizzas cooked well done. A little black on the crust is totally acceptable and preferred. My pepperoni pizza from Oregenos in Tempe was perfection! 

My side of wings was damn good as well.
