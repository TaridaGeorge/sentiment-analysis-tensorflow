Love this place.  I went to Phoenicia when I was in Phx last month, and I'm glad I did.  The staff was well-informed, friendly and articulate.  I bought two t-shirts and a sweater and remain stoked about my purchases.  It's nice to wear something unique as opposed to mass produced.  

I hope this place grows and expands to SF!
