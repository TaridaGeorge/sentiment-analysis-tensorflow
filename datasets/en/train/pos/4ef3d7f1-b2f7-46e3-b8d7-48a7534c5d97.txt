Best Doctor  around as far I  am concerned.  I wish more Doctors treated their patients as well as Dr. Sawyer does. This office is well ran and very customer friendly. When I  am in the office I  feel they  are totally caring and understanding of whatever my needs are.  They are efficient, warm and 
extremely helpful.  

I have had many friends that use Dr Sawyer for their Ob needs and have been extremely happy.  Dr. Sawyer is well respected by his colleagues and customers alike.
