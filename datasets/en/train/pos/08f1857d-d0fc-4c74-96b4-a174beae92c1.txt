I love our local library~! 

The location is within walking distance from my home so it is easily accesible for me. (Until Spring Training  that is, as the other reviewer mentioned) And I love that I can order everything I want online, get an automated phone call and then show up to pick up my selections.

It's so wonderful to go to such a peaceful place where the staff is very accomodating and pleasant. And do yourself a favor....on a sunny  (slightly breezy )day, sit by the windows, look out onto the lake and delight in the way the sunshine dances across the ripples in the water.  It's truly breathtaking. Just don't forget to enjoy the walking trail and park as well....its really a wonderful FREE family outing!
