This is my favorite place to just hang out vs other coffee joints for one simple reason - FREE REFILLS!  I used to hang out at McDonalds in the mornings for coffee and wifi and then I switched to Starbucks for the same reason.  But then I realized that Paradise Bakery had more to offer me - like I said, free refills and in the event that I did want a little snack I get the benefit of a larger/ better selection of food.  

If you're like me - a senior with time on his hands; this is a great place to hang out, read the paper, surf the net or just visit with friends.  This place just feels right to me.
