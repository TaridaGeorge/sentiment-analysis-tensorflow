WOW!  
My parents and I and other family friends come her almost every Friday!  They have a great happy hour menu! (Although they just changed it a little) But happy hour is available everyday ( I think) from 4-8!  They have a wonderful frozen sangria mixed with a frozen margarita! ( its a MUST TRY!)  
Also,  the pretzel buns for the burgers are delicious!! Not to mention that the staff is amazing, and the owner Jen is a DELIGHT!  She is constantly walking around the restaurant talking to guests!  Probably one of my favorite restaurants around!!
