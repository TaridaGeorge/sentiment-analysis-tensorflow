I haven't ridden a bicycle since the 1980's. Seriously- so I wandered in here today accidentally after I missed the driveway for the florist next door. The man who greeted me was very polite. He had another customer or two before me but apologized for the wait and took me on a mini-tour of the store and explained the different kinds of bicycles and their various uses, pluses and minuses. He was very helpful and I decided before I left that I might save up and buy a bicycle there. Great local store- very friendly staff and I MIGHT start riding again after all these years.
