We've now been back a few times and LOVE this place.  It is the perfect environment for an intimate dinner...with your SO, family, friends...whomever.  You have to plan a little in advance to make sure that you can get a table, but the food is top notch, the menu has something for everyone, the prices are reasonable and the owner customer friendly and charming.  Centurion is one of my new favorites (seiously!).  You should check it out!
