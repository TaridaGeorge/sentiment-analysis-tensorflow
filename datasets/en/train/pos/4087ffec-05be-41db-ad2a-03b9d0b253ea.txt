I LOVE their granola and their nine grain bread!  I know longer live in the area and now have their granola and bread shipped to me in Southern California.  They also have the best cookies, pastries and I have enjoyed their sandwiches as well.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful as well.  I recommend this bakery highly!
