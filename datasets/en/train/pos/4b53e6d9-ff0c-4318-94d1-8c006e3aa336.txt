I was very impressed with the woman I spoke to on the phone. She was very knowledgeable and helpful.  Justin who did the carpets was very pleasent and helpful. My carpets were like new again. I have used them twice now.  For a small fee Justin restreched my carpet and even replaced the carpet in the closet for me. I thought it would take all day to dry, but I ran a few errands and came back and found much of it dry already. I will continue to use them as my carpet cleaning service.
