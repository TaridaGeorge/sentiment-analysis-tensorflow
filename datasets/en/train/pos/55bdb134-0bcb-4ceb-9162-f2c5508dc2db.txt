Laura Smith is THE best brow lady in town. I'm extremely picky about my brows and after having them botched more than once by others I'm so happy I've found Laura. She creates the perfect brow shape using hard wax which is gentle on sensitive skin. My brow area used to be red and irritated for hours after waxing but I no longer have that issue since seeing Laura. I receive a lot of compliments on my brows and I owe it to Laura!
