I had received a birthday gift certificate from Firestone for a free oil change. I thought that there would be some catch or at least they would tell me to fix something. However I decided to try them. SURPRISE... they changed the oil and they said everything was good. Bigger surprise is that they did not charge me even a penny for the oil change.. not even tax. The service itself was fast and prompt. The vehicle appeared smoother after the oil change. I would definitely go there next time for the oil change.
