It never fails: I'm never disappointed. You can't go wrong here. Great atmosphere, good people, awesome food! If you've never had a pasty then I feel for you!

I absolutely love the Lovely Bit a Salmon, but other great ones are the Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Tikka Masala, Rosemary Chicken, Pilgrim and the awesome Chicken Greek. Many of their pasties are available vegetarian style too.
