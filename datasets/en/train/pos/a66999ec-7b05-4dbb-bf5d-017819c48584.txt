One of the only food places in AZ I miss! This place is just awesome, you order a half sandwich and the soup in a bread bowl and you've got yourself a food coma. The Wisconsin Cheddar soup is to die for. The dinning room isn't much more than some chairs and a few tables, but this place isn't about the dining, it's about the food. If they ever expand to the East Coast, I'll be the first person in line.
