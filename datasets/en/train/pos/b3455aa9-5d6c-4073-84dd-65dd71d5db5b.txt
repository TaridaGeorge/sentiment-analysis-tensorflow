These guys have been my mechanics for as long as I've had my car!! Greg is an honest mechanic. He took me out to show me what's wrong so I could see the damage needing repair and explained what needed fixing now for safety reasons and what could wait until I had money and time, along with the time frame I had before those damages would cost me more.  He also quoted me and was able to find cheaper parts the next day so I paid 30$ less than the quote!!  I will definitely keep coming here for repairs that are major. Thanks Greg!
