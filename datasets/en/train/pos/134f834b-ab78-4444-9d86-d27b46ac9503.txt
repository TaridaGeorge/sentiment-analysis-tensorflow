Sierra was fabulous!! Professional and knows her stuff. I bought the first dress that I tried because she pegged my style instantly! Not only that, she worked within my budget options and I ended up getting an incredible bargain on an incredible dress. Sierra made the whole experience easy, fun, and a delight. The store should keep her on as long as possible - she is an absolute asset. My only regret is that she probably didn't make much of a commission off of my sale and she deserves a huge bonus!! Thanks so much, Sierra - you've made my wedding day fabulous already!
