Hooray for Luci's.  G-reat coffee, and I will specifically add great service as well.  I wanted a bagel breakfast sandwich with ham (not on the menu) and they actually made me feel like I WASN"T being difficult. 

Now that's how you do it....

I know it might not sound like a big deal---To go see if there is ham available in the kitchen, and then make up a custom egg bagel for a customer's picky breakfast, but it IS a big deal because it is so simple, and so possible, and so often the answer is just  'no, it's not on the menu', because that's just easier.  

My hat's off to Luci's for being awesome.  Made my day.
