When ever in the city, (live in Chandler) Phoenix City Grille is on the list of places to go. Also a favorite place for after the theatre. Whether a late lunch, or dinner we have never been disappointed here. The atmosphere is warm and inviting,  more towards upscale without being pretenious. The staff always pleasant and knowledgable about the specials / menu. It's also on the list of places to go when out of town vistors are in town. Be sure to say Hello to Sheldon.
