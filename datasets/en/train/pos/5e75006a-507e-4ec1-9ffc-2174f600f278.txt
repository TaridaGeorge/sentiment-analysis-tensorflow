Lush is freaking amazing.
I think the store originated in San Fran, but is now spreading its cheer across the world.
Lush is filled with fresh, handmade soaps, facial masks, cleansers, bath bombs, fragrance and more.  It's such a fun store to go in and all of their items smell and look amazing.
If you have to get a gift for a girl, I would definitely hit up Lush- you just can't go wrong. 
Their fresh facial masks are amazing...try love lettuce- it works wonders.
I also love their bath bombs...they have a ton to choose from and they add color and aroma to your bathtub. Some even leave tiny rose buds or glitter behind in the water.
P.S. Lush never tests on animals!!
