I absolutely love this place! I mean... what's not to love about a cozy little Greek grill?! It's family owned and operated and the whole family is so sweet and puts a lot of care into what they do. 

I also agree with the review before me... amazingly affordable breakfast with nice hearty portions. 

For lunch, I tend to stick with the shwarama sandwich combo. And yes, they do sell gum. Trust me, you will need it. ;) 

Highly recommended to anyone in the area for breakfast or lunch!
