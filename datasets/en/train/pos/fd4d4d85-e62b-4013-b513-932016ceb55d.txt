I've never been one to frequent hair salons.  I went here and was lucky to get Shana to figure out something for my longish 65 year old hairdo. She went shorter and helped me learn how to style it at home. I came back a few weeks later and went a little shorter again. Shana will listen to what you want and will make suggestions, but it's your call. I then took my daughter there, seen in the photo. We are very pleased.
