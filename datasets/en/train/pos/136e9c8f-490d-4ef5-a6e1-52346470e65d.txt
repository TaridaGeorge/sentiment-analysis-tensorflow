I have been coming here for years for their lunch special, which I don't think, anyone could ever beat. For ten dollars you get 4 or 5 pieces of  nigiri; salmon, tuna, white fish, shrimp, and a full set of California roll with a squid tempura stick.
At night it is a great place and fun. If you sit at the sushi bar the chefs could easily do stand up at the Improv. 
Always fresh never had a ok meal, always great. Severs are beautiful inside and out. Always on top of getting you whatever you need, they stand out front and before you think you need to find one to ask for something  their  at your table already.
Portions are always very generous and great prices.
