I always go to Picazzo's for lunch when I am in Casa Grande for business. Why? The service is always terrific and they have delicious lunch specials. My go-to lunch is the slice of cheese pizza with the Ceasar salad. Everything is always fresh and delicious. The nice thing about the specials is that they come with iced tea. The prices for the lunch specials range from $7 - $11, depending on what you order. It's high quality food for the price. There aren't a lot of good restaurant choices in Casa Grande, so I am thrilled that Picazzo's has a location there. 

Definitely sign up for their "Power Card" while you're there. It's good at many different restaurants in the Phoenix area and on certain days of the week, this Picazzo's location offers double points.
