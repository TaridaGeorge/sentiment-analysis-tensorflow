I got my dog from here. I love the Arizona Humane Society. All the dogs seems to be taken care of despite being in a shelter. The staff was very helpful. Only downside is that at times the description of the dogs is not accurate. My dog was turned in because he was too much to handle by the previous owner and at first I was concern about it and almost turned him down because of it but he was just too damm cute so I brought him home and at my home he is pretty mellow and never caused any problems so not sure what problems he had at his previous home. 

Arizona Humane Society is one of the organizations that I have chosen to donate money to this year because I absolutely love what they are doing.
