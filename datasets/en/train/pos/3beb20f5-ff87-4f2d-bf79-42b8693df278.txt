So I came down to check out "Mixed up Sundays." There was a dim haze of flickering candle light...everywhere. As soon you walk through the doors any drama  weighing your heart will disspate.   Only good vibes.  You'll be puzzled by the Art on the wall...its interesting. Sip on a Guiness and let the funk flow through you. You'll be nodding in  no time.     If you are lucky to be with someone this would be the time to head on to the back and sit quietly in the theater. Hold hands or something ;).  Leave and have a part two horizontally.  Bravo to the owner you nailed it bro
