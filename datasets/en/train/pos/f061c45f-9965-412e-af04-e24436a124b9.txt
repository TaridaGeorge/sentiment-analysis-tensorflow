I have been to this wine bar on several occasions and I always leave with a smile on my face. First, this place has the most impressive wine list I have ever seen.  Basically anything you are looking for and within any price range.  Second, the service has always been great.  The waiters will always try and help you find that perfect bottle of wine so you don't throw your money away.  They are always willing to suggest various wines and most of the time will allow you to taste a wine, if they have an open bottle behind the bar.  Last, the atmosphere can't be beat.  It is reminiscent of a speakeasy and is very dark.  This place can get pretty loud if there is a band or music, but overall this place is great and I highly recommend going for a bottle of wine post dinner.
