One of my favorite spots to grab dinner! The happy hour menu is awesome. I love their apps, especially the godzilla tails. My roommate loves their steak appetizer. And I am a huge fan of their sushi. My favorites include the shogun roll and the surfer roll. I have never eaten any of the normal non-sushi entrees, but again, my non-fish eating roommate loves their teriyaki chicken bowl. The bar staff is very friendly and efficient. Plus, there is a large TV in the bar, so if there is a sporting event on you can watch. Great place!
