As a residential Realtor, we often recommend that our clients meet with an attorney prior to making any decisions that might affect  their assets, their will, their estate, or anything else of the like.  In this market, particularly, I recommend that anyone considering a short sale or foreclosure speak with an attorney.  My first recommendation has always been and will always be Hal Bliss.  He is exceptionally knowledgeable and very thorough.

And best of all, as someone who refers clients to him, I always hear positive reviews back from my clients who decided to hired him.
