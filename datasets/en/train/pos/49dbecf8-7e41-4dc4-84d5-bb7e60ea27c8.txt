This place kicks ass.  I'm a huge fan of non-hippie vegetarian food.  I hate the idea that you have to just eat veggies all the time.  With the advances we made in soy products, it is nice to see someone really going to town with quality ingredients.

So I ordered the buffalo chicken po-boy.  SOOO good.  Plus it came with fries.  Can't hate fries.  It's really hard to describe the texture of the sammie but it was exactly what I expected and it was brilliant.  I literally can't wait to go back.  I think I ask my wife every weekend if we can go.  It's so good.
