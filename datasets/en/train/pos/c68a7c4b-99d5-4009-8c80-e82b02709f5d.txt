I'm basing my review entirely on macarons, though if you've had these macarons you'd know that they merit the full 5 stars and then some. Or maybe you wouldn't, but I definitely think they do. 

There are no words to describe when I first took a bite into the heavenly Meyer Lemon cookie and all things previously mysterious and unknown were known to me and a "Holy sh*t" issued from my lips. It seems crazy, but it's true. And then the caramel cream? Lord almighty-- chewy and complex and cunning (I needed another "C" adjective) but true nonetheless. 

They seem a bit expensive but it's worth it. Didn't sample any of the food that time, but may shortly.
