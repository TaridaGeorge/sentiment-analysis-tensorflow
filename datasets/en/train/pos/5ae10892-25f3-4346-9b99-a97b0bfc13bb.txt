OH I have a craving and its Delux...in fact that's where I will be at lunch today!!
Enjoying their basket of sweet potato fries and a Delux burger....no wait I will have a Beet Salad maybe to start...or the Chinese Chicken Salad....mmmm....yummy!!
Get there before 11:30 or else you are screwed - first of all parking is crazy there....getting a table is next to impossible!!
There is also a take-out counter side with a selection of pastries and RED VELVET CUPCAKES!!
or Gelato Spot is across the parking lot!! =0)
