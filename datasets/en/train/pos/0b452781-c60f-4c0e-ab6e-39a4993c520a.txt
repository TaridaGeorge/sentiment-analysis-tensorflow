This place is a must on any hot AZ day ... and it's almost always hot here, yes?! So, get yourself to this little hole in the wall and check out their ice cold concoctions. I go there mainly for their fruit ice bars. They have so many flavors, it hard to decide what to get every time I go! The bars come in either the fruit juice or the cream variety. There are even "exotic" flavors for the adventurous such as tamarind and hibiscus. The hibiscus is YUM! Very refreshing, a little sweet, a little tart. The store is easy to miss unless you're looking out for it as you're driving down Arizona Avenue. It's just past Chandler High, across the street from Chodang korean restaurant -- another YUM on my list!
