I've eaten here more often than I really should.. but Z's Greek is just too delicious to say no to. 

The employees are always nice. I usually get the lamb souvlaki or gyros pita combo. To die for. With fries, of course, and they have the best fries that I've ever tasted. 

Baklava is good. 

I love love love that this place has a drive thru because I am lazy and prefer taking my food to Squaw Peak to eat over there. But the inside looks nice too, they have TVs. They have outdoor seating too and allow pets there.
