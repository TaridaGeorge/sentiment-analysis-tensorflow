This was the first restaurant I became a regular at when I moved to Phoenix 3 years ago. I love this place, my heart will always have it. Everything, and I mean everything on the menu is great. From the garlic mashed potatoes with cheese, to the vegetarian pasties to the P,B, and J pasty, it's all great. The employees are all helpful and extremely nice. A perk for me, is that I get to sit at the bar and watch my food get prepared. I love that. Great for lunch and especially great to pre-party before going out on Mill.
