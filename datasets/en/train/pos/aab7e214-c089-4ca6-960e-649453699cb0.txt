Great service, I didn't get steak from here (yes, I know...a steakhouse), just got the Zesty Thai Salmon. The salmon was awesome with the chili mayo, baked potato, and asparagus. Can't wait to go back to try their other dishes.

Thank you Kathy (owner) for taking the time to send me the name of the dish! Had to update this review and rating because of it :D
