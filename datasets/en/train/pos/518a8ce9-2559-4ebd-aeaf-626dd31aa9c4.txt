No dings on this one. Always a great time and the food is terrific. Service is friendly and personal. Drinks are generous. Perfect up scale dinner house light level - makes everyone look good. I can't think of anything I would change. The house rotisserie chickens are featured in a showcase on the south side of the building...I'm sure just to get you salivating. (Also check out their "Flying Chicken" - under the radar takeout via the back door. Very Cute) Not a huge menu, but lots of comfort items, great variety and consistently excellent all the way. Deviled eggs, cornbread gets a big thumbs up, and I'm a big fan of the Macho Salad. I could eat that everyday. Can't wait to go again! Soon.
