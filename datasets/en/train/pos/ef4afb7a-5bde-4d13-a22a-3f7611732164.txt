I love this place. The Las Vegas roll is amazing however the crispy California roll isn't that crispy. Their sake is in fact bomb and the restaurant it always a good time. Their prices are reasonable for sushi places in Tempe and the service has always been awesome. If you've got a party bigger than 4 though, call ahead.
