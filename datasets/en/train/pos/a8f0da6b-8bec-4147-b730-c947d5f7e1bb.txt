I've been driving by this place for months waiting for it to open.  I'm so happy it's finally here.  

It's just as awesome as all the other Postino's.  Bruschetta boards, awesome.  Wine, awesome. Ambiance, awesome.  

Liberty Market and the Farmhouse are both hot spots across the street so parking will be tricky around there.  I'm not looking forward to fighting the crowds - which are inevitable but worth it!
