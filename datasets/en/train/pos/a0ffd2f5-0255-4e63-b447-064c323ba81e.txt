I had a great experience at Spinato's Saturday night. The food and service was awesome. We started out with garlic and cheese breadsticks with marinara. Orgasimic. :) There were three of us dining, and we ordered three different things to share. I have had their meatball pizza several times, and it is my absolute favorite. We also tried the baked spaghetti and meatball calzone with ricotta. Oh my! This calzone was like heaven in your mouth. It was awesome, but a tad on the rich side. A few bites of this were enough to share. We also got an Italian sausage and mushroom pizza. It was also extremely good. Our server was fantastic. She was attentive, and was very helpful in explaining items on the menu. On top of all of this, it was very affordable.
