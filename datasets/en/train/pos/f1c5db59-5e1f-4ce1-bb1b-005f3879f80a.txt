Wow! That's all I can say! I had Dr. Chris and he had his work cut out for him with me that's for sure. He even came in to help me on his day off and stayed longer than he planned ti do my procedure right and not to do a rush job.

His staff was funny and comforting in all areas from beginning to end and couldn't be happier. If you need a dentist Dr. Chris is worth the drive from anywhere in the valley and I still have work that needs to be done.

He made me proud to have my "I just won the lottery twice smile back on my face again!"
