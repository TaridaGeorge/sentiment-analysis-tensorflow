40% surplus, 30% cheap knock off Asian made, 30% American made cheapie.

With that said, I'm sure this store must serve certain customer base.

The guys working behind the counter seems knowledgeable. Also this place sells some multicm and a-tacs camo for airsoft kids. 

My cusotmer wanted American military surplus jacket to bring home, and I managed to find one that he wanted. 

Pricing is okay, compare to on-line shops this is about average. For surplus some items were cheap, some items were over priced.
