Everyone who knows me, knows that Char's is my favorite place to dance. Tonight I want there and listened to the Kenny G Project and danced. I was in need of a dance fix and was not disappointed, I always have a good time at Char's, but the new Tuesday night with Kenny G makes this my new favorite night. The service is always friendly, the music is the best in town and the prices are very affordable. Hands down, still my favorite place to take my friends and to go and dance.
