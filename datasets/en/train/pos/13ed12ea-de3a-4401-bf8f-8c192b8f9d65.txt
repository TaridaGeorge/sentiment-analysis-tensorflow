I've been coming to MacAlpine's on and off for about 8 years and I still can't get enough.

Monica and Cary (owners) are two of the most hard workers small business owners that I've had the pleasure of knowing.  

MacAlpine's is Phoenix's only still existing original Soda Fountain and a true gem.  Filled with vintage decor and charm, it's a fun time warp every time I go in there.  Their shakes are delicious and so big you get the leftover serving in the metal mixing cup.  Their food is tasty and like mum made it.  They always have vintage tunes on and you can browse the antiques and collectibles next door in between dining.
