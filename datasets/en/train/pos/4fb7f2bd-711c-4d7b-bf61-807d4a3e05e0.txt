It is time I give credit, where credit is due.  Sens is a 5 star dining establishment.  Hands down.  If you don't think so we may have to go toe to toe.

Bacon wrapped dates=Amazing!  Soup Gyoza=Addicting!  Green Papaya Spring Rolls=Refreshing!  Panko Shrimp=Guilty Pleasure!  Hot & Sour Soup=Well, HOT!  Sizzling Shrimp plate=T.A.S.T.Y.

Really, it's not just the food.  The bartenders/servers have always been super attentive, personable, and know the food.  The atmosphere on a busier night with the door rolled up and perfect weather.  Priceless experience.

I know everyone is always talking about how everyone is on Johnny's nuts, but come on, the dude is a super nice guy and knows how to put some damned tasty food together.
