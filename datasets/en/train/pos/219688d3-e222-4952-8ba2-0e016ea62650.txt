OK, your probably wondering what makes this McDonalds so special.  The outside may look like just another older, McDonalds franchise but it's what's inside that sets this place apart.

The good:
- Large kids playground with small toddler play area, air hockey, basket ball area & video bike  / games
- Main room is modern & clean
- Flat screen TV (even have one that only shows puppies like that of a pet store)
- Great service: cashiers ask for your name & manager (he's so nice) hand delivers your meal
- Cool promotions (Passed out BOGO Big Macs, Frapps, Smoothies that you can use right away), Win a kiddie party, etc.
- Special Events (Meet Ronald McDonald)

The bad:
- may get a little crowded during lunch time
- too far from my house :(
