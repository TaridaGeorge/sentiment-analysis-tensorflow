I will join the troves of people writing reviews for Cibo.  By now, it's known that it one of the best places to eat in Phoenix.  

Cibo's atmosphere is the best by far.  Inside the "house" is quaint, and intimate.  Perfect for a romantic date for two.  The outside patio is lit well with stringed bulbs, great landscaping and the occasional live music.

The pizza is on par with Bianco.  I recommend getting a pie per person so you can try a variety.  Also, I usually prefer red pizzas, but the whites here at Cibo always end up being my favorite.

The crepe deserts, with fresh fruit and ice cream are beyond words.  Save room, you must get it.

I love brining out of towners here to show what Phoenix really has to offer.  Not some chain restaurant in a strip mall.
