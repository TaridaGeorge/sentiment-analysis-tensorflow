I love Next Coffee. It's exactly what my neighborhood needed in the way of a coffee company that is constantly expanding and improving upon their already delicious menu. And to top it off, they're now serving wine and beer. Great deals abound and they even often tastings. Plenty of tasty treats too, but not just typical coffee fair. They have excellent lunch and dinner options as well.
It's a student haven being across from Midwestern U, but the atmosphere isn't librarian at all. Some evening include music, poetry or comedy entertainment.
