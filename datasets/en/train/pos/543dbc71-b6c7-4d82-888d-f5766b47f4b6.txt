We got late (for LA) into Scottsdale.  Here things just started to pick up...
Our waiter was very helpful.  Really tried to male us happy and even said that.. Explained the menu and also told us he can make any thing we want (my wife likes to have her options...).
We ended up with fantastic house bread, very tasty salad, great veil Milanese!, spaghetti meat balls from great Kobe beef.
Dessert was a bit disappointing but is was part of a special week deal. 
The price was also much cheaper that we have paid at home.
