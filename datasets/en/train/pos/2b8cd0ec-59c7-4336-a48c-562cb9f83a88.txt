Finally an upscale Chinese buffet, where have you been all my life? Away with the mess hall atmosphere, since it is in the old Claim Jumper restaurant, the seating is nice and secluded. Sushi station has a ton of variety and the other choices are plentiful and high quality. The cream cheese wontons are the best and the fruit is cut up, ready to eat - even the oranges came out of their peel. Don't even get me started on the desert selection. Well, if you must, I tried the straw mouse and the chocolate mouse, both delish and even the mundane chocolate or tapioca pudding is served in appetizing little containers reminding me of the wicked spoon in Las Vegas. So much better than the piles you get at other locations.
Absolutely my favorite Chinese buffet from now on, I shutter now thinking of my old digs.
