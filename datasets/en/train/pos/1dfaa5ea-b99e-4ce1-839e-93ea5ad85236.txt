I choose to recognize awesome.  I choose to recognize greatness in the common man, or woman hair cuttress in this instance.  I choose to scream it to the heavens that Debbie is a goddess of the hair cutting arts.  She is all there is and all there will ever be.  She is the standard by which all hair cutresses should aspire to be.  I will never let another touch my hair again.  For I, and my hair and my family's hair are with Debbie, forever...
