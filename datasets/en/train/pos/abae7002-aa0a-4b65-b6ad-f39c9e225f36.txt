We ordered a sampler and voted that pulled pork and pork ribs are indeed tasty and delicious. The home made Root beer was an added perks, we like it very much too.
This restaurant started in 1998. After more than 10 years in the business still they have maintain the food quality and the cleanliness of this place. It's definitely one of the places in the valley that we would visit when we crave for BBQ.
I am so impressed with the review from some organization so I decided to take a photo. You'll be the judge.
