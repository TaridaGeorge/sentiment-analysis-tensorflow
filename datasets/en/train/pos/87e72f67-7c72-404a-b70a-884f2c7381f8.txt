What are my favorite kind of services? Fun services!!!

This place blew my mind at the size, and the amount of hat choices. The only complaint I have is my boyfriends large noggin size - not a single one-sized fits - all hat could fit him - but I found my captain hat for $2.50. Best price I've ever found for a themed party...

This place is great.
