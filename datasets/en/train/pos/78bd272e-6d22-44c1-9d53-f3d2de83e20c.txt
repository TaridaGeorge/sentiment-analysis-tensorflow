While visiting family in Arizona, everyone said we had to go to Glendale to see the Glendale lights. Well we went a little early and the stores were still open...YES!! I spotted The Pink House on accident and HAD to go in.  My poor boyfriend. I was like a kid in a candy store and I d-i-d n-o-t want to leave. It was like going to an Etsy store, I loved the unique handmade jewelry and clothes.  I  believe the owner, Danica, happened to be the one to check me out and she was a gem. She was so helpful and personable and led me to more stores in Phoenix that had the same FLAVA! I just wanted to pick up the whole store and take it home with me. Definitely a cool gal's go-to store.
