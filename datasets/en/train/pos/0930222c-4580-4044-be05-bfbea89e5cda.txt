I frequent RnR quite a bit for happy hour.  I've been here tons of times since I moved to AZ.  Definetly one of the best happy hours in old town.  Happy hour from 4-7 LOVE IT (I get mad when places are 3-6- who gets off work that early??).  And pretty every drink is on special during happy hour.  Really cheap wine, beer, and liquor.  
Ya their food isn't orgasm AMAZING but it's pretty good.  I've havn't disliked anything I've tried there.  
I love the atmosphere and outdoor patio on both levels.
I've been for breakfast too and the bottomless mimosas are wonderful.  They keep em coming.  The food is good breakfast food.  
I take family/friends from out of town here for happy hours.
I love this place I don't get what the hate is about!
