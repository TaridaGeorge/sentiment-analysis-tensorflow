This place is amazing! The food is great, fresh and tasteful! The service is awesome, they make you feel as though you have been friends for a long time and the prices are reasonable. 

I had a hamburger that was apparently marinated or cooked w/wine, followed by a Mexican Chocolate Latte, it was great! 

I'll def. be back for more
