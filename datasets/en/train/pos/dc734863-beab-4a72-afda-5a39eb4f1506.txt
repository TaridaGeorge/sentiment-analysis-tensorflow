The only word i can use to describe this little hole in the wall is WOW. First i have to say that i have a soft spot for locally owned places with homemade offerings. This place's gelato is simply out of this world, i had a pint of half mango and half berries....both sugar free/vegan gelatos. I could go on and on on how rich and unspoiled these flavors were but i will let all of you make that decesion when you go there. So in this summer's heat head there you wont be one bit dissapointed!!
