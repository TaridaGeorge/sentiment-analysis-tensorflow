I recently bought a new vehicle and Tint Wizard was recommended to me by my boss. He has had 7 cars tinted with this company. My experience was nothing but perfect. Lenny (what a personable guy) not only gave me an appointment sooner than I expected, my vehicle was done in an hour and a half. Although I had my boss pick me up so I could work during the installation, there is a very comfortable waiting room there. On top of this, the cost was extremely reasonable for what I had done. I expected to pay more. It has been three weeks since I had this done and the tint is laid down perfectly as well as protecting my interior from the hot Arizona sun. Thank you, Lenny. You and your team rock!
