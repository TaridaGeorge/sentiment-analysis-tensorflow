We drove a ways to find this bookstore and was not disappointed. Found many books in the series I was reading! When I had looked for an author and had given up I finally asked the nice lady who worked there and she took me right to them!! I loved the organization of their books, my husband who reads a lot and can not always find ones to read that he has not already read walked out with quite a few! I know we will be returning!
