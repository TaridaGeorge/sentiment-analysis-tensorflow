Being a vegetarian, any Asian restaurant other than the Indian restaurants are always an adventure for me. And I loved this thrill ride. 

My room mate is Thai and he helped me order some of the BEST Thai food, I have ever had. He vouches for this place. 

Try the Thai tea and coffee. They are delicious.
The fried noodles were divine... 

And if you like uber spicy food, like I do, try everything "Thai hot". If you don't sweat by the end of the meal, please comment back!!
