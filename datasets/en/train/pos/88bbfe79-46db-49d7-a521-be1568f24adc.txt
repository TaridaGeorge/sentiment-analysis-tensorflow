I went to Phoenix  for a few days to work on a photo shoot. From the moment my cab driver pulled up to the hotel to the time I left, the experience was awesome. The staff was all friendly and helpful. I loved the attention to detail and the design. The bed was super comfortable and the food in the Blue Hound cafe was outstanding. I appreciate the ipod dock too. I pretty much stayed in the hotel the entire time I was there because it was SO hot. I recommend staying there.  Hopefully next time I stay there it won't be so hot and I can take advantage of the outside pool cabanas and bar! Kimpton hotels rock! Oh ya and they're dog friendly!
