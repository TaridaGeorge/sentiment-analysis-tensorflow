LOVE LOLA TAPAS!
The food is always amazing and I can not say enough about all the different specials!  I always take the waitresses recommendations and am never disappointed.
The atmosphere is great and I feel like there is a little central Phoenix community when I am sitting there.
As others have said the sangria is to die for.
