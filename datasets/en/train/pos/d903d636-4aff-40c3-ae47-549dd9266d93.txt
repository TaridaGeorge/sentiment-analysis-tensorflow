I had my first professional head shots taken by Jon. They turned out wonderful. He makes the shooting environment comfortable yet professional, letting you relax and enjoy the experience. Most importantly, he knows what he's doing and it shows in the quality of his work. I would definitely recommend him for your next shoot, whether it be portrait or event. As an actor, I've quickly learned how important trusting the photographer is. You can trust and communicate with Jon because he takes pride in his work. Two thumbs up in my book. Thanks Jon!
