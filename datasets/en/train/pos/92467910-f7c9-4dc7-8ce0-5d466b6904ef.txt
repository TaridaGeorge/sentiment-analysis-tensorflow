We ate here for Easter dinner with a special friend while on spring break. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The food quality was very good. In fact, one member of our group ordered a petite filet, med rare. It was not cooked properly. The waiter took it back immediately and brought another. The replacement looked like a 10oz or 12oz. And they took it off the bill anyway. Dessert was great and our wine selection was perfect. Although we don't live in Scottsdale, I can recommend this location.
