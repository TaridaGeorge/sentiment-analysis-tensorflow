We finally had dinner at basis on Tuesday night and we were very pleased. The only regret is that we did not go there sooner. We have lived in the area for 4 years and feel like we have missed out on many a delicious dinners! I had the special, it was salmon and my husband had the beef medallions. They were excellent; no leftovers, unfortunately to take home. We had to have dessert; creme brulee and ice cream with carmel sauce. Did I mention the half off glasses of wine? They have the deal on both Monday and Tuesday. 
We were thrilled to have dined at such a simple, delicious, welcoming establishment and we look forward to getting back there again very soon.
