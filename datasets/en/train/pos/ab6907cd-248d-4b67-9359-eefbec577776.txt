I had a really good experience with this store. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. On the two separate occasions I went in, the different staff members asked and were interested in what kind of running I was doing. One even suggested a race that I would like to participate in. I liked the whole shoe fitting process. I felt it was very thorough. The price is about the same as you'd find everywhere else. They have a great selection as well. Really enjoyed the atmosphere here.
