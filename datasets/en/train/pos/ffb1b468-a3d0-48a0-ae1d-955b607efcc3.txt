They have recently renovated! I have been going here for years and I consider it the best Chinese place I have found in Phoenix, hands down. I'm excited about the renovation because it's actually very nice to sit down in now. Very clean, consistently good food with great flavor. I never feel bogged down after eating here. The service is very friendly. They have a really nice menu with a ton of different plates that are all under 10$. Most of them start at 6.95 which is dirt cheap for the quality and quantity of the food you get. I love the pork fried rice, Snow pea pork, garlic chicken, chicken and broccoli, kung pao beef/chicken, and crab rangoons. They also have free delivery. Yum!
