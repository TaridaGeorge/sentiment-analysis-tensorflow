Great sandwiches here!

I had the chicken walnut sandwich and really enjoyed it.  You can tell that they use fresh ingredients and everything is hand made.  The chicken salad was very flavorful, super cold and served on rye bread.  The little chucks on walnut make a huge difference.  With every sandwich purchase you get one of the "famous" cookies.  It was delicious!
