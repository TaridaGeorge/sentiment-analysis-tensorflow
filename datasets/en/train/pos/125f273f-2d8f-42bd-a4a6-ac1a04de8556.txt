I have been a patient at Dr. Koerperick's office for over a year. I had several cleanings and just recently a crown procedure. The crown was also recommended by my previous dentist.  Dr. Koerperick listened to all my concerns. He is gentle and made me comfortable during the crown procedure. He also kept giving me updates during the procedure, which I really appreciated. It was painless and I was able to relax.  The hygienist uses a very gentle touch.  I no longer mind getting my teeth cleaned with the ultrasonic scaler. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is calm.  My husband left his previous dentist and is now also a patient. I hope to be a patient for many years. I highly recommend Dr. Koerperick .
