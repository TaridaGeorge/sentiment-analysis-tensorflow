I haven't been inside the actual restaurant, so I can't comment on that, but I've tried their sandwiches twice (once at a party, and once from my boyfriend bringing one home).  I had the roast beef with horseradish mayonnaise both times, and it's absolutely delicious.  I think one of the coolest things about this place is that they have tons of different sandwiches, and you can pick from a variety of different types of mayo or dressing for your sandwich. 

The roast beef is, I believe, on sourdough bread, and as the other reviewer said, the meat comes piled high.  Bread is delicious, horseradish mayo is delicious, and the meat is super tasty.  I'm craving one right now--wish it was closer to my work!  

I look forward to actually going into the restaurant and trying the lemonade that the other reviewer mentioned.  Will update my review once I do!
