I absolutely love Ace stores.  It's a clean store, they are very friendly, helpful and usually have what I need.  The one time they didn't, they researched it (rare item, didn't even find one for sale on the internet) and got back to me in a timely manner.  They weren't able to find the item; but, they found a much more affordable alternative!  :-)  That's worth 5 stars in my book!
