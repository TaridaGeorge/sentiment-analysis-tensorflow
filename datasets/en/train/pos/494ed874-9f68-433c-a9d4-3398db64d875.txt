I've always have gone to LGO after Postino and to get a dessert. I finally can now say I've had food that wasn't sweet.

The commuter sandwich was great. The muffin is awesome and the meet, egg and avocado really makes this a great sandwich for breakfast or brunch.

The one down side is the parking and trying to secure a table because of the popularity and good food being served here!
