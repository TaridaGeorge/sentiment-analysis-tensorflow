It takes either a great or horrible experience in order for me to write a review. Thankfully, my experience at MyoSymmetrix was a great one!

I went there because I had a Groupon but I would happily go back and pay full price.

Chad was very nice and made me feel comfortable right away. He was also very knowledgeable and used a variety of techniques to create a custom massage just for me. I appreciated it since you normally have to pick just one technique. 

I usually have a hard time relaxing during a massage but I was able to here. We chatted on and off throughout the session, Chad really cares about his clients. 

I left feeling relaxed and could feel the difference in my body. He is truly wonderful at what he does and does a great job of taking care of his clients.
