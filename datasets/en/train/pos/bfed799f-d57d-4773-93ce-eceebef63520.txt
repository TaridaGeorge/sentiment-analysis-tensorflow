I have always made my own skirts but my eyesight isn't what it used to be.  That being said, I had stockpiled fabric over the years.  I brought Lana a skirt that I wanted duplicated.  Her work is wondeful.  She's very professional and my skirts were done in less than 2 weeks.  I love longer, full skirts that I'm not usually able to find in stores so the cost was well worth it.  I can't wait to make the trek to Mood Fabrics in LA for spring fabric.  The cost per skirt was $95-still less than Nordstrom's and it's priceless to not have to settle for what's in the stores.
