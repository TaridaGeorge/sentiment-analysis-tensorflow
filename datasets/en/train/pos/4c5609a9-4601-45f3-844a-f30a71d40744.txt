I met my brother for lunch, since I was working near his work hood.  This place is bright, clean and modern.  We were quickly greeted by the host.  As soon as we sat, we were greeted by the server.  Got our drink quick and took our order.  I ordered the Meaty Italian pizza.  OMG, the crust was thin and crispy.  Really good.  Very GOOD.  I likey!  My brother woofed down his spaghetti and meatballs.  

Great food and service, whats not to like?
