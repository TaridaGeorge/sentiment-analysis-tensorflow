Love this place.  Great food, large portion sizes, great service, and reasonable prices.  All Big Fat Greeks are pretty much the same to me and I love them all.  I know its not hoity toity fancy schmancy, but I don't care.  I enjoy prompt service, large portions of good food, and consistency and this place delivers all 3.
