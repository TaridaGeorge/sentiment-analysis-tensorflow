I love hole in the wall places where food is good, owner who works the kitchen and they know what is good food. Olympic Gyros is one of those spots that i make sure to stop by once or twice every week for lunch. Few places where you can have a full meal for under $10. 

Tonight I was working late so went their during closing time and Steve the owner was cooking. He is a Chicago native who knows about food and we ended up talking a lot about food in phoenix, small business, what is good food etc etc.
