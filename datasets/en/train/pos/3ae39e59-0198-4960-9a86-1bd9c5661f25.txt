Tina did an AMAZING job with our April 2011 wedding in Phoenix. I had seen her work at a friend's wedding and knew we had to have them! Her artistic touch made our day come to life in photos, and we've heard from tons of folks that we have the best wedding pictures they have ever seen. Tina and Angie were so nice to work with, kept us on schedule and shared many laughs with us. I can't recommend them highly enough - they are truly talented!
