I love this place! I've been here a few times now with co-workers, and everytime I come, I leave with leftovers and content with my experience.

The service is great and fast (important for those on a time budget), the food is really good, I enjoy the Mongolian Beef and Kung Pao Chicken, and the prices are very affordable - $6 to $8 for the lunch special. 

It's definitely worth a try!
