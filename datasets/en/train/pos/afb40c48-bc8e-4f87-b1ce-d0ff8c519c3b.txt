eco-fresh is great!  highly recommended.  

they came to my house, picked up my (very) dirty, beloved 12'x8' wool rug.  i was in the middle of a move and we arranged for it to be delivered to my new address, which it was with no problems.  my rug is now soft and beautifully clean, with no chemicals!  they really did a wonderful job!  the price was just what they quoted me and totally, totally worth it.
