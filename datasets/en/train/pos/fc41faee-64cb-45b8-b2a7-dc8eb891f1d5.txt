This place is outstanding!  What a great experience and fabulous yogurt!  They have 12 different flavors, and many I have never seen before. We love self serve yogurt and have been to many of the yogurt shops across the valley. This place is by far THE BEST and we met the owners too!  Great people and care about their customers.  We will be here all of the time.
