I look for four things when I go to eat: easy parking, clean place, and a great breakfast at a modest price. Berthas has all the above. They have more parking than the place needs. The place is nice looking and clean. You can eat inside or outside. Inside has some nice looking art work on display as well as a hot skinny owner. The breakfast is really good, and fills me up. I try to top off my meal with an English breakfast cookie when I can. So when I am in the neighborhood I go to Berthas.
