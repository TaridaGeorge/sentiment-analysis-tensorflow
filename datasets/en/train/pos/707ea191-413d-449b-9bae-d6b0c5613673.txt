HEAVEN. I just had what I can only describe as the most delightful dining experience of my life...

From soup to nuts Petite Maison rocked it. Service was wonderful, and was what service should be in every restaurant. Our waiter was a professional, and treated his customers with much respect. He was extremely knowledgeable about wine and food, but explained it in a way that lacked any condescension. I think we've all had that person who knew more than you, and made sure you knew they were superior. Not one ounce of that here at all!

The food was all wonderful. I am not going to go into all the boring details, because I am sure you have a life and other reviews to read. Just go yourself, and experience Petite Maison. Make a night of it, take friends, or a date, but just do it, & soon!
