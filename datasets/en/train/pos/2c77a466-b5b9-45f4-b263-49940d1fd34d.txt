For what this place is, its a winner compared to Denny's, Coco's, or other joints I'd put in the same category. Its fun for kids, with its Bear theme. I have had the fish fry and prime rib specials, both of which were really good! More than generous portions, this place will really fill you up! Avoid if you are on a diet! Great, friendly, attentive service too. The other location in Avondale is the same, just as good.
