So I've been out biking all afternoon and it's still a gorgeous day so I want to sit outside somewhere and eat something. I stop at this little Gyros shop in an obscure corner of Papago Plaza for the sole reason that it has a great outdoor seating spot -wide, well shaded, far enough from the street and a decent view over Skysong with a bit of the Supes peaking through.

And the food is fantastic!! I had the chicken Pita, which was astoundingly tasty, with a great salad and it's $6.25? How is that possible? And the service (I think that was George?) couldn't have been better. And the place inside is clean and bright. 

Nobody could ask for more.
