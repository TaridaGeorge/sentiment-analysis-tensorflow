In the process of changing from state farm to Allstate with Ian & Shelley.  They didn't think they could touch the rates that I am paying...guess what they blew them out of the water!!!  Much Much better coverage for the same monthly costs.  It's really a no-brainer when dealing with insurance to go with the company that cares for it's client to make sure you are covered where you need to be!
