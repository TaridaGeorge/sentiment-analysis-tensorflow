Yuri's Popcorn is NOW open at Hilton Village Shopping Center on Scottsdale Road and McDonald.  I seriously cannot STOP eating it.  I bought the banana and cinnamon flavors.  She is very reasonable and also makes wonderful gift baskets.  You must stop by but be prepared to become addicted!!  The best popcorn I have ever had!!
