Ok, look for $1.50 to get a big hot dog or Polish Sausage.. and free refills how can you argue. This place has never dissapointed in that special. I live within a mile and when I want a quick midday meal or just a easy dinner this fits the bill, and if I want to splurge I get the sundae. For around $3 I get a nice meal.
