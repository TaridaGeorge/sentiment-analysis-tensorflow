I ended up at Practical Art randomly a few weeks back.  I love the concept of art that is somehow useful in a literal way (although figuratively useful art is also fantastic).  I'm a sucker for businesses like this and wish I didn't live in a tiny guest house so that I could justify  more practical art in my world.

With the holiday season coming up, I'll be sure to stop in and see if I can find a unique, locally made gift for someone that I adore.

The time I did purchase something was this adorable purple glass night light and every time I see it, it makes me smile.  A definite stop in!
