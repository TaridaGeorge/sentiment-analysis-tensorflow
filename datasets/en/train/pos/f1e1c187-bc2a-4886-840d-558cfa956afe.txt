I work 6 days a week, so it's really hard for me to find time to take my two Yorkies to the groomer. I was looking for a mobile groomer and Jay was recommended to me. My dogs can be really rambunctious and loud around strangers, but Jay was gentle and patient with them, very professional. He did an excellent job and was very affordable. I definitely plan on using him again.
