Postino is possibly my favorite place in the Valley.  The wine list is divine, the apps are delightful, the setting is relaxed but not too casual. The happy hour can't be beat, but it gets packed fast.  The bruschetta is nearing infamy at this point. I've never had a bad experience, and even hosted my sister's bridal shower here once. Love, love, love this place.  The downtown location is newer and super cute, and the food is just as great as the one on Campbell.
