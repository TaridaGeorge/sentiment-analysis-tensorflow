The Vig rocks.  The biggest, best priced Hangar One martinis in town and the food is always excellent.  After 3 years in the neighborhood, the Vig has become an Arcadia fixture.  The staff are among the best and friendliest in town and then there is the food.  Always very tasty and fresh, with a great variety.  The specials make it even more difficult to decide what to order!

The best part of the Vig is Sunday Funday/Sunday School on the patio.  On a sunny Sunday afternoon, there is no better place to be in Phoenix.  I took two friends there who were in from Seattle and Raleigh to run the Rock n Roll Marathon to celebrate their run, and it was  a hit!  

The Vig never disappoints.
