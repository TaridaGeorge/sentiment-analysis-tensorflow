This place delivers.. ok maybe not literally, but it does bring the goods to the table and my tastebuds!

I have been here about 5-6 times so far with some good friends who showed me the place. The owner and his wife are a class act and have a good thing going here.

Check the place out, shake the owners hand and have the maple hot wings.


Tv and projector is nice and the bar seemed to be filled full of jolly people too, nice place to catch a game.  Wings are only 2.50 a lb on mondays!

Hope others see this and give this place a try.
