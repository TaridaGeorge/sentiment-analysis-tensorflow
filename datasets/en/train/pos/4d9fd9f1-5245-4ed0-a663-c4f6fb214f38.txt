Don't let the line fool you, it goes quick!  

The first time I went I was a little daunted by how ordering actually works but once we found out how it was simple.  The food was really good.  Not extremely filling, but filling enough.  I got the sampler dish and everything was good. As said before, the root beer cannot be better.  It is a very unique restaurant with great food.
