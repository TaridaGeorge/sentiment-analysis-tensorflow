Two different friends from two different circles pointed me toward Golden Buddha at COFCO Center. I was not disappointed. My eternal quest for the best General Tso's Chicken has not been satisfied since the Jasmine Tea House in Globe, Arizona closed...but Golden Buddha is the best Tso's I've found in Phoenix so far. 
The venue exudes a cultural ambiance that is far superior to the stereotypical zodiac placemat. There is even live piano entertainment in the dinner hour. Friendly and knowledgeable staff also a perk!
