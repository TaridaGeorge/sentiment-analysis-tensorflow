A friend took me here for our weekly lunch and it was a really cool dining experience.  It's very no fuss, it's set up like a fast food place, you look at the menu on the wall then order from the person behind the window.  Then they give you a buzzer that will go off when your food is ready while you go pick a place outside to eat.  The food is amazing!  You can tell how fresh everything is and it's cooked great too.  I can't wait to go back and get another great burger!
