Definitely one of the best places the valley has to offer. The park itself is so close to everything, yet it is huge. You can get a good hike/workout in and be back home in time to hit the pool.

The layout of the park is pretty easy, and it would be hard to get lost if you are hiking one of the established trails. Having hiked most of the central and eastern sides of south mountain I can unequivocally state that there are trails for all abilities. And your dogs will love it too as long as you keep them out of the jumping chollas. 

Watch out for rattle snakes when the weather warms up. I have not seen too many, but they are out there.
