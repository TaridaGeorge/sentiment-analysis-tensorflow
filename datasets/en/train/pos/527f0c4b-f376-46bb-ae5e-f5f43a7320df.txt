This place is so delicious!!  I've never even heard of eating chicken and waffles on the same plate, until this place opened up in my neighborhood.  It kind of reminds me of Thanksgiving dinner-with a lot of sweets and meat in the same mouthful!!  I wish it was a little less expensive, since I can make chicken and waffles at home for a fraction of the price, but I have to admit.... my homemade chicken and waffles could never be  NEARLY as delicious as Lo-Lo's.  ;D
