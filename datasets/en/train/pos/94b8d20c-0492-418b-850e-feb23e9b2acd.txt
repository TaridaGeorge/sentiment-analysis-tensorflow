I've always enjoyed food trucks when I'm in New York because they are cheap, fast and convenient, so I had to try this place.
I live within walking distance from here, so I have no excuse for not going sooner. 
Well I finally checked it out this morning  and ordered a vegetarian hotdog with all the spices and relish on a pita bread. 
I have to say that I concur with the other yelper's commentary. Yum! :)
