Lo Los has the best fried chicken I have ever had.  Light, crisp, fresh, and delicious. If you love fried chicken or just amazing food this place is more than worth trying. Red koolaid in jars, eggs, waffles, and chicken to die for....mmm.  Its located in the hood a little bit but dont let that scare you.  This chicken is worth a bullet or two.  The building is a converted home into a restaurant thats been around for years.  Inside the setting is funky and cool.  Theres usually a wait and on a hot summer day that can be pretty hard to do outside in the heat with only a small canopy of shade and a rotating fan with a mister.  However, the wait will pay off when your food arrives.  I recommend going when its cooler outside so its not so miserable.
