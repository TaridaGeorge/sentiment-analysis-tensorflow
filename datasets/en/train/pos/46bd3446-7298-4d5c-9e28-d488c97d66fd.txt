I have been to Olive & Ivy many times for happy hour and dinner, but my first time for brunch.  I went with some girlfriends and it was a perfect spring-time girls get-together.  I had the Cinnamon French Toast, which was amazing and my friends had the mixed berries with yogurt, also delish!   I was surprised at the portions (large) and the price (reasonable).  Would love to go back for brunch and try something new.
