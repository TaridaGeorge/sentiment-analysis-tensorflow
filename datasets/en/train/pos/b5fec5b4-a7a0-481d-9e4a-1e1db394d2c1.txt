I also love this place!   My sister mentioned a "pizza place" she saw on yelp, this place is so much more than just a pizza place though ... very well-rounded ....great food, reasonable prices, nice ambience.   We had the duck sandwich and spagetti bolognese....they nailed both dishes....we left very happy.  Go here before it gets too busy (we went on a weekday at 12 and got seated right away..i can see this place becoming over-crowded soon).
