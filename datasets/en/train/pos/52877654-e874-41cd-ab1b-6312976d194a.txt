I have to upgrade a star, because for a SLICE place this is it!

I devoured 3 Slices of the Chicken Pesto, OMG that tang from the feta cheese was so damn good, it needed more if you asked me, I also picked off the chicken not that it was bad I just preferred it without (see pics)

Yum Yum!

Also a tip= I like to ask for my slice extra crisp!
