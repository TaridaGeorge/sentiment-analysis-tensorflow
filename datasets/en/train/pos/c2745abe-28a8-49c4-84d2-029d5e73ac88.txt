Western Town with fun for everyone - great western store too - and homemade fudge!  Kids are never, ever ready to go home.  We've been back time and time again - wristbands for the kids = hours of rock climbing, petting zoo, burro rides.  Margaritas from Pete are the best - dinner in the Steakhouse is always extraordinary!
