Amazing! We went there for Sunday Morning Brunch.  I had the Quiche with tomato coulis and Justin had  the Croque Monsieur with mornay sauce.   We also had  the beignets with a red wine reduction.  The sauces are amazing.  
Love how they decorated see my attached pictures.  The space is so warm and cozy and the staff was amazing.  Chef even came out of the kitchen to welcome us and talk to us about the food.  Their outdoor dining area has a fireplace and looks very inviting now that outdoor dining in AZ is here.  
Can't wait to go back for dinner.  Everyone has to eat here and plan to stay and hang out for awhile in this new little cozy restaurant.
