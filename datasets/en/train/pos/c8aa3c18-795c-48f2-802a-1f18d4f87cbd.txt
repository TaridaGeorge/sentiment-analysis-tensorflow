I love this place so much! If you are an oatmeal fan you can't pass up the oatmeal cookie yogurt at yogurtology! Its so amazing! With bits of real oatmeal mixed in- its incredible. The tart is also supererb and the cheesecake is my 3rd runner up.The prices are really good here too compared to many other yogurt places around.

Being situated a couple doors down from my sisters closet in the town and country center, this place is golden in my book!
