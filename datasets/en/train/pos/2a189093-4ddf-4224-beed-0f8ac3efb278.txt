Better luck next year guys.  The Phoenix Suns are the pride of Arizona when it comes to professional sports.  Let's face it, we have some pretty sorry sports teams here.  

They're the only local team (a star studded team loaded with talent) that actually wins consistently, and they're a class act on & off the court.

Cheers to the Suns - my second favorite basketball team (close second).
