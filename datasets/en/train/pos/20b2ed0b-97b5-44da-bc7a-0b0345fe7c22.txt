I loved this spot! I didn't realize that it had been there for about a year, found it in the New Times.

The wait time wasn't too bad (20-30 minutes, but the bar is a great spot to wait! Very good selection of beer (several that you do not normally see on drink / beer lists). Service was great! Our server had great suggestions, and we are so glad we listened to him. Dessert was very good, too! Atmosphere was wonderful (went in October, so it was perfect to sit outdoors). I definitely suggest this place to anyone, and look forward to hopefully going again, soon!
