So far I've only been to Sally's for the breakfast (but to be fair it was afternoon by the time I made it there) but I really enjoyed it. My waitress was super nice and attentive. 

The food was exactly what you want it to be - I mean don't come here if you want some fancy breakfast. This is diner food, and GOOD diner food. I had eggs, hashbrowns, toast, bacon and a pancake and it was greasy, fatty, buttered and everything that's so bad for you but tastes too good to pass up.

Parking wasn't a problem for me because I work on Mill so I have a parking pass but I could see that bumming other people out.

I think this is exactly what we needed on Mill and the fact that it's open 24-7 only makes it more convenient.
