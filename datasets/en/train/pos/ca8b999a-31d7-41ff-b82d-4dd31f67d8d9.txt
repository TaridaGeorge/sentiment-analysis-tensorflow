I need Mr Chaos to leave Ahwatukee and come move in next to me - seriously, there's available property and everything.

We got takeout from here and it was sooo tasty.  Generous portions, so we were all able to sample a little of everything.  Their crab puffs were excellent, and perfectly crispy on the outside.  I can't wait for an excuse to go get another dinner from here!
