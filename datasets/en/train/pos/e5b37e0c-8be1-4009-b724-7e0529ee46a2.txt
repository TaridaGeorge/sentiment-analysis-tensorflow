This place is 100% legit.

Service was fantastic, from our host to the waiter to the sommelier.

I had the filet which was the best I've had in AZ, cooked exactly how I like it with an amazing flavor.   

Our sommelier recommended an awesome cabernet that perfectly complimented the filet, Chad L. and I had no issues finishing the bottle ourselves.

All in all we had a fabulous meal, cannot wait to get back to Scottsdale and give this place another go.
