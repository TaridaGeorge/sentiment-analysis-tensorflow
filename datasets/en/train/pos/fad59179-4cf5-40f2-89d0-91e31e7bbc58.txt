I use Zen 32 for happy hour purposes of course and give it 5 stars. Its affordable and you can't beat free California rolls , crab puffs and various styles of wings. The service is pretty good and the bartenders are always ready to get you a drink when they detect your running low. The patio is great during the summer with the misters and the bar is a call place to have a drink after work or late night. The have TV's and also show games if you request. for my needs its a great place to start or end a night.
