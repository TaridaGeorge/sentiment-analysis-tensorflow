This place has it ALL for a successful night out.
1) Wonderful ambiance both indoors and out for a casual visit during the day or a romantic evening 
2) A healthy variety of bruschetta on the menu made with the freshest ingredients
3) Quick service 
4) Cute waitstaff if you're into the hipster type
5) Great prices, especially during happy hour

And $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta board??  Take me to heaven!
