I think this is my favorite go-to place in Phoenix for happy hour, dinner, etc.  Bruschetta is amazing here - artichoke is my favorite.  Soups of the moment (they change all the time) have never let me down either.  And their salads are really tasty.  Portions are big - even salads - so splitting makes sense - and they are really great here and split things on separate plates for you.  Love the wine selection - this place got me hooked on Tempranillo.  Place has a hipster vibe but really chill and the staff is super friendly.
