I really like this coffee shop.  Pros:  Natural light (practically sunny inside), super clean (even the bathroom), decent coffee, open and airy, couches, clever design (converted gas station).  Cons:  Located 3 blocks from my ex-boyfriend's house.  Since I live on the other side of town, I cannot come here ever again.  If I run into him, he will think that I am stalking him.  I'm not taking this well (the loss of Copper Star).
