Found Flores last year on Yelp after my AC went out. They were quick and got everything up and running. A year later the AC went out again and Michael was out quick again. He said that it was just a capacitor the 2nd time but he replaced everything that he had replaced the 1st time, just in case. Once this old AC unit dies I will be using Flores to replace it.
