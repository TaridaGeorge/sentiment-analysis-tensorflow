I highly approve of CityScape putting an Urban Outfitters in downtown. It caters to all the 20-somethings, like myself, who don't always want to drive to Tempe or Fashion Square for their shopping needs.
It's a 2-level store with the clearance stuff all located upstairs. That's usually my first stop. I found a great  throw pillow there for $5, plus numerous $5 shirts or $20 button downs for my hubby. It's one of our favorite places to shop.  Nice and friendly employees and ample dressing room space, also located upstairs. Things can be pricey, but it's something to expect at all UO stores.
They validate your parking, so don't forget to ask!
