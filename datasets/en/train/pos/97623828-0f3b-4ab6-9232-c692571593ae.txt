OMG! this place is amazing!!!

Service is #1.  They really look after you here.   


The rooms are fantastic, very comfortable, with fireplaces and wonderful bathrooms and overlarge tubs!    Depending on the room you can experience anything from a fully stocked wet/dry bar to a rather unique coffee/tea maker, telescope, secluded hammock and personal relaxing pool.    The whole entire hotel is wonderfully decorated. 

The pool and spa area is beautifully nestled (as are all the casitas around) into the architecturally perfect rock surroundings.   The hotel is so peaceful.  The pool and spa is colorfully lit at night, but the entire hotel is lit so that your experience of the stars is not interrupted. 

Great money saving tip is that you can take a very short walk to Pinnacle Peak Patio for Happy Hour, food and local brews in a great fun atmosphere.
