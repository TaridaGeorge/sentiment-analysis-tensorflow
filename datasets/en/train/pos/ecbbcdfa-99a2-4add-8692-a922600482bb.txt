My business is a part of the Scottsdale Chamber of Commerce and I attended a Chamber meeting this morning that Xona hosted.  Everything was great: the poolside views, the excellent breakfast, and the service was friendly and timely. 

I did not stay there but recommend checking out the resort.  I really had a great experience.
