The Pudgy Pup has been the answer to our prayers concerning daycare for our little puppy, and she loves it here!  Best deal, 3 hours for $5!  Its right by our house, so dropping her offer for 3 hours so we can run around or clean our house, its worth it.  We have taken her there for 8 hours once when we were traveling and working, and we have taken her for longer periods as well, and we've been so pleased.  They also are known for grooming, which is what they started out as being, and we've added their bath/brush service while we had her there for daycare, they even cleaned her ears, which we have terrible time getting near her ears.  The bath/brush was $24, and even though we had her there for 6 hours, they only charged us $5!
