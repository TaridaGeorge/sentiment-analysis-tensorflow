This place is awesome! Easily the best shopping experience out of all the antique stores in downtown! We were out looking for a dresser and before we could even ask the guy helping us offered to discount the dresser by $30 and to top it off we were not sure if it would fit in the car and he was willing to deliver it! Luckily it fit in our car because we were very excited to take the item home. Lots of awesome finds in this store but the people there make it even better! Will be going here often!
