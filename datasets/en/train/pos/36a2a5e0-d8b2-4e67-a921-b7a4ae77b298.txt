First Watch on Black Canyon Hwy in Phoenix has amazing service and very good food! They're worth the drive. You won't be disappointed. Coincidentally, I went there b/c it was right next door to the Courtyard Marriott. I have been back several times and continue to receive excellent customer service and delicious food. 

My favorite breakfast is their Tri-Athlete omelette; which I hesitatingly tried b/c it was a healthy choice but fell in love with it! Wonderfully roasted vegetables in an egg-white only omelette topped with salsa...muahhh, magnifico!!

For lunch I had their Pecan Dijon chicken salad...wow, another amazing dish full of flavors...good to the last drop!

And lastly, their customer service...always SPOT ON! Once we had only 15 minutes. Informed the always-welcoming staff and VOILA, an excellent breakfast in exactly 15 minutes. I'll be back soon! 

Thank you First Watch on Black Canyon Hwy!! You're awesome :)
