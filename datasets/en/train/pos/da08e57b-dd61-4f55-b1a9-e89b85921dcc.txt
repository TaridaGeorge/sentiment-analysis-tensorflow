My obsession with Jamba has increased over the years and I believe it started when my friend Aimee started working there! Aimee you need to pay for my rehab. Jamba is delicious! My favorite flavor is Peach Pleasure! MMM. Recently they added all fruit smoothies which are surprisingly good and good for you! They also give you a free boost with your smoothie. I usually get an immunity boost in my smoothies. I used to go to this location for breakfast back in high school at least once a week, and the staff was really nice and fast.
Here are some of favorite flavors:
Orange Dream Machine
Peach Pleasure
Strawberry Whirl
