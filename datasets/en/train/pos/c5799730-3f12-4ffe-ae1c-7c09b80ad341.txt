Doctor Doug is the best in town.  He doesn't accept most insurance so he's also probably the most expensive, but they will try to submit on the part of the patient.  Agree with others that the staff can be gruff, but when you deal with sick people all day long I can see why.  

Doc's motto is taken from Patch Adams in that "The secret of caring for the patient is in caring for the patient." and I can tell you first hand that he really means it.
