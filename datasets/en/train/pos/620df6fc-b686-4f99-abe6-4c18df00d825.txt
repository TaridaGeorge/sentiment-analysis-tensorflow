I can't give 4.5 stars, so the food quality and service pushes it to 5. I think the fare is a bit too high priced for the quantity of food, but the quality was outstanding, and the service was excellent. (We were in here late - around 10:30pm on a Sunday night.)

The atmosphere was *great*, it was 101 degrees outside still, but they have those misting hoses around the patio area, and the inside is a beautiful bar, and my date was great!

I would definitely go here again.

Orders: tomato bisque soup, sweet potato fries, and coconut shrimp appetizer.
