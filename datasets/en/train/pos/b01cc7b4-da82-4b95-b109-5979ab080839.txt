Cartel is the best coffee spot in Phoenix hands down. It is almost always busy and does take a while because the baristas take their time to make each drink with care and expertise. The whole staff is knowledgable and very nice.  The mocha is my favorite. It is not too sugary or sweet the espresso has great flavor and acid. It is my favorite coffee by far must go!!!!
