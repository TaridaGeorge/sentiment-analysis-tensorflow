I'm happy we have a second H&M and I'm happy this one isn't so filled with business clothes or clothes of a genre one might dime 'heroine chic' (or maybe that's just me). This new H&M has most of their lines, lots of everyday clothes (cute tops, skirts, sexy dresses) and some more casual things too as well as some business wear (not to mention the cute bikinis and lingerie - lingerie is always my weakness). I'd love it if H&M opened a third location a little farther south. Maybe in the Chandler mall?
