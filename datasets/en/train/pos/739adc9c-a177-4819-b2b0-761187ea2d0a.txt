I have seen a few shows at Mesa Arts Center and I have enjoyed every one.  The facilities are clean, the atmosphere is nice, and parking isn't too difficult.  I have only really spent time the Ikeda Theatre.  The seating is good, I have never sat in the balcony, but I have sat in the back section of the lower level and could still see fine.  The acoustics in the theatre are great, I wish that there were more shows that I would like to see there.  When I have some more time, I would really like to check out the rest of the facility in more detail, but from what I have briefly seen, the rest looks really good as well.
