Outstanding memories of this place...Valentines Day 1999...Absolutely first class service, highly polished cooking, but very conscious of its Southwestern surroundings, this place still stacks up against the best. If you can deal with amusing and effete clientele (bombed-out Barry Goldwater Republicans) then Vincent's well worth the expense.
