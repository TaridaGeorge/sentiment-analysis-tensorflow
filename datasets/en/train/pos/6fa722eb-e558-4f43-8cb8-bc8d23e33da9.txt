We go here whenever we get the chance. My only wish is for one over here on the West side of town. Be sure and try the Buffalo wings...they are very tasty. Roadies/Porkies are also a favorite. The Onion Brewski steak is very good too...come to think of it,everything I've tried there is good. Servers are friendly...never had a problem. I've visited their restaurants in Alabama,TN and now here in AZ. I'm a fan :)
