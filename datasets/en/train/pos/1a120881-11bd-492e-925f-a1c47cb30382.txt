The Insight Bowl is usually cool and the tickets can be had for cheap from a scalper, or free as there's tons of companies who get comped passes in the Valley. The biggest comeback in bowl history happened here in 2006 where Texas Tech was down 31 and rallied to beat Minnesota. 

Lately, this game has preceded the New Year's Eve "Block Party" along Mill Ave in Tempe. Check out the football game and skip the block party. I sold my tickets and went over to Casey Moore's instead. Oh and the drinks inside the stadium are all like 5 bucks, and 10 if you want a beer.
