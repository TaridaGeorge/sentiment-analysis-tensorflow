I came here for a friend's birthday party and decided to show up a little early to get a feel for the place. I sat at the bar and the two bartenders held great conversation and had lots of fun with the patrons. I came during happy hour and was blown away. At least for happy hour, the prices were phenomenal for what you get. They had multiple flavors of limoncello, which I'm a sucker for. There food was top notch. I recommend this place for groups or date night dinner. I absolutely loved the projector showing old black and white movies, a great touch.
