A vast variety of sheet music for instruments of every type. Very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  They also have music instructors who teach classes on an individual basis to students, just around the corner. A great place to buy accessories for your instrument, and they also have a small but high quality selection of guitars, both electric and acoustic. ALSO, this is the BEST place to get your guitar repaired and to do a maintenance check-up.  They have a quaint section of the store, designated specifically for instrument repair.  I have had both my acoustic and electric serviced here, and I've always left VERY satisfied with the quality of service and craftsmanship. Highly recommended. I've been a repeat customer here, on several different occasions!
