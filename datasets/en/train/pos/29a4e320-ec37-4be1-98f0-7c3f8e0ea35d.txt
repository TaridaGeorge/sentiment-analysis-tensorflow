I wish I had a place like this around before I severely reduced my soft drink intake.  Pop the Soda Shop is loaded with LOTS of soda.  They've got everything from the standards with cane sugar to egg-based cream sodas.  They also have a decent selection of water, energy drinks, non-carbonated (and non-alcoholic, of course) beverages, and candy.  You can even find kegs of root beer.  If you need a drink immediately, they've got cold drinks in the back. 

My personal recommendations are Frostie Vanilla Root Beer and Captain Eli's Parrot Punch.
