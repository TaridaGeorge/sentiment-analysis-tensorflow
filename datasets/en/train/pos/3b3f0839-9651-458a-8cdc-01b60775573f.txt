I love Mojo! This was my first time at Mojo and it was great. I love that you can help yourself and sample whatever flavor you want. I couldn't believe how each flavor tasted exactly like the flavor it was supposed to be. The chocolate cake tasted exactly like chocolate cake, the mango was an exact mango, the snauzberry tasted like a snauzberry. 

We decided on a combo flavor and did "skinny raspberry" and "white boy vanilla" with just a tiny bit of kit kat. It was soooo good. The raspberry was really tart and refreshing and the vanilla was a great compliment. This is a great place for kids or couples on a date. I can't wait to go back. If you go, don't forget to ask for a punch card!
