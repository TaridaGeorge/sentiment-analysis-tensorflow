Was a little hesitant about this place at first because of it's location... but it's delicious! Went for lunch the first time, which is a smaller menu and gets pretty busy. The pad thai and yellow curry were some of the best I've had. Now we regularly order take out from here and have never had anything we didn't like. Also has a great dining room/atmosphere. Best thai in chandler!
