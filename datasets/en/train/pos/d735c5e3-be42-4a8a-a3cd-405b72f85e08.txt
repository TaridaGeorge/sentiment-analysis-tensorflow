Interesting atmosphere and decor.  The burgers were great--the coal fire taste was juicy with the right amount of char.  The thicker cut fries were a welcome change and were totally addicting.  I tried the natural ginger ale and it was out of this world!  I couldn't stop going back for refills.  It's was very refreshing.
