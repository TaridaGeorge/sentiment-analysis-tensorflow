Great middle eastern food in Tempe! The chicken shawarma plate is tasty, especially with the home made garlic sauce. Some interesting drinks include the rose water lemonade, definitely a new way to spice things up.

The place is pretty small, on Friday afternoons it can get pretty packed. Parking sucks, but its ok since the food is so good.

A bit pricey for a small middle eastern restaurant, but the selection and portions do justice.
