Hidden gem in Downtown Tempe. When I first heard the name I thought I was being taken to a dive. Wow was I surprised! The location seems to be in a former residence with a casual garden surrounding diners eating al fresco. There is air conditioned dining available.The food is well prepared and reasonably priced. It is the favored location for entertaining visiting faculty and VIP's from ASU. It is a very popular spot for graduation celebrations so make your reservations well in advance. Parking behind the restaurant will spare you the unpleasant surprise of a parking ticket for those who linger beyond the parking meters 1 hour limit. The serving portions are generous. The deserts are equally delicious! Been visiting about 10 times a year for the past 12 years and always a great meal at the House of Tricks.
