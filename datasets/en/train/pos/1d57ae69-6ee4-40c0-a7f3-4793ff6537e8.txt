A fantastic lunch, and my favorite was the amazing cocktail I enjoyed.  I cannot remember the name of it but it's the pomegranate drink under the martinis, not to be missed!  

My husband enjoyed a steak and said it was really good, my mom loved her pecan trout, but she didn't love the slaw that comes with it.  My son enjoyed his Chicken tenders, they even come with a little package of two oreos!  The potatoes are delicious!!! Oh and the bread that comes at the beginning of your meal is really tasty as well. 

I can't wait to try dessert next time.

Also service was AMAZING!  We will absolutely be back again and again!
