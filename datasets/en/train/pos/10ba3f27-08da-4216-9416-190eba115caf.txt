I have been learning pilates for 5 years and have worked with 7 instructors over that time.  Ashleigh Miller is by far the best instructor that I have ever had.  She is very focused on technique and has helped me realize the benefits of movements that I have been performing wrong for years.  She never gives the same class twice and is always improving and advancing our level.  I can whole heartedly recommend her as an instructor.
