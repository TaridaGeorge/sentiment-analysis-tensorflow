We were looking for a place for dinner on a Friday night ... after driving past all the chain restaurants at Arrowhead with the long lines, we decided to try Line Thai instead.  No lines!  We had the Green Curry and Phad Egg Plant.  Both were excellent.   Everyone was friendly and the service was great!  However, the coconut ice cream was the best!  We'll definitely go back the next time we're in the area!
