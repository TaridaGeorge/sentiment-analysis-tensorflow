Incredible service and delicious food. Skip the wait with Pizzeria Bianco and come here -- this is where you find great pizza in Phoenix.

Highly recommend trying the 'fresca' dessert crepe -- ice cream inside a crepe with fresh fruit and whipped cream.

I also discovered my new favorite beer: Nimbus - Dirty Blonde - perfect beer to for tolerating 100+ degree weather. Try it. It rules.
