Best Pizza in Phoenix!  I already knew this, that's why we suggested it for my pizza lover brother-in-laws birthday dinner. We came here for a birthday with a party of almost 30.  We called a few hours in advance and since their party room was free they were more then happy to reserve it for us.  The service was awesome with such a hectic group, mostly paying separate checks, the waitress always had service with a smile and our drinks were always full.  There were several kids in our group, this totally could have been a disaster anywhere else but at Grimaldi's it was great service and excellent food as always.
