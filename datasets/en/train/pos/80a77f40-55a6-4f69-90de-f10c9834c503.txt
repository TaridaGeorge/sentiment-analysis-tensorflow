This place is amazing. Some of my favorites are the minestrone soup, Greek salad, spaghetti Bolognese, gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, fettuccine with white clam sauce and much more. Everything here is good. The sausage and meatballs are great, too. This is one of the places I miss the most after moving from the area. Hard to find really good Italian food like this.
