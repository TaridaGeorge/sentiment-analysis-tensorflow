I love the Bikini! It is my favorite bar in the world. The music is always way too loud, and the crowd is the best of any bar I've ever been to. The beer is super cheap, so make sure you just buy a pitcher...no one will judge you for drinking straight from the pitcher! It gets really busy on Tuesday and Saturday nights, so wear your dancing shoes, since you probably won't be able to find a seat anyways!
And don't forget to bring cash! They are cash only!
