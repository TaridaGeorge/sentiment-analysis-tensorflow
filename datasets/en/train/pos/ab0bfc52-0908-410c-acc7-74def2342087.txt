I've always loved this place. Came here a few years ago when they first opened up, and they offered us free soup, and ski because we have never tried it. While we were waiting for our food we had a nice conversation with the people there. They are extremely friendly and real chill people. The place is a very relaxing feel even when it is packed which as of it's gain in popularity it's always packed! Great for them because they deserve it. They have some of the best food in it's class in the west valley for a great deal you won't find no where else! 

Great prices for great food! Friendly staff and great environment! Go and try it out!
