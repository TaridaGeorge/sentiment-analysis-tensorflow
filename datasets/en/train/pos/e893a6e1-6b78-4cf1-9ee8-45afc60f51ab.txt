We went here last night for dinner and once again had an amazing meal! Even on Sunday night this place was packed. The service is always friendly and the food is delicious!  Now that the weather is getting chilly I don't think there is anything more satisfying then spicy thai food. 
We usually get the red curry with seafood and the drunken noodles but it seemed like everyone around us was having one of the soups (either Tom Yum or Tom Kra Gai). They looked good so next time we will try one of those.
