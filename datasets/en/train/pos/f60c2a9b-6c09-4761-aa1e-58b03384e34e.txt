I am currently on day 3 of my 5 day stay here.  Hands down this hotel is FANTASTIC!  The staff are incredibly friendly and aim to please.  The building and grounds are absolutely beautiful, clean and safe.  

The best part for me is the food!(I'm a Holistic Nutritionist).  As soon as I opened the in-room dining menu I saw "super foods" and so many healthy options. After that I knew I was in the right place lol.  

I have traveled the world and stayed at some pretty great hotels, but this place is top notch.  If I am ever in this area again there is no question that I will be staying here when I do.
