I don't care what the haters say! I love this place. 

Great deals on brand names that I just can't get enough of. Never any problems with returns. Gosh, I spend way too much at this place. I just can't help myself.

Want the best deals? go first thing in the morning. That's when the shelves are stocked. Don't park right infront of the building. I've seen two vehicles get hit this way. Park back a little further. Oh yeah, and right around the corner? Costco! Can't beat it!
