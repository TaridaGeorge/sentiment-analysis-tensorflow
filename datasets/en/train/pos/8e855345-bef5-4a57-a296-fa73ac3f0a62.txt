We were living in Phoenix temporarily, and our 2010 taxes were a bit complicated.  I read the other Yelp reviews and decided to give it a shot, otherwise I would have randomly chosen an accountant based on location.   

I was very happy with Mr. Gallacher.  He was very nice and personable.  He was not rushed, and made me feel very comfortable.  I'm a young woman, and sometimes people can make you feel intimidated.  But not Mr. Gallacher!  

We've since moved from Arizona, but I think I will have him do our 2011 taxes as well!  Its not easy finding an accountant that you really like!
