I almost wrecked my car when I saw the sign that a Postino's was opening up on Central.  Having gone to Arcadia many, many times I was thrilled to have one so close.  I have been to the Central location a zillion times and have to say that I have only had bad service once.   The Proscuitto, Fig and Mascarpone Bruschetta has been my favorite since day one and I could make a meal out of just that.
