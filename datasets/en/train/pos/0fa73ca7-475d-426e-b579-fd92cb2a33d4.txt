This is the finest dessertery & cafe to satisfy your favorite sweet tooth cravings. They serve world famous exotic Belgian chocolates- Leonidas, along with various types of coffees and chocolate drinks made with fresh molten chocolates. They also have sinful tasting pastries and do not forget to try their Gelato, Italian Icecream.
I even got some of these gourmet chocolates packed for friends and family back home.
It's conveniently located within the new Westcor shopping center at SanTan Village.
