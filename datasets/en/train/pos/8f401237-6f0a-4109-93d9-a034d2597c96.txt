They have Cinemasuites AND Fork and Screen. I was so skeptical the first time someone told me a dinner theater could actually be a pleasant experience, since usually you go and it's noisy and the food isn't as good as it could be elsewhere, and movie theater food is always suspicious anyways. But AMC actually trained their employees to serve food during a movie without being intrusive, and I've seen three or four movies with dinner and drinks now and had a great time every time. The food is actually good! Regular movie tickets cost enough anyway you might as well make a night of it and have dinner and drinks all at the same place. Speaking of drinks, they don't skimp on the booze either.
