One of my favorite hangouts in downtown Phoenix! Hanny's never disappoints! My friends and I usually visit on Friday or Saturday nights when they have a DJ. I love the music, decor, ambiance, food (my heart belongs to the cheese plate), the young hipster/trendy crowd and drinks. Even when it's crowded, you never feel ignored by the wait staff which is an extra plus!
