Been going to Juan's for over 10 years.  It is family owned, they are great people but don't expect them to be gregarious, they seem somewhat shy.  

This place has great family style Mexican food.  The salsa is not out of the can as some have suggested, it is fantastic.  The chips are a weak spot, not always fresh or hot.

I love the chimichanga and carne asada tacos.  You can't this quality and quantity of food for less than $8 anywhere else.  The beans and rice are also great, if not understated.

Another way to rate a restaurant is it's cleanliness.  They always get top ratings by the county health department.  They can get really busy at lunch and Friday nights, guess lots of other people think this place it great.  Another sign that the place is good....lots of cops eat there too!
