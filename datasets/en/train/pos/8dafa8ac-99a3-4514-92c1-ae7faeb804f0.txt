Love me some Brenna and Bronzeology.

She was able to squeeze me in last minute before my vacation. I'm extremely pale naturally, but she was able to give me a tan that looked like I had been on the beach for a few days, and it looks sooo natural! Brenna herself is super sweet and welcoming. Totally the kind of girl you'd want to hang out with...but I am a little biased to Midwestern transplants.

Prices are quite reasonable, especially for the results!
