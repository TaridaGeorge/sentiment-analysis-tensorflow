underscore the tastiness of the pita bread. so, so good. i was really sad when i realized i had finished my gyro feta pita.

french fries are really, really good. that's probably not why you would come here, but those little bonuses are memorable.

i also had a side salad and the dressing was unlike any greek dressing i've had before-slightly creamy, not to heavy, not too acidic. 

yum.

oh, very small dining area so you might want to call them if you've got a larger group.
