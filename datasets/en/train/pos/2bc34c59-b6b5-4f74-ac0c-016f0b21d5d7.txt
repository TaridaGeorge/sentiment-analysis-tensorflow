This is a wonderful independent establishment in a sea of corporate-bland food!  

The food is very fresh and quite reasonably priced.   I almost always order the pho, but the steak salad is just as good on a hot day.  Like all great soup bowls you are encouraged to add as much spice, basil and lime as you like.  Don't let the small size throw you off, this place is GREAT!
