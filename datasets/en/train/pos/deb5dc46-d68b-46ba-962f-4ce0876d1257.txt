This place is pretty incredible.  The california club and the breakfast buzz are probably the best items on the menu IMO... but seriously, you can't go wrong.  The only thing I've had that I didn't really care for is the Breakfast Burrito, but that was because it was just a little boring compared to the other choices on their menu.  It's a long wait in the drive thru 99% of the time, but it is absolutley MORE than worth it.
