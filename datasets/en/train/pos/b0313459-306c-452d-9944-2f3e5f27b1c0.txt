A new sub shop in a dying shopping center...risky move!  But with the nearest Subway a mile northwest of here, this was probably a great location if they can get the word out about their business.

 I'd say the shop is comparable to a combination of Subway and Jimmie John's. The bread was fresh and fluffy, and the vegetables were all crispy and generous.  They don't have peppercini peppers but they do have jalapenos.  

And, after telling the owner that our dog had passed away earlier today, he gave my daughter three free cookies, which I thought was a sweet touch.

The prices are on par with Subway, and for the money the quality is there. I had the tuna sandwich, and the tuna was quite fresh.

I'm happy that we have a new local sub shop!
