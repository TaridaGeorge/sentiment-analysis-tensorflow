If you love beer and I mean really love beer not get drunk but love the taste of beer this is your spot. I am a beer snob and if you ask for a sample they will give it to you without concern they are in the business of quality beer and the food is great too.

I have been lucky enough to be there while a live band played and it was a good equal crowd, what do I mean by this? In Scottsdale its a holier than thou attitude if you drive to downtown chandler there is no attitude. We in chandler know we are not Scottsdale nor do we dream to become. 

Downtown Chandler is a better place to have The SanTan Brewing Company. When I move back to PA I will miss this place.
