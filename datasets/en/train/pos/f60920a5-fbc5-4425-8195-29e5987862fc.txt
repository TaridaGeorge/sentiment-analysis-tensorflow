How can you not like Costco. Try going around noon on the weekends. At that time, there are so many samples to try you wont even need lunch. Beware of buying stuff you do not need. It's so easy to say, "WOW, that's a great deal," (in the cart). Fortunately Costco has a fantastic return policy, better then any around.
