I was seriously blown away at the sheer quantity of teas in this adorable local tea shop.  I could have spent hours there, smelling and tasting teas that I have never seen anywhere else.  

The owner was incredibly helpful and assisted me in choosing a bundle of teas to give as Christmas gifts.  She even wrapped them up in cute little bags for me, and sent me off with a big cup of tea to-go. She spent a lot of time telling me about her products, and her knowledge was phenomenal - I guess that is why she owns a tea shop ;)

This is definitely my cup of tea!
