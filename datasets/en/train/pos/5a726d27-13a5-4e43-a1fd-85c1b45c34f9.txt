We went because we had a coupon for buy one get one free, which was for a nine dollar value. I had the sampler, the boyfriend had the veal. Let me say that it started off with some of the best foccacia bread we have ever had and a salad with chickpeas and the best homemade creamy italian. Everyone in the restaurant was very nice and greeted us immediately. It was around 9 pm so we were there with only another table who knew the owners that were there. As far as our meals, they were fantastic! The sauces and noodles were perfect, the best we have found in town and especially in the north valley. We will definetely go back and cannot wait to try the cannoli next time.
