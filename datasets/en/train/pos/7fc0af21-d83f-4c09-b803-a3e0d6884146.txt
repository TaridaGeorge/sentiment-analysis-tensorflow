I have only had the Pho here, but it was really good. Flavorful broth, not too salty, with high-quality and fresh ingredients. I like to get the rare beef and tendon, and the beef is very tender, and they give a good serving of tendon. Someday I'll try some other things from the menu, but the Pho noodle soup is so good I just keep getting the same thing.
