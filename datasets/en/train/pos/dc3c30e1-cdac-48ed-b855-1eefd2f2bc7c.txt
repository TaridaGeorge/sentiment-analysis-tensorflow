Living here now, have lived here for over a year now. Things are very different. Management staff is darling. Maintenance is on the ball. Neighbors issues have been dealt with. There is police patrol on site at night. Place is close to everything downtown. Love it, love it, love it. Get here... ahaa, oh and BTW i am not getting paid to say this.
