Definitely one of the finest restaurants in the Phoenix area. It will cost you, but well worth every penny.

I attended a company function here awhile back. All I can remember is that I was very impressed with everything - the location, the decor, the menu, the service and of course the amazing food.

I suggest saving this for a special occasion.
