Stopped in the other day for the amazing 50 cent iced coffee promotion and ran into Brandon Webb from the Dbacks. He was getting some donuts, a breakfast sandwich, and an iced coffee. HE was as nice as can be and we chatted for a few minutes. Its glad to meet some pro athletes who spend time with their fans....
