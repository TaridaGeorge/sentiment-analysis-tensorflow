Hands down the best brewery I have been too.  Most of their beers are better than any other out there.  Yes, the Oatmeal Stout is better than Guinness.  The Pumpkin Porter should be on the menu all year long.  The food here is also amazing! I have not had anything here I found just eh.  Fun place to go, lots of cool people, tvs for sports....

If you have not been here, go, NOW!

Only bad part is parking kinda sucks since it is so packed.
