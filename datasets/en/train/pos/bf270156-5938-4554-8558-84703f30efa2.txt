As an attorney, I have needed to find a real estate company that can handle my client's needs. The Drummond Group has gone above and beyond what has been expected. They have helped manage properties for clients, helped others find homes and also worked with clients needing to sell their properties. Ed and Evan are great to work with. They follow through on what they promise. Also, if you have any questions whether a short sale is for you or not, these are the people to ask. They are up to date on all the different programs.
