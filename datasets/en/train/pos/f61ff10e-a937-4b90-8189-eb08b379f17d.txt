When you walk in, this place looks like a mess. Don't panic, just tell the staff what you are looking for. This could be a request for a specific bottle (how they know where anything is baffles me). It could also be a more general question, such as a style of beer or type of spirit. The prices are good for a liquor store and their beer and liquor selection are top notch.
