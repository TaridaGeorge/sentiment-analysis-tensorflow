Andreoli is an incredible find. If your looking for "true" Italian cooking this is the place for you. Some items are a little pricey, but you must realize everything is made with the best ingredients in the highest quality. House made pasta, bread, the best deli meat and cheeses  and baked goods. My favorite is the Caio sandwich , every simple but packed with so much flavor. Next time I will step out of my comfort and order a pasta dish.
