I've been frequenting Saparro's happy hour for several years, and for good reason.  Aside from beautiful decor and beautiful people, the half price sushi and super strong drinks keep me coming back for more.  Many a late night, I hit the reverse happy hour for a late night sushi craving, always leaving satisfied.   I'm glad I don't live closer to Sapporo, I'd spend all my free time and money there.
