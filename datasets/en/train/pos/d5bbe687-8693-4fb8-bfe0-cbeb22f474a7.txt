Lux has the best coffee in town, hands down. They roast the beans on site, never bitter like that overdone Starbucks stuff. My penchant for sugar-free vanilla latte's always satisfied here. Free wi-fi. The staff do some jedi mind trick and always remember my name. I can bring my dog, they remember her name too.

BOTTOM LINE: Sometimes I dream of this coffee
