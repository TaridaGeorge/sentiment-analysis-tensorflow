Although I have been enjoying the fare of PF Chang's since it opened, I decided today, after a visit that it was time to offer a review. In addition to this location I have also been to the Lynnwood WA and Minneapolis MN locations...all three offer exceptional cuisine, delightful ambiance and excellent service. 

Usually I enjoy the Broccoli and Chicken but today I decided to have my hubs favorite; the Mongolian Beef. We also ordered a side of sweet peas and started the meal with the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. Oh my gosh, I totally forgot how much I ADORE this place! 

From the food to the Mango Iced Tea, the extensive wine list and delightfully unique alcoholic concoctions...this is a great place to go either for lunch or dinner. And with waiters who actually seem to LIKE their job, you are in for a wonderful experience!
