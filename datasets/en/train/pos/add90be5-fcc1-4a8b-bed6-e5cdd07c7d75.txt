Wow. There are no words and yet so many words to describe what desert botanical garden is all about. The best time is to visit in the spring, after a winter of sufficient rainfall. Cacti bloom every year but wildflowers along the pathways and scattered throughout the gardens only bloom when there's been rain in the months prior to warm weather. This year is spectacular. So many flowers and so exotic, even if you've seen desert landscapes all your life.

The butterflies are on show and well worth the $3.50 extra to enter their tent. And abundant wildlife to boot! In the few hours we were here I saw jack rabbits, quails, butterflies, humming birds, iguanas, lizards...

Desert Botanical Garden is not only one of the best things to do in Phoenix, but for those interested in botany, it's one of the best botanical gardens in the world.
