Stopped by after meeting the owner at Social Media Phoenix Day and he hooked us up with a buy one get one free coupon. Then when we stop by a few days later, he is right there running the place with his dog chillin outside to great us as we walk in. 

This is a great neighborhood fro-yo spot. At a time where it's as easy to find fro-yo as it is to find gas for your car Aloha does what it can to set itself apart with the Hawaiian theme. (Dog outside the store!) The flavors were awesome and the toppings looked fresh. 

Unfortunately they are not located in our neighborhood, but they are near my parents place so we hope to be back by again. 

Protip: Grab a punch card so you can start earning yourself some free yogurt.
