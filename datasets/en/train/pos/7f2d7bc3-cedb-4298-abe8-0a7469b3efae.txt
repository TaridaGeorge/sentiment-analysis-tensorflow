Four Peaks is my staple!  If my friends and I are trying to decide where to eat and watch a game on TV, this is definitely a good choice.

There are SO many good things about this place:  GOOD Brews, one for every taste, great specials on happy hour and food, the food is amazing.  Try any sandwich on a beer bread, and you will be in heaven.

If you like pale ales, try the 8th street ale, by far my favorite beer, EVER!!!!
