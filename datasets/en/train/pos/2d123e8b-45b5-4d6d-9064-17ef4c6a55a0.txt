There's always good covered parking here and if you become a rewards member and are a frequent traveler- you can redeem points for free parking.  Plus- you gotta love that you can always snag a free bottle of water on the way out.  

I highly recommend that you go to their website before you check out though- they always have a 20% coupon available online.
