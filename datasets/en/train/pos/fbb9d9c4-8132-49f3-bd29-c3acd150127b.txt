Was there on a very busy Friday night. We were seated immediately, and received very good and friendly service. We had the Thai chicken lettuce cups , Yellow Curry chicken, and Kung Pao chicken entrees. Food was flavorful, portions generous, and fellow diners were very pleasant. The owner (Flo) was circulating in the dining room, speaking to (classy casually fashionable to well-dressed customers) and graciously asking how their meals were. So nice to see restaurant ownership that sincerely CARES about their product and customers.

Top-notch Friday night stop with a good happy hour and app specials, good for a Friday/Saturday night date, and I would highly recommend.
