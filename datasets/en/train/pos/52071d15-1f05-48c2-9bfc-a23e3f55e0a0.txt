Simply put, the finest dining experience of my life. We were seated by the window, which had a beautiful wall of fire just outside it. The service was perfect--great timing, attentive without hovering, good suggestions. Everything was perfect, from the wine to the gnocchi. I wish I could afford to eat there more often.
