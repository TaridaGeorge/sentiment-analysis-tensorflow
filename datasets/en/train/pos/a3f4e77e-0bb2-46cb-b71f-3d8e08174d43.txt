I've visited Steve's espresso once, but the cute bistro made the best Dirty Chai I've had in a long time!!!  The atmosphere of the place is great and cozy, and the drink selection looks amazing! Next time I go I'm gonna try the Aztec Gold(or something like that) a chocolate spicy mocha that looked delectable!!  They're kinda in the corner of a cheesy strip but worth the drive for a good priced coffee drink!
