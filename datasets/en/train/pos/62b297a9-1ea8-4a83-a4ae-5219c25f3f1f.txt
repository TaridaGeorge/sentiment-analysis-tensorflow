For over 12 years monOrchid has been --and continues to be-- the center point of First Fridays. 

Wayne has kept it open through the tough recession with just grit and determination. I have the Get Your PHX work space in there, where I plan the Get Your PHX events and help my real estate clients with all their needs. It is a great place to work.

I'm excited about Songbird Tea and Coffee House opening soon. But I can also see that things are happening all along Roosevelt: new residential, restaurants and retail. 

monOrchid still has affordable collaborative work  space available, which gets you access to all kinds of creative industry folks. This will help boost your own creativity and your business.
