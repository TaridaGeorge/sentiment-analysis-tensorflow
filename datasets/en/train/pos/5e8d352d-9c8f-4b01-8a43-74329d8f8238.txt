I was recently in Scottsdale on vacation and my sister suggested a spa day.  She had heard good things about The Beauty Scene so we gave it a try. I treated myself to a facial with Logan and I'm SO glad that I did. It was 50 minutes of pure heaven. In addition to being so nice and making me feel welcome and relaxed, Logan was also very knowledgeable and helpful with all the questions I had about the treatment. I wanted to take her home with me so that she could give me weekly facials! Such a great overall experience, I highly recommend.
