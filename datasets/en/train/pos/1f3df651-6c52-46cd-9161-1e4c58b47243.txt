Excellent!! I have had EVERYTHING on the menu and was more than impressed EVERY time.  

The BEST Taco Salad I have ever had.  I lived in Salt Lake City for nearly three years and ate at Cafe Rio at least 1 time per week. I now moved to Phoenix and am willing to drive 30 miles to get a Cafe Rio Salad.
