Paul's Ace hardware is excellent, forget about HOME DEPOT and their big box baloney (or bologna), we gotta support these smaller local businesses.  Personally I have never met Paul but based on the customer service I've experienced as well as free popcorn I'm gonna have to go on record and say he probably is pretty kick ass.  Quick story: When I was there last 2 kids came in after school because they saw the free popcorn.  They politely asked and the man at the register if they could have some and he said go ahead, didnt make them buy 2 x 4's or a bucket of paint :).   Its nice to see some community and customer support/respect at its forefront!
