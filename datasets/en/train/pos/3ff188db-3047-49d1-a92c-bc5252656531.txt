John does a great job on my golden retriever. He is very flexible with his schedule and my dog loves him. John is very friendly and you can tell he is a real dog lover. My dog is always clean and smelling great. His prices are very reasonable and have recommended him to several friends that are as impressed as I always am. John does a through job cleaning my dog and is very convenient that he comes to you!
