I love this place for chinese food. I am from the East coast and I was always trying to find a place that even compares to what you get in Boston or New York.This place is as close as you will get and they are so fast with delivery.I always get my food within 30 minutes and it is steaming hot. They are always friendly.I have never had a problem and my order is always correct..
I had given up on chinese food in this area.....and then I found them and so happy that i did.
They are as close to New York and Boston as i will get in this area.
