I recently got a $1.99 coupon in the mail for Park Avenue Cleaners and I figured "why not?" since I had several work shirts and pants that I had been procrastinating about getting cleaned.  When the price is normally $2.25/piece, it seems kind of silly that a $1.99 coupon would be a great motivator, but yeah, I guess I'm THAT girl.

But I was wowed by the nice and attentive service, the promptness of their same day service, and the quality work they did.  They do have a fee for debit cards but it is pretty negligible at $.50.  Keep in mind that they do not accept credit cards.  I would come in to this place regardless of whether I had a coupon or not!
