I'm addicted and I just can't get enough...just can't get enough!

In the past two months, I've eaten at 7 different sushi restaurants, including two in New York, and Toyama remains a slice above the rest. The intimacy of the atmosphere, the freshness of the fish, and the skill of the Itamae make Toyama an outstanding Arizona gem. 

If you enjoy traditional sushi and have yet to visit Toyama, be sure to make the trek to North Scottsdale and you will not be disappointed. Mo and Giro will cater to your tastes and they will create something delightful.  If you go this week, try the red snapper!
