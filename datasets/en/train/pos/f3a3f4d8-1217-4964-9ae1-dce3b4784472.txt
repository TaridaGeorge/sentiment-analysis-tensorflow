Very attentive service and very good food.  Also, I was impressed that the iced tea was nice and fresh.  So I am a dork and didn't try the steak or any of the beers.  I had a grilled cheese sandwich that was a gourmet masterpiece and every cheese lovers dream.  The sandwich came with a delicious tomato soup.  Also, split the artichoke crab dip.  It was good too.  I am looking forward to returning to try some beer and enjoy guy-watching.
