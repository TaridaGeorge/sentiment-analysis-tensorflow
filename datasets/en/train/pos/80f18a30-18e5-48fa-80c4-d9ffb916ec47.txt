I have received service here that is so outstanding I am sooo sold on Lowe's!
They are extremely customer service oriented, and if you buy a defective product from them they will actually make good on it by either fixing it or giving you another.
I've never had this type of service from anywhere else really.

Customer of Lowe's for life, and I bought all my ceiling fans, Levelor blinds and so many thing from them.  Great store here!!!!
