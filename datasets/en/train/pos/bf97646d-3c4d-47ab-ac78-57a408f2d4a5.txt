Hi there!!!!......I went with 2 co-workers of mine, Joyce and Maria. We had a great time! the food was delicious and the sushi was fresh! They have many options to choose from and the price was very reasonable (7.00 to 9.00 for lunch) The place looked very clean and the staff was very courteous. A good place to have lunch with a large group! I'm looking forward to my next visit! Yummy!!!!    xoxoxo
