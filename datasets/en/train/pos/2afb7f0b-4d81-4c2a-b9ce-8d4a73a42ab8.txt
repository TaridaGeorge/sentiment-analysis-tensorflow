What a loss for our area!  Kashman's has closed.  We drove there for our weekly Sunday breakfast and was stunned to see a sign on the door and that it was closed!  So we drove south to the other location to discover that was closed as well!  UGH! They were the best and I know their closing will make a lot of people sad.  Good luck to the owners and you will be missed!
