I am so glad that the Entertainment book had a coupon for this place.  A girlfriend of mine and I went for dinner and I just LOVED it.  I can not wait to go back.  We got a vegetarian sampler plate and the waiter (owner maybe?) threw in a free additional item on the sampler.  Everything was super yummy but I think my favorite was the collard greens.  Mmmmm.... I am craving it again.
