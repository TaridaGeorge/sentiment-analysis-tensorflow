Oh the Coach house! We've been here before but never during the holidays. Every year they win some kind of title for most gawdy light display, and if you drive past it you'll see why. It looks like the Griswald's house! However nothing had prepared me for the inside and all it's magical holiday spendor. Every inch of the place.....every wall, ceiling beam, corner, was decorated with holiday paper, tinsel, and lights. It was impressive. We went on a Friday night and it was packed with people!!! Their inside bar is a little small but the good thing is they have an outside patio area as well. 
This bar is a fun Scottsdale staple to check out anytime, but definitely during the holiday season if you want a hefty dose of Christmas cheer.
