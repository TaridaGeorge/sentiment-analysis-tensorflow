Ever since I moved to Phoenix about 4 years ago I had craved for a place with "real" donuts similar to the ones I'd find in the mom and pop shops in SoCal. I can gladly say I've found it! Not only are the donuts fantastic (they really do melt in your mouth) but BoSa is also open 24 HOURS 7 DAYS A WEEK! Staff was friendly and the prices are all super affordable. Needless to say I will be coming back for many future visits.
