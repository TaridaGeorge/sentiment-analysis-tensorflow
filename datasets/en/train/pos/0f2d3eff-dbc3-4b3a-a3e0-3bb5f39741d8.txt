We stayed at this hotel for one night yesterday and it was a blast. We got a room on the 19th floor with a beautiful view over the skyscrapers of downtown. The room was in a perfect condition and the staff had a great service level. Especially Lucy at front desk who helped us with a crib for our infant who wasn't supposed to follow us to Phoenix at first, but did and Lucy helped us out!
