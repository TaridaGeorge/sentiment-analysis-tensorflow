A fantastic spot for breakfast!  (Lunch is pretty good too!)  Fresh ingredients always make every dish a home run.  The staff is so warm - make you feel like part of the family.  The restaurant is located on a picturesque, old-time, americana, main street in Gilbert, AZ.  The line is usually long on weekend mornings, but it is always worth the wait.  Great food, authentic country atmosphere, homey-friendly service - it doesn't get any better than this in the Metro Phoenix area.
