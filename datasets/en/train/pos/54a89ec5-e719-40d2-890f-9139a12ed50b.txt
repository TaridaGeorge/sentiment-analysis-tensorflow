This place is awesome!  Got together with some friends I haven't seen in over a year.  They mentioned the Rose and the Crown.  As soon as I walked in, I felt at ease.  I walk in, and a couple people knew me, so it felt friendly instantly.
The staff is awesome!  Super-friendly and attentive, without being down your throat.
I told them to expect me back everyday.  Teehee!
