I went to an early morning yoga class yesterday and it was absolutely fantastic! I was greeted at the front gate and guided to the yoga studio. Cute studio space and very clean. Carrie's class was amazing! She is a great teacher and very knowledgeable! I am already looking forward to my next class at Inside the Bungalow!
