Coming from Texas I had high expectations....and Mastro's exceeded my wildest expectations!   Wet aged beef is my new gold standard for prime beef!  The bone in rib eye was the BEST I have ever eaten, and the unique bone-in filet was very flavorful and very unique!   The mac-in-cheese was the ideal accompaniment to our meal and the house salad was the perfect prelude!

In Fort Worth & Dallas we regard Bob's Steak and CHop House as well as Del Frisco's as the "go-to" prime steak houses.......Mastro's has easily eclipsed both of these fine benchmarks.
