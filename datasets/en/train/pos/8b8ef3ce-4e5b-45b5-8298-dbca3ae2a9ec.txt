I love PCG! It has to be my favorite restaurant, aside from Houston's. The brie appetizer is soooo yummy. And last week I tried the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich. It was sooo good. The bacon wrapped shrimp is good, but after two, you feel a little weighed down. It had some type of white cheese in it- not necessary. I shouldn't have tried it anyway- I am trying to be a fishetarian. They have great simple salads. And the cedar plank salmon is absolutely my favorite menu item. mmmmm.....
