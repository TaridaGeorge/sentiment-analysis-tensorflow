I'm a Portlander, and of every single place in Phoenix, nowhere feels more like Portland than Shady's.

This is good and bad. Come in on a weeknight, and it's like the PDX dives we used to hit in the early '00s, except everyone just kept aging and drinking. As I was texting this to my friend the other day, I followed it up with, "I mean, 'Amelie' is playing on the TVs right now. 'Amelie'." Another downside: the beer selection, while it's gotten better in my four years here, still kind of sucks. Then again, if they had 12 taps and a bunch of imperial IPAs and stouts, it wouldn't be Shady's, would it?

And yet, as I said before, it feels like home. It's only a few blocks away, and I love it.
