We went with reservations for our anniversary.  We were seated promptly, the wait staff was friendly and attentive, appetizers were delicious, fried zucchini and calamari, entrees were hot and tasty and large portions.  Had our take home entrees for lunch and dinner the next day.  All for forty bucks.  We will be back.
