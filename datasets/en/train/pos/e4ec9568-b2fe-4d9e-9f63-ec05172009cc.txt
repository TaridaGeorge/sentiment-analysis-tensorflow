Five stars for customer service - everyone at this resort is HELPFUL!  It is a beautiful place with every room, I believe, overlooking the golf course.  We always relax in these environments.  I think the beds here must be the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in, anywhere - so much so that I may buy the same brand for home.

The rooms are beautifully decorated and they have just what we needed for our relaxation.  There are lots of good restaurants nearby, although there's not a restaurant in operation at the resort itself.  We called a local delivery service one night, and frankly, that was a great meal.  We got to just relax and enjoy our room.

I have to laugh at all the towels folded into swans - cute, but a lot of work for the staff.  We completely enjoyed ourselves and we will stay again.
