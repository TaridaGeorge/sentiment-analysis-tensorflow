I'm writing this review from my iPhone at the coach house. I'm taking yelping to a new interactive level. 

This place is great. A lot of skeeziness. But it is the oldest commercial structure in Scottsdale. Every year around the holidays Santa C goes out of his way to throw up all over the joint. It takes them like 2 months to clean it up. The crowd is always a little older. The men's bathroom frequently smells, in a disgusting and charming way only possible in a dive bar. The bartenders are some of the nicest in town. As I'm writing, the bar keep is chasing a really drunk lady out to her car to make sure she doesn't wipe out a whole family or two.
