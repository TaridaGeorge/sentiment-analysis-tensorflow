Cornish Pasty Company, I hate you!  You are only located in frickin Arizona, and I can't get my fix because I'm in San Francisco!   My husband and I ate a Pasty at practically every meal when I was in Arizona for a convention so we got to try a LOT of the flavors there.  Please please please consider opening a shop in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I'll get a little rounder, but hey - happy fat is alllllllll good.
