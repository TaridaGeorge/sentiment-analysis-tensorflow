It's great that this location is open late on Friday nights, but what's more important is that it's open by nine on Saturday mornings, because LoLo's is up there for the award for the best hangover food I know. It might not sound appetizing when you first wake up and realize you died sometime in the night and are still putting the pieces of your brain back together, but if you can drag yourself out of bed and get to LoLo's everything is going to be okay. Don't ask questions, don't second guess yourself, just get the delicious greasy food you need to keep going. Once your plate is empty, you'll feel like a new person, one who can contemplate the rest of the weekend. 

If you see me there with hangover shades on, drinking coffee by the pot, feel free to join my party. Waffles love company too.
