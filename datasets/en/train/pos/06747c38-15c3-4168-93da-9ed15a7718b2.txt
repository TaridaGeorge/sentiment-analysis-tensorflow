I am from a small town just south of a big town. I have had plenty of hamburgers in my day believe you me. However, nothing will ever enter my mouth the same way as the Vesuious burger did. It was an epic explosion of flavor that titillated every single one of my taste buds. And don't get me started on the staff. So helpful! Especially (I believe her name was??) Whitney. She helped me out not only with my burger choice but also my life. I want to be a better man because of her. If girls could be boy scouts she should get a badge for awesomeness. Seriously though, you can tell when people like their jobs. As the old saying goes, If you love what you do, you will never work a day in your life. WHITNEY FOR PRESIDENT!!!!!!!!!!! - Chainsaw Todd
