I might be too generous considering I've only consumed vodka tonics here, but man! I love this place.

It's quite simple, really. Starting a Friday or Saturday night off right to me, means coming to Drift for beverages, eye candy, booth dancing, and giggles. 

I love the layout. Its very cool and classy. The lighting is just sexy too. Luckily, when I've been here it hasn't been over crowded and there was a live dj who i wanted to give a big fat kiss on the lips. Amazing place to start prior to a night of dancing your ass off in old town Scottsdale.
