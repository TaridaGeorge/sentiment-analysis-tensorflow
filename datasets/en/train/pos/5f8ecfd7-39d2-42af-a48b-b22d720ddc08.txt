I was visiting some family in the area and was happy to stumble upon some self-serve yogurt. I'm a huge fan of yogurt, but i hate those places that charge you a ridiculous amount for each topping you pick. I love that you get to pick which toppings you want and how much of each you want. This was great yogurt for a very affordable price. I would recommend checking out this place...just be careful about going over board with the toppings. i always seem to get overly excited with picking my own toppings and get more than i can eat :)
