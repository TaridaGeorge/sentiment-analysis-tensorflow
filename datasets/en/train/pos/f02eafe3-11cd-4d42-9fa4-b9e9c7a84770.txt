This is a GREAT Vegetarian place! Especially if you want to taste something that is faux-meat.

PROS:
  - Lots of tasty options, even "meaty" alternatives
  - Vegan
  - Fast
  - Prices are good

CONS:
  - A bit loud with the music playing and not much sound damping
  - Not really healthy, you must order the right stuff for that
