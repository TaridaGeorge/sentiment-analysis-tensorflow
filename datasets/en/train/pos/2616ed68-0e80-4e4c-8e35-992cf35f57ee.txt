I love this place! Good for all ages and relatively cheap, a win-win!!
If you park in the heritage parking lot they win discount your parking ticket to only $3 bucks and its usually $12! another win!

We went and checked out bodyworlds and the brain, and if you have never been here, YOU have to go and check it out. Even if you have gone and you know someone who might enjoy it, i think it is the type of place you can go again and see/learn things that you missed your first time through. 

We ended up on level two playing in the kids area( don't be fooled they have pretty cool stuff in there). plus, its o.k to let your inner kid out sometimes. :)

A definite must see, and i won't be surprised if i end up back here again.
Very cool!
