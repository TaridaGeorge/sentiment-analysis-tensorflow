This place is on the corner of Frank Lloyd Wright and Pima, in that rather large shopping center. It is in the same area as Rubios, if that helps. Anyway, this place is incredible and affordable. I got an awesome vegetable panini with eggplant, artichokes, bell peppers and cheese, with pesto sauce and chips and I only paid about $5.50. The owners are incredible, and you can watch as they make your sandwich. This place is worth a stop for breakfast, lunch or dinner. They offer a great variety of options for any time of day.
