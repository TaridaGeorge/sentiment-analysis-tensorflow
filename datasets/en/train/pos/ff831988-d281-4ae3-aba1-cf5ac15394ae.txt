I don't live in Arizona but I have been there several times while traveling for work.  I ALWAYS make sure to stop here for either lunch or dinner every time.

The food is good, the price is very reasonable, and we normally get good service.  The main reason is the quality of the food.  From Pizza's to sandwiches this place has never disappointed.
