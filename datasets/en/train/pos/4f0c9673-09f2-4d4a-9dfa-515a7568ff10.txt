Came here for the first time on Sunday afternoon, and loved it.  Ordered strictly off the appetizer menu so we could try oysters, clam strips, hummus, and crab cakes - and all four were amazing.  Best crab cakes I've ever had.  Nice beer selection, good mixed drinks.

Also enjoyed the layed-back patio setting.  People brought their dogs.  Nice casual atmosphere with friendly servers.  Can't wait to go back!
