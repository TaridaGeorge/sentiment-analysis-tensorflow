THE BEST RIBS I'VE HAD HANDS DOWN!! The meat was perfectly cooked and the portions are so big for such a good price! My bf and I shared a half rack of ribs and got two sides and were completely stuffed, all for $20! They even gave us extra corn bread as an appetizer! And free dessert! Love this place!
