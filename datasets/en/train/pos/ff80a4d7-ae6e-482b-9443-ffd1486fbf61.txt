Staff is great, food is great, beer selection is super great.  They have PBR in a can every day all day for $1.25.  They have great daily beer and food specials.  The California Carver pizza is super unique and amazing.  Also, it is very bike friendly.  You can bring your bike in and hang it up inside, which is super nice for anyone who actually cares about their bike.  Everyone is super nice, they have tons of seating, tons of TVs with the games on, darts, and pool tables.  They also just added a new outdoor seating area where you can drink.  Trivia night is every Tuesday, and they have great live music every Wednesday.  I am a huge fan, and they deserve your business.  If you like good beer, good food, and good times, this is the bar/lounge/restaurant for you.
