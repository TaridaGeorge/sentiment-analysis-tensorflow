This is the perfect yogurt place. It's brand new, and I have been to a few competitors, but this is small, and simple. It also had a bunch of rad toppings like cream puffs, rice mochis, and pomegranate seeds. I had the peanut butter/chocolate mix, it was amazing. Best thing about this place... open til 10 pm on weekdays, 11pm on weekends... FINALLY! A perfect local yogurt place worth a trip.
