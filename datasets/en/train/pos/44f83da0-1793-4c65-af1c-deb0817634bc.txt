I heart the Phoenix Neutrino Project. I think I go so often I should have a lifetime free membership. Seriously. You all thought I was joking, but I wasn't. Someone should work on that. 

Think of it this way. It's improv *and* a movie. The crowd gets involved by donating props that have to be woven into the storyline. Three groups each get a prop and go off on their own to film short segments of a story. They are then ran back to the viewing location where they are edited and all merged together.

The cast is always awesome and the crowd has a chance to be actively involved. 

It's only $5 and well worth it. You have to go once, and I guarantee you will want to go again and again.
