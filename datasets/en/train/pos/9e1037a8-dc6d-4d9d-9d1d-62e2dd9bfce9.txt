Probably about 4 stars, but a bonus star for having Old Speckled Hen on tap. Sooo creamy and delicious!

I had dinner here with the family before I flew back to San Jose. The miso sea bass was delicious! Service was great, and pretty empty on a late Sunday afternoon. Good beer selection! Prices seemed a bit high...good thing my dad picked up the tab. ;P
