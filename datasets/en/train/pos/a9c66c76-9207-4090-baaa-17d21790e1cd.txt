These guys are wonderful!!  When I bought my house, with a wood burning fireplace, I placed an order on-line because it was after hours and Thomas called me the next day.  He asked me questions about my fireplace and determined by the size, etc. that I would be better off with alligator juniper and red gum.  The combination of the two is wonderful.  They delivered and stacked it for us.  My husband is disabled and cannot do anything strenuous so they were a Godsend.  Now, all I have to do is call and they know what I want and where to bring it.  Get your wood from them, you will not be sorry.
