What a great way to get introduced to Fogo De Chao

And I thought I would still be full this morning because of all the wonderful food I consumed last night.  (Sorry meal plan, but I had to break a couple rules last night...)  Food, service, atmosphere were all A+!!!!  The meat was cooked to perfection.  The salad bar is AMAZING!!!  And the tour of the kitchen and the private room was a great touch to end the evening.

Thank you Gabi for putting this together!  It was such an excellent treat!
