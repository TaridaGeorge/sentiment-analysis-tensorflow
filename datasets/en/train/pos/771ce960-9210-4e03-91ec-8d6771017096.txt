so far this is the only place i've come back to get a steak in town. I have yet to find a place in town that has a steak as tender as ruth chris's. 



list of places i've gone to recently for comparison

mastro's city hall
BLT 
capital grill
del frisco's
hillstone
houston's 
STK (very close second best steak could be better but i need to go back :) )
gallahers (vegas)
