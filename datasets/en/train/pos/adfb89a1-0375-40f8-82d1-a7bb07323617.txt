Just a quick update to let people know that they now serve alcohol! Woohoo! They got their liquor license six weeks ago -- after a tedious process, they said -- and now have a full menu of wines and other libations (Beer and Sake that I know of).  So, next time you want to cruise downtown to listen to some great live music, have some fantastic grub and enjoy the cool atmosphere, you can do so with some wine and beer too!
