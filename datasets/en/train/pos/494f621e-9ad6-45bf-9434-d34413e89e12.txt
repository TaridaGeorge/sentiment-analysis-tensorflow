Bicycle Ha√ºs by far has the coolest new cycling products under one roof. They have the widest variety of everything you see in the magazines.

I find it impressive that they carry all the newer clothes, hippest bags, lightest wheels and largest food selection you could imagine.  I find myself stopping by for a coffee and checking out what's new weekly.
