Elements is great!  The ambiance of Elements begins when you first take step into the lobby area.  The colors, decor, soft music playing in the background, helpful and carrying staff all add to the experience.  

I had not received many professional massages because of the lack of comfort level with other operations, but i immediately felt at ease with my massage therapist.  She took the time to see which areas were bothering me and had me complete an assessment before to ensure she was targeting my trouble areas.  

Highly recommend the couples massage.  Thank you Elements for bringing relaxation back into my life!!
