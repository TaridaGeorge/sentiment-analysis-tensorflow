There are many words which could describe this place. I will start with one: YUM.

The vegan french toast even fooled my meat loving counterpart.

The quick ordering process was seamless and cut down a considerable portion of the waiting game. The drinks are self-serve but not tacky either. The place is spotless, clean and offers your morning addictions from CNN to sports to 90s reruns. Throw in a latte, loyalty card and a smile and I'm sold.

I couldn't be happier and either could my tummy.
