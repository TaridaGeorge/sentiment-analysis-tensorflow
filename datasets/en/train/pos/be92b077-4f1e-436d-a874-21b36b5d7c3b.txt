I don't know where to start.  This place has amazing food and service.  The look of this restaurant reminds me of European restaurants.  Not fussy,and the decor has clean lines.  Our waiter Luis was wonderful!!  Luis made a great wine suggestion and was able to answer all questions as this was our first visit.   We started with the chopped salad which twas split for us.  The homemade bread served with olive oil was warm and tasty.  The gnocchi 3 types - , brie, asiago cheese and mushroom with a brown butter sage sauce was pure unadulterated heaven!  The Bucatini Amatriciana was outstanding.  All the pasta's are organic and homemake.  We finished the evening with cannoli where were freshly made and very good.  Next time we am in the Scottsdale area I will be dining there again.
