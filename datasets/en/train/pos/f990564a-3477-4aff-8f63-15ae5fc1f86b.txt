This place does NOT get enough credit for its fast, friendly service, and tasty quality menu items at fair downtown prices. The pastries are the best downtown, and I grab coffee or lunch at least twice a week. I've even brought the kiddos down on a weekend, and they were happy with grilled cheese. I love that I can order at the counter, from the diner style bar seating, or just grab something quick from the cases.
