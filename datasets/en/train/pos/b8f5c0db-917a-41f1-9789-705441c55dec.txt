I love this place and eat here too often. They can have some long lines, but it moves quick. The employees are very frriendly. Love all the TVs that are always on sports. The subs are amazing. I get either the club or the Big Kahuna, both are awesome. They're definitely on the pricier sub, but if you want a $5 footlong with processed cold cuts and stale bread, you know where to go, if you want a good quality sandwich, Jersey Mike's is for you.
