I have been going here for years.  In that time, I have seen virtually all the doctors and nurse practitioners who have worked there.  Drs. Tokatlian and Mouaikels are top notch.  In addition to being very knowledgeable, they are easy to talk to, never rushed and very thorough.  Moreover, the office seems to put a premium on staying  on schedule as much as possible (long waits are NOT the norm) and making it easy to get in for an appointment.  The walk-ins and Saturday appointments really stand out.

Also, this office has a great network of specialists for referrals.  I highly recommend AIA.
