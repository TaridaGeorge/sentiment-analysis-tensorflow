In a last ditch attempt at exhibiting what may be the last shred of virility within my being, I took one of my vintage Robert Graham shirts to Brothers.
I did so after my wife plucked it from the Goodwill pile, reasoning how these folks can fix anything, and how I shouldn't give away such an expensive party shirt. 
I agreed.

And now I have a vintage Robert Graham shirt hanging in my closet. 
Just hanging there.
Waiting...for the day when my wife says something like;

        "Hey, wanna go clubbing tonight?"

I have a feeling it may have to go back to Brothers a few more times in its hanging career...while my weight changes... like I'm a finalist in the Duncan Yo-Yo tournament.
