Ok ... I have to admit, first, that I have been a HUGE fan of In N Out burger for years ... then I stopped into Freddy's one day, and haven't gone to In N Out since!  The service is great, the food is AMAZINGLY good, and the atmosphere is fun and fresh.  You will not be disappointed!  I do the California Double Combo ... give them a try!
