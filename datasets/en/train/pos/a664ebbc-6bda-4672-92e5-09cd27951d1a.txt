our family stopped in at 8pm on february 10th.  there was no wait and a few folks eating in the restaurant.  we were sat very quickly.

our server, cody, was awesome.  we ordered coconut crusted wild ecuadorian mahi mahi, wild baja californian yellowtail, wild alaskan red king crab and southwest salad.  we loved all our meals!  we did not have any problems with our order.  our meal for 2 adults and 1 child was around $41.

the restaurant is very nice inside but it was disturbing to see so few people inside.  so we had a great quiet dinner.

for the record parking and traffic sucks real bad at this restaurant location in the tempe market place.
