Best Chicken Shawarma EVAR!!

And their lemonade is crack. I'm pretty sure there is not actual crack used in the making of the lemonade, but it's addictive as all get out. 

So, I used to go to Arizona every year in the spring for work. And I'd go to Cafe Istanbul a few times during my stay. I did this for seven or so years. 
I've been gone for six, but when I came back this year and walked in there, the owner recognized me right away, welcomed me back, and made our dinner feel very homey. 
The food is every bit as good as I remember. Everything I've ever had there has been fan-freakin-tastic. 

I think I secretly travel to AZ just to have their chicken shawarma. It's totally worth the 1800 mile trip for me.
