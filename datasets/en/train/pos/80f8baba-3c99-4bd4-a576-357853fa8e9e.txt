Great breakfast....portions as big as what I experienced at Hash House a Go Go in San Diego....

Omelets and pancakes were great.  Have had the oatmeal here on another occassion - served with all of the fixins...can't really mess up on the oatmeal....

Arrived before the huge morning crowd.  

Great place to people watch and to walk around afterwards- lends itself to a great location.....

Wanted a t-shirt to this place, but was not willing to spend forty something for it....
