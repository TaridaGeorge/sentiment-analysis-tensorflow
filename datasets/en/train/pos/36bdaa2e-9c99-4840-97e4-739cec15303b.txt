I like going with the kiddos, yes it cost a good amount of money but you cant expect these people to get dressed like they do for nothing.  We went opening weekend this year, much of this place hasn't changed over the years, I have seen many of the shows but my favorite is the falcon show with the flying birds (I watch it every time).  They have a sword swallower, comedy shows, mid-evil time kid rides, ax throwing, tons of stuff to buy mid-evil, cool food, and lots of walking.  Oh yeah, don't forget the sunblock.
