The best bread stick I've ever had.  So good I ordered an extra to go.  It's refreshing to be able to get new cuisine and Breadfruit fits the bill.  My other favorite part was the BYOB, however don't listen to the server that says it's just a couple blocks away.  Next time I'll be sure to bring my own vino.
