The reason I'm giving it 5 stars: STEEL-TIPPED DARTS!

While the ambiance is subpar to my local watering hole in Champaign, IL (Blind Pig), the bartenders are friendly and the beers are cheap. They also let you bring in food from other establishments.

I'm sure there are other things I could rate them on (pool tables, jukebox, bathroom, etc) but if I feel like cheap beers and real darts, you will definitely find me here. I should probably figure out their specials if I'm going to become a regular...
