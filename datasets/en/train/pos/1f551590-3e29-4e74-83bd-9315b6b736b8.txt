Hard to find the location. If your directions take you to 1st street like ours did, park in the shaded structure, and walk west toward drinkwater blvd. It's near the performing arts center.

We were worried about being under dressed, but only until a group came in wearing exercise clothes!

I ordered a chicken sandwich with honey and jalapenos. The ingredients blended together very nicely. My husband ordered a burger with peppercorn, bleu cheese, bacon, and a special sauce. It was also delicious. His only complaint was that it was a bit heavy on the peppercorn.

Portions were huge. I ate just over half a sandwich. Prices were fair. Our meal was under $30, including tax.

Make sure you visit the restrooms. The decor and architecture are really neat!
