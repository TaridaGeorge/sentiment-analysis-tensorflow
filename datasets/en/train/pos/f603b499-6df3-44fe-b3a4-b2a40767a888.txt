I so know what Thomas means the best thing about this QT or any for that matter, is the customer service and large bays. They have very attuned staff that are trained to be fast and efficient and nice. I have had so many bad experiences at gas stations I just dread going inside any at all. But QT has made a point to create a higher standard and make all their locations large and efficient. 
Don't try the subs though I had one at the QT on Osborn and 3rd Ave and it was awful.
