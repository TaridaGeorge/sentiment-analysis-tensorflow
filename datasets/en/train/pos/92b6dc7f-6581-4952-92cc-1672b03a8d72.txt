I see Dr. Anderson as my primary care physician. He's an incredibly empathetic and professional doctor. He always takes the time to listen to my concerns and answer my questions. The rest of the staff is wonderful too. Even though I live in Maricopa now, I refuse to find a closer primary. A doctor like this is rare in this day of get-em-in-get-em-out practices.
