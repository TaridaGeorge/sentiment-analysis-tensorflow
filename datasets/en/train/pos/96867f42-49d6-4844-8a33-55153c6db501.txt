I am constantly looking to integrate new training principles and ideas into my fitness regimen. I was introduced to crossfit a few months ago and have never looked back. the camaraderie of the people, the environment, the clock ticking, the music blasting creates a motivating and prosperous environment for physical and mental growth. The main trainer Derrick is modest, low key, positive and highly experienced with his military background and training expertise. His co owner Brian G. is a solid businessman and strong athlete as well. There are elite athletes to beginners and everyone feels welcome and at home as we are all competing against our own "clock". Don't let your time tick away any more and take advantage of this amazing workout and change of lifestyle. I look forward to seeing you at the next WOD aka the workout of the day.
