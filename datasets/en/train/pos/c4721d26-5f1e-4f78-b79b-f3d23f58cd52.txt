Pricey, but by far one of the best dining experiences I've had. We were lucky to go on a slow week night and our waiter was also their sommelier so he gave us excellent pairings to our dishes. Portions are quite reasonable so one starter, a second, and a dessert was plenty for me. Their menu changes according to the seasons as they pride themselves on serving local, in harvest, produce. If you go and you see the calamari risotto on the list still it's a must. The bread pudding is to die for as well.
