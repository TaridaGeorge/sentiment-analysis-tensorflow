Oh my gosh this is some of the best Chinese food we have ever had! We came to spoil ourselves after the warrior dash and I trusted the repetition in the reviews to get beef chow fun, the hubby got his usual orange chicken. We felt happiness in our hearts after diggin in (covered in dirt, smelly, hungry)... the orange chicken was very very good.  The beef chow fun was so amazing! I am full of so many mixed emotions now! Sadness-"why ace, why are you soooooo far from my home"... relief-"thank goodness this is sooooo far, I would gain 20 pound this year if it were closer... anger-"surprise Chinese food places should burn to the ground for serving the food they serve!"... joy-"in both my mouth and tummy"...

Thank you ace!!
