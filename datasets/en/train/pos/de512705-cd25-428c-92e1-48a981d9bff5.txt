I've been coming here since they opened.  It's always reminded me of the narrow downtown bars found up in Seattle, not sure why.

Love the food though.  If I'm feeling cheap, I'll get the Oggie & a Mickey's.  On good days, the Lamb and Mint & a Smithwicks.

The owner is a beer lover for sure, don't go here if you want cheap domestic (Bud & Miller).  Try a good English or German brew instead.
