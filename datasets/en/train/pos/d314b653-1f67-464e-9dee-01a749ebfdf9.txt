If you love great  pizza and you believe good dough and sauce are the foundation  to great pizza..then look no further! I have been hunting for a pizza joint since I moved here three years ago..many have fallen so short and left me bitter, until I found Nypd. They use fresh ingredients and it shows in the flavor of the pizza. I like the thin crust, and I love the variety of table spices that you can add to your pizza..be warned the pizzas do take time to cook, so if your a bit hungry order an appetizer along with your order. This pizza is worth the wait and is phenomenal, I love the crust and order a 16 or a 14 inch pie which is plenty for the next day.
