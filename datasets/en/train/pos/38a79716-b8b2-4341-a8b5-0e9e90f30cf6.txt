Tip of the Cap to the Wag n' Wash staff!  I had never brought my dog into a groomers before and the ladies here took me and my pup in past their last appointment of the day and really help out before we had to leave on a trip. The summer cut looks great and I will definitely take her back! Sorry about the thick fur...
