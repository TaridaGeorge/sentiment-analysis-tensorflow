My rave starts here:

I love everything about Switch. From the food to the atmosphere, the place is simply wonderful.

I've only been a few times, but I've enjoyed it each time.
I usually get the turkey sandwich with cranberries on it (the official name escapes my memory). 

I can't say much about their Happy Hour or drinks in general, because I have not been since I turned 21. However, I will have to make a stop in soon so that I can check that out. 

I love their servers. Being a waitress myself, it is really easy for me to spot servers that are "fake", and the servers at Switch all seem to be genuinely nice people who enjoy their jobs.
