I started going to Stanley's after the warranty ended for my car. They were recommended to me by a friend. I cannot tell you how pleased I was to learn of their service. The price is fair and they are very thorough. It is a family owned business that believes in integrity. I am alway confident that they will do the job right when they work on my car and when I recommend them to others.
