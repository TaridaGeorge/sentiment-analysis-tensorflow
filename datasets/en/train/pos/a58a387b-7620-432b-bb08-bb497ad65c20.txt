As a long time lover of great cheeses, and especially feta, there is no place better to get your cheese from than Crow's Dairy.

I have tried almost all of the different kinds they make and I think the worst part is picking which one to buy.  The regular feta and the peppercorn feta are two of my must-haves.  The peppercorn gives a nice little kick thats great paired with tomatoes and cucumbers.  Also, the chevres are creamy and so delicious.  If you are looking for more of a sweet treat from your cheese, definitely try the butter pecan.  It tastes like a delicious cheesecake and I could literally eat an entire container by itself in one sitting (thank God for self-control, right?)

I would say that worst thing about Crow's Dairy cheese is that I have to wait until the weekend Farmer's Market to get it!
