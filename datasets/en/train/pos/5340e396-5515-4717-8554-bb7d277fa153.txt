I was pleasantly surprised at how attractive the Ritz was after reading some earlier reviews.  But the gracious treatment started as the taxi pulled up to the front door.  A warm greeting was extended to me as my door was opened, my bag was immediately taken out of the trunk and wheeled up to the front desk.  There I was again greeted by a beautiful blonde that was as warm and gracious as she was beautiful.  

Rooms start at $299 a night and are a bargain at that price.  The restaurant Food was excellent.  Staff most gracious at every turn, from the doorman, front desk, Lobby Lounge bartender.  A truly classy Ritz property!
