This is my go-to Starbucks, less than a block from my office.  I'm the Dutchess, actually.  They know me by name.  :)  

They tend to be busy most of the time, but the line always moves quickly.  The entire crew is so friendly and takes time to chat with customers who want to chat back.

Kudos to James, Derek and everyone at this location.  I hear the staff will be dismantled once the new City Scape location opens and this location shuts its doors.  Some will go to the new location, others to various other locations.  Boo!!
