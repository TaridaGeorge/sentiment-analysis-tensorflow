Its pretty bizaare that all other location of Ted's are in the Western NY area, an then there is one here. But I'm not complaining! I was skeptical to try their white hots, but I can honestly say that I've been missing out. The lines get pretty long, but its definitely worth the wait. At Ted's they grill up your order right in front of you. Hot dogs dont get any better than this.
