In an old house across the alley from Pizzeria Bianco, this must be the center of good food in Arizona. There are no two finer restaurants so close in the entire state. We had lunch this time during the Arizona Matsuri and my tonkatsu sandwich was a joyous surprise - tender pork cutlet with traditional tonkatsu sauce and a hint of hot mustard on toasted bread. The soft shell crab sandwich lacked spark but it was fresh and tasty nonetheless. Japanese fries were well cooked and salted just right. Looking forward to returning for dinner.
