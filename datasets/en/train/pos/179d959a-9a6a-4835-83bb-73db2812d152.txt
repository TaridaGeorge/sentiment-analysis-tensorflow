This place is good!! I ordered 2 slices of pizza for lunch and really enjoyed it. The dough was crunchy at first but when you get to the crust it is like a pillow you can eat. haha. I sat in the bar and the bartender was quick with my drinks and was very nice. If you are around the area you should stop by and eat some lunch. I will be back!!
