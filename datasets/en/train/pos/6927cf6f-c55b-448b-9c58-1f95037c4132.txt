There is no better way to spend a beautiful Sunday morning in March than sitting outside in the shade eating good food in a lovely atmosphere.This place is so fun! I even like using the restroom, it's a treat in itself. However it wasn't as clean as I'd hoped but the place was so busy I'll let them slide on that one. My family ordered the March special, all the items featured on "Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives" for $31, it was so much food and very good. Loved the onion rings. I will try the date shake next time.
