A true down town delight .

Loved it here ! both visits !

Very ambient space that has a sleek modern look and trendy splashes of color. Jumbo windows look out onto a great patio gorgeous seating and a wall fountain .

Lunch was a delicious Salmon cake with Quinoa salad,the salmon cake was moist and delicious My companion enjoyed Chicken and Paella  . 

Came back for happy hour the cucumber gimlet was refreshing and strong .The flat bread with Mozzarella was super yummy .
They have $4 sangria and wine and $3 beers .
