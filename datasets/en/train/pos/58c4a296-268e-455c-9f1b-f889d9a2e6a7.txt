5 stars to Oscar's Coffee Bar!!!  In the spring, we hosted a tea party at Harper's Nursery and Ted from Oscar's Coffee Bar made it a fantastic event.  All of the children along with their parents came to the nursery dressed in their finest and we all got to sample different teas and nibble on cookies provided by Oscar's Coffee Bar. Delicious!  It really is a must visit place the scenery is beautiful, the owners are so nice, and the coffee is great! Every time I host an event there, I end up with a plant in one hand a coffee in the other and a great big smile on my face!  Thank You!
