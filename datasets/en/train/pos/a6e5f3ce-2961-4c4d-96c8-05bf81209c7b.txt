I have to say that this was a great restaurant. My partner and I went there for dinner today, and we both enjoyed it immensely. I chose the beef pho, which I had never tried before, and was very impressed. The flavor was very good, and it was filled with lots of great ingredients. My partner ordered the beef and rice bowl, also very delicious. The beef had great flavor combinations, sweet and salty, with a nice kick to it. It came with two egg rolls on top, which were some of the best that I've ever had. For these two entrees and two small drinks, it was just about $19.00, which I think is quite a considerable bargain because of the huge portions that you receive. We will definitely plan on returning to the wonderful establishment, and recommend it to anyone who is willing to try something different!
