Rico's American Grill in the truest sense of the word: delicious, fresh, unpretentious, impressive and friendly. I attended a yelp event last night and was truly pleased with the food and service here. I've tried most of the dishes on the menu and everything tasted great. I am definitely coming back here to have brunch with my Mom when I get back from New York. I was also very impressed with the Manager and the rest of the staff. They were all very professional and made sure we were happy with the service and our food. They were happy to explain how they cook their dishes and how everything is freshly prepared everyday. We even met their chef. A great place to drop into to have a great meal and leave happy.
