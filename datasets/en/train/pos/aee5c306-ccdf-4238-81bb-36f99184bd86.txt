This is absolutely the best restaurant in the area!  The food is freshly prepared, high quality, and healthy. Fortunately, the owner is concerned about quality and doesn't skimp. The shaken beef teems with flavor. Actually, all of the dishes teem with flavor and awaken the senses. The portions are generous and you would expect to pay more. I highly recommend Saigon Kitchen for any dining experience.
