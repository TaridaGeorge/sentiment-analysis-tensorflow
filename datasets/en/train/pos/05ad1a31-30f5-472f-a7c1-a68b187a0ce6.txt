How can you not like a store that basically meets all your needs in one area? This Target is nice, clean and has a friendly staff. I've always been able to find what I'm looking for at this store. The items are always in stock. Prices are always really good. 

This Target is a bit further drive than the location on Baseline and McClintock, but is MUCH better overall

There is also a snack bar with a Starbucks inside.
