I cannot get over what an awesome children's museum this is! My 3 year old was in awe. It is 3 floors of of the most creative play I've ever seen. From the giant steel building structure on the first floor to the art studio on the 2nd floor and the "noodle forest" and grocery store on the 3rd floor- it was a morning packed full of fun! There are so many opportunities for imaginative play and creative exploration, we could have stayed all day!
This is an absolute must if you are in the area and looking for something awesome to do with your kiddos!
