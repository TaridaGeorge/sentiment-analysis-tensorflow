My favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix! Food is consistently delicious...atmosphere is great (fun and alive crowd almost all the time.....despite others saying it's just full of douchebags/sugar daddys and cougars.....if you're not out just to judge, then you should be fine)....service is good....happy hour and reverse happy hour on the week-end is THE BEST!   Love it.
