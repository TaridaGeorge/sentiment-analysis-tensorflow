If I would have to choose three restaurants as the only places I can eat until I die, this would be one of them. How does 
"Bone-In Kona Crusted Dry Aged Sirloin with Caramelized Shallot Butter" sound? Freakin AMAZING...(5+++*)
The salad I had "The Wedge" was real fresh iceberg lettuce with tasty dressing and real big bacon pieces (4*). 
The crab and lobster cake had huge pieces of crab leg and lobster in it which was definitely the best crab cake I ever had (5+++*). 
Their signature Martini was delicious. Apparently they keep it inside a pineapple for about 14 days (5+*). 
I wasn't a big fan of the mocca chocolate cake (2*) which was very rich and was probably just my wrong choice of dessert. 

Go here for the best Dry aged steak, the best crab cake and amazing pineapple martinis.
