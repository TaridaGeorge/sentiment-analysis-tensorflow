I have been going to Scramble for 2 years- I can't believe I have not reviewed it yet! 

I love the casual atmosphere of this place and I love the outside patio when the weather is cooperating. 

The service is great and the food is even better. They are open for breakfast and lunch. The menu is varied- breakfast pizza's, salads, sandwiches, benedicts etc...

My husband loves the gringo burrito. My son loves the eggs benedict and I usually create my meal from the al la carte menu. 

Try the cinnamon roll....you won't regret it!
