I am in a *DEEP* love affair with Sahara......I feel, there is nothing they could do wrong.....All the dips are super dank (the trio is a must), the Lentil soup really is RIDICULOUSLY DELISH(By far, the best I've ever had!), the lunch combo with Chicken Tikka, basmati sweetness, hummus, house salad-if feeding 2-add a veggie Sanbusek-uh double up uhh uhhhh! 
**The Lamb Kuzi totally rocked my face off with its tenderness & the pumpkin pudding.....oh the pumpkin pudding......Mmmmmm......reminiscing on past food experiences at Sahara makes me slip into a fuzzy, warm food coma....Sweet food laced dreams everyone! 

PS-I adore the owner, Ali, he is so sweet & charming-A truly gracious & proud owner-Thank you so much* XXOO
