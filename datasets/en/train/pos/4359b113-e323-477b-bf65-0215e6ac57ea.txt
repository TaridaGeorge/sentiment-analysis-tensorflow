Just had my first taste of breakfast here at Boulders and I was not disappointed. They have about 7 awesome breakfast combinations and I can't wait to try them all. Had the eggs benedict today and it was great. The sweet potatoes that come with it are the bomb. You'd be crazy to not to give it a shot.
