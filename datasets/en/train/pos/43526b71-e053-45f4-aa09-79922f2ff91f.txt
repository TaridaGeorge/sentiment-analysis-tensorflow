We have always enjoyed this cafe for brunch but they blew us out of the park tonight with a private party we had in their patio. They let us bring our decorations, helped us move tables around, and also allowed for split checks which is usually a pain to restaurants. I was worried about the traffic on 7th street being so loud but it wasn't even an issue- the patio had such a great atmosphere with the lights and the warmers. And the food was as always- AMAZING! The owners are from Maryland and they serve the best crab cakes in town- worth the visit! You won't be disappointed in this charming restaurant with quality food and service.
