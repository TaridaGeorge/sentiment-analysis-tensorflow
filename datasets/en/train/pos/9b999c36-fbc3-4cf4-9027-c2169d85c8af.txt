great selection of beers on tap!  I am pleased to go into a place that offers a different selection from the normal sports bar, yet still has plenty of the old stand byes!  food is great, happy hour is awesome! I love the daily specials, which encourage me to try something new at a reasonable price as well!  service is rock star super awesome and amazing as well! i usually end up in Joey's section and also had the pleasure of  being served by Kyle this evening.. both are super helpful in helping me decide on a delicious beer and always there with a smile or anything i need!  this is one place id be proud to be a regular at!
