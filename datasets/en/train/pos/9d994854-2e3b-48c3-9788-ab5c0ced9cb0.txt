Incredible is the only word I can think of.  The bread, dip and antipasta were delicious.  The bread dip, and I am untrained culinary wise, was way too tasty, could have eaten it all night and left satisfied.  The main courses were sooooo good.  Then the pizza.  There is nothing like this pizza.  We had the Italian Stallion pizza and it was heaven.  Took some home, heated it up the next day and it was still better than all other pizzas.  I don't know how the chef does it.  The price was right, better than right.  The service was super, I wish I could recall the young lady's name, but she deserves big time credit also.  We have been back and will go again despite a rather long drive for us.  This is Italian food like its supposed to be.
