Best idea ever! I love being able to choose what's inside my roll an they have soooo many choices. Everything is fresh and the staff is super helpful. It is fast, affordable and delicious. They even have eddamame that they heat right there for a dollar and miso soup for a dollar too. Just thinking about it makes me want to go back and try another roll.
