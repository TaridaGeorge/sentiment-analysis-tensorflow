Very nice little shop.  I love the teas and the truffles.  I haven't had the time for lunch, but after glancing at the menu I might just have to make time.  Everything sounded SO good.  

Very friendly and helpful staff.  I love looking around on my lunch break.  It's great to get out of the office and walk around.  And when I do, I always find myself there!
