I was impressed, John really knows his stuff. He is obviously a well educated optometrist who is passionate about his patient care. If you live on the West side I would highly recommend John for your annual eye care exams.

These guys are light-years ahead of the national chain stores in service, quality, and training. 

The only downside is that they don't have much of a selection of eye-wear. (So just get your chic frames elsewhere, and have these guys put in the prescription lenses - FOR LESS MONEY).
