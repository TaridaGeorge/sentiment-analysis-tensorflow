Pretty darn high end in all the right ways.  Outdoors, Indoors, Movie Theater, Dining - all the standard stuff - but done up nice and pretty.  Sure it is expensive but in all reality it didn't feel stuffy at all.

I loved the furniture stores and the decidedly Arizona feel to some of the shops while mainstays like Boss, Ferragamo, Gucci, and Armani all hold down the haute couture end quite well.

Add in the free parking and air conditioning - if I end up in the area I've no doubt I'll be here frequently and my bank account will be none too fond of it.
