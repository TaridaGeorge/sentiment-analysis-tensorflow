aaah, breakfast, how I love you.  Why on earth would someone spend upwards of $10 for breakfast at fatty McD's when u can have fresh pineapple juice, smoked salmon, picture-perfect berries, firepit baked pastries, bacon literally sliced off the slab right before your eyes, and blueberry pancakes made in sight (not frozen), among many, many other surprises ..... ALL for $9.99 and UNLIMITED.  This, my friend, will start your day off right.

Yet, this is NOT your grandparent's cigarette-filled buffet.  It's a younger, lively, clean atmosphere with floor-to-ceiling windows giving a view to the golf course.  Enjoy!
