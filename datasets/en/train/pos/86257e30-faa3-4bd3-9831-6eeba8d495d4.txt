I really enjoy ordering in from this place the people are always friendly. I am in and out of the hospital a lot and everytime I order from these people they always ask how I am doing. They remember if I was sick the last time they saw me and they just seem to care. They even know me & my mom and always ask about her health as well. Not only is the service wonderful the food is really good too and made to order just how I like it minus or plus things I do and do not like. They are always adding those little extra touches I ask for that most places charge you extra for. I really recommend this place.
