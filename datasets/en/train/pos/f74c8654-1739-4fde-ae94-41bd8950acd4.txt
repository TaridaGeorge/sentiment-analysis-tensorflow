I went for my inaugural allergy appointment with this group and instantly fell in love.  Their staff are super-friendly and the building is brand new and pretty (which just made me feel instantly less congested upon entering).  I am forever grateful to them for testing me to confirm, in fact, that I am not allergic to cockroaches, feathers, and various kinds of pollen.
