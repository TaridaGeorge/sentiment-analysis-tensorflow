After my friends talked this place up over and over, I finally made it there for happy hour and was not disappointed. Not only did they have great happy hour specials and amazing food, they also had Tuaca (mmmmm). 

The nachos were the main objective and were to die for! Real melted cheese AND processed nacho cheese...oh mannnnn, so good. The chicken we added was also really well seasoned and along with the beans, salsa, and sour cream this was a truly winning combination. I also decided to try the pulled pork sliders and was glad I did! Seriously delicious pork on buttery toasted little buns with a great bbq sauce on the side...we'll order these again for sure.

Friendly and helpful server, fabulous food and drinks (at great prices), fun ambiance...I will definitely be back to Rosie's and hope to see you there.
