I went to mastro's scottsdale steakhouse and it was fantastic..the steak was delicious and the lobster was excellent.  we had sweet mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms and they were delicious.  The drinks were great and the service was excellent.  I would suggest only ordering one side because the meal is so big and heavy you don't need all the side dishes.  This is a high end dining experience...if you want great steak in arizona..you must go here!!  we left full and very happy!
