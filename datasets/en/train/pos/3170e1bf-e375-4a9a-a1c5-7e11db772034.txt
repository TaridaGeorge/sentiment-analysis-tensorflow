Five stars for the NEW Soul Cafe which has taken the place of the Harvest Restaurant. 

You want great pancakes? Go to this cafe. You want a great dinner? Guess where to go. 
Fine dining, excellent food quality, delicious meals, great service and very good value for the dollar spent. 

This and the owner's other restaurant in Cave Creek are our favorites and I would strongly recommend anyone go here for not only a delicious breakfast, dinner and lunch but for the money you will spend, it cannot be beat!!
