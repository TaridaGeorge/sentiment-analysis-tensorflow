When one of our spa guests asked me yesterday where she could get a gluten-free pizza that tasted good, I couldn't wait to tell her about True Foods! My girlfriends and I had eaten there last week and we couldnt believe our luck. We had the mediteranean salad which was a revelation, and the kale pesto pizza with sun dried tomatoes. Who knew good food could taste this good?! As the owner of Arizona's largest freestanding resort-style spa, guests expect me to eat healthy. Now I actually want to!
