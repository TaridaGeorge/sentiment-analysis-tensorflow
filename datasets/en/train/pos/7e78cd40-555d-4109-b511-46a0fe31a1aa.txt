I've been to this location 5 times and I'm yet to see the same special presented twice. They have them made up in the lobby area so you can see if they tickle your fancy.

The lunch portions are VERY generous and diverse (include miso soup, asian salad, crab rangoon, and the entree).

Also, if you like Kirin beer- every Kirin you order allows you to choose an appetizer add-on for $.50 - $1.00. There's seating at the bar, which surrounds the personable sushi chefs. And every meal is concluded with complementary orange pieces served with toothpicks.

Fresh wasabi upon request.
