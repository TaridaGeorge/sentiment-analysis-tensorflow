I've been a customer of Hans for years (since 2004) and I can't say enough good things about him! He epitomizes honesty in all his dealings and a more knowledgeable car mechanic you won't ever find! I _know_ he's saved me HUNDREDS if not THOUSANDS of dollars on repairs and maintenance, as well as giving the same excellent service to my daughter and her husband on their vehicles. You can stop looking for an excellent mechanic when you find Hans -- he's the BEST!
