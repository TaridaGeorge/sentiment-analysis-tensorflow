We have eaten here many times for lunch for the Friday fish fry and it has always been fantastic (if you like the cornmeal type breading).  We did go once for dinner and none of the 4 of us liked it so we never have gone back for dinner.  We just tried breakfast and it was fabulous!  The eggs were super fresh and cooked perfectly, the sausage patties were amazing and the potatoes were piping hot and fresh.  There must have been 2 pounds of potatoes on the plate!  This is home cooking (nothing upscale)  but if you like home cooking, you will be impressed with the 2 eggs, sausage and fried potatoes.  The place is a little dated, but you don't really notice it when you are overlooking the view from the outdoor patio.
