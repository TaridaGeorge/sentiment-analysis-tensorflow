It's called the Cigar Inn. The owner Salma is the best, she is very knowledgeable and is extremely helpful. Cigar Inn has the best selection of Arturo Fuente cigars and other high end cigars. She has not given me a bad recommendation on a cigar yet.
If you want great customer service and a place to make you feel welcome every time, you can't go wrong with Cigar Inn.
