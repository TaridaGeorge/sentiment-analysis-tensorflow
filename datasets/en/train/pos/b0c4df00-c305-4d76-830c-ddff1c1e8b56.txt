Love this place!  I'm so glad they opened up in the neighborhood!  Before that, I used to drive down to their 59th Ave & Behrend Dr location (also great) for my bagel fix.  The bagels here are huge, delicious, and very reasonably priced.  IMO, best in the Valley.  My husband and I are fans of the breakfast sandwich combo (choice of bagel, breakfast meat, egg & cheese, with coffee or a soda.)  I love mine with Taylor ham, egg, and cheese.  So good.  Also great getting a bagel and cream cheese.  My sons love the frosted cinnamon rolls.  I keep meaning to try the other sandwich offerings on the menu, but every time I walk in I just end up ordering bagels.  :)

Highly recommended!  I hope this place stays around for a long, long time.
