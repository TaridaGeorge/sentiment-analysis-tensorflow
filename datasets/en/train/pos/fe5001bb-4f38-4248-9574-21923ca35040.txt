I normally never give any place a 5 star but this place deserves 10 stars!! It is a sweet hidden gem in the middle of Scottsdale. The service was outstanding, I never had an empty glass and everyone was so friendly. And the food... The food was outstanding. We started with the giao mozzarella so fresh and delicious but so simple. I was scared to have the rabbit gnocchi but I'm so glad I did. This is my new favorite Italian restaurant in the entire valley
