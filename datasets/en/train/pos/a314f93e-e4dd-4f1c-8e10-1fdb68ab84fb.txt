We absolutely LOVE this restaurant! When this initially opened right around the corner from our house, we were so excited that we literally burnt ourselves out on this place! We literally went every chance we got. Now, don't eat here *too* often because the weight gain alone may deter you from what is otherwise a great restaurant. Our service is typically wonderful with some rare exceptions, our food is always delicious, and their beer selection is great for beer lovers like us. The environment is dim and cozy, but there's also an awesome patio if you don't mind smokers, bleh. 5 stars for you, Pasty!
