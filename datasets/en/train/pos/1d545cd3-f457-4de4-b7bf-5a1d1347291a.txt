Fantastic service, excellent crispy egg rolls, and delicious Pho with fresh and crispy condiments.  Any new place is bound to struggle at first... so take the bad reviews lightly.  We eat Pho once a week at a fabulous hole in the wall in Glendale, but have decided to change our ritual to this new location.  The atmosphere is lovely.  Can't wait to go back again.
