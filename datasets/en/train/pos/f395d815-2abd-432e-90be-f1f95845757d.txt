I've been dining at Tomaso's for many years and have yet to have a bad experience! As a matter of fact, my wife and I have have brought many friendsand family with us to enjoy our favorite Italian restaurant and we have yet to find anyone who found the food or the service to be anything less than spectacular!  

If you are looking for exquisite, authentic Italian food with the utmost in service, Tomaso's is the place.
