I absolutely love going to k-Bella to get my hair done! The staff is so sweet and welcoming. Tori is my hair stylist and does not only my hair but my whole families. She does an amazing job and I recommend her to everyone I know who is looking for a new person to see. I have tried many different places for hair and k-Bella is by far the best place!
