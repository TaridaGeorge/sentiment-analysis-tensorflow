Have to say, probably the most beautiful course I've played. Not as difficult as I had thought it was going to be but not at all easy by any standards. It's amazing how much easier this game is when you hit fairways off the tee box! Great pace of play, I never saw anyone ahead if us and no one behind us pushing even though I know there were groups surrounding us. 
One older gentleman told us at We-Ko-Pa, "I golfed Troon before they built all the houses. It was ten times more amazing then." My friend, if you ever read this, yeah. I see it. Still gorgeous now though. A definite must play in the Scottsdale area.
