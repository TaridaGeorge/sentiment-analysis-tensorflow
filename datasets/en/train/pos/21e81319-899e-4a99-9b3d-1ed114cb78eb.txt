I found out about this place in a flyer advertising free Pho Tai between 2-3 today. So some friends and I decided to check it out. The place is clean, and the set-up is like most Pho restaurants. The place was packed, obviously, but the wait wasn't too bad at all. Once we got our pho we added the basil, lime, sprouts, hot sauce, etc to make it to our tastes. It was great! I had a wonderful bowl of free pho! I absolutely recommend this place. I ended up tipping $10 just because I was so happy and full! Definitely check this place out!
