Let me tell you about the best piercing shop in Arizona! I started going to HTC about a year ago to stretch my ears and I will always go back! The piercers are so nice and knowledgeable.  The shop is clean, and their selection of jewlery is amazing! Tons of organic, glass, metal, and rare pieces for any hole you have! If you have not had the pleasure of going to this amazing shop, do yourself a favor and go!
