If you enjoy service by someone who is as competent as he is personable, I would recommend Corey Kaplan highly. The time he has spent here has been very productive and working with him educational and enjoyable. I hope not to need him again (though this is highly unlikely) but knowing he is there if I do is very nice. By the way, I'm not from El Centro, CA. but Scottsdale, AZ.
