What a great place. The guy who owns it is almost always at the front counter and is nice as can be- he even remembers my name when I come in. Everything I've ever taken there has been cleaned and pressed perfectly and any stains completely removed. The costs are totally reasonable and he is really flexible if you need something back quickly. 

I wont take my clothes anywhere else!
