Awesome place. We loved the atmosphere, not much beats an old house converted into a bar...complete with a live band on the front porch when you walk in! Bartenders were pretty swamped, but managed to pull off tasty drinks pretty fast! Very diverse crowd, looked mostly post grad age, everyone was having a good time, and it seemed like thats what it's probably like every night.
