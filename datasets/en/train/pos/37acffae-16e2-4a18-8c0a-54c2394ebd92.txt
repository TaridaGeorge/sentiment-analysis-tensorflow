Me: Scott, mix me up my usual and make it dirty.

Scott: Sure thing Dolores one Green Monster with blueberries added headed your way. 

I make a meal (generally Saturday brunch or Wednesday dinner) out of one of many of the Smoothies Scott offers up at Mojo Bowl. He also offers my 1st love Shaved Ice in many natural flavors as well as lush green salads, warm soup and don't forget a chocolate covered frozen banana or a greek yogurt granola parfait for dessert.  

Scott prides himself on providing quality nutritious options and exceptional customer service.  He definitely gives his VitaMix blender a good work out. 

You are always sure to get a warm smile and a tasty nutritious meal or snack here. Not to mention the funky ol' school grooves he usually has going keeping the mood light & lively wherever he roams.
