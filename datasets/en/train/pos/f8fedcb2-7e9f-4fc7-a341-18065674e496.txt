I found this company here on Yelp and went with it because of all the high reviews.  This company deserves them!  They did a one time treatment for sewer roaches and while they were here also found termites and showed me where they were.  They were able to treat them with a one time fix instead of trying to sell me monthly treatments.  This is not a company that pushes sales they just do what you ask them to and they do it well.  I would recommend them to anyone having a sewer roach problem or termite problem.
