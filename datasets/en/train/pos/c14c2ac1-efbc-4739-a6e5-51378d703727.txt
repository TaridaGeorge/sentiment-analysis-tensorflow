This is our go to restaurant and hardly a week goes by that I don't crave their food! An upscale sports bar with better than sports bar food. We tried the Tempe location one time and I kinda felt like I was slumming. I love the Scottsdale location and their wonderful staff. I always look forward to seeing their daily specials because their chef knows food! Great pizza, salmon blt, spinach salad, chicken salad pita and I always begin with the edamame. Yum!
