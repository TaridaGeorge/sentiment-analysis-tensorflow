Granted, I had a simple sandwich, but what makes a simple sandwich into an "experience" is the staff, who was tremendous!

I was here for the Cave Creek Wicked Pet Costume Contest.  These people could have been irritated by our "special requests," but instead were so very gracious!  My first request was water...totally free, yet served as though I had ordered it with a full meal.  My second request was lemonade...and the server served it with a smile and an offer to provide free refills.  My third request was lunch, a BLT.  The server offered to bring it to me in my booth outside!  When she brought it to me (quickly, I might add), she even remembered to bring the ketchup for my fries!  And finally, on my last visit inside, they were already closed, but she offered to bring me a fresh water anyway.  How great is that!!!?
