I hate to admit to my sweet tooth - and I do keep it under control most of the time. But I did succumb today when I visited TopIt Cupcakes with my junior Yelper daughter, Abby.

Abby had chocolate with salty caramel icing and I had the ganache-filled chocolate cupcake.  Yes, you read that right - chocolate ganache filled. Oh my! Decadent, rich, over-filling. Both were absolutely delightful.

After we finished our treat I went back in and suggested that the owner participate in a Yelp event. His cupcakes are better than others I've had at various events. I guess I'll wait and see what happens. Meanwhile, when I have another sweet tooth I can't ignore, I know how to fix it.
