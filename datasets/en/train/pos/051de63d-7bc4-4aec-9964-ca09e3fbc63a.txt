Love it! Love it! Love it! This is the perfect date night. Everything on the menu is homemade and super good. Ive been comming to this place for years and have never been disappointed. When you go make sure you get lemon chello shot at the end of your meal., the owner makes it himself.  Every dessert is super good and worth saving room for.  There have been times I have had slow service, but Im on a date so I dont mind too much.  Please try it out one time, and support real homemade food and not a chain.
