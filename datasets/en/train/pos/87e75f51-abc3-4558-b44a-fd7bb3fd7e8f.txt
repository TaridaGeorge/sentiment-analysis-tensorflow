I arrived at the studio for the facial I had. I was greeted by Virgina with a warm smile. We went back to the Estitician room and she went to work on my face! I chose to get Micro and an Oxygen facial. It was so great!! It was so relaxing with the music and the lighting. I could easily drift away. Before I knew it my time was done! She did an amazing job. She recommended me products for my skin time! She was very personable and she knows what she's doing! Terrific service and a wonderful experience! I can't wait to go back! Very reasonable prices also!!! My face loves it :)
