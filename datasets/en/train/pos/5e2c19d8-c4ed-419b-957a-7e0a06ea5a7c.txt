You never know how good you have it until it is gone, right? Well rest assured Thai Elephant isn't going anywhere, but I didn't realize how good this place is until I was out of town and visited another Thai restaurant. I compared the massaman curry dishes between the two restaurants. Big mistake. It instantly made me homesick for Thai elephant. I go here often during the lunch hour. Arrive early as the line grows quickly out the door. The staff is efficient and friendly, making this a great choice if you are looking for a quick sit-down option over the lunch hour.
