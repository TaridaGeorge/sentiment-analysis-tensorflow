12-14-2012--I'm paranoid about my hair. More than paranoid--freakish to the point that I used to fly to Portland to get the color/cut just PERFECT. As in Super-Model perfect, when I walked out the door. My gf, gets her color done here...so as far as ease of scheduling, I was seen within 1 week. Very cool. 4 stars so far. We shall see how the end result looks. I am hopefully optimistic. Stay tuned.
