Anniversary Dinner was fantastic!  First time there, I had the sea bass my husband had lobster. We also shared a ceasar salad, gumbo, and smoked salmon. I know it was way too much to eat but so delicious! Our server was Marlin and he was so friendly and informative. Really enjoyed it only complaint was I wish there was some seating a little more private, it was kind of noisy but tha'ts the only complaint I had. We will definately be going back, I never thought I liked salmon but that appetizer was so good I want to try the salmon for dinner. It is a bit pricey, but you do get what you pay for.
