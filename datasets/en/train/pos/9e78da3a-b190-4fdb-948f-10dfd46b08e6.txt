I don't know why this store has such low ratings...

I've always found the Scottsdale Dillard's, the largest of them in America to be top notch. The selection here is fantastic, compared to the selection at PV Mall or Arrowhead. The men's department isn't crammed into a corner here either. It's huge! The women working in the men's department are also very helpful, especially the women in the coats department. I can't remember her name but she's from Chicago and is so friendly. I bought the nicest Suede jacket here a few weeks back, no regrets whatsoever!

It's shocking to me that such a good store is so poorly reviewed, but I guess I've had a better experience at this store than most people.
