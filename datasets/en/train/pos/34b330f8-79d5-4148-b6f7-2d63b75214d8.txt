My BFF took me to Joya spa today for my Birthday.  What an incredible experience!!!  The grounds are beautiful!!  Then you enter the spa and it really is a magical place!!  They give you this tour as you walk in.  You set your intentions for the day by choosing one of their stones and placing it on a crystal table.  Walking through takes your breath away!!!  I had a 100 min massage.  I have had a lot of massages in my life, and this was by far one of the BEST!!!!  After completing our treatments, we enjoyed a delicious lunch by the spa pool which was beautiful and so relaxing.  I will absolutely be returning ASAP!!  I highly recommend Joya Spa!!!!
