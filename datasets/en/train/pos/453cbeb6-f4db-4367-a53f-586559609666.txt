Every times I went to Cherry Blossom, I always had rice or pasta plates.
Then last weekend, I went there again for noodle soup.
Now I can say that all the menus there are delicious.

The atmosphere is cozy and the staff are so friendly.

Beware of the leg on the front door during the haloween...heeheehee...
