This place is by far the most affordable and best place to get a pedicure in Scottsdale! It's only $20 for the basic pedi. That comes with a hot stone massage as well. I love how they heat their lotion so it doesn't freeze you. They are extremely friendly and value their customers. The salon is very clean and the massage chairs are comfy. They also open at 9:30am which is really nice. This is my new favorite discovery!
