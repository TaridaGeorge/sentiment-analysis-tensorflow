Holy.crap.

The best, ever.

I LOVE THEIR HOT DOGS!

OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!

I could eat their hot lady dog everyday forever and be happy.  A delicious spicy hot dog, on a naan bread, topped with chipotle cream cheese and all sorts of other delicousness.

SO GOOD!

I should have gotten two.  One to eat, one to go.
