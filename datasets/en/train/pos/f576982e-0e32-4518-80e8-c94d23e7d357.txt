I'm in love! Their brunch options are fabulous for vegans (yay for me!) and omnivores (yay for most people I take with me!). I am crazy about the Lumberjack breakfast sandwich with tofu and vegan cheese, their breakfast burrito is amazing and kept me full all day. I try to get there once a week at least and always treat myself to one of their yummy vegan desserts. The raw cheesecake is to die for, their cupcakes are fantastic (I even got some from their wonderful pastry chef for my birthday and they were a HUGE hit with friends). I can't recommend them enough!
