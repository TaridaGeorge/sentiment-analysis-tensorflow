Saw this place the other day while driving home, and stopped in to pickup a quick dinner. My boyfriend & I are from Chicago where you can always get a yummy gyros, but we haven't found anything great so far in the east valley. I must say the gyros here are surprisingly delicious gyros. We also tried the kabobs which were also yummy although the rice was a bit dry. The hostess/server was very friendly. I would definitely eat here again & I can wait to try other menu items. Highly recommended.
