I am so a Diamondback fan now! Just moved down here and went to the game to get tickets. Walked up to the ticket booth and asked if they have a military discount... they did. We got amazing seats right by the home plate for only $25 a piece. Recommend walking around before you settle on what you want to eat and drink they have a pretty awesome selection of food and booze, everything is kind of expensive... but it is cheaper than a Cardinals game. We almost got hit by a foul ball, we saw the freak in action, and a grand slam! Plus there were 2 drunk guys a couple rows back who kept things fun with their various crowd pleasing chants. We were so impressed we are thinking about getting tickets for next year.
