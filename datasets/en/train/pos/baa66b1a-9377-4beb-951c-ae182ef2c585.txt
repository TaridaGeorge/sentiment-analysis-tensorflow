We are definitely regulars at this Nello's location.  The service is friendly.  We almost always get a nice cozy booth to sit in.  The pizza is great and so are the sandwiches.  They are really  accommodating when it comes to making special requests.  Their house dressing is not just good for salads - get some to dip your sandwich and pizza bites in!

Good beer list and inexpensive prices. 

You really can't go wrong with Nello's.
