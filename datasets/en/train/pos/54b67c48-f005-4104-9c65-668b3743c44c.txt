This is what willis was talking about!

I tried to find decent sushi in the Scottsdale area and i failed again and again until I hit up Hiro last night. 

Great place! Good Sake selection, delicious hamachi kama and the freshest sashimi that i've found in the area. You are getting what you are paying for here.

We tried almost all the sashimi available here including the toro and ankimo and everything was pretty good. For some reason, the american sushi chef guy put the hirame to swim in ponzu sauce which upset me a little. but i will let this slide. Will probably have to pass on the toro next time too.

Try the hamachi kama if they have it available!

My coworkers and I will be back here soon. very soon.
