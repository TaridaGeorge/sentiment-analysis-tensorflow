Just when I thought I was finished discovering new (for me) "Pho Joints" in Phoenix Metro, I had to hit one more (now up to 13 visited!) and WOW, a very big winner. Broth that rivaled Dragonfly (My #1) and Pho Ao Sen (My VERY close #2), with lots of very tasty meat and the usual accompaniments. I much prefer Broth with a bold flavor and this one fits the bill. Upscale location that was very busy during lunch with lots of "Pho" being served to Vietnamese and other  patrons. I guess at $7.50 per bowl a BARGAIN for "Pho" with this quality taste!
