These folks are my heroes. For over a year after first moving downtown I suffered by ordering Pizza Hut for delivery, thinking it was my only option. A neighbor enlightened me. I called Z Pizza. The first time they delivered something to me, I almost wept with joy. You have to understand how much pain and pizzatorture I went through before seeing the Z light.

Not only do they always deliver on time, but their food is among the best I've had anywhere in Phoenix that delivers. I select something different from the menu almost every time I order, and I've yet to be disappointed. The delivery drivers also tend to be cool dudes.
