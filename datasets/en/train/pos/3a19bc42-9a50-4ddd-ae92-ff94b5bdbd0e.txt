Have you tried the new Brittlebush brunch menu? We sampled the delights on a beautiful warm November Saturday on the patio with gorgeous views of the golf course and mountains beyond. The food was simply outstanding.
    I had the scrambled eggs with smoked trout which arrived with the eggs delicately cooked on top of delicious soda bread. The scones are warm, flaky and melt in your mouth with butter and the strawberry compote. My favorite was the French toast made from corn bread drizzled with Nutella, and caramelized banana. 
   Another highlight was the coffee by Press, roasted in Arizona. In fact, I went immediately to Press Coffee Shop at Scottsdale Quarter to buy some coffee for home!!    
   Wow, this is a golf course restaurant that doesn't have just burgers and fries or fish and chips. Run, don't walk to try this delicious brunch menu.
