I've been coming to this practice since we moved to the Valley in 1990 and the doctor before Dr. Dameron took great care of my teeth and Dr. Dameron takes just as great care.  I have a small mouth and he's very considerate, especially when performing procedures.  His staff of hygienists and assistants are very nice and pleasant to deal with.  I would recommend this office to anyone in the Phoenix area looking for a dentist.
