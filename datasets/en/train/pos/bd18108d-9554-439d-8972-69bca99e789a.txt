I still love this place. Today, I brought my car in because the tire was low. Seems I've run over some nails. While waiting, I noticed they have one of those arcade basketball games to play for FREE while you're killing time. I TOTALLY suck, by the way. Didn't make a SINGLE shot. But, it's something to do beside watch Oprah!
