The list of things that makes this place awesome can go on and on.  The service is top notch, you will never be in need of anything.  The food, beyond outstanding. I LOVE the Filet Mignon Chopped Salad.  This salad will move you, it is unlike any other.  I took a friend there the other day, boasting about this salad, and he was impressed.  Yes, it's a man friendly salad as well.  The ingredients are fresh and crispy and let me tell you about the dessert.  We had the White Chocolate Brownie, which was beyond amazing.  The place is usually pretty packed, so it can be a bit loud but there is ample seating both inside and out.  

Overall love the place, it is a bit pricey spent $60 on lunch for 2 people so heed that warning but aside from that, it's AMAZING.
