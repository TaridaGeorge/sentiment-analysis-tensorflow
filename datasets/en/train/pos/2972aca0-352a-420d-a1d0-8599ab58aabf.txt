This update is based SOLELY on the events that occured after posting my last review. After my birthday was basically ruined on my last visit to Fogo, the manager of the restaurant personally contacted me to apologize and offer to make it up to my family. Not only did he take the time to listen and apologize for the events of the night but offered to buy our dinner the next time we came in. I truly believe this is what is missing in America today. Since when did service oriented businesses stop emphasizing the importance of customer satisfaction and begin acting like our patronage was a privilege they were affording US? Although I have not returned for my do-over dinner, the manager's actions have ensured that it is a place I would definitely return to, over and over again!
