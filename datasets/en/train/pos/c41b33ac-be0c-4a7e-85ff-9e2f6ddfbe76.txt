So perfect. The atmosphere is just spot on. I love going whether it's just to grab coffee and leave or if I am there studying or just want to chill. I love their Apple Harvest (?) salad. So delicious and beautifully prepared. Baristas are always very nice (especially Brianna!). Can't wait to hopefully become a regular and attend some of the live music events they put on every week!!
