A while back, I was looking for Rodenbach Grand Cru. I couldn't think of where to go, so I asked a couple of my former co-workers. They recommended this spot.

I timidly asked the person at the front of the store if they had it. I was assuming he would have to look it up, then have to find it. Not the case at all. (See what I did there? Case? Beer?)

The guy said, "Follow me". Not only did he know what I was talking about, he knew exactly where it was, and he even offered up some alternatives for me to try as well.

The import and craft section at Sun Devil is phenomenal. If you are a beer guy, THIS is where you should go.  

The staff knows their stuff. 

Also...check out "The Iron Curtain"...a whole section filled with Russian beers.
