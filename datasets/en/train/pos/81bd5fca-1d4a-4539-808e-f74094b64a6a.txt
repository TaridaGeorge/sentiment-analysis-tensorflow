This place was absolutely amazing. I was there alone on a sunday afternoon and I was treated like royalty. I orderd the Green Chile pulled pork sandwich and it was the best sandwich I have ever had. 
-The egg bun was the best part. 
My server Lexi was knowledgeable and fun, she even reccomended a great cocktail that was thouroughly enjoyed.
