So this is my spot, hands down. I spend more time in this particular building than any other building on any given week, except my house (I work from home, so no I'm not a lazy grocery store wandererer).  They have the bomb diggity Starbucks with my Starbucks peoples, they have a good deli, good meat department, great bakery, dope wine selection and just generally kick the crap out of every other grocery store I go to. I have been to some craptacular Safeway's, and they just make me love this one that much more. It's been recently remodeled, so everything's nice and clean. If you need a solid Safeway or grocery store trip in this area, this is the true gem!
