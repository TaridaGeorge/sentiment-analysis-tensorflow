Some of the best food I've ever eaten. The portions are huge, so don't eat anytime before you go.  You pick your food out and they cook it right in front of you, plus there is always soup and rice and pineapple to have on the side. You get a drink included. It's packed on weekend nights, especially since there's a classic car show right out front.
