One word: TONY. 

This man is insanely talented! My husband and I had only been in the Valley for a few years and were researching tattoo artists. Sometimes I find it best when seeing tattoos from an artist in person on a living canvas instead of in a portfolio. One of my friends has her sleeves done by Tony and I was very impressed so I went to him for my legs and half sleeve.

Knowing what Tony can do, I put my full trust in him and let him have a lot of free reign of the creativity. I feel like that's when artists truly flourish! 

Everywhere I go, I get compliments on my half sleeve and when I say who it is, there's been quite a few people who've said, "Oh yeah, Tony at Lady Luck. I should have known!"
