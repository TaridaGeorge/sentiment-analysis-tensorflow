It took me a year to venture from my Apartments from across the street to Solo Cafe, but I'm glad I did tonight. The place is a little small, cozy is a good descriptive word for it. The staff is very friendly and enjoy what they do. They offer "to go" or "hangin' around" options (meaning disposable if you intend to dash, or glass if you intend to stay).

The menu has a wide variety and fair price for each item. I always go for Italian Sodas (I'm not a huge coffee drinker myself). The night I went there was a local jam band playing in the corner and they really set the mood of the place. It is definitely worth stopping by.
