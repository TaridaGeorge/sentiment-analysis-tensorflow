There aren't as many places with the service and friendly staff as PCG!  I've only been there for the Yelp event, but I will definitely go back based solely on the treatment we all got from the staff.
The food was amazing with combos that were perfect.  The coconut shrimp was my very favorite and I am always down for fruit and cheese.
This place is very close to home and I will become a regular, whether they like it or not.
