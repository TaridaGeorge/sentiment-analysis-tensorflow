Ok I've been here about 10 or more times and I still love Rudy's the same as I first tasted them in Austin a few years ago. This place rules! Get the choice cut of brisket and try some smoked turkey and throw in a half link while your add it. You won't be disappointed. I've never been!  Overall my favorite BBQ here in Phx until I can be proven wrong. If this is not the best one in Phx, then it's one of them in almost everyone's list. I love Rudy's!
