Shannon did the flowers for our daughter's wedding back in April.  She did an outstanding job!  We got so many comments about the flowers-how beautiful they were-the decorations-which Shannon did-how beautiful!   Shannon took care of all the decorating the day of the wedding and had everything ready to go-we could concentrate on other last minute details.  Shannon was easy to work with, prompt with getting back to us with prices and was very reasonable.  Shannon gave wonderful suggestions and ideas which turned out to be exactly what my daughter was looking for.    Thank you Shannon!
