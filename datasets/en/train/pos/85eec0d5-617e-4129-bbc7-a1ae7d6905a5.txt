Since I refuse to feed my beloved doggies the crap that comes out of pet stores, grocery stores, and vet offices I buy my food here. 

Pet Food Depot has a great selection of dog food and the staff is amazingly helpful and knowledgeable about the various foods. During the Great Pet Food Recall of 2007 there were emails and notes around various foods stating if they were affected or not. The prices are very reasonable. It's not some high end posh puppy palace but a livestock store.
