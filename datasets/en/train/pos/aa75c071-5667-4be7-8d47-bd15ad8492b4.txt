We just got back from a great dinner at Pasta P (new nickname I see). I had really slow service almost a year ago and hadnt been back since. This year we've already been twice and both times, the service has been right on point, the wine list well suited my "no sommelier here" taste. We both ate the special, ( I know, Italian cardinal rule #1 was broken. No one orders the same thing so everyone can "taste" something new or different) Linguine with Fresh Dungenous crab & fresh veggies. Yum yum yum. Service was quick, took away salad plate brought entree. Iced tea was so good I asked for a to-go cup (think thirstbuster size) $40 (with tip) for two specials, one salad, a water and major iced tea....not bad for a boring Tuesaday night.
