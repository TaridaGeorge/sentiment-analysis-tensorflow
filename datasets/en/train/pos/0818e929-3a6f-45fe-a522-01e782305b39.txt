I grew up in an area with a high Asian population, so I'm spoiled when it comes to Chinese food. This place makes great food. Although it doesn't look like much from the outside, it's actually very nice inside. They even have an aquarium. It looks and feels authentic, although I guess I technically am not qualified to say that it is. The owners are very nice and the servers are happy to help and accomodate. I just love eating there - the atmosphere is very relaxing and the food and tea are comforting.
