WOW!!!! 

It's about a 15 minute drive up the mountain. At first we were disappointed and thought, "yippie. dry, brown, rock. can't wait to see more." The further up you go it becomes amazing. The roads are winding and the views are unbeatable. Once at the top it was crowded especially Dobbins Lookout. You can see the entire city. it was sorta windy and we could see mini dust storms in the distance. On the drive down there are areas where you can pull over and take more photos.

Next time we visit the mountain we will be prepared to hike and maybe go at sunrise or sunset.
