Haha I got the Valentine's Day special and you didn't! 

On our Yelp scavenger hunt we found our way into this I guess for a lack of a better term, Popsicle shop. I swear there were like 5 candy or sweets shops on that list and I HAD to get something at everyone. This place was by far my favorite. I was lucky enough to snag one of their last V-Day specials, strawberry with dark chocolate drizzle. To die for! Everything else sounded, smelled and looked delish too! 

Must try on Mill Ave! Perfect after dinner treat!
