When I first moved to the area, I chose this vet because I can walk here.  I didn't like the vet at the time, but since Dr. Capwell has taken over I'm much happier.  They are always very friendly and helpful, and I love that Dr. Capwell is willing to sit on the floor with the dogs - it makes them much more comfortable.

I travel to the northeast frequently, and so I had some questions about Lyme Disease.  Since it's so rare around here, Dr. Capwell researched the vaccine options and really helped me out.  She definitely went the extra mile!
