I love this salon! The owners, Tina and Bruno Davanzo are very friendly and treat their clients with respect. I have been going to them for 5 years and never once had a problem or situation in their salon. Tina is the master hair stylist and is an artist with her scissors! I also adore Yesenia who always makes me look like a model when I leave the salon. 

It is very important to me that a salon is current on trends regarding color, cuts, and makeup. It shows that they take pride in what they are doing. Overall, it's a wonderful place to get your hair styled, a great place to relax and be pampered!
