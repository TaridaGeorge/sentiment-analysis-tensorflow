Hiking Camelback up through echo canyon is one of the best things about living in Arizona! It's a strenuous hike but well worth the effort. I feel like Spiderman everytime I head up the steep rocky areas of the hike. It's a matter of grabbig onto the right rocks and pulling yourself up. In some cases it's better to not look back just keep heading up!The parking on this side of the mountain is quite challenging but worth the wait. I ususally sit in my car in line while slowly each car moves up into the parking area. Take water and a camera to capture some of the best views of the valley,
