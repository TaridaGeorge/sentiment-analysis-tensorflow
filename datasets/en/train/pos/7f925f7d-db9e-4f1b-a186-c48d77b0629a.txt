A few weeks ago after bowling I ventured to the Bunkhouse with one of my teammates for a quick nightcap.  It was about 9:30 p.m. on a Friday night and it was fairly busy but not packed.  I had not been there in years, literally lived in an apartment complex behind the bar back when I was younger and was definitely a "regular" in the day.  

We only stayed for one cocktail, the bar is kinda divey but a pleasant environment.  The large patio is a nice feature that most bars don't have.  If I still lived in Central Phx and not Tempe I would be there more often.
