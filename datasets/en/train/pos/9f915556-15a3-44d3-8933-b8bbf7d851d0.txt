This is truly my most favorite brewpub ever! Why? It is only the site of the best beer and food paired meal I've had. The chef is very imaginative as they came up with a entree with goat, pepper cheese and spinach with pine nuts rapped in phyllo dough was amazing. It was paired by yours truly with their impale ale. 

I have dined their on several occasions when lucky enough to be in Tempe and have enjoyed many of their entrees, though sadly that fave dish is no longer available. Their beers are phenomenal, their service attentive (the waitresses are cute ,at least when I go), they have a shrine to Elvis and their pub has a great lay out.  What is not to love?
