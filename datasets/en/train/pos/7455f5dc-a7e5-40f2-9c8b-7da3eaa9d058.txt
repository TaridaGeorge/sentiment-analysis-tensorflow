Short Version: Dude, this place rocks.

Long Version: This is, by far, the most amazing resort I've ever visited. The grounds, the service, the food, the accommodations, everything is top of the line. And I think the attribute that should be mentioned above all else is the architecture. The facilities are gorgeous and inspiring, which is not something you can say often about architecture. It is second-to-none. In a way, it's almost pointless to go into depth describing this place because it is simply the best. I want to go on, but you can read all the other reviews. If you're in town and you have the means to stay there, do it. You won't regret it.
