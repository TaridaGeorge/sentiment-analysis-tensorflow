Never say never, I was completely against hot yoga, the thought of being in a stinky sweaty room with other peoples body heat was the last thing on my mind. But right before my Birthday last year I decided to try new things and I am so glad I did.  Not only did I like it, I loved it.  First, it is  great workout, second I feel like I had a massage after the class. Third, staff great especially Serena, I highly suggest taking her class, she is motivational, plays great tunes and will make you smile. If you are new to hot yoga or didn't click with bikram before you give up on it try Sumit.
