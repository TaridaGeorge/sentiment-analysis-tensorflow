Wow. Fast is an understatement.  Two cashiers, two terminals, handling two customers at once - one on each side.  This is their business model - awesome!

Step up to a terminal by the donuts and order a fresh hot pretzel - done in two mintues

I have seen elaborate coffee stations but I was in love when I saw their elaborate TEA station.  SWEET!  My favorite.  Hot tea, iced tea, flavored tea, brewed tea, boxed jarred and sunned tea.  

I think I will quit my professional job and work at a QT if they ever come to Michigan.  :)
