On average, I go here MINIMUM 1X a week....already been there 2X in the last 3 days, so that tells you what a regular I am.  Have met the owner multiple times and he's super friendly and always remembers us.  They change flavors regularly and the flavors are SOOO yummy.  You can even get ones with no sugar in them that are delicious (chocolate dipped strawberries...had it tonight...great!).  Their website has all of the weight watchers points, too, which is kind of nice.  Their toppings are the best - fresh fruits AND some of your standard stuff (M&M's, cookie dough, sprinkles, etc.).  Great ambience and the teenagers that work there are always friendly.  Glad to have Yo Love in our neighborhood!!
