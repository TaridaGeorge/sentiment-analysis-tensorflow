I love Capital Grille, I don't know how there is even one bad review. I have eaten here several times. I have always had excellent service and food. I love the shrimp cocktail, Calamari, and stuffed mushroom apps. The steak salad is great and the filet melts in your mouth. I tried the coconut cream pie and fell in love, it is amazing! It is pricey but so worth it. We usually go here for very special occasions.
