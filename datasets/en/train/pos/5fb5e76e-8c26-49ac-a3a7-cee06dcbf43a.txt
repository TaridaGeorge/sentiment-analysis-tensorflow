You have to love Roaring Fork's awesome happy hour.  It runs until 7pm which is great for people like me who work too late!  The food is good and the portions are generous.  Hey, where else can you go in Scottsdale for a good meal and a drink and spend less than $20 per person?  And they also have a great wine selection.  Definitely worth going to and it's a central place to meet people from all over the valley.
