A couple of snowbirds back in FH for the winter, love the Taphouse and so happy to see they are now serving breakfast! Friday night prime rib is back or friday night all you can eat fish & chips, both are excellent at a reasonable price. Breakfast for $3.99 is also an excellent choice, 9am to 1pm on weekends or 10:30am to 1pm on weekdays. Lots of option's, great atmosphere, friday nights get busy so plan to go early.
