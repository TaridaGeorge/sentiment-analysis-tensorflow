I've gone here twice with my daughter and once myself. Wait time to me is very reasonable not long at all, less wait time than my normal Dr. Maybe 30 mins tops! staff is nice, and the three Dr. I meant with were very nice and helped me with my issues. I honesty did not have one issue. Walls are thin but I dont mind all you hear is mumbles.  To me I had good experience at this urgent care and would go back.
