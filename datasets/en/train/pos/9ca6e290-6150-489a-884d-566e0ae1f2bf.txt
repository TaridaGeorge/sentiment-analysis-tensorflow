Literally ran into this delicious place this morning with a friend while taking a nice run around Old Town Scottsdale bright & early. They just moved here from the Biltmore & I could not be happier about it! 

We devoured the ham and swiss croissant, which was to die for, while sipping on great coffee. Can't wait to go back & try more of the food!
