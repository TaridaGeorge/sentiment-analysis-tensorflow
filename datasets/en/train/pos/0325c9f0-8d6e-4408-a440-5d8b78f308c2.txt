What's not to love about a locally owned restaurant with a great menu!? They feature new lunch and dinner specials and a great happy hour! 
The list of beers may be overwhelming, try the "Beer of the Month". only $3! Or go for my absolute favorite, their Red Sangria. All other Sangrias can't come close!
