After years of using online print brokers and experiencing declining quality & reliability, I gave Impact a shot. I sent them an email for a simple business card quote and within 10 minutes I had a PDF in my inbox. The price was competitive, estimated turnaround time was cut in half, and my order was COD - in other words, they wanted me to examine the work before paying... unheard of these days.

Like the previous post, Jeff was my point person, and I have to give him an A+ for delivering on his promises. He takes the time to understand your needs, doesn't pressure you with an up-sell, and produces a fantastic final product.

As a Phoenix graphic designer, I'm grateful to have this world class operation in my neighborhood!
