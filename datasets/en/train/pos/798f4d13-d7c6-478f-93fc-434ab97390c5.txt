First of all I have to say the chocolate martini was Great. The prices are a little steep but you definitely get what you pay for. We happened to show up on their live band karaoke night and I have to say it was fantastic! Everyone was personable and nice. The waitress was also amazing. Looking forward to coming back next Monday!
