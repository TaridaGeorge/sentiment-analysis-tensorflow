I went to the emergency room at JCL with severe lower back pain and had a great experience! Everyone was very attentive and really listened! They took me directly to a private room and I got into a gown and laid down. The doctor came in and took time to talk to me and examined me. Gave me three choices. I had a CT scan to take away my worries. I decided to get a muscle relaxant and give it a few days...good decision. I went in at 5:30 am Sat morning and only spent a few hours at the hospital. Super nice people and environment!
