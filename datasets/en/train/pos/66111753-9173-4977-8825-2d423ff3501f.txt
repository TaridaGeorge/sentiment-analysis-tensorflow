First of all, I completely disagree with DIane G statement. Interesting how she is a member just this month and then posts a negative review? Hmmm Also, they don't serve shrimp dishes during lunch buffet which she indicates, which Indian Buffet does that?.. "All the dishes are watery?" I don't believe it.  Anyway, we went with our family this past week and the food was great. They have a good selection and food was fresh. The only thing that was not good like the reviewer said was that charged my son a full buffet price. He didn't eat anything except 3 spoons of rice and some rice pudding.
