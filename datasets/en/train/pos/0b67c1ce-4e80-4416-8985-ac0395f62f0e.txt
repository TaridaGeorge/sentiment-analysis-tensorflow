Every time I come here, I always think, "Okay, I'll try something different this time." I don't. I always get the Vegetable Musakaa. Oh goodness, the eggplant is so tender, it just melts in my mouth. And it's served in an amazingly flavorful tomato-based sauce with garlic slices (roasted to the point of mellow flavor - nothing a simple mint can't solve after dinner) that I could eat every day for the rest of my life and never be able to tell you what combination of spices they use to make it so perfect. It (and every entree) comes with lentil soup (or salad, but I'm stuck in a food habit at Sahara) which warrants a paragraph on its own, or even a sonnet to fully convey my love for it, but this isn't the place for such intimate thoughts. Just be sure to have at least a cup.
