Oh breakfast, you're my best friend. Let's be pals forever and for always.

Butterfields offers so many choices, it's almost absurd. You can choose between breakfast or lunch.. Although for me, it's no contest. Breakfast wins every time. 

The skillet I ordered started with a hash brown base, topped with peppers, chorizo and avocado then topped with two over easy eggs. It originally came with cheese, but they left it off for me. This comes with your choice of pancakes or grits. I picked whole wheat pancakes. Sooooo good. Everything was delicious. Even the fresh squeezed OJ and I don't even really like oranges. 

The service was very friendly and prompt. I could seriously eat just about everything on the menu. I can't wait to go back.
