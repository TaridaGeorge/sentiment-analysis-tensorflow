The lowest prices on art supplies in the valley. I know, because I hit up all the art stores, seeing as I am an artist as well as an art teacher. 
I love the layout of this store also. Comfy comes to mind. Not warehouse-y, which sometimes ends up happening. 
I bought and used a groupon here. No muss, no fuss. Great deal!
