Phoenix City Grill is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The food is always amazing. There's always a special dish so I can try new things. The staff is excellent. 

I love to take out of town guests here, but it's also our go-to spot for date night. I highly recommend PCG & their sister restaurant, Sierra Bonita.
