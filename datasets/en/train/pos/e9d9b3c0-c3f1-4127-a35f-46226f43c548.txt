This place has hands down some of the best service around.  Thomas runs a tight ship and if you ever have any concerns or needs hit him up.  Their burgers are to die for and I'm excited to go back and try more dishes.  Kirk is also an outstanding server,  he remembered me and my girlfriend from my previous visit and always makes you feel important.  Love this place!  One of my favorite spots in town....
