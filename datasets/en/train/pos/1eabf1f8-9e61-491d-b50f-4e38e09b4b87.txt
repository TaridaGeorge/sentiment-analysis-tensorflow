I don't own any Parnian Furniture, but I like it.  Does that count?  This is a family owned company that has obviously done very well for themselves. 

The furniture is all high-end and very contemporary.  They tend to have very bold colors in their furniture, but that is contrasted by the lack of patterns.  This keeps things minimalist, but still modern. 

Check out their showroom, but they also have a new store in Scottsdale Fashion Square mall.
