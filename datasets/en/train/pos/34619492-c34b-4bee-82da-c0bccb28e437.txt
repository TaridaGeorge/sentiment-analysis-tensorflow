Love Penzey's!  I don't cook major recipes any more, but I still like to cook a bit. I may not use many of the spices in Penzey's but the store makes me want to.  What I love about this place is that it has any spice you can think of or never heard of before going in there.  They have samples of every spice, for sniffing.  I think I sniffed every spice there. I didn't get out of there for over an hour.  I bought a few things and I've used them all so far.  Love the cocoa, BBQ 3000, the almond extract, rosemary and more.  
Go to Penzey's...get inspired....or not...just go for the experience.
p.s. staff is very helpful and cheery.
