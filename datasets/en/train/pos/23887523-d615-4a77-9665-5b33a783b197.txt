I quite like Pita Jungle and have been to three of their locations. The downtown location is not only a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but it's also their most beautiful and usable restaurant. The space is very large and features a full bar and a patio. This is something I was aggravated by at the Tempe location is they have no bar, and the Indian School location has no patio. They also did a teriffic job of keeping the integrity of the old Gold Spot Market that they are located inside. 

The service here is impeccible just as normal with Pita Jungle. Friendly servers, cute waitresses, prompt delivery from the kitchen, and efficient seating. The food is high quality, tasty, and inexpensive. The black bean burger is probably my favorite dish here. A beautiful balance of spicy, smokey, and salty. 

Pita Jungle yum.
