I have been going here for a few years now and in the last year or so I can say that I go about 4 times per week. I LOVE this place and I love the staff. I get either different Iced Tea that is not brewed so they specially brew it for me OR a Mocha and I have never had a proble with my drink here. The staff are always friendly and they are not ROBOTS like at othe coffee places I used to go to. I will drive out of my way to stop in because I enjoy this place so much....
