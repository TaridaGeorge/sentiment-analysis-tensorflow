If you love burgers than you should eat here at least one time, especially if you love sweet potato fries!

Just get their standard issue burger with a "basket" of sweet potato fries.  Literally, it's a shopping cart basket filled with their fries.  It comes with this orange sauce that's amazing.  They'll cook your burger any way you want it so if you're the kind of person who wants the beef still mooing, they'll bring you the cow.
