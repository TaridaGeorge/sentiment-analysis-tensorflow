YUM!!!! I love this place.  Its the best icecream I've ever had.  The flavors are amazing and you can tell everything is made from the best ingredients.  I tried the mint icecream and it tasted like real mint leaves.  I sampled the salted caramel icecream and that was wonderful too.  Excelleny customer service too - very friendly and they offered plenty of t aste tests.  Definately will be back many times.
