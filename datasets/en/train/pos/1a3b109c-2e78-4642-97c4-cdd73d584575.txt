The best supermarket...end of story.  I like the covered parking, which helps in the dead of summer.  I haven't had need to use the car wash or valet parking service, but I think that it's a nice touch for people who cant walk far, mom's with kids and the elderly (or just super lazy).  The produce section has items I have never heard of and we have had fun trying new things.  The bakery has items that rival top tier bakeries, at half the price.  The meat department has a great presentation.  The service is great.  People watching isn't as good as Fashion Square, but it's not too shabby.
