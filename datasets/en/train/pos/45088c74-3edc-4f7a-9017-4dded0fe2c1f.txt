I can't believe I haven't rated this before.  LOVE LOVE LOVE the food here.  Kool-aid on tap!   NOM!  

I do have to say that I don't eat wings, but my bf does EVERYWHERE and this is one of his faves.  His 7 year old said they have the best food she's had anywhere!  She is a picky little princess too!

I get to nosh on all of the other deliciousness they offer... try them all!  

We will be back again and again and again!
