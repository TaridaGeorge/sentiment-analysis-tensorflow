I love this place.  I have visited it a couple of times and last time was for restaurant week.  Everything is great. I love the sauteed prawns with pineapple salsa and for the sides my favorites are the jalapeno creamed corn (can't get enough) and the cheddar mashed potatoes. On a previous visit I had the Pernil Asado, really awesome.  For dessert I like the Horchata bread pudding.  The place is very cozy, just a few tables inside.  I am so happy we have nice weather now, so we can sit in the patio.  Can't wait to go back.
