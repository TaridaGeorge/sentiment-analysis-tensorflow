I sought the help of yelp to find a good Mexican restaurant where I could take my mother while she is visiting and was reminded of Richardson's New Mexico style cuisine.  I had been there twice before on dates and thought it was mediocre, but when I wasn't submerged in dreadful conversation I was able to fully enjoy the food!  Mom loved her turkey and mushroom enchiladas with yummy sauce that made her lips burn (just how she likes it).  They accommodated me with veggie blue corn enchiladas--yummy!  It would have been better with wine, but I'm not allowed to drink around my parents at age 29--pathetic I know!  I guess the wine didn't make my dates better, so the food definitely doesn't need it.
