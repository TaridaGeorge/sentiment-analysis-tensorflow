I tried out this restaurant a few weeks ago when it just opened.  I think I got the pan friend noodle entree with beef.  It was delicious! I also had a taste of my friend's noodle soup, and it was light but fulfilling.  I did not get food coma after I left this place, which I think is a good thing.  I am Vietnamese and I heard Cambodian cuisine is similar to Vietnamese food, or at the least, it got it influence from Vietnamese cuisine.  Though I cannot critique Cambodian food with much authority, I've eaten homecooked Cambodian food at my friend's house before, so I can say Sekong by Night's is comparable to homecooked food :).  Give it a try. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.
