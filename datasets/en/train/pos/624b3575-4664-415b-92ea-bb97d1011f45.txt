I've been shopping here since opening day 10+ years ago.  This is the ONLY place to buy fresh fish and prime meats.  the service is fantastic and friendly.  Seafood is way fresher (and cheaper) than whole foods.  

There is no better Fillet Mignon you can buy to make at home.  The bacon may look like that in other supermarkets, but it's way better.  Fresh, never frozen.  This is what makes their chicken breasts taste better.  This is the best selection of fruits and vegetables anywhere in Scottsdale.  Everything is always super fresh especially compared to a regular supermarket.
