Like most people, I don't exactly look forward to going to the dentist. Let me just say this was one of the very best medical experiences I've ever had, if not the absolute best.

The office is relaxing, modern and full of things to keep you interested if you have a wait (including a computer for patient use and a break room with coffee and water). The staff is approachable and friendly. And Dr. Tran was kind, thorough, and gentle.

I actually look forward to returning!
