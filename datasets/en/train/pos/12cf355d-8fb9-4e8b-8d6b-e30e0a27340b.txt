I can't really tell you anything that has not been said over and over already. There is LOTS of selection, the herbs and spices are amazingly fresh, they have a really helpful staff, you can sniff the stuff in store, you can order by mail if you like, there are different sizes of jars and bags to choose from, there are recipes for you in store and online..... you read all that already, right? 

Bottom line:
Want to get some herbs and/or spices to enhance your cooking? GO HERE!
Enjoy!
