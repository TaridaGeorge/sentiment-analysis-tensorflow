I love Penzey's. I stumbled into it, and now make a point to stop in whenever I need spices.  Feel pretty lucky that the only Penzey's in Arizona is so close.

I recommend their Arizona Dreaming salt-free seasoning.  Excellent.

Also: Natural Dark Cocoa, Vietnamese Cinnamon, Fine Herbes, and Chili 3000.

Lots of varieties of chili powder, cinnamon, vanilla, and much more.  Allow some extra time for your first visit.
