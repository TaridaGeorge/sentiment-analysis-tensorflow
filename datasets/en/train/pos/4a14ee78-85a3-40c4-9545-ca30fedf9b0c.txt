We were looking for GOOD NY-style pizza and great wings.  We found both at Lucky's Pizza!  It is PERFECT for a sit-down family meal or get together with a few friends.  Their pizza, calzone, and wings are awesome!  We love the delicious and fresh pizza with great quality ingredients.  Service is quick and even "to go" orders are just like we like it!  We are "regulars" there and are never disappointed!  We are definitely fans and feed our family of 6 (with leftovers)...very filling and tasty.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!    (Delivery would make it PERFECT, but it's WORTH the drive...about 10 minutes each way....we pass by (4) other pizza joints on the way so I hope that's saying ALOT!)
