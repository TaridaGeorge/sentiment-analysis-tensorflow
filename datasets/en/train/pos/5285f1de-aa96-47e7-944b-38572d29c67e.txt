Went here for our anniversary with friends. I posted pictures. I apologize that they're half-eaten and upside down, but hey, at least I got a few before we finished the meal. I can't count how many times I've done that.

Had the chicken picatta, which was excellent. Others had the chicken and penne, stroganoff, and ribeye. Prices are a little steep (about 20 bucks on average), but they are typical for a resort restaurant. Excellent service--she even cracked a joke (on me!).

The lounge area is great and the bartenders enjoyable. We went to the lounge bar before dinner and for a night cap every night we stayed at the Ho.

Highly recommend.
