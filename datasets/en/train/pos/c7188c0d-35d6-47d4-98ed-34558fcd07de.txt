I have been to the other site in Phoenix, so I was excited to see one near me. Had early breakfast to celebrate New Years. Had the traditional Eggs Benedict. Really yummy. The hollendaise was perfect, as was the poached eggs. Even the muffin was better than most. Sweet potato lots are crisp and tasty. Will come back again not only for the food, but for the great service.
