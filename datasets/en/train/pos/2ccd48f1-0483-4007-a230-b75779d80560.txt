This is the most extraordinary theater I've ever been to. I love this place. I've only been in theater 11 so I'm not certain all of the others are the same, but this one has an incredible amount of leg room between the seats. Someone could literally walk down the aisle and not even brush against your legs. 

In addition, the clarity of the picture, the sound, the termperature... all perfect! I live down near San Tan mall and drive out of my way to this location to watch movies, thats how awesome it is.
