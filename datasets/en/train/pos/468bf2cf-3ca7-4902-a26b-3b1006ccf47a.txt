Lowe's- the only home improvement store I semi don't mind going to.  The cool thing about Lowe's is that they have everything, from tools to patio furniture.  And most things are reasonably priced.

You'll also get great customer service here and it's usually not too hard to find someone on the floor to help you. If you haven't been, this is definitely a good spot to go if you're doing any home renovations or changes.
