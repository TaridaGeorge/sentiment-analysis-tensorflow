Everything we had here -- and we ate a ton -- was fantastic. All the sushi was great, but I wish we ordered more smoked salmon. No reason really to splurge on the Toro because the yellowtail, albacore, salmon and all their rolls are phenomenal. Get the octopus cucumber salad to start, too. My only suggestion would be to those of you who like things a bit more spicy, you should do your best to insist on an increased kick with the spicy tuna roll and anything else they say is "spicy." Great place -- we will be there often.
