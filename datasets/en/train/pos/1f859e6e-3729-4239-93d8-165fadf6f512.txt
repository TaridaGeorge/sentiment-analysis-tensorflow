Probably would vote best bbq in city.   I love BBQ and eat at many places with BBQ.  Beans are terrific and great sweet potato fries rock.  BBQ sauce is chefs own and so is the rub, he competes and this is how his story begins, check this place out and you won't regret it.  Must try ribs and brisket.   Service is great and family friendly.  Recommend this place and hope to see them on Drive in Diners and Dives in the future. AWESOME FOOD.  If you try it email DDD and see if you can get them to show up, this is a great place and one of the only places that has a local smoker onsite (BIG PLUS).
