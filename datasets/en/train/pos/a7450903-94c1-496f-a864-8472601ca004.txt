The BEST chain store in The Valley to purchase your Urban fishing supplies from.  Other chain stores sell fishing crap cookie-cutter across the country, but Big 5 has exactly what you need to fish around Phoenix and in individual small packaging at great prices.  You don't have to buy assortments and unrelated fishing item kits like at other places.  For example, bought 3 bait-holding catfish treble hooks for $1.49, 6 half-ounce egg sinkers for $.99, and 8 medium swivels for $.99.  Also, bought a cheapy spare rod/reel for $15, and the thing works great.  They also have a bunch of portable chairs, including some with sunshades for cheaper than anywhere I've seen.  $10 for just a chair and $30 for the chair with the built-in canopy.  They also have fresh night crawlers and meal worms.
