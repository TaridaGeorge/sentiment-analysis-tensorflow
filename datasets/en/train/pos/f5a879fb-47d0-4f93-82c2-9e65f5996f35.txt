Abacus is the best! They have the best hot and sour soup I've ever tasted. Eggrolls are awesome too. I've tried many things on the menu and have never been disapointed. 
I can't comment on the table service because I always get take-out but the cashier has always been very nice. 

Be sure to ask for thier special mustard, it's awesome too.
