I love me some SidBar!  It is hands down my favorite chill lounge in downtown Phoenix.  The crafty cocktails and small bites are perfect to help unwind after work.  The music is chill and even on the weekends you can have a conversation because the music isn't blaring, so nice!!  On Sundays they have Retro-Hi Fi and the dj spin some sick beats and bring in some amazing acts.  Shoot!  I want to go right now!
