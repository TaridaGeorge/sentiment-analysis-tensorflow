We are regulars at this place.  The food is very good, as are the portions.  The restaurant is clean, open and airy, and there is a patio outside for the appropriate time of the year.

The owner, David, is usually there and "manages by walking around".  The staff is both friendly and competent.

Try it, you'll like it!
