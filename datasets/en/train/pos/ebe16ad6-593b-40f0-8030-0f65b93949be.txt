Before nursing school, I used to have pampered nails. Now I bite them before tests, break them opening pill bottles, and hold the polish as a means of infection control.

The minute my semester was over, I went for a mani/pedi. I feel ASLEEP in the massage chair. (Thankfully it was later in the day and not that many people were there to witness this)

So, I've been coming to see Mei here at Paradise Nails off and on for around 5 years. She just went ahead and let me sleep, she figured I needed it. I figure they need 5 stars.

Oh, and you'd never know I'm in nursing by looking at my hands now. Bam!
