this place was fantastic! Now don't get me wrong, i won't be driving all the way to Wickenburg to satisfy a craving, but when i'm in town (either on the way up or back from Vegas) there's no doubt i'll stop, hungry or not.
It was lunchtime when we stopped, so a two item combo for me (links and pork ribs, cornbread, coleslaw and beans), and a full rack of pork ribs for my traveling companion ( a veteran of the place who knew the value of bringing home plenty of leftovers).
i loved the "small town" feel with the exposed and rather spartan service station, and the guns and roses and aromas drifting out of the open door to the kitchen added to the "home cooking" feeling.
if you like bbq, and you find yourself in Wickenburg, hungry or not, stop at the Hog Trough.
