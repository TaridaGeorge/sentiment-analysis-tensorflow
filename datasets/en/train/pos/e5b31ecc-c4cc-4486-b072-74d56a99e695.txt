The Gilbert House is my absolute favorite breakfast place in Gilbert.  Susan's Apple Pancakes are to die for, and I usually struggle between getting that or the Buffalo Scramble.  Everything tastes like it was made in mom's kitchen (or better if you had my mom!)  The service is great.  The people are so friendly.  Nothing like a leisurely breakfast (or lunch) on the patio on a beautiful day.
