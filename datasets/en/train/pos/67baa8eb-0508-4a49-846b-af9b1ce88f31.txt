This place is soul squared. There's nothing finer than an evening starting with a long conversation with a complete stranger at Bar Bianco, followed by an antipasto platter, then a Biancoverde with a layer of buttery proscuitto piled on top. Bring me a pint of cream ale and I'm in heaven. If Dave brings it to me, even better. Crusty, cheesy, salty, splendid heaven.
