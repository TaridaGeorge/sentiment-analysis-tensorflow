Ok. This place is THE BEST place to get sausages in Phoenix PERIOD! The breakfast sausage could very well best the best ever. I go here regularly and have had so many of thier sausages, they have all been great. I do not even buy supermarket sausage anymore after finding this place, not even in the same ball park. Top notch.
