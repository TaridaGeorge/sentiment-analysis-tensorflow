By far one of my fave brewery's/bars in the valley. I look forward to the fall season bc that's when I know they will have their seasonal beer, Pumpkin Porter on tap soon. Absolutely amazing and one beer I actually  grew a craving for. My typical beer other wise is their house Hefeweizen with their order of salted pretzels with spicy mustard, which is FANTASTIC..If you're looking for a sweet but dry dark beer try the Oatmeal Stout, it's amazing as well. Alright I'm drooling thinking about this place, and no I'm no alcoholic just a beer connoisseur.
