Travis is hands down the coolest and most talented tattoo artist I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. His creativity, skill, and professionalism go unparalleled. Quite possibly the quickest tattoo artist I've ever met as well. After he finished a large tattoo on my arm I went back to him within weeks to complete two more tattoos in one sitting. All three of the tattoos completed by him remain to be my all time favorite. If you want any ole tattoo, go anywhere. Who cares. But If you want a beautiful tattoo you will absolutely love... go see Travis.
