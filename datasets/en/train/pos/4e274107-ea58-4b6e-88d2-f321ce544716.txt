What is there to say about the Home Depot? Not sure.

The competition is generally Lowes. I find lowes to have a younger staff, maybe a bit better looking. However, who cares. The Home Depot has people who genuinely know what they are talking about. 

For example, I was looking at table sanders one time and one associate came by and asked if everything is OK. I told him, just window shopping and dreaming. Then we started talking about large planers and projects we were working on. It's nice. It's nice to know that you aren't dealing with just plain salespeople but rather people who work with stuff they sell.
