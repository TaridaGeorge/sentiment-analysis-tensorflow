Absolutely love the ambiance and bruschetta!! I came here for a surprise bday dinner with my classmates. My friends recommended eating prior since its a little on the pricier side. I ordered the four of the following bruschetta:

Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone
Smoked Salmon with Pesto
Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese (**FAVE**)
Salami with Pesto

I'm starting a healthier lifestyle by trying to eat organic, more veges, and foods with anti-oxidants. Today was a cheat day and I will have to remind myself that this is a great place to come back to! There were about 20 of us and we sat in nice comfy chairs outside. Waiter was really friendly -- great service! I love the ambiance and its a great place to walk around downtown Gilbert afterwards!
