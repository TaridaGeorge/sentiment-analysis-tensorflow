I agree with the previous posts.  I was looking for a reasonably priced, but delicious lunch and found this place on yelp.  They were celebrating their 35th year anniversary and were thrilled to find out I was visiting for the first time.  I met the owner Joe and his wife Tina.  They make a point of introducing themselves and making you feel very welcome.  You can taste-test all of their salads.  (Their chicken salad and baked beans are delicious) I am so glad for yelp helping me find all of these little gems that would have remained hidden!
BTW, cheese steak is amazing.  Got the works and it is delicious.
