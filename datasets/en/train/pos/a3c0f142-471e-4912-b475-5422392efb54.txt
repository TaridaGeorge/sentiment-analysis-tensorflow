The best alterations location I've found in the Phoenix metro area, and trust me I've tried a few.

I took some men's dress shirts here about two years ago to have them altered, and they turned out perfect.  After I moved I took any new shirts I got to different tailors closer to my house, but never got quite the same level of results; now I'm back to taking everything to this place, even though it takes a while to drive across town to get here.
