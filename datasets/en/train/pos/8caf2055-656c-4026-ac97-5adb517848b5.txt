My scheduled carpet cleaner cancelled at the last minute this morning and I was faced with a house full of furniture that had been rearranged in anticipation of their visit. Barefoot Organic Carpet Care saved the day by coming out within hours of my phone call! Not only were the prompt and reliable, but the product that they use, BioKleen, is my favorite non-toxic product - a must have in this house! Justin just left; my house doesn't smell chemically and my carpets are clean. Success!
