My boyfriend and I found this cute little place through urbanspoon. It's our new favorite breakfast place. The food is wonderful and the service is friendly. They even gave us to-go cups without us asking. We will definitely go back. It's going to be hard to try something new on the menu because the carne asada burrito was so good. :)
