I needed an after market Sirius taken out of my old car and installed on a new vehicle. Don made sure to fit me in quickly and take care of the process. I know it must've been a quick and easy job, seeing as how they do custom installs on high end cars and do custom speaker and audio installs. However, just because my job was a "normal" one, doesn't mean i don't appreciate how quickly and professionally they took care of me. 

the place is small, nestled b/t Flicka's and another auto store, but there work, judging by the photos on the wall, is huge. if i ever need to (or have the cash) to get my truck tricked out, i would definitely go back to Soundwerks.
