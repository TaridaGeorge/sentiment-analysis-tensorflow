If you are looking for unique furniture  or that perfect accent piece this store is full of options. After searching and waiting for the perfect height, length and texture bench for the end of my bed, Rebecca helped me create it from start to finish. Rebecca is the humble owner that is always a pleasure to be around and will definitely go the extra to get what you're looking for if not already on display in her wonderfully eclectic store. It's also a great place to drop in for a last minute gift from original dry humor cards to incredibly lavish candles.
