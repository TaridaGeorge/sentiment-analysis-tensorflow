oh this fills the void of vinyl toys in phoenix. i love the store, love the selection, and the owner is always so excited to talk about the up and coming. it has to be one of my favorite stops in town. a lot better than seeing toys only online. i hope they stay around for a long long time.

the only down side? it's bad....really bad on the wallet. :)
