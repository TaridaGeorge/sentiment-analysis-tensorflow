Had never even heard of a bialy before I went here but it was really good. Got a tomato basil bialy with cream cheese and lox. It was really good and a nice filling meal. Probably ate too much but I wanted to finish it was so good. 

The bialy is supposed to be healthier than a bagel which is great because i think it tastes better too. The tomato basil packed a ton of flavor. Can't wait till i get back here again.
