We wanted a hot air balloon ride for our 10th anniversary and the people at Arizona Hot Air Balloons did not disappoint.  Their reservations process was easy, their prices were competitive, and their service was really personal.  We even got to lend a hand in the launch of the balloon!  Our pilot, Peggy, and ground crew, Larry, were friendly and charming and made us feel like old friends.  Our post-flight champagne toast was enjoyable, and our pilot had even made part of the breakfast.

We launched from a site with several other balloons from other companies which were clearly more 'slick' and commercial, but I wouldn't  trade our experience with Arizona Hot Air Balloons for anything.  It had the personal touch that we really appreciated.  It was a really special way to celebrate our anniversary.
