Food was excellent and consistent. I ate here over 9 times while staying for a conference. I was very surprised to find such quality in a franchise on-site restaurant. They use fresh herbs, and it makes all the difference. The staff is friendly, the outdoor setting is beautiful. The bathrooms are clean. I would highly recommend this restaurant. I went to Elements at Camelback and had the salmon -- sorry to say I paid twice the money for an inferior dish when compared to the salmon at Rico's. The bartender and managers were very friendly. They even comp'd a dish because it took too long and my sister was a little late for the start of the conference.
