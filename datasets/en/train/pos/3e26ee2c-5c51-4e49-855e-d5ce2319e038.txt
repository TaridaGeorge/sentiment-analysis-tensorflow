The Clarendon is now our go to hotel while visiting Phoenix. It is affordable and the resort fee is worth it as it includes free parking, free long distance and local calls, free internet, and free snacks and drinks at the front desk. The staff were polite, helpful, and very nice. The hotel itself is super super cool-the pool, decor, and art displayed all eclectic and unique. And I cannot say enough great things about the restaurant downstairs! We literally ate there everyday several times a day during our stay. It was delicious! Yes, the bar and restaurant close early, but if you want a late night meal you can walk a block to Fez. Even with it's quirks, The Clarendon is still amazing. We felt right at home with all the creative types who were staying and/or hanging at the bar. We will be back!
