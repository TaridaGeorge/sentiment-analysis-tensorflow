I think they're starting to remember me.

Yellow tail - Yummy! I'm gonna get this again.

Eel Tempura roll $8.95 - This comes warm & covered in crispy tempura. It was really good. Think this 1 was cut into 4 or 5 pieces.

Rock n' Roll roll $9.95 - This has shrimp tempura in it & it's really good. It was cut into 5 pieces.

Dragon roll $9.95 - Great, like always. They usually cut it up into 8 pieces.
