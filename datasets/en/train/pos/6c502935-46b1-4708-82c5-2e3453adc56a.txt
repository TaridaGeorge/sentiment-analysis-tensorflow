Extremely happy with my Dr. and all of the nurses.  I highly recommend treatment at this practice.  
This probably holds true with any allergy practice, it's crowded when kids are out of school.  Be it after school or during spring/summer/winter breaks.  Plan accordingly.  The staff can tell you when the rush times are and check out the schedule they have posted on Google calendar to see if they have adjust hours, or are closed for pre holiday etc.  

I have no regrets.  Stephanie A., why cant you keep your co-pay statements or your EOB's from your insurance instead of a year end statement?
