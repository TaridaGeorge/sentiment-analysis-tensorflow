It may have taken me a few minutes to get my Il Purista, but upon the first bite it wouldn't have mattered if it took 3 hours and my first born child.  Defalco's has the honor to be my first favorite sandwich shop.  I have never been a huge sandwich fan, but with fresh mozzarella, basil leaves, tomatoes and enough panscetta to bring my tastebuds to climax, I am now.
