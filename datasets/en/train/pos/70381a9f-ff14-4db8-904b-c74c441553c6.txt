I highly recommend Ahwatukee Primary Care, even though doing so may make it harder for me to schedule an appointment there! 

Dr. Patricia Dietzgen really listens to your concerns and works with you to find the best plan for your care.

Dr. Dietzgen always takes the time to know her patients and remembers them.  This is not always the case nowadays, when many practices use P.A.s and you rarely (if ever)  see the actual doctor.  

She also recommends only the best, most thorough specialists outside her practice so you can be sure you are getting the kind of attention your situation requires.

Her husband, Dr. Mark DIetzgen, is a Naturopath and also works in the office.  

Join Ahwatukee Primary Care with confidence.
