My taste buds will forever be thankful that I tried this place. We came in after eating next door because I'd been craving something sweet. The guy behind the counter was wonderful. He was super sweet (no pun intended) and was eager for us to try as many flavors as we wanted. He was very knowledgable about the product and sold us from the minute we walked in. The mango gelato made my knees melt. We will definitely be back and I highly recommend that everyone tries this place.
