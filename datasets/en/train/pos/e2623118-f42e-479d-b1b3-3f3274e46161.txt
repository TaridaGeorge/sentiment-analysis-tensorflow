When I first stepped into Smeeks, my entire face lit up, I was figuratively (and quite literally) "a kid in a candy store." 

It's is a true one of a kind store, it's so entertaining to just walk around in. The decor is fun, the inventory is even more fun, and the photo booth is by far the most fun!

The walls are full of great novelty items, such as the Smoking Baby (that actually smokes!), Yodeling Pickle (that actually yodels!), and Fake Cigarettes that are surprisingly realistic! Plus, Smeeks has a lot of really cool, and delicious candy. My personal favorite was the Fat Pig organic chocolate bar (with Puntini coming in a close second). 

Smeeks is most definitely my new favorite store in CenPho!
