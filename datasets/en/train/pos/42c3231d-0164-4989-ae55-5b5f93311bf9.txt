Fumbling through the free Phoenix billiards magazine, I ran across an ad of 5 hot babes. I asked my friend, 'Which one would you WANK to?'....

I chose one as well and ran into her lovely presence at Marc's! 

She even offered me a job... do I have what it takes ?

The service was, of course, phenomenal. 

Happy upbeat atmosphere. Chipper patrons, positive conversations.

Me likey here.

Fancy chicas. Cheap beer.
