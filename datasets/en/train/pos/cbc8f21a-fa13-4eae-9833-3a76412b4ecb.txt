I just played Longbow in a tournament on May 2nd...definately one of the best conditioned courses in Arizona right now...tees and fairways were perfect and greens were lightining fast. Longbow has some cool long views and unlike many area courses there isn't a home or condo on the place. Just golf...which is a nice break. We had a banquet on their cool patio which overlooks 18. Course is home of a number of competitive events...and has one a number of awards from golf mags since it was renovated a few years back. Staff was friendly. Overall certainly can be a fun and challenging round. 

Their website www.longbowgolf.com had some cool videos that got me pumped up to play. 

Definately recommend it to AZ golfers.
