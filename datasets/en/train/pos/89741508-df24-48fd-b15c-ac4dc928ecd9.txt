Wow, I am shocked by the negative reviews of the Biltmore. It was and to me is THE hotel of Phoenix. If you want more information about it, just click on the weblink and read all about it. The history of the Biltmore is amazing. Sure it's old but that only adds to its charm.

You could never had a hotel like this built today because of all the land it's on. The grounds for parking alone are huge, bigger than most hotels are. Quite amazing.

Just park your car and walk around inside and around the grounds. It's magnificent. We stayed recently on the other side of town for baseball games, none near here but if I was coming to Phoenix for sightseeing, my first choice to stay would be the Biltmore.
