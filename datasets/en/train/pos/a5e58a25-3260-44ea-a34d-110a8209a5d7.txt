I stopped in for an oil change after my regular place further into Ahwatukee closed down. I asked for the top end oil change which included tire rotation and balancing. When they got to that point they called me out and said that it probably wasn't worth the extra expense because of the wear on the front tires. They could have performed the service and tried to sell me tires afterwards, but instead they stepped down the service expense to the less expensive oil change. They made a recommendation on tires, and asked me to consider them for replacing it, no high pressure sales. They did the right thing by me, which seems to be rare. Their honesty and integrity has earned my business.
