I really enjoy the quality of their produce. We get a small veggie box and the website allows for easy navigation and up to three substitutions. The box is always outside before 7 as they promise and I take it in before I head to work. It is wonderful to find this variety of organic food and have it delivered right to your door. The more I try and shop for organic in the store the more I'm amazed at the high prices, low selection and poor quality. I haven't even seen organic radishes in any PHX store yet, but thanks to NGD, I have a beautiful bunch last week!
