Excellent hotel choice for the discriminating Scottsdale traveller.  

It had a very hip vibe in the lobby, somehow managing to pull off laid back and classy at the same time.

My room was the basic King -- and I can tell you, not much was basic about it.  From a bed that sat in the middle of the room as the center piece, with sliding wall panels to block the bathroom / shower area off.  The design was trendy to the say the least!

I scored a great view of the pool and some mountains in the distance.  

I would not recommend it for travellers who don't enjoy a "Vegas" style hotel with an almost club atmosphere on the weekends.  As long as you know that when you go, you'll be very, very happy!
