I am a patient of Dr. Bazilus', and he is the absolute best!  Dr. B is always very honest and makes me feel so comfortable when I come for my appointments.  I've had a few cavities filled and also did the Venus whitening last year.  The front office staff is so friendly and Megan always greets me with a smile and makes me laugh!  I feel so welcome there and never am afraid to go to the dentist anymore.
