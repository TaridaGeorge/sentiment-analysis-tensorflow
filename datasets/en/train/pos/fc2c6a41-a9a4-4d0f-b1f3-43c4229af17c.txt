I love this place! The food is great, and the service is wonderful! I've had both the breakfast and the lunch and have always had a great experience.  I am just amazed with how friendly and helpful all the employees are, even the owner stopped by our table today to ask how everything was, amazing! Such nice people, and good food, I really love coming here.
