Amazing trivia fact! Did you know that Camelback Mountain is known by the local Indian population as Oont Peent? 

By "local Indian population" I am of course referring to myself and my brother. We naturally consider ourselves Americans first, but we are of Indian origin. From India, I mean. "Oont" means "camel" in our ancestral language of Hindi. "Peent", you'll be surprised to know, means "back". 

Anyway, Oont Peent kicked the living shit out of me the other day. I got out of work early and decided to kick off my new health cycle for 2008 by climbing to the top. I actually made it to the top just fine. On my way down I fell and almost broke my peent.
