I can't think of anything negative to say about Butterfield's- they have everything down perfectly. The breakfast is awesome and there are a ton of choices. I have gotten many different things and you really can't go wrong. Plus, the service is great!

 It gets super busy in the mornings, any day of the week. There is a lot of seating and there always seems to be a wait, but they are pretty good about getting people through without feeling rushed. 

It's a great place to meet casually over breakfast. Try the orange juice, it's fresh squeezed and full of awesome.
