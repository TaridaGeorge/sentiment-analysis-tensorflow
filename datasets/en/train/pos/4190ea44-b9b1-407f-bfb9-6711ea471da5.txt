The food at "Pork on a Fork" is awesome!! I have tried the pulled pork, brisket and ribs. I haven't had the sausage yet. It's fun to try the different sauces or just taste the natural flavor of excellent juicy pulled pork. They sell the sauces so you can have it on hand at home. If it's your first time there, I recommend a pulled pork sandwich with Smokey & Tangy BBQ sauce on the side and mac-n-cheese or potato salad. Enjoy your visit to "Pork on a Fork".
