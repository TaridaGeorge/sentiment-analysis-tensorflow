I was very sad to see Iruna go, but was very excited to learn about Aaron's new concept.  I went there last Saturday and it didn't disappoint!  I had the Burrata salad and it was amazing!  The pesto vinaigrette was delicious.   

I can't wait to go back again and try other dishes.....quite a menu and beer list!
