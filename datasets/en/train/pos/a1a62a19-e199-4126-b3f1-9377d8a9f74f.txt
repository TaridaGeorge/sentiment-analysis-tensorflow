Favorite place for a relaxing drink of wine and some great food as well. Love the owners involvement with this place. They keep things fresh and updated. Friendly is an understatement. Service is 100% great menu to choose from. Everything I try I like. Big on their Greek salad and gotta hit that meat lovers pizza one in awhile
