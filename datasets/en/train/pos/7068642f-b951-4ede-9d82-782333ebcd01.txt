Wow, this place is amazing.  I first started coming here for a good cup of coffee in between meetings downtown.  They have some of the best espresso drinks I've ever had.  They also have some kind of "clover" machine that allows the barista to control many aspects of how the coffee is brewed, etc.

I have been meaning to grab breakfast/lunch there as all of the food looks amazing.  Today, I stopped in for some lunch and the barista/waitress suggested a wrap variation of their turkey sandwich that included roasted peppers, pesto, and some other goodies.  I have to say this is the best lunch I've had in Phoenix and will be a regular from now on.  This place is a new favorite!
