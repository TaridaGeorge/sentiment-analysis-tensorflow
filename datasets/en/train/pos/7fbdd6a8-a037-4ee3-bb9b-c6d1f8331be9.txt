I LOVE Penzey's.  My entire spice cabinet is from their shop.  The quality is excellent, they carry things you can't get anywhere else, and they have amazing spice blends for almost every occasion.  I do agree with Dan that the store should have longer hours now that it is in Tempe Marketplace, but for me the convenience of having their store so close is worth the inconvenience of the hours.

I'm telling you, once you try Penzey's you'll never go back to the stuff at the supermarket, and frankly there is no need.  The prices are not that different and the quality is light years better.
