Sarah and Elite Pet Care took great care of our pups when we were out of town.  Sarah stopped over in person for an initial consult and we went over all the details and she met the doggies.  Everything went as planned when were were gone and she sent me some photos of the pups which totally brightened my day.  Overall I highly recomment Elite Pet Care as top notch and caring for animals.  They really care and you can't ask for more!
