I was placing Line Thai as my second choice for a while, but they are starting to tie for my first.  We went on a whim the other night and had their phad Thai for the first time, it is the best I have had.  We also ordered our usual Thai fried rice, and it was as AMAZING as ever!!  I have also had the yellow curry many times and it is great, as well as the pork dumpling soup and it is great also.  Their Thai tea is wonderful! Also the service is always wonderful!
