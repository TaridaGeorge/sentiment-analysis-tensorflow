Our son received lessons from Gold Medal for most of last year.  He went from being timid about getting in the water to.... swimming!  He enjoyed his lessons, had fun, and trusted his instructor, which is most important.  I would highly recommend Gold Medal to anyone.  Also, Nancy is a wonderful instructor!
