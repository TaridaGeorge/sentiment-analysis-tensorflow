Wonderful food.  I went here for my birthday and Valentine's day.  We went for one of there special events (Robert Craig wine dinner).  The food was amazing and I wish served as part of the normal menu.  Favorite appetizers is the tomato soup dish.  Favorite desert is the S'mores. So far favorite main has been either the chicken or ribs (not counting the lamb at the special event, it was out of this world).  This place has great cocktails that are reasonably priced and creative.  I recommend the Finn's dilemma.  This is a kid friendly place.  Finally, the servers we have had each of the four times we have been (all different) were great.  Honest about strengths and weaknesses in dishes, insightful, and thoughtful in responding to questions.
