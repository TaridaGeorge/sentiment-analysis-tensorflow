Casey Moore's is authentic. Perhaps that is why it is so difficult for some people to appreciate it. It makes no apologies for what it is - a great, neighborhood Irish pub, next door to a college. The outside picnic tables fill with that great city mix of academics, bohemians and the 20-something black glasses crowd. Inside, crowded around the small Boston-like bar, locals fill the bar stools reminiscing about days gone by and the neighborhood gossip. The conversations alone are worth a visit.
