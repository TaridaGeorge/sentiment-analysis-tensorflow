Holy Moly, I'm shocked Sandstone doesn't have a better review!  Talk about a family owned business where they'll not only remember your name but come around the bar and give you a hug when  you stop by!  The drink prices are great, generously mixed, and it's always a fun laid back crowd.  Want different music?  Just ask or plug your ipod in.  And who doesn't love video poker?!

We held a charity function here where Jeff cooked us a special steak dinner, hired extra help, and about killed himself ensuring the event was amazing.  I'll come back time and time again to support this amazing family owned business by having some drinks with my girls.  What's better in Chandler?  The d'bags you'll meet at Sandbar?  No thanks!  

And PS- The steak was amazing!  :)
