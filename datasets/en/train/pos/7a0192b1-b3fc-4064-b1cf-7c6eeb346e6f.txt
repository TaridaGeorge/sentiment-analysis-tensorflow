The first time I tried BB it was about 3:55 on Saturday (they close at 4). They still made me a delicious sandwich, and I bought their banana bread which was really good too. The owner even gave me two free raisin oatmeal cookies (really good too!) and did not push me out the door at all. 
They ran out of a lot of their popular items, which is a good thing because it means the stuff is made fresh and it's good!
