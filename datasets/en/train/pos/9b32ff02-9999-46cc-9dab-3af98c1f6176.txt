Food is spectacular. Best american food in this city hands down. Staff is exceptional, friendly, everyone knows your name. Wally... he's kind of a grouch. But whatever. I think he's just getting old... and tired of it all. The bar is adorable, the patio is so cozy and quaint, and the laughter makes this place a joy to be in. Great place.
