Such a beautiful place to see the desert!  Phoenix has really sprawled since I initially moved here in the late 70s.  It's quite a drive to get out to the desert today -- but the DBG is close in, well laid out and has so many great events. I became a member in the first week I related back to Phoenix and intend to visit very often.  Great for locals; great for visitors.
