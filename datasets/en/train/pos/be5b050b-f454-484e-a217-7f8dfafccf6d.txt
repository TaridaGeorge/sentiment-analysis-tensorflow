I adore Menchies. It is the best frozen yogurt. I screamed with joy when I saw we had one so close to our new home in Scottsdale. I tried it several times on a visit to California and became totally obsessed. They have great milk free sorbet. It is self serve which can be dangerous for portion size. The staff is always friendly. Ask about a club card to get points for free yogurt and register online for bonus points.  I love you Menchies!
