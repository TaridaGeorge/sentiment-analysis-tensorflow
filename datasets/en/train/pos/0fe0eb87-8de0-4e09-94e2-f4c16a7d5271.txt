I am addicted to these subs! Great ingredients, tasty fresh bread and the mayo/ mustard mix is the bomb! Meats and cheeses are sliced in front of you, just like at a deli. 

I have also ordered one of their party subs and it was just as good as when you eat in. Can't go wrong with this place.
 Anyway, if your looking for a good sandwich this place is quick and will hit the spot every time!
