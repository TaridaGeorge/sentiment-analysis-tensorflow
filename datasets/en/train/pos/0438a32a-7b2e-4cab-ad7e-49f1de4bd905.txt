Considering my experience with a previous dentist, I was hesitant to try a new one. But my experience was absolutely the best.  Foothills Smiles is the best dentist I have been to in the valley!! They are professional, friendly, and reassuring allowing their patients to feel comfortable during the visit.  Most people dread going to the dentist, but I feel motivated to continue going to my 6 month check-ups!!
