I went to see the Ann Banofy Taylor exhibit.  It was fascinating and really explained why couture is an art form.  The clothes were stunning and the subject led a fascinating life.  The museum overall was really a world class building.  They have many more pieces than I remember and I love the clean space.  It feels very open and free versus the old museum, which felt very cluttered.  Fascinating.
