I wanted a Lego Portrait for my grandson. I was referred to a Lego artist, Dave Shaddix, by the Lego Store. I contacted Dave, emailed my grandson's picture to him (BTW: my 6 year old grandson grooves on Legos). Dave responded via email with what the portrait would look like. I gave him the go ahead, and Dave created a FANTASTIC Lego Portrait of my grandson. This will be a family heirloom.
