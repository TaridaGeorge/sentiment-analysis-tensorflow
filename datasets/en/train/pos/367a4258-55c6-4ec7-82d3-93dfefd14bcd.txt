Nothing new here - except to say the pizza was awesome. I'm a late convert to Spinato's - a neighbor told us of the gluten-free crusts they offer (courtesy of www.glutenfreecreations.com).

I eat regular crust but some in my family are wheat sensitive, so we hit Spinato's for their GF pizza. The wheat sensitive ones loved the gluten free pizza and this wheat eater loved the regular pizza. 

If you love excellent pizza, hit Spinato's.  http://www.spinatospizza.com/
