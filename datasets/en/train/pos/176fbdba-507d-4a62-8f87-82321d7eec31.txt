This place is awesome!  I had the sampler platter, and wow...I couldn't even finish it all.  It was so much food.  The ribs were good, and the chicken was good....but when I go back, I am sticking to the brisket and the pulled pork.  The brisket and pulled pork are the best I have eaten in AZ, and I have tried a lot of places.  The coleslaw and the macaroni salad was very good as well.  Really can't go wrong with any of the sides.

Make sure to get a coca-cola cake for dessert.  It was amazing.

Definitely try this place out if you are looking for an inexpensive barbecue joint that will fill you up!
