Walk, bike, light rail or drive, but get to Postino Central.

Postino Central is a definite favorite of mine, especially for late afternoon/happy hour food and drinks. It's tough to beat. The indoor/outdoor bar is fab. Service is always great and food is always better. The bruschetta, the hoegarden, the paninis, the hoegarden.

And don't forget the brunch, it's amazing. The scones, the egg sandwich, the french toast are all amazing.

Brian DeMarco's Trio plays here on Sunday afternoons too.

if you are looking for a great place to hang out, people watch and enjoy amazing food and drinks, this is the one.
