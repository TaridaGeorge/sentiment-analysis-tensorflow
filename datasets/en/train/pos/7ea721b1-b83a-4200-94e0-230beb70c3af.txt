i have found my boba place!

i really dig the street. it's cute, friendly, and really convenient. located in the saketini/oregano's strip mall area, this place is a refreshing little joint that offers a wide array of milk tea choices and even has a milk tea/ramen special for $7. nice.

i had the Taro Milk Tea with boba and i was a happy camper. like other reviewers have said, they only serve the large size so be prepared to hold a lot of liquid. the boba itself is really tasty and not too hard but has that right, firm consistency that makes it fun to chew on a little but wont kill you if you try to swallow it whole.

accessible by bike, this place is going to be seeing a metric ass ton of me.
