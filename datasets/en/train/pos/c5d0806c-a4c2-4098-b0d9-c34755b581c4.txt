I'm biased. I love this place. I enjoy live music and like to live vicariously through artists. You'll find plenty of them here. This is the definition of a dive bar. Ridiculously cheap drinks. If you spend more than $20 for the night, you're drunk. Regulars and hipsters hang out and everyone gets along famously. Strange tiki bar theme. Bartendresses that will scream at you if you piss them off and a place where at last call everyone scampers up to get that last drink. Great jukebox and even better DJ on the weekends. The owner is always there and super cool person. It looks like crap on the outside, but at midnight it's packed. You'll likely be standing. 

Oh and bring cash. They take no plastic and the damn ATM so often never works that it's a running joke.
