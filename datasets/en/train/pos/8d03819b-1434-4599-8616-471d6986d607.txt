I was recently at John C. Lincoln Deer Valley Hospital for congestive heart failure and I give so many applauds to this hospital.  I have been in there several times before and they just get better and better.  Everything pleases me about this hospital.  They try to make it a good experience. From the doctors and nurses to the cooks and the maintenance people, they are there for you and care so much.  Thank you JCLDV for everything.
