When I was on vacation in AZ I tried this place and loved. I had one of the Acai bowls and now I'm addicted and wish there were a Juice It Up! in DC (hint hint).  I usually visit Jamba Juice when I'm on the west coast but this place is definitely better. My friend had a smoothie and got a free boost, which is pretty awesome considering you get charged by every other smoothie shop! Def give this place a try...you won't regret it! I will be back!
