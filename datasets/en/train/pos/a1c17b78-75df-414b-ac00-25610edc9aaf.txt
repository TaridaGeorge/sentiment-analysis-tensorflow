Everytime I visit the AZ I always stop here for breakfast on my last day. I've ordered almost everything on the menu. It's really home cooking country food. Please order a milkshake when your done with breakfast, it always hit's the spot. As for lunch and dinner I couldn't tell you anything really. I only eat breakfast there.make sure you visit the store before you go, you'll end up buying something unique. Peace.
