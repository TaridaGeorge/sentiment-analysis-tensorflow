I went today for lunch and WOW I can't say how great this place was.  Ok you do have to get past the fact it's not the best looking location or even in the best area but this place is a must experience.  I got the Mexican Burger which came with grilled onions, mayo, monterry jack cheese, and green chili's.  I tried a fry first and was amazed I usually don't like the bigger cut fries cause they are never crispy enough but no these fries were the best I've had in a long time.  They came with seasoned salt on them and were just amazing.  I had a milkshake with m&m's which was amazing as well.  I can't say enough about how good this place is.  If you have never went as I never had you need to go NOW.
