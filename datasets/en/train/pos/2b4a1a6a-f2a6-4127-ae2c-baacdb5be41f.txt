OMG! Best crab rangoons i have ever had. I am from Chicago and i was visiting my mom. She recommended the place and i was thoroughly impressed. In Chicago when you get crab rangoon there is like one squirt of filling and the rest is the fried dough. Here they are filled to the max and utterly delish! The veggie lo mein was pretty good.

Service was fast and friendly.
