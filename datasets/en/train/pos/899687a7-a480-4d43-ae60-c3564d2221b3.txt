Anyone who knows me, knows I love me a good game of blackjack!  So, the Wild Horse Pass is usually my casino of choice on weekends when I  partake in such activities.  The dealers are friendly, the casino is like a mini Vegas and it's just so much fun.  Ling and Louie's restaurant has great food, as does Shula's (but a lot pricier!) steakhouse.  They also have a nice lounge for Platinum players where you can get appetizers and free cocktails.  Gotta love that!  I've stayed here overnight once or twice and the rooms are brand new and quite comfortable.  Double down on Wild Horse!
