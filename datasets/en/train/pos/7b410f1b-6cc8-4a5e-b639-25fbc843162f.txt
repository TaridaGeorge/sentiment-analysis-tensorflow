Their food is amazing -- all of it.  Love the gyro, veggie combo, greek salad, shawerma, falafel, baba ganoush.  Make a point to order the house-made pita instead of the Armenian bread.  Always great service.
I'm also a big fan of the grocery store part of the joint.  You just have to try one of their baklavas -- walnut, almond, pistachio or cashew -- all divine.  Fab for tea and spices, too.
