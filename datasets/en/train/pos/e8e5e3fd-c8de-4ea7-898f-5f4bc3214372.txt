Who doesn't love the cheesecake factory?  It's huge booklike menu consists of something for everyone.  Start off with one of their many signature cocktails.  My favorite appetizer is the chicken lettuce wraps.  They offer huge salads, sandwiches, burgers and entrees.  Oh yeah and they also serve cheesecake!
