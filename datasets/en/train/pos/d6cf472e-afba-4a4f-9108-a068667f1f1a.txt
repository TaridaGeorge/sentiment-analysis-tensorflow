Sexy, Chic, Hip.  Patio feels like 5th floor roof-top hotel.  GR8 DJ: spinned tunes of Hot Top 40 MIx.  Excellent sound system.  (no bass rumblings).  Dance Floor styled around a high stone fireplace with a mansion feel, set under a gigantic modern & unqiue chandelier:  Anyone who used to frequent Devil's Martini around the corner will luv this change to hit the nite scene :-)

I'm anticipating the start of the food menu which starts in 2 weeks from a fabby high-end chef from PV resort.

Will definately be back on a regular basis, especially since it is so close and Devil's Martini has gone to CRAP with new management.

Open Thur, Fri, Sat eves.  Happy Hour Specials, VIP areas, Bottle Service, Dance, Garden Patio, Indoor/Outdoor Bar.
