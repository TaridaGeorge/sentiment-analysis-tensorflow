I eat at this location probably once a week and have for quite some time. The staff at this location are excellent. They are always so mindful of your time, especially around lunchtime when I don't have all day to sit and wait. The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious and the restaurant is very clean. I have used them several times for catering purposes and while I am bummed they don't deliver, it is always great to know that my large orders will be ready on time when I show up to pick them up. This is my favorite location by far!
