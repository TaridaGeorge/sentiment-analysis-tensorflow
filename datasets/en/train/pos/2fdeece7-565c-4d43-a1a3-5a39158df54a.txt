Stopped here with my sister on the way out of Phoenix airport.  I love amazing bread and they have both--the bread and the pizza crust. Wow.  We had a veg pizza that was half bianco and half with red sauce.  Added mushrooms on top (yum).  I had a bit of an issue with their red sauce--I'm not exactly sure why, maybe it wasn't sweet enough.  But the white pizza side was perfect and had the added interest of pistachios.  I bought one of their breads to take home to the family.  I love eating pizza and bread in Italy and bread in France.  This is top-notch.  Go. Enjoy.  Luckily we went on a day when the museums were closed and at a weird hour, so there was no wait for a table.
