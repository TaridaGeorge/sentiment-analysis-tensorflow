I really enjoy the Aloha Festival: a variety of vendors, heaping plates of food (chicken katsu, manapua, Portuguese sausage, lomi lomi, shaved iced, etc.), great music and entertainment... and entrance is free! Unlike some other festivals, there's plenty of open space to throw down a blanket  and enjoy the atmosphere. It's definitely grown over the years and the move from Heritage Square to Tempe Beach Park was a smart one.
