An amazing little gelato upstart opened this Spring.  It's located right next door to La Grande - with a connecting door, no less.  The owners are a friendly Italian couple recently relocated from LA.  The gelato is made fresh every day - not with mixes like a few other places in town.  Check this place out before it's overrun by new converts!
