Beckett's Table is one of my most favorite places.  I recommend it to anyone looking for simply great food!  The service is right on point and the food is so comforting, delicious and perfectly done. I adore the setup of the restaurant.  They have a great patio with heaters and misters, and the atmosphere throughout is so inviting and cozy.

Foodwise, the beet appetizer are hands-down the BEST beets I have ever had, and you also can't go wrong with the brussel sprouts.  Whatever fish is on the menu is always great and I'm also a big fan of their short ribs and burger.  They have many gluten-free options on the menu for those gluten-conscious diners.  Make sure to try the fig and pecan pie, too!
