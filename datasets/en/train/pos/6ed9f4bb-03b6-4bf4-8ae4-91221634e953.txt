IF only CALI had Pit stops like these!! ALL we have is chevron's and am/pm which is NO COMPARISON to this place!!
I never been so amused with a convenience store like this, THEY carried TONS OF FLAVORED DRINKS from MANGO Limeade's to Pina colada icee's to vanilla mocha hot drinks!!

i bought some tom's CHIPS, they dont have the onion ring flavor which is theee absolute best but nonetheless they carry the brand so thats a plus!

i got a 44oz MANGO limeade for about 2 bucks or so!

talk about cheap!!

they sold pretty affordable iphone charger as well. 15 bucks duracell brand compared to the $20 china knock off at the mall.
