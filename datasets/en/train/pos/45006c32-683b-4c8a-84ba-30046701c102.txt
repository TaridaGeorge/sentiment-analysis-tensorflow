How does anybody stop at the Taco Bell across the parking lot?

Great food, great prices. I rarely order beef, except here. The appetizers are delicious and filling, perfect for a quick lunch by themselves. The tamales are some of the best ever. Don't come if you're in a hurry, but if you understand that the service will be slow, you won't be disappointed because it's very friendly. It's a small place, but I've never had to wait for a seat. One of my favorite restaurants in town.
