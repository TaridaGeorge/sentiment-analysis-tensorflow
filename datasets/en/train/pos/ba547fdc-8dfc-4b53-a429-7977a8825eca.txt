Great place!!

Very friendly service. Everyone was so nice. This place is very clean, and it has a nice, casual atmosphere.

The rolls are outstanding!

We ordered the lobster bisque, scallops, and coq au vin. Everything was excellent. The salads with the entrees were great as well. Wish we had time for dessert, but we unfortunately had a prior engagement.

We will definitely return!
