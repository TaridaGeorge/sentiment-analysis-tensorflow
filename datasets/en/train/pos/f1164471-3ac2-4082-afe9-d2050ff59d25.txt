awesome! one could loose hours here wondering through this amazing store. twists and turns find you in different rooms (LITERALLY! there is a 1930's house INSIDE UrbanSouthwest!) each room with a unique identity filled with unique treasures. the juxtaposition of old, vintage, and sleek modernity coincide beautifully within the many artisan made works of art. items vary from server hand crafted tables, to vintage ornate iron, to local art, and so so much more. highly recommend!!
