This is absolutely my favorite restaurant to go to when visiting Phoenix. The "Scotch Beef" (pot roast) is absolutely the best I've ever had anywhere. They pile it on a bed of mashed potatoes with carrots, green beans, and onions. Then they cover it with the most delicious red-wine reduction gravy. I've eaten it two nights in a row its so good. The drinks are good too. Others I've gone with say the fresh fish dishes are excellent as well.
