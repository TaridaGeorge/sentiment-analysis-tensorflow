My parents have been taking me here my whole life, and now that I'm an adult I'll probably eat enouch burritos to fill up my whole life.

The staff is so kind and anyone I've ever brought here freaks out about the quality.  The salsa is one of my favorites in the city.  I find that when I go out of town for a while the first thing I crave when I come back is Los Compadres. YUM!
