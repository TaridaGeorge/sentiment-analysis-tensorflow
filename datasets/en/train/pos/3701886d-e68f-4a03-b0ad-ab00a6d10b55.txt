I recently visited Raise The Vibration Healing Studio. Firstly, it's located in the heart of the Biltmore district, walking distance from the mall and the Ritz Carlton. I had an amazing session with Nicole. She made me feel very comfortable right away. I feel like she really "got" me, and understood me right away. The session was amazing (really, you gotta try it!), and I walked away feeling like a million bucks! Actually, I think I'm glowing.
