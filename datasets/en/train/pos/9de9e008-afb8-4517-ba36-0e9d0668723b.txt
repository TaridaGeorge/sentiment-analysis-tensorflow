This sweet little spa tucked in a small corner of a shopping center is charming. I received literally THE best massage I've ever had. Not only is the front desk staff friendly and knowledgable but the therapist I had renewed my faith in the industry. I made an appointment to go back for a facial and booked another massage. I live in Downtown Phoenix but The Beauty Scene is definitely worth the 45 minute drive to North Scottsdale. If you want an amazing deals on spa services and a talented staff to assist you, this is your place!
