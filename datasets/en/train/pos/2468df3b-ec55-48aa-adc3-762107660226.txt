I love this place. I only went there because the reviews were so good- its not in the best little stripmall but I live right down the street, so I was willing to try it. I have never had anything there that was less than excellent. The pizza is great, the pasta is excellent and even the stuff like the chicken rollatini, which I usually wouldn't get, was amazing. Everything is super well done and authentic. I loved it all! I wish this place great success, unless it gets too busy and I can't get in anymore :)  It is a kind of small space so calling in for a reservation isn't a bad idea.
