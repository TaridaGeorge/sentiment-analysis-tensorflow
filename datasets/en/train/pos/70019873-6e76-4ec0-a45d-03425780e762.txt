This shop is one of the hidden gems of the phoenix metropolitan area. I am in interior design and I have been very impressed with their selection of vintage and antique finds. The owners are very friendly and helpful.  The prices are very reasonable and often negotiable.  I am so excited about the upcoming Sweet Salvage event. This shop has a large variety of items which fit the shabby chic style. I have found so many incredible items here such as, furniture, home accessories and jewelry. I have found many near identical, vintage replica items for sale at other shops for triple the price. Every time I come here I find something special. I can't imagine a better place for finding unique vintage home decor.
