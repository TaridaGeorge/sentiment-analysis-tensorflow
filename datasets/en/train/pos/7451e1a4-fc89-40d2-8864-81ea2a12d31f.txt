Jessie was called and came out that afternoon for an estimate.  They came out on time and provided a reasonable estimate for tree and bush trimming. I agreed with their price and they say they could come out the next morning to do the job.  The job was well done, even cleaning up the yard, which wasnt requested but appreciated. I will be calling them again for my next lawn needs.
