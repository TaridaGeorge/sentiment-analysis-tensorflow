The Waterfront couldn't really be described as a mall, but maybe a classy strip mall. It includes Olive and Ivy, P F Changs, Pink Taco, Borders, Urban Outfitters, Sauce, and much more. I like it for the Sauce, Borders, and Urban to be honest. Just steps a way from Fashion Square I usually only go as part of my fashion square experience. Above Scottsdale Waterfront are the Waterfront Condos which I haven't yet toured, but I'm sure they a pure luxury. I'm not sure what the new craze is with living above malls..Kierland and here, but people are loving it!

The Waterfront is too small to make a trip for,but it's fun to check out if you are in the area. Also this may be the location of the long awaited Sprinkles Cupcakes! Yes!
