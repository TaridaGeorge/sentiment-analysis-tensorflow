Love this place. Inspired, creative, and beautifully prepared farm-to-table cuisine. Just got back from 2nd time here and it confirmed that the 1st dinner was no fluke. Nicely diverse menu, love the use of seasonal and organic veggies. Everything I've ordered or tasted here (Duck Three Ways entree special, Pork Osso Buco entree, various appetizers, sides & desserts) has been outstanding. Service has always been warm and attentive, even on an uber-busy Saturday night. Like the open kitchen and the whole vibe here; energetic but not too loud & hectic.  Enjoyed the 50% off Sunday Night special on Arizona wines -- surprised my out-of-town snobby parents ("Arizona wine? That can't be any good") with a wonderful Keeling Schaefer Syrah. Prices are way reasonable (entrees $12-$21) for the quality and portions. A great evening out.
