Went to Nick's tonight, this is our second or third time trying with this place. YUM! Very good pizza. 

Also, on Mondays and Tuesdays they have a killer special, any size pizza, any number of toppings - half price. SO my large pepperoni pizza tonight was ~$6.50. Awesome.

Decent pizza, great prices, especially with their Monday/Tuesday special!!
