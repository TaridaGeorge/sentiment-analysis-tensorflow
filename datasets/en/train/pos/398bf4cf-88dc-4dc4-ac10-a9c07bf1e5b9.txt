Must see for kids and their grown-ups alike! The main attraction here are the Dinosaurs-- big as life and nearly as scary. In fact, you might want to give your kids a primer before visiting. We learned the hard way once when our five-year-old became so terrified we had to leave. (Bad Mom). The three-story Dinosaur Mountain, complete with thunder, a simulated flash flood and mechanical prehistoric creatures, is quite impressive. 

Besides the dinos, there are several other fun attractions at the museum. What kid wouldn't want to pan for "gold," visit a (replica) Spanish Mission, or get locked in the authentic pioneer jail? 

There are also two changing galleries and a gift shop.
