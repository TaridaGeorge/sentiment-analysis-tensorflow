We stopped in recently for a late evening dinner, on the recommendation of a colleague.  Thank you, Tim, we loved it!  The food was fresh and delicious, the staff were friendly and accommodating.  I left wishing I lived nearby and not 6 hours away in San Diego.  My final wrd on Saigon Kitchen is Yummmm.....!
