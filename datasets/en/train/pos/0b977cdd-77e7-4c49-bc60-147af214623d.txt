Needed to get out of the West Valley last Saturday and decided to put on the pretense of being productive at Copper Star. It was very quiet and laid back. I sat on the purple couch for 4 hours and savored every drop of my latte. AND double bonus for being within walking distance of the Fry Bread House. Perfect lazy Sat afternoon!
