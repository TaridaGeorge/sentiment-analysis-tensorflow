All the stars for food, service and surprises.  We drive 90 miles to dine at Binkley's and almost always go with the tasting menu and wine pairing.  The wines chosen with each course add a new dimension to the experience of he food, something I would be lucky to achieve unles I was totally familiar with the cellar, and I'm not.  Between courses, Chef Kevin sends out an array of 'amuses bouches' that are imaginative, flavorful and occasionally a little showy, but a sense of humor is not a bad thing in a restaurant, especially one with its foundations in the classic French style.  Having Binkley's 90 miles away has tempered my need to dine at the French Laundry in Napa Valley where Kevin picked up a few inspirations.
