I have to admit up front that this store is partially owned by a friend of mine.  

Big Sticks recently opened in the Mesa Riverview shopping center.  This shopping center is fairly new...right off the 202 freeway in Mesa.

The store sells many cigars and the price range is decent all the way from a couple of bucks to about thirty.  They also sell Dunhill cigarettes which are my weakness on the rare occasions that I smoke.  $8/pack and totally worth it.  My husband calls them chick magnets but they don't seem to work the other way.

They have comfy leather chairs and televisions.  You can actually smoke there which is nice for cigar smokers in Arizona these days.

If you are into cigars you should check this place out.
