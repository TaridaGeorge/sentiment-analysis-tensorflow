I found MyoSymmetrix on Groupon.  I called in the morning and was given my choice of times in the afternoon and choice of therapists.  I asked for Jessica.  I arrived a few minutes early and Chad was  there cleaning.  I foound him very pleasant to chat with while waiting.  Jessica got there a few minutes later and we got started,  Wow!  She is really strong and worked the knots in my neck and back.  She was outstanding.  She checked a couple of times to make sure the pressure was OK.  She talked a little but mostly just let me relax.  She also recommeded exercises to help.  I will absolutely go back there.
