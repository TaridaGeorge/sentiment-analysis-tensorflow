Downtown Chandler's best kept secret! Yoli's is an awesome cafe for casual dining with great food and service. I highly recommend the breakfast skillets, they are delicious, and provide plenty of food to satisfy the heartiest of appetites. Staff is very friendly and attentive, you can't go wrong with Yoli's!
