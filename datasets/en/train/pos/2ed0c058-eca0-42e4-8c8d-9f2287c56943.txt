Since I married my wife, who is Korean, I can only go so long without Korean food.  I, of course, judge all Korean restaurants against my mother-in-law and wife's cooking.   Since I am in Phoenix for work I looked up Korean places and found this, I have friends who live out here so we went.  I ordered a ton of food of them to try, it was their first time eating Korean.  I was upset when we got the Goyza and I wouldn't get them again, but everything after that was amazing.
We ordered Dolsot Bibimbap, Daeji Bulgogi, Dak Bulgogi, Japchae and a few other things.  Everything was fantastic!  My favorite was the Daeji Bulgogi, which is close to my mother-in-laws.  I will be going back before I leave Phoenix.
