my new favorite spot. $2 ambers after 10, at least on saturdays. there's nothing i can knock on this place. reminds me of the great restaurants in which i used to work.

the beet and watermelon dish with fresh goat cheese and pumpernickel croutons is unstoppable.  one of the best beet dishes i've ever had - the herb blend is unbelievable.

the rock shrimp is a must.  very simple but awesome to pick on all throughout the night. 

i'm coming back here many, many times.
