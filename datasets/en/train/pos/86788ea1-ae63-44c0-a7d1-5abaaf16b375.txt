With the right company, this place is awesome! 

Particularly, because the few times I've been it hasn't been crowded, it's like having the world's best bartender make craft cocktails to suit your personal palate as you sit by a fire pit and enjoy live music! 

Shell, mixed a delicious Manhattan with a Croatian cherry liquor for me -- a super cool giant ice ball to keep it chilled and, after finding out about my desire to keep the calories down, treated me to an awesome tequila drink with a natural juice fresh fruit. 

The pork sliders were good... but, she's right, those short rib tacos are awesome!!

Can't wait to go back!!
