This chain has the best selection and prices on wine and liquor.  On top of that they have the best service staff around.  It is always a pleasure to shop here and I look forward to learning something new from their talented staff on each trip.  They also have plenty of tastings going on every weekend so it gives you a good chance to "try before you buy".
