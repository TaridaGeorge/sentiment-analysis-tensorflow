Gilbert was ridiculously knowledgeable and quick to get the shoes we were looking at. He listened to what we were looking for and showed us what he thought were the best options and didn't hover when shoes were being tried on. He managed to make shoe shopping easy for Husband, which is not a simple task considering he waited until the soles fell off the original shoes before finally (STILL reluctantly) getting a new pair. Still shocked and amazed by the stellar and painless experience.
