I went in with a few girlfriends over the weekend as each of us were looking to get a piercing. HTC is very clean, super friendly and professional staff making all of us very comfortable. JD did all of our piercings and what a great job he did! Very helpful every step of the way. What I loved also is how they recommend a time to come back to check on the healing of all of our piercings. I've never had that before with other places I have been too. 

Will certainly be back and recommend HTC to anyone looking for any kind of piercings/stretching, etc...
