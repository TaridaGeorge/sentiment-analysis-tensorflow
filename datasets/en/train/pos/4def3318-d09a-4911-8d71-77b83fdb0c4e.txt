Never thought I would be reviewing a Starbucks, but I had to mention this one.  
Went here a few nights ago.  In front of the store the seats were crowded.  I expected a wait inside.  Instead, the service was fast and friendly.  I ordered only a water and a cookie.  The person I went with ordered a coffee and said it was very good.

The next morning, I realized I had left my planner behind.  When I asked about it, I had barely gotten the question out to the barista when she said, "Yes."  She promptly went back to get it and this is the main reason this Starbucks gets the great review. Service.
