Great food in a very homey location. Set up as a cute local family style place, we tested it with my well behaved 3year old grandson. Most of the other diners were our age and enjoyed the young enthusiastic Italian eater. The staff went out of their way to show him a good time. 
As for the food, excellent homemade pasta with a very delicious sauce. Meatballs were light and tasty, ravioli were homemade ade delicious. I had the veal parm which was great. 
If you are in town for a meeting, give it a try
