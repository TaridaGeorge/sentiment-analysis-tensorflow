Think Hot pockets on steroids*. Great Beer, Atmosphere and patio furniture.  I return to this place religiously.. Each time, eager to try something new. I'm about half way through the menu as it's rather extensive. I highly recommend the "Spicy Asiago Chicken Pasty." Spicy chicken, roasted corn, black beans, asiago cheese, hatch chilies, and Mexican stewed tomatoes. With a side of sour cream & salsa..ORGASMIC. 
You seriously can't go wrong here people. The Menu versatility is astounding; it's as if they have a pasty specifically tailored to your palate.Try the "Strawberry Pavlova"  for dessert. Perfect place for a date or to suck down some good food and beer with your buddies. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do.   - Cheers
