I'm a novice at outdoor activities, but that doesn't mean I don't like them and I don't like to be properly prepared for them.

There's a bakers dozen of sporting goods stores in the valley but somehow I always end up at R.E.I. 

Why?  Quality, quantity, variety of products and friendly, knowledgeable, helpful staff.  What I can't find at other places I can find here.  And aside from products they also offer classes for different outdoorsy type things like map reading or using a GPS.

R.E.I. is the one shop stop for outdoor activities.
