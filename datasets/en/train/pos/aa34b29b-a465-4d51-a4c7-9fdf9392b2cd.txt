My wife and I drove by this place hundreds of times without ever paying much attention to it.  During the day, its very easy to miss.

We decided to stop in after getting curious one day and checking the reviews on it.  After seeing that other people had good experiences with it, we gave it a try.  We were extremely happy  that we did.  Since then, we've been back a couple of times and we have never been disappointed.  I'm happy to see some very good food in the baseline corridor.  

The pizza is good.  Thin crust, light, and flavorful.  We also had fried provolone for an appetizer, which was amazing, and the balsamic strawberries for dessert.

Do yourself a favor and give this place a try... you won't be disappointed.
