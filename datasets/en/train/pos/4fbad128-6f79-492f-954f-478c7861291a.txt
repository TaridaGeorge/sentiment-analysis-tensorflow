The only bad thing here, the acoustics...and waiting for a table even though we made reservations a week ahead of time for my birthday. (Waiting when you have a reservation and then having he staff expect you to spend money at the bar is just a pet peeve of mine) The food isn't overly fancy. Its just very fresh, made well with great ingredients. The scotch beef was fab as was the chocolate cake. The service was decent even though they were busy. It was hard because the tables are so close to each other, but it worked out ok. Def worth a try, but I would warn them that there are a few things they could work on, food isn't one of them. The portions are perfect and everything is cooked perfectly. AND my mom is a chef and she was with us and agreed:)
