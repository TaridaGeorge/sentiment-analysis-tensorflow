I thought I had something horribly wrong with my cooling system and was in dire straights when I looked up mechanica on Yelp. I found Mike Vinson  auto. After reading the reviews, I was set.

They were able to take a look at the car right away since if the problem was major, I would be stuck for a 40+ mile ride home. While I went and grabbed a bite to eat, they looked at the car and found something so minor that I am embarrassed to admit that it never occurred to me. A new radiator cap, the price of a pressure test and I was on my way.

Quick, efficient and honest. If I have car trouble again, this is where I'm going.
