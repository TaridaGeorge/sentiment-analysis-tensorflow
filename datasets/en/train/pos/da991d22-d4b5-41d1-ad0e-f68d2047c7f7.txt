Awesome Venezuelan food. I was raised in Venezuela and I can tell you that this
food is as close to the real thing you will come across outside of Venezuela.

Be sure to talk to Moises the owner - fantastic guy.
When you go, be sure to try the empanadas and arepas ... ask for black beans
and rice on the side.
As good as it gets.

If you are in the mood to try something new, give My Arepa a try.

Food is so good that I have been known to by it, and ship to family in other parts of the US. When was the last time you did that?!?!?!?!
