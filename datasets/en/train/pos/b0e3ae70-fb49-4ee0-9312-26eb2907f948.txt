The best brunch or breakfast I've had in Phoenix.  The eggs benedict was perfect, and all of the six people I was with liked their meals. The atmosphere was good, the coffee was good, the service was good. 

Admittedly, it was cool and overcast, and I wouldn't want to sit outside if it were 100 degrees outside. But other than that, I anticipate many, many trips here in the future!
