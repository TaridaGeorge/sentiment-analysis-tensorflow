After posting my review, I received a call from the membership director. Someone emailed her my review. She was very nice and apologetic, so I agreed to meet her to tour the facility again. Because of her outstanding followup and customer service, I decided to join. Therefore, I'm raising my initial rating of one star to three. After I've spent some time there and gotten to know the facility and amenities better, I'll probably adjust my rating accordingly.

UPDATE: I've been going consistently for about three months now and I have to tell you, everything about this Y is awesome.  The staff has always been friendly. The place is clean and well maintained. It's five stars all around. I'm willing to chalk up my initial first impression to everyone was having an off day. If you are looking for a great gym, join this one. It's a winner.
