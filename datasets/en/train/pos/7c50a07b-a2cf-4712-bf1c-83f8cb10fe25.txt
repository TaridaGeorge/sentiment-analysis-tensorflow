Just had to thank the staff at Wag n' Wash. for helping me grab some dog food and treats BEFORE they opened. I know what a pain in the arse it is to open early or stay open late, to help someone (even one who should know your normal hours of operation). This is another reason why I love this place. I was able to grab a coffee and make it home before kickoff. Thanks again!
