Always good, Always a smile! 

A" must-go" if you are anywhere in AZ ...! 
... get to Matt's and you can thank me later! ;) 

A HINT: get there a little before 6am or bring an umbrella for the sun in case you have a wait. 

Regardless ... wake early, travel with an umbrella or sunscreen OR sit for a bit ... you will be glad you "close this deal!" 

Bfast or Lunch ... the answer is YES!

Bon Appetit!
