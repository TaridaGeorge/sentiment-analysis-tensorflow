awesome! On more than one occasion I found myself coming to this place some acts are quite strange but that's what I go for.  Also cool bartenders and cool vibe throughout matt white once was playing his show shoe-less just real laid back kind of place although the crowd did get a little crazy during some mean theremin playing by a band whose name fails me at the moment...also if you like pabst blue ribbon look no further.
