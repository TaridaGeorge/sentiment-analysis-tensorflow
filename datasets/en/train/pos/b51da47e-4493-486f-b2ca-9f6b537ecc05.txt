Best BBQ in Arizona!  Big portions, great sides, and great service.  I got the combo platter with pulled pork, brisket, and ribs...it was outstanding.  The pulled pork is exceptional.  For your sides, you have to get the Mac & Cheese!  

If you really like the traditional KC or TX BBQ joints that are hole in the walls with red and white checkered tablecloths (or none at all) and you have to walk through lines to get your BBQ, then you probably won't like Bobby Q's.  The food is great, but it is a somewhat upscale for BBQ.

Oh yeah, and the "Thank Q's" doughnuts are great way to end the meal.  They're so fresh and gooey!!
