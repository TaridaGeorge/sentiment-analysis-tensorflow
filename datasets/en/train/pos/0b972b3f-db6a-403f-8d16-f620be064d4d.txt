A drizzling Sunday lunch brought everyone inside as it was packed.  We found the last small table by the windows and waited for our food which arrived quickly.

The Farmer sandwich had fresh vegetables and goat cheese.  I got the corn, tomato, and bean salad as a side with it.  The Vegetarian pizza had grilled zucchini, grilled asparagus, mushrooms, and olives.  Everything was cooked and prepared perfectly.

The shining star was definitely the bread pudding which they make out of their cinnamon rolls.

Very fresh and healthy food.  Great pastries.
