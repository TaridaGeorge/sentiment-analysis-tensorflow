Best Bun Bo Hue (Hue style, spicy beef noodle soup) I've ever had at any restaurant I've been to! It almost compares to my mom's...almost.

They Americanize it some, in the sense that they leave out the chocolate meat and pig feet (Boo to that!), but the broth is so delicious it doesn't even matter! It's all about the BROTH! I was sooo tempted to take it home in a friggin cup b/c I was overly stuffed. Yes, it was THAT good.

I'm guessing if the bun bo hue is this good, the pho is probably tha bombeezy!
