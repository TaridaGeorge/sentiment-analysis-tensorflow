This is the first sushi restaurant I've been to and I'm pretty sure it has completely spoiled me for sushi. It's absolutely delicious. Everything is. It's well-priced, the sushi looks beautiful and tastes fresh, and there are little touches like the delicious oranges they bring out after dinner. I've been there twice now and look forward to going again.
