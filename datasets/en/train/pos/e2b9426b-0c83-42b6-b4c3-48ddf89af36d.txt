Oregano's is my favorite place to get Pizza in Tempe/Phoenix.  I grew up on "Chicago Style Thin" in Illinois and this gets it just about perfect.  The service is always good, even though this location is the busiest.  I haven't had anything other than the pizza, but friends who have tried other things say they are good.  Plus, the pizza cookie for dessert on a special occasion is always a treat!  Oregano's has a heavy hand with the spices usually, but I like that so it's great for me.  

I did take-out once and it was great.  Will use them again!
