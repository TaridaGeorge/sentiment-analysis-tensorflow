Lovely place, especially the quite large patio w waterfall wall.  Steak frites w chimichurri was really great, Marisa says the chimichurri was just like she's had in Buenos Aires.   They also have a great homemade ketchup.  Really liked the home made pistachio ice cream.  Also tried an apple honey crisp with phillo dough wafers and dulce de leche ice cream which was really terrific.  I'll be back!
