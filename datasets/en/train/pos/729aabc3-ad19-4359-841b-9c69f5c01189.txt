What can I say about Echo Cofffee that hasn't already been said?  I am a  frequent customer and I feel like I leave one home and then walk into my other home.  I absolutely love lovE loVE lOVE LOVE Echo Coffee.  I have never had a bad experience here and the baristas are my favorite.  The owner, Steve, is my favorite.  And the fabulous customers that come in are my favorite.  I have met so many great people at Echo Coffee.  And oh their menu is grand!  The great thing is everyone that works here is highly knowledgable about their products. It is a great place to meet for business or with family and friends.  I cannot find one negative comment anywhere in me!
