I would eat at Jimmy Johns every day if I could.  
Great atmosphere, employees are all quick to say hello!
"Subs So fast you'll freak" is more than just a slogan - by the time I paid for my sub and filled up my cup with my drink, the sandwich was done and in front of me.  
To top it off, the food is absolutely delicious!
