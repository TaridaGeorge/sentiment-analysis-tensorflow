Last night Tottie cooked me up a special "diet" plate. She started with fresh steamed shrimp, chicken and dry fried those with cabbage, red pepper and onion then finished with fresh spring onion and cilantro. Let me tell you, it was amazing! No oil, no sugar, no starch but ALL flavor! 

Along side she brought me a dish of spicy Tottie sauce which is made from vinegar, chile and garlic.. again sugar free but still packed with complexity flavors and major heat! 

Tottie is just an amazing chef, owner and person. Even this morning I'm still reeling about the experience I had at Totties last night, I felt just like family.
