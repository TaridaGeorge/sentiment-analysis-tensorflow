i'm a packaging person. the way things are packaged makes a huge difference in my experience. i love the cups at lux. simple and wonderful. 

my best friend was in austin for three months and when he returned he informed of a coffee place there he would frequent, i was so excited to bring him to lux and give him back a little piece of home.
