This place is just my speed. Not pretentious, not overpriced just realllllllly good chicken fried steak. Whenever I go, someone gets the fried chicken & someone gets the chicken fried steak and we share because the portions are GINORMOUS (sp?) . The house salad dressing is my absolute favorite dressing out there. One thing to watch out for, they serve the beer in little itty bitty glasses which somehow makes me drink more....maybe thats why I always leave there happy. Prices are very reasonable and service is perfect. They are there to feed you and let you get on with your night!
