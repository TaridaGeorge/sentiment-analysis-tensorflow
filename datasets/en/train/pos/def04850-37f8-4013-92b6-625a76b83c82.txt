Roka Akor rocks!  Superb high quality of sashimi and robata grill with attentive but not pestering service by modelesque waiters. What else can one ask for?

The grilled scallops were juicy and crispy on the surface, flavored with yuzu paste (Japanese citrus).  

The sashimi platter was out of this world.  Highly marblized toro that they paired with freshly grated Himalayan rock salt, kumamoto oysters, maguro, sweet shrimp, salmon tataki, and butterfish sashimi.  Even the wasabi was freshly grated.  It looked like an expensive masterpiece (thank god our vendor took care of the bill :)).

My miso-glazed black cod was perfectly grilled and creatively presented inside some curved leaf.  

I also heard the kobe beef was good.

And the flight of sake was pretty refreshing as well.

All in all, Roka met every expectation I had. I can still hear my coworkers raving about last night's dinner.  :)
