This place is wonderful!!!! I could hangout here all day, their so polite and so helpful, I feel like half of them are almost like my buddies by now. They help me unload and load heavy items into my car, they care to ask about my day, their just overall great! I highly recommend this place not only for supplies but for classes and to meet some awesome people! Congrats on the business guys, I'm sure I'll see you all in 48 hours or less! :)
