This place is amazeballs!!!!  I will never eat at subway again after finding this spot!!  Their concept is awesome, the sandwiches are delicious and the people that work there are so nice and friendly.  I pick up lunch here at least 2 to 3 times a week for my office and the general consensus and feed back on each sandwich is outstanding!!  I personally am addicted to the chicken cordon blue, on wheat, toasted, with swiss, lettuce, tomato's and lite mayo...it always hits the spot!!  This place is a MUST try trust me!!!
