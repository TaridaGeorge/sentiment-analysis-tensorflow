I have always wanted to stay here but we often opt for the younger Phoenician in Scottsdale. My room was in the newer Paradise villa and was large and bright. 
    Pool is amazing! Food and Beverage options are great but not cheap. I was not charged for parking as some have said, there is a $13 room fee, but Internet was free and without complication. The staff were awesome, the meeting facilities were good though the food and service was not to the caliber of the hotel. Maybe it was my group but the hotel was a 5 and the meeting food and service was a 3 at best.
   The Spa was nice and service was good, but for the price the are asking it's just not worth the services. Skip the massage, use the gym for free and there will be no disappointments.
