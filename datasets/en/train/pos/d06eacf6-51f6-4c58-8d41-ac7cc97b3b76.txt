I really kind of love In-N-Out.  Even if they serve a little proselytizing with their fries, which would normally drive me nuts.  I fell in love with In-N-Out in Southern California in another life, and I was thrilled to find them here.

I'm a vegetarian.  I get the grilled cheese without grilled onions (because the onions are cooked on the same grill as the burgers).  It always hits the spot.  I don't care for the fries.  And not because of the Bible verse on the wrapper.  They taste too potatoy, or something.

But the chocolate shake deserves it's own paragraph.  Oh.  My.  Gosh.  I think it's vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce mixed in rather than chocolate ice cream.  And it's lovely.

I think when my family comes out in the fall I will take them to In-N-Out.  They will think I'm crazy, until they have their first bite.
