So, so delicious.  Pulled pork sandwich, fried okra, sweet tea.  Really tasty.

DRENCH your sandwich with their sauce - they give you a bottle of it for a reason.  I suggest applying one coat to each side of the bun (the "primer"), and then putting some extra on each bite.

Be prepared, the service is pretty slow.  But if you've got plenty of time, pop into the purple palace and give it a try.
