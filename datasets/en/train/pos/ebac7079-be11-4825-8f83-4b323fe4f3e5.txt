The Phoestivus last night was a lot of fun.  My hubby and I walked around and looked at all the cool things that people were selling and tried a couple of samples too.  I bought a cute bracelet from Pure Life Forever by Jenny.  After walking around we decided to have Short Leash for dinner.   Short Leash was amazing as always. :) 

When walking around earlier that night we saw that they had a photo booth.  So we decided to get our picture taken from Social Station and the picture turned out great.  On our way out we stopped by the Yelp Table and had Lindsey F. wrap our gift for us.  She did a great job on our gift.  :)   

Next week they are doing Phoestivus again.  So, if you are in downtown next Wednesday you should check out Phoestivus.
