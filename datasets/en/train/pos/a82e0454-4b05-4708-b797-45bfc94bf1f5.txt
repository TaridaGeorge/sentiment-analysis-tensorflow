Besides the fact that this liquor store has an excellent selection of beer, wine, and booze, they also have a small walk-in humidor to buy cigars!  

There is nothing I love more than being able to pick up a nice hand-made cigar while buying a bottle of good whiskey and some good beer.  

This place is located near Four Peaks Brewery, so I will often stop here after I leave the brewery for my at home liquor and smoking needs.

the cigar selection isn't huge, but they have basic good brands like CAO, Punch, Macanudo, Partagas, Acid, and others.  

If you are a lover of fine cigars and booze like I am, this is the liquor store for you!
