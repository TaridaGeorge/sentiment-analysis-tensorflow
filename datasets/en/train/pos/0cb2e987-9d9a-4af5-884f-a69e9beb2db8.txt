Why 5 stars? Because if you are looking for a deal, this is the place. I wished I had stopped before. I bought a sleeper in a very good condition (the mattress was like new) for only $130. As other reviews said, they carry used furniture and accessories from hotels, but  they also carry new furniture like Coasters. The personnel is friendly and professional.
