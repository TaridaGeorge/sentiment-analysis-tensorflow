Just came from Candy Addict and who ever is bitching about the saltwater taffy and orange peanut things must be high as a kite...  Their selection of salt water taffy is around 45 flavors.  "maple bacon" salt water taffy was amazing !  All very fresh.

I checked out "It's Sugar", some new corperate chain and their prices are through the roof...  almost double what Candy Addict charges.
