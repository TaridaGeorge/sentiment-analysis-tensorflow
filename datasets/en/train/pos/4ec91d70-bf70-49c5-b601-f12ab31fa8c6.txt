WONDERFUL!!! Best shrimp and fish tacos... We were there sat 10/3/09. The food was great everyone loved the food (hubby, daughters 10 9 4 and son 2)  The customer service was exceptional which I dont see often. I did see several people just take a look inside then walk off but u cant judge a book by its cover! We will definately eat there again often and soon!
