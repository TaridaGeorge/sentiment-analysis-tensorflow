I absolutely love this pizza.  This is my comparison place when I try other places and I'm still saying Nello's is better.  I've never had a bad pizza here.  Their thin crust pizza is the best and they don't overdo the sauce, so you can still taste the bread of the pizza. Of course the staff is always friendly. Bonus part is being able to have a good red wine here with the pizza. Yum.
