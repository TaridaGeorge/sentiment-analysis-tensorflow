I absolutely LOVE this place.  Good service, and great food.  Always get food pretty fast, and the food is nothing less of delicious. 

I get the chicken shwarma, with the tomato soup.  THE TOMATO SOUP IS THE BEST SOUP ON EARTH.   For appetizer I get the garlic dip, or the hummus and it's SO good.

I give this restaurant 5 stars, and I find myself craving this place once a week!
