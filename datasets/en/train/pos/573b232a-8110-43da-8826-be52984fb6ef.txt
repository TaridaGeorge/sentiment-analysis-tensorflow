Wow I must say this place is really good. I like the area! The staff is super friendly! And they have a straight forward breakfast menu. (awesome, thin pancakes) 

My wife things they has the best coffee in Phoenix! And she's had a hard time finding a coffee that can compete vs new jerseys coffee so I think we have a winner! 

This will be my ahwatukee place :-)
