This is a cozy coffee shop in a strip mall.  I went for lunch one day and ordered a sweet crepe with nutella, strawberries, and bananas.  It was very good.  In addition to the sweet and savory crepes, you can also create your own with a wide range of fillings.  The coffee was also good.  The service was warm and friendly.  This is a good place to relax and enjoy a sandwich alternative.  The TV didn't seem to fit the rest of the restaurant, although I'm sure sports fans will be happy.
