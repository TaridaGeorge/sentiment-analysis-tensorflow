A la carte fries in a SHOPPING CART = love.
Sweet potato fries in a shopping cart = I have to check that I still have a pulse.

I wish wish WISH that there was a Delux in Chicago. The burger (rare, just how I like it) was nothing short of incredible, and I am ridiculously enamored of the mayo aioli for dipping the shopping cart sweet potato fries. 

The beer/cocktail menu here is more extensive than you'd ever expect for a burger joint. It takes up several pages of the menu - which, by the way, is pretty nifty looking. The beer flights come in cute little trays, which may be entirely unnecessary, but they're fabulous nonetheless.

If I hadn't been so full from the burger, I would have had one of the gorgeous cupcakes from Delux's to-go place next door. Or a mini-apple pie. Or both.
