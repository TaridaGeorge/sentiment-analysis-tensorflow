Don't know what Simply D is talking about but sounds like those drinks that the bartender "added" on not only impaired his typing skills but also his mathematical skills. The drink prices at Grimaldi's are moderately priced, so two drinks adding up to $50?...Think simply D might just like to gripe. I've been in the industry for long time, so I've witnessed and also have been guilty of not being able to keep count of exactly how much I've had to drink. Maybe It was just an oversight on either side? Whatever the situation don't let his review sway you because you would definitely be missing out...
