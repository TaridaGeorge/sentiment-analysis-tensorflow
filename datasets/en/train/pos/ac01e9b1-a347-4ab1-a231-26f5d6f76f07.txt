Yea, the eggs benedict is absolutely delicious!! YUMMY! It's got bacon, hash browns, and a delicious sauce. Mmmm!.. I went here with my coworker to get some work done before heading into the office, and we split the dish. I regretted it. I guess I'll have to go back... anyone up for it?! :D

I enjoyed the iced coffee, too! They don't have Splenda, so bring your own if you're not okay with Sweet'N'Low. 

Decor is awesome
Service is very nice
WIFI is free
