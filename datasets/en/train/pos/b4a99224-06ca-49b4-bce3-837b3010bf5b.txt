I have attended two graduation ceremonies of friends in this building. The modern asymmetric architecture, the beautifully landscaped grounds, and the scenic views around make the area a pleasure to stroll in. The building itself is spacious and can accommodate a lot of people while giving you a sense of being in a more personal, somewhat intimate setting instead of a cavernous, impersonal space.
