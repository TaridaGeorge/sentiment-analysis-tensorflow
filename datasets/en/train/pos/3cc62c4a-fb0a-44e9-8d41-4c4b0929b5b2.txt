The only place I know of in Phoenix where you can get a fresh vegan breakfast, with new specials each week. I love the tofu scramble, sometimes they have a tofu and veggie breakfast burro which is absolutely to die for. The owner and staff are always very friendly and have always been happy to accommodate any special requests I've made.
