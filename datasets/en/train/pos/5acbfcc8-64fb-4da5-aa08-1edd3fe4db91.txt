I love La Bocca!!!  When we have friends come in from out of town, we always bring them here.  I love bruschetta, and their's is honestly the best I've ever had.  I split a plank with my best friend and we're full with just that.  The cookie and ice cream dessert is well worth the wait.  Their entire menu is delicious and reasonably priced.
