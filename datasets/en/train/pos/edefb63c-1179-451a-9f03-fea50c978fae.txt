I love this place. It's way better than the chains in Cali. I love their BBQ sauce and their curry chicken katsu is yummy. And I love their mac salad. The mini portions are not really mini, at least for me. It's a fairly big portion size. I will make the short trek out here when I get the craving for Hawaiian BBQ. The others aren't as awesome as this place :)
