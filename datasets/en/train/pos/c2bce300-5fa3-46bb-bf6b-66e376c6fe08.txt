So popular at lunchtime that there's a line extending out of the restaurant into the plaza with people waiting to get in. My wait time was 15 minutes last time I went. (Note: This will now result in 25 different Yelpers coming here and giving us their oh so original thoughts using one of the three following cliched lines: "Not worth the hype!"; "Not worth the wait!"; and/or "I'm from [some crappy economically depressed part of the country which explains why I'm in Arizona] where they really know how to make Thai food, and this isn't that.")

Eff them. The curry bowls are the most delicious things on earth.
