I love this place! Its my new favorite restaurant! Everything is so fresh and so good..I had the hummus to start with a friend and they had the burger which was awesome and I had the chicken sandwich which was pretty good. Sweet Potato Chips were amazing and the iced green tea was really good! Only downfall was the server could have been nicer but oh well maybe next time.
