It helps to know that I give Starbucks in general great reviews because I love it so much.  This starbucks gets 5 stars because the people there are so kind. I have met a different person every time I've been there, and each person is not only nice but personable.  They seem to genuinely care about the people walking through the door, and that, afterall, is an important part of enjoying your coffee experience, the smile that comes along with the cup. :)
