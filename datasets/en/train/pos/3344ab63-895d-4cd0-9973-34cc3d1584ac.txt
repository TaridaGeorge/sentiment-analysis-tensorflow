LOVED Tandoori Times!  Seriously loved it.  I've only been there once, which violates my dine-twice-before-reviewing rule, but it was that good.  I ordered the Navratan Korma.  The other two people I was with had the Chicken Tikka Masala and a fish dish in a masala-like sauce.  Each of us raved about our meals as we ate them, and then we raved again as we ate the leftovers.  My dish was perfectly spiced and slightly sweet and just typing about it is making my mouth water.  The garlic naan was excellent as well.  I NEEDED a favorite Indian place in Phoenix.  I am very much looking forward to going back to Tandoori Times.  I have high expectations and hope beyond hope that I will have the same excellent experience next time.  Will keep you posted...
