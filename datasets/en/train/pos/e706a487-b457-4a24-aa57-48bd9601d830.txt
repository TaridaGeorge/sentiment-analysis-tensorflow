I don't get my nails done very often, but when I do I go here because they last a long time.  The shop is very clean and decorated nicely, which I like.  This place is good for groups too... I brought my bridal party here, and they were able to work on all of us at the same time so that we could socialize without waiting around.  The staff is very friendly.  I come to get my eyebrows done too because they don't make them too thin, and they take walk-ins.  I have recommended this place to all of my girlfriends, and I will keep going back!
