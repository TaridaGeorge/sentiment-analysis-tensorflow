Record stores that carry used stuff generally struggle with the balance of massive inventory versus organization.  Stinkweeds has found a balance which I think works for them.  Or at the very least, for me.

The used vinyl isn't massive, but more importantly, its right up my alley.  As aging indie rock pseudo hipster, I struggled with not buying the whole store.  Plus they have all the new releases I could ask for.  I literally picked up 4 different albums and walked around with them, each time saying 'Yup, this is the one I want,' only to change my mind again.

Prices were great, staff friendly, and if you a burgeoning or veteran music snob, there's something here for you. Plus you can see it from the light rail!  What more do you want?
