Since moving downtown, Hanny's has become one of my absolute favorites! I love everything from the reclining booths to the crazy bathrooms. And even more, I love the food! 

My favorites are the Hanny's Salad and the Margherita Pizza. It's plenty to share and you'll enjoy every bite!

The drinks are a little pricey, but they definitely don't skimp on the booze. 

Great for lunch, dinner or late nights!
