My gal pal and I had a phenomenal meal here.
We started with a peach, pecan, and blue cheese salad-AMAZING.
Moved onto a eggplant pasta dish and a bolognese.  We were very happy with the portions of all for the prices.  Quality was great and we can't wait to go back.
It is now the go-to place for pasta in Phoenix-which isn't easy to find!
