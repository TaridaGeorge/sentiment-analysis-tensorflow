Great place and always willing to help with any questions and general advice. Tanks are always clean (cleanest in the valley) and prices are competitive. The fish are healthy, active,  and bright colored. However the couple times ive been in the selection hasn't been huge but decent nonetheless. They keep a record of what you buy fir reference as well and you get a small discount on your first visit. Overall I reccomend them and as a plus they are never overly busy like other stores.
