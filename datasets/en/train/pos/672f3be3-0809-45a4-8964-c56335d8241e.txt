I ate at Atlas Bistro two nights in a row while in Scottsdale at a conference. The surroundings of the restaurant are less than appealing, but once inside, all was forgotten. The food is among the best I've ever tasted. The ability to choose from an extensive wine selection from the wine store next door is great. It works out to be a great value. I was steered here by the Zagat guide and it certainly did not steer me wrong. Three different prix fixe selections are available from a seven course+  tasting menu down to a three course meal. Prices were extremely reasonable, for the quality of the food- $55 for three courses, $65 for 4, $95 for 9+ courses. Everything we tasted was absolutely wonderful, from the quarter free range rabbit appetizer to the chili peppers in aoli sauce to the seafood stew. Highly recommended.
