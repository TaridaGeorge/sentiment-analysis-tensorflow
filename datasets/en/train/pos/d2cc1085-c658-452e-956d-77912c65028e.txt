I just spent two-and-a-half years living in Chicago, and though I'm not saying this beats their pizza, I'm not exactly missing it, either. Nello's has an amazing pie that would be right at home next to the big pizza giants in Chicago (Lou Manati's, Gino, Giordano's, Uno's, etc).  They make their own sausage, have an amazing house dressing and their tomato sauce sings. You can order light with a crab meat pizza or margherita, or heavy, with their meat lover's (which is a yummy plate of guilt). I'm partial to their bacon and onion, which is amazing and sweet and smokey. They also put their pepperoni under the cheese so it doesn't slide off, which is a very important technical maneuver.
