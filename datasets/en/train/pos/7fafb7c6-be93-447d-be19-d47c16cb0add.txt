Gotta love a liquor store with shopping carts!  Seriously, this place is perfect because it's so easy to find what you want and they have a ton of inventory - more than BevMo for sure.  The aisles are clearly marked with the type of wine, and they provide a description for each wine.  Employees provide their own elaborated descriptions if it's one of their favorites.  Staff not only asks if you need help, but asks specific questions in case you really do need help but are too self conscious to admit it.  If they're out of something, they're happy to see if it's in another place in the store.  The prices are lower than just about any store but Costco, and they have a very wide selection of very good wines in the $8 - $15 range.
