I signed up for Yelp because of this place!  It is A-MAZING!!!!!!!! 
I judge every pizzeria by their Margherita Pizza and they passed with flying colors! My husband was born and raised in the South of Italy so I have become a major pizza snob and this place made me want to order a second.  If my hubby would have been there, he would have ate 3 because they are soooo good!  I also tried the white pizza with pistachios but I am a tomato sauce girl.  Order the margherita:) Buonissimo! and worth the wait....be prepared to wait.
PS:  I'm actually already planning my trip back to AZ just for the pizza.  I'm serious. lol.
