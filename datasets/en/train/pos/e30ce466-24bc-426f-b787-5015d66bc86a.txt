Regular in the work rotation for lunch. Parking can be rough if it's during busy hours but there is plenty of street parking around and behind the brewery. Each time I visit, I always get the Four Peaks Cheeseburger and beer battered fries. Their fries are some of the best that i've ever had. Sadly, I don't drink but when i introduced some friends and beer aficionados for lunch on a visit, they were hooked to the beer and the food.

Warning: If you sit inside in the back, it can smell a little weird due to the beer vats. You get used to it after awhile. Also, no air conditioning in the hot summer months.
