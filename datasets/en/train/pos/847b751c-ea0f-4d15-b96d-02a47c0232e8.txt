Ok....first of all I have to say...I do love tourists as I am often one myself. But if you are a tourist and never have hiked in your life please don't hike Camelback! As I am coming down the other day after breaking my "record", I come up to this woman clutching the fence for her dear life. I try to go around her and end up falling on my butt, sliding down the rocks! Nice! Thanks for the "rock rash" on my lower back! Its sexy! 
Seriously watch out for damn tourists!
