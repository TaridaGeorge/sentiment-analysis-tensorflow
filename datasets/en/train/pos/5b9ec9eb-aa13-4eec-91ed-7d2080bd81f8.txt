We dined here again but this time with friends who also love Indian food. On December 08, 2012 we arrived at 5:50PM. Parking within their parking lot was great. My wife and I ordered Kingfisher Beers served with a ice cold glass. 

My wife ordered Shrimp Korma with a spice level of medium. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala also with a spice level of medium. One order of Basmati Rice was ordered. Our meal arrived hot-temperature wise and was excellent. I did steal a shrimp or two from my wife's selection and she stole a piece or two  of chicken. The level of spice was great. 

See my photos from my  previous review posted on Yelp. We will return in the near future for another excellent meal.
