I walk over here about once every 2 weeks after getting a latte at Dutch Bros and after a trip to Smeeks...This is a lovely boutique.  I live in the neighborhood...so I am partial...But, How cool is it to walk over to shop and get a cute outfit,jewelry,shoes,purse and some fun knick knacks for the offspring..all in one visit?  If I want something new to wear to Postinos, or St. Francis that night I can shop here and find something unique, cute and stylish.   Hope they keep up the good work!
