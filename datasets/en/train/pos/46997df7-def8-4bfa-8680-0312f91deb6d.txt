Lo Cascio is the cutest little Italian restaurant. My sister and I went for an early dinner before heading to Gammage for a Broadway show. We were just in time for the Early Bird specials (smaller portions at a discounted rate). I ordered the Eggplant Parmigiana and my sis got the Penne Bianche (penne pasta in an alfredo sauce with vegetables). She subbed the Penne for Fettuccine instead. Everything was delicious! The bread was to die for! It was so fresh. The creamy Italian dressing served with the salad was yummy. The waiter was very attentive, friendly and nice. I wish I lived closer to this restaurant!
