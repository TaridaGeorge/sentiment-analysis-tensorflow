Kudos to Stevey P and Yelp for discovering this awesome place! I'd been driving to a stupid Blockbuster on Thomas and 27th Street until now, for the past two and a half years since I moved downtown. I love almost any independently run videostore, for many of the reasons cited in SP's review, especially my love of foreign and independent flicks.
