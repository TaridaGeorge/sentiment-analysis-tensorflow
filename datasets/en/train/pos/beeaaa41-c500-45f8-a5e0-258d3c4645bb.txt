This is exactly what Gilbert needs! Love this place. Love everything about it: location, service, food, vibe. It is really cute and has comfortable seating outside and inside. There is a grass area where you can bring a blanket and eat your food there. There is always a wait, but they take such great care of you. They brought us out some tasty olives while we sat around and sipped on bellinis. The bruschetta is amazing. Then I had the roast beef sandwich and Italian salad, which blew my mind. Sitting on a comfy cough, sippin on some beverages, and biting into some crispy bread loaded with salmon, figs, pesto, and sun dried tomatoes. Close to heaven as you can get on Earth.
