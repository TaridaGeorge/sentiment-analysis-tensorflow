Yum Yum Yum!...Yum?...Yeah Yum...Oh Yum!...Yes Yum!  I love Tottie's!  I love Tottie too :)  If I had a wife I sure hope she can cook like Tottie haha!  Needless to say the Thai food is magnificent!  Hold off on the spice though - I'm kind of a wuss when it comes to the chili peppers.  I'll stick with just mild :)  Fried fish and chicken basil mmm so good!  Gotta love the decor (Thanks Gary!)  Samurai art while you eat your Tum Yum - Yum again? Yes...please.  Gotta try their assortment of dessert too it'll help with the fire coming out of your mouth.  Service is fast with a bang!  More water please - my to tongue is going numb :) - enjoy!
