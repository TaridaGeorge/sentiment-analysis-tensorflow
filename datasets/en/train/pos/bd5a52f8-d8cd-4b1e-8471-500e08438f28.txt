What a great ball park!!!!
Watching a baseball game under the lights with the roof open in early / mid spring in Arizona, doesn't get much better than this.
My party was spoiled as we were given a suite over looking left field (??)
so we had really good seats, and clean toilets!
There are a ton of typical ball sports eateries at chase field, hot dog vendors, pretzel and beer vendors, pizza, etc...
If you're in the PHX area and are looking for something to do definitely check out Chase Field.
