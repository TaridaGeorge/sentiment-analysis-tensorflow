Blue Nile is one of my favorite places in Tempe! I get something different almost every time I go and I have been happy with everything I've eaten. I especially like their vegetarian dishes (more than the meat ones, which is surprising because I'm a big meat eater) and I LOVE their sambussas. So good. Also, their lunch special is great because for around 10 dollars you can get a vegetarian entree, a meat entree, and two sambussas.
