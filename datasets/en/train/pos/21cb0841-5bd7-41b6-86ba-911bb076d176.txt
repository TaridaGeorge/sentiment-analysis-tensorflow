I was getting my race on at f1 race factory and decided to kick start my yelp search engine to find a nearby restaurant . So I  decided to eat here because of the high praise from the yelp community and it reminded me of the line in tropic thunder when he says pasty tea bag. By the way I recommend the movie as highly as I do this eatery. It was a chill laid back bar atmosphere. I've only had it the one time, but that was enough for me to be confident in saying 100% of the time its good everytime.
