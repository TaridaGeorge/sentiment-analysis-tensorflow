Went there last night with a group. Everyone really liked the food and the service was excellent. We shared 5 different dishes. The lamb masala was particularly good, as was the tandoor chicken tikka.  This is the best Indian food we have found in the valley (our group has been to many Indian restaurants in England, Canada and elsewhere). The decor is a little plain, but is clean and new.
