Let me start out by saying I am not a vegan or vegatarian. But seriously, this place is freaking amazing. I'll admit I was a little skeptical about the whole vegan thing but they proved me wrong. 

I get the Thai spicy "chicken" salad. It is the perfect amount of spice for me, not too spicy but just enough to give it flavor. The "chicken" is so good and flavorful. If I didn't know it wasn't real chicken I would have been fooled. Their oatmeal cream pie just the right finish to the meal. 

The way the restaurant is decorated is so different than most places around Tempe. All along the back wall they have old car doors lining the bottom half. On other walls, they have local astists display their artwork that you can buy. It's just a great atmosphere.
