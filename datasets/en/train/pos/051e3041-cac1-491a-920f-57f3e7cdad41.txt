Last night the Chihuly exhibit opened and I visited the garden this afternoon.  $15 is a hefty entrance fee, so i brought a book...i was going to make it worth my while. The installations are AMAZING. My usual response to modern art is "huh?" but this felt organic and otherworldly all at once. The pieces are scattered all over the garden and I would definitely suggest going during the 4PM-8PM showing so you can see the sculptures in daylight and twilight. At about 6PM the garden lit up and it was so cool to see the huge sculptures like Moon and Saffron out across the dark desert backdrop. 

This is not to be missed, though you have time, Chihuly will be showing his work through May 2009.
