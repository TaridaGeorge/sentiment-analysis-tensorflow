Awesome. Awesomeawesomeawesomeawesomeawesome.

Our waiter was funny and personable and patient. He was quite a gent.

The food was awesome and there were vegetarian options as far as the eye could see. I loved it.

My only complaint is that the patrons next to us seemed way uptight but that happens.

Loved it, can't wait to go back.
