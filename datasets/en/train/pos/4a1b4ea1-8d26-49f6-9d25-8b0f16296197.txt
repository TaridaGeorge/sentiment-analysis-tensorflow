Had to work in PHX for a few days and a co worker took me here after he saw me eating a pear at my desk...he asked if I liked pears and said that we had to go to a place that puts pears on burgers and chicken sandwiches...kinda thought well that's weird so off we went. Had Casablanca Chicken Sandwich...who would have thought pears on a sandwich...one of the best chicken sandwiches I have ever eaten! Too bad I was in town only a few days ....would have gone back again!
