This is definitely not your typical run of the mill nightclub. 

First off, let me mention that the decor is gothic cathedral style complete with erotic art, bright lights, and a chandelier over the bar. There is a unisex bathroom that is very clean and surprisingly never awkward. The music on Saturday nights for Doom Disco is an amaazing mix of old and new (think Joy Division and She Wants Revenge). Plus, the bartenders can make a mean gin and tonic and they have a pretty well stocked bar for any other drinks you might fancy. 

Tip: Doom Disco also has a Facebook page where they post pictures and the playlist from the Saturday before. Check it out!

Overall, it's 100% worth the drive and $5 cover
