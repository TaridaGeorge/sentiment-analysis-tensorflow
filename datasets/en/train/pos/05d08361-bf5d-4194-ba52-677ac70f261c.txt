I would give the gelato six stars if I could. Yum. 

Every batch is made from scratch, unlike other gelato joints in town, and the difference is obvious. I've tried just about every flavor there- except pistachio, because I hate pistachios- and they have all been exceptional. 

Try the Vesuvio- available only on Friday and Saturday. While it is more expensive than the other flavors, it will leave you craving more.  

It may be expensive compared to ice cream, but there's a reason for that. Ice cream could never be this good.
