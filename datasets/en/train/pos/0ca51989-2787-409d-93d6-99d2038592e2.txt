Wow! Is all I can say about this sub shop. I just ate a Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket for lunch. 1st visit to this place by the way. The only complaint I can make is to myself for not getting the bigger sub. This sub was Saweeeet! The meat was cooked just right. The cheese was melted perfectly. The sauce  Mmm Mmm Mmm good! The fountain drink dispenser was a first for me too. Coca Cola exterior with a Touch Screen beverage selection, too cool. I will be going back to try a few other subs this place has to offer, but one can't go wrong with the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket.....Scrumptious!
