For a Monday evening for dinner this place was steady busy. Very clean, everywhere as well....inside and out! 
First time here, we ordered char bbq bacon burger and tri tip steak sandwich with sweet pot. fries and onion rings with 2 mocha malts for dessert.
WOW! The food was amazing, cooked exactly to order. Especially the tri-tip had a REAL piece of steak, not just shavings as it usually goes elsewhere. 
The service was so friendly and helpful too!
We will definitely be back to sample more of the menu.
