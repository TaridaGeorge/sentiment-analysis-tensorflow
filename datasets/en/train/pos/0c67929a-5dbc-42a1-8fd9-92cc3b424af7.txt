This place reminds me of the many breakfast joints I miss in the Chicago area. Good basic food. Plenty of it. Super low prices. Down-home, informal, good stuff. 

Don't get me wrong... If you're looking for organic and upscale you're headed for La Grande Orange or True Food ($$$). If you want the best tasting breakfast you've ever had, you're going to Matt's Big Breakfast ($$). If you want a place to eat every week (or more) that's good, filling, inexpensive, and convenient for meeting with people... it's Fast Eddie's, Joe's Diner, or Acacia Cafe.
