My husband and I do like good wings and as we're in Phoenix for a couple of months we looked for somewhere that offered some tasty wings. The Armadillo Grill certainly provided them! The Armadillo Gold and the Honey Hot were absolutely delicious, the asian slaw that came with them was a tasty take on a traditional favorite.

The staff were very pleasant and all in all we had a great happy hour!
