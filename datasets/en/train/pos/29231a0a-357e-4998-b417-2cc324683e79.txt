They take care of me at The Vig.  My local hot spot where I take my clients sometimes after their massage with me.  The food is always fresh, the servers are continually delightful and my clients leave with a full belly and happy.

Happy Hour is grand!  From 3 to 6 pm you can get 12 plump, juicy chicken wings with blue cheese and celery sticks for only $4.50.  I adore the wines, and they are only $6.  

The Vig Azz burger is yummy.  YES, I like meat :-)  Veggies too, yet, the burger is cooked to order, fresh condiments, huge onion rings and the buns are soft ~

I am hungry for it right now ~
