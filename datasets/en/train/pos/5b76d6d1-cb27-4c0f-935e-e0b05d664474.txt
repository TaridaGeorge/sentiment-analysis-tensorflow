We checked out this place at the request of friends and they had amazing BBQ, I personally got the brisket, mac n cheese and cornbread.  My food was hot and amazing when my to go bag was delivered, the two friends I had with me had the BBQ chicken and Ribs, with the mac n cheese and greens, both friends commented on how good their food was, so we are giving a local, family owned Water and Ice shop 5 stars!  

Way to go Mary and keep up the amazing BBQ menu, we will be back!
