Damnit. I just got a raise but still can only afford to go to Sidebar on my birthday.  

I love Sidebar.  Its urban, hep, chic, trendy, crazy, sexy, cool.  But its also very intimate and laid back.  It feels like you are in some posh city outside of Phoenix.  They have a fabulous cocktail menu, with my favorite being the White Rabbit - an adult horchata.  They also have delicious drinks with lemonade, root beer and other perfectly sweet ingredients.The cocktails run around $8 - $12 each, with no significant happy hour prices. Of course they also have beer. But that's boring.
