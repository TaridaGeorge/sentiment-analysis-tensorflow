I just recently discovered the Greenbelt ,fell in love with it immediately and am there almost daily .
The best place to bike ride ,roller-blade or jog .this large expanse connects to a couple of different  parks and lots of lush greenery ,shady areas and ponds ...just beautiful ! plenty of places to stop along the way for a picnic .there is also a skate park .wonderful place for a family to explore together. it is  very tranquil here ,and very easy to find  a shady spot to meditate or just sit for a short while soaking up the peace .If you need to cover 2 to 3 miles in a run or bike ride ,it can be accomplished here .

If you jog ,walk or love to ride a bike ...do it here ....you will love it !
