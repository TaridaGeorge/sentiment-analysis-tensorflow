My kids beg to go to Butterfields! We live close. The service is always AWESOME! I have been there at east 100 times and only had bad service once, and it was only bad because the server was overwhelmed but he was so kind I forgave it. Plus the kids get balloons. The only downfall here is the OJ is way overpriced. It is like they are buying organic greenhouse hydroponic oranges or something! Other than that its awesome
