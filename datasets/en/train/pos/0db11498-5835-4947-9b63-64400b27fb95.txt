Chix Char Broiled Grill is what made me what to get on yelp. Why, you may ask? Because I think the establishment should be rewarded for its exceptional value. The meat, rice, and vegetables are all delicious, high quality, and healthy. Not to mention one only has to wait just a few minutes for the food. Anyone who would choose eating at the Memorial Union over this place, unless of course you only have a minute before class, needs to take ECON 101 over again! For five bucks you are in and out (not to be confused with the burger joint), having just eaten a healthy, satisfying meal.

Check it out - I promise that you'll love it!
