We went here this morning and had a very pleasant breakfast experience. I have been to a couple of the previous iterations, and I hope WyKnot is able to stick around longer than its predecessors. 

My (presumed vegan) tofu burrito was piping hot, savory, and chock full of tasty fresh spinach, mushrooms, and potatoes. Tofu entrees are so often bland; this was anything but. The side of salsa was also very flavorful with a little kick. 

Husband ordered the classic burrito and subbed tofu for the bacon; he said it was great. 

My soy latte was large and tasty. 

Service was very friendly. Price was reasonable. We will continue to support this little place.
