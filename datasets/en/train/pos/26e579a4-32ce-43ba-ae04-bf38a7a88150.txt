I don't think I can live without Thai Rama! As I said in my earlier review, the #18 soup is amazingly delicious! The #23 garlic chicken is probably my favorite dish! I've been ordering a different curry every time I go. The yellow curry with chicken is very good, the panang curry with beef was so good, the masaman curry is like Thai beef stew! We had the red curry with chicken once and while there was nothing wrong with it, I prefer the yellow and panang. I have yet to try the green curry.
