Absolutely one of my favorite sushi places in all of the state...the filet wrapped asparagus is amazing, spicy tuna on crispy rice cakes are great, all the sashimi rules, the baked crab roll...unlike anything I've ever had, delicious. They have awesome happy hour specials but beware its a very small inside bar, so get there early.  They have amazing mixologists and always have a nice seasonal drink menu.
