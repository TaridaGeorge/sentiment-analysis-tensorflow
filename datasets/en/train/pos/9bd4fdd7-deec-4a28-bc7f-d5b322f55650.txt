This place is an amazing breakfast spot, I usually go here once every weekend. The staff is super friendly and down to earth, and they have a lot of vegetarian options on the menu. I usually get the veggie burrito, which I highly recommend. The drive-thru is fast, which I thought was amazing for a health food spot. Make sure to get their fairly early on the weekends though because sometimes the line can get pretty long, but it moves fairly quickly. 

I have yet to try any lunch items here yet, but I'm planning on it since their breakfast items are so good!

They also do a punch card, where you can get a free drink if you fill one up, coffee and smoothies included.
