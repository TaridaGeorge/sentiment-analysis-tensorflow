I have never eaten inside Meatballz, but I have ordered take-out twice.  OMG!  So delicious!  I order the hot eggplant parmesan hero!  As a vegetarian, I am always delighted to find meat substitutes or alternatives on a menu.  Eggplant is available as the "meat" of several entrees!  The hot hero is amazing!  The marinara sauce is delicious, not acidic.  The melted cheese is a nice touch and just the right amount.  The eggplant is sooo good!  I highly recommend ordering the eggplant parmesan if you're a fan of eggplant.  ;)  My coworkers and I are hooked on this place and order take-out from Meatballz often.  The prices are AWESOME too!  For a vegetarian, this places deserves an A+ for Chandler mall vicinity.  Simply awesome!
