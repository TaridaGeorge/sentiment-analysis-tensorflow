Casey Moore's is my favorite place to meet friends and enjoy an evening catching up. 
The appetizers are consistently great and the veggie burger (get the chipotle mayo!) is perfection.
It gets extremely crowded on Thursdays, Fridays & Saturdays (11-close). Although that doesn't stop me from going, if you are hoping to find a place to sit without stalking getter-uppers, you'd beter go Sun - Wed night.  Dinner hours are almost always accessible. 
I'm a veg, so I can't comment on the seafood....But my friend Skye hearts the oysters!
