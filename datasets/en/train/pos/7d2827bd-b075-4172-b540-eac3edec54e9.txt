Found this place about 15 years ago.  You guessed right....a referral.  Been referring and using ever since.  This is a no nonsense - CUSTOMER SERVICE oriented family business.  The staff is the same since the original trip.  

If you are looking for fair pricing, personal service and no "extra" suggested  upselling, this is a great place for you.  Wouldnt even think of taking my vehicles anywhere else.  Special thanks to this staff that goes out of their way for the little things too.
