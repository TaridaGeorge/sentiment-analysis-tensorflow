This is currently our favorite place for date night.  I live in the north valley and don't get to downtown very often but if we have an occasion we definately go to Cibo.  My husband and I are trying to experience all the Best of Phoenix restaurants and so far this is our favorite.  

The pizza is amazing.  My husband especially enjoys the pasta specials.   They seat us promptly and the service is top notch.  The fresh mozzarella app is amazing.  

If only we lived closer we would go be there much more frequently.
