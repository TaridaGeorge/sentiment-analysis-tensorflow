I heard about Nobuo's restaurant but didn't know much about it. After a friend's recommendation 4 of us made our way over to Nobuo at Teeter House last Saturday night. The Teeter House is a great little place that provides the perfect atmosphere for an intimate date or a dinner with a few friends. The  izakaya style of food is a great way to sample a bunch of Nobuo's creations.  We ordered Nasu Bacon Miso, Grapefruit & Hamachi, Kumamoto Oysters with Uni, Hirame Carpaccio, Coconut Curry Grilled Lamb, and Okonomiyaki. While all the food was amazing, the Grapefruit & Hamachi was my favorite. Each bite was served in a spoon and unbelievably crafted with an explosion of flavor. I could eat a dozen of these. One of these days I want to try the Omakase. I'm definitely going back!
