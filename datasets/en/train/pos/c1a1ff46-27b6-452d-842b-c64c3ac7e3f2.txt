I can easily give Hula's 5 stars. We've now been to Hula's numerous time since their opening and they seem to get better with each visit. Initially, like most new restaurants, their service was suffering but now it is awesome! Their menu has grown and become even better. I love the pulled pork sandwich and my partner is a huge fan of the chicken Cesar. This place is great for happy hour or for a relaxing meal. Highly recommend Hula's!  Awesome atmosphere!
