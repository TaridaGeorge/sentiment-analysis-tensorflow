I miss Postino's.  Once upon a time, I worked less than a block from here, and frequently stopped by for lunch or after work for some wine and bruschetta.  To this day, I have never had anything like their bruschetta.  Don't order it as an appetizer; it's definitely a meal.  Large and luscious, sweet and savory, served on a slightly rustic wooden plank, topped with amazing things like apples, soft cheeses, figs, and pistachios.  It's the stuff dreams are made of.  I wish they would hurry up and open the one in Gilbert.  I'm never in Arcadia at the right time anymore.  Also, do not expect to find parking here; you will definitely have to valet.  That's not just a Postino's thing, though, that's an Arcadia thing.
