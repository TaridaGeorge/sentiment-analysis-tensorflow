This is the most progressive, inclusive, welcoming, diverse, intellectually stimulating, public-service oriented church in the Valley, if not the West Coast.  We've been to more than a few and can attest to that.  

Pastor Jeff not only knows everyone's name but is genuinely concerned about everything that goes on in your life.  The congregation is like one big family.  Love for your neighbors is not just a commandment at this church - it's acted upon.  

If you're sick of churches that tell you what to believe in and don't act what they preach, you'd better check this one out.  Services every Sunday at 9:30am.
