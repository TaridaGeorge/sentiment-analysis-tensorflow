We bring out of towners here always. Great combination of super good, interesting food selections, cool re-hab architecture, and the  house made tonic and ginger ale always garner a "What?" with guests.  Our server was a pro - and with a great sense of humor. The place beautiful all the way.  If your friends don't like this place, take them to Dennys.
