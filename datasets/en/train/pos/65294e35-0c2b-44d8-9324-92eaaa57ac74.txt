I am In Love with Lux. 

They have everything I have ever wanted in a coffee shop. Good coffee, great homemade pastries and food, desks to study, comfy chairs to relax in, open and airy atmosphere, friendly employees, clean bathrooms, indoor and outdoor seating, spacious parking lot, great music playing and a huge tv with sports. Holy crap, that pretty much satisfies everyone. 

AND they serve booze! I mean, jeez. How can you not love it here?

Ps, it's a great place for a first date.
