What I love about Oregano's is that it never disappoints. The staff is always friendly, the food is always good, and the wait is long enough that you have time to enjoy a glass of wine (or two) before sitting down to dinner. I've been going to Oregno's for many years now and except for the time my car got towed from in front of the knitting shop, I've never had a bad experience.

Don't come to Oregano's if you're looking for nothing but food. Oregano's is all about the experience -- fun and casual, but not exactly a quick bite to eat. Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato Pizza is THE best and the Pasta Basta rocks, too.
