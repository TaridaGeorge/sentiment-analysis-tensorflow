I have used several yard maintenance services in the past, and I always felt like I could have done a better job.  Not so with Green Goat!  They did an amazing job, offered a very reasonable price for monthly maintenance, and were so easy to communicate with.  I've never used a yard service company that had email!  Highly, highly, highly recommended!!!
