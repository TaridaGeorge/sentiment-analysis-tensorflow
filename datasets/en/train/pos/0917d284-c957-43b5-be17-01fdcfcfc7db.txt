Great great food.  No ambiance but for a great chicken kabob plate or beef kabob with a cold lemonade you are in for a treat.  Love the Humus and Kibi.  

When in Tempe, stop here for a good meal for two for around $20.

I love Haji Baba, it is a Tempe landmark and that food is so so good and so inexpensive.  The servers are all cool.  My favorite ME Restaurant in town by far!!!
