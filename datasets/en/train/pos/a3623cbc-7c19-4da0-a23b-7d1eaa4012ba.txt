Mountain View has been REOPENED. I just enjoyed a nice morning at Mountain View Coffee at Fountain Park. A generous warm homemade cinnamon roll, fresh dark coffee and a great setting and friendliness made for a great stop that I recommend to others. Say hello to Belle the gracious new owner whom you'll recognize by her warm German accent. Did I mention Mountain View Coffee has the best location in Arizona with views of Mountains, World Famous Fountain and adjacent to the popular Fountain Park walking paths.
