Very cheerful, upbeat atmosphere. Excellent service. There is a huge screen that usually shows sports for the fans. And, a happy hour that makes the food significantly cheaper. If you are wanting to listen to modern Irish jigs while eating delicious food (who doesn't?!), read on.

I've ordered a number of appetizers and dishes here. The cod and pork sliders are by far the best. There are also wings, fries and Irish-style pizzas, and tacos, among other dishes. If you are a first-timer, make sure you go during happy hour (4 pm to 7 pm) and order pork tacos and cod sliders; you won't regret it. God, I'm salivating just thinking about going back.
