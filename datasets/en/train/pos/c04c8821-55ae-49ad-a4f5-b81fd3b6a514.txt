BW'S is a family favorite. That's not just a slogan. My kids are Gluten free and there are not a whole lot of places I can take them for dinner. 
They can eat the chicken wings no sauce and we are all addicted to their fries. 
I know Gail the owner. She used to have a play kitchen in her restaurant for the kids but unfortunately corporate made her remove it.
She tries to create an atmosphere where parents can bring their kids and they don't have to stress out about making them behave like 70 year old ladies. It makes it a little more relaxing for us. 
And besides the food I love being able to watch sports while I'm with my family.
Good Stuff, Thanks Gail
