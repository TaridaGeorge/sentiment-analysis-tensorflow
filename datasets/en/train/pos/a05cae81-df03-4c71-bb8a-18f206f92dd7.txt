Def has become my fav froyo spot. The owners are super nice, the staff is helpful without being annoying, the place is super clean and most importantly the selection is awesome! I love the tart with almonds, berries and coconut! YUM! Hot temps are around the corner, but at least I've found a great place to cool down!
