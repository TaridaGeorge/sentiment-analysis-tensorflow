The food alone deserves 5 stars; add an always welcoming staff, fresh ingredients, and an ever changing menu that compliments the regional museum exhibitions - where is the 6 star button? 

We eat here at least 3x a week, you cannot beat this restaurant for price, quality and service in Scottsdale. This is a well run kitchen serving great food at an affordable price - in fact after eating here and tasting the freshness for yourself, you'll start to feel conned by so many other restaurants that charge more and for little nutritional value in their dishes. This restaurant is an example to all restaurants.
