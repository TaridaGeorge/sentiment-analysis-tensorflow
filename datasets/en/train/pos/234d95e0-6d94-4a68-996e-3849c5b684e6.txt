yep...pretty much my new favorite taco shop in the valley...I tend to stay away from beef so carne asada holds no appeal for me...BUT this place has a little bit more of a variety of tacos-I had the Oaxaca black mole chicken shark taco and the mole was the perfect mix-just spicy enough....and the salsa bar made me giddy!  I can't wait to go back. YUM!
