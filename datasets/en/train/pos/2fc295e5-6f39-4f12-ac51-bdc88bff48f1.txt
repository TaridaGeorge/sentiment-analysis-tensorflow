Okay ya wanna know a little secret? I LONG for Green. Ever since moving back to New Orleans I'm surrounded by an embarrassment of culinary riches but our one vegetarian restaurant can never hold its own against Green. I passed through Scottsdale a few weeks ago to visit the Grand Canyon and the second I stepped off the plane at the Phoenix airport and secured the rental car we drove straight to the restaurant. Everything was just like I remembered it and slightly better. The staff was warmer and the food just as good. I'm still thinking about the "crab" puffs and the eggless rolls.
