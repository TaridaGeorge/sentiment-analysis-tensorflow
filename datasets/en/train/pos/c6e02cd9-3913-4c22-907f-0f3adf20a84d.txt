Damn Channel 8.  Why must it be so damn addictive?  Apparently its reputation is impressive nationally, as it's the 7th (or something like that) most watched PBS affiliate in only the 13th largest market.

KAET must secretly hate my friends, because I'm not ashamed to admit that I have flaked on friends due to the following:

* A British sitcom marathon. Yes, that's pathetic, but whatever.
* An inexplicably captivating Horizon news episode
* A Mamas and the Papas special that put VH1's "Behind the Music" to shame
* A Garbage concert and tonight's Celtic Woman concert (complete with hottie songstresses)
* An Arizona Highways episode that had me completely spellbound
* Being a telephone operator and sweet talking the Sun City crew for one of those pledge drives.

Btw, the studio is pretty nice inside, and should be completely awesome when it moves to ASU Downtown next year.
