The experience was AMAZING!!! I was a little hesitant about using this particular location because of previous reviews but it's 2 blocks from my home. I brought 2 guests plus myself as a birthday gift/ relaxing day & we all enjoyed our massages immensely. So much that 1 of my guests signed up for the monthly massage packet. I must agree the front desk workers are a little in the clouds. There was a small issue splitting the payment of my guests massage but otherwise a great time.
