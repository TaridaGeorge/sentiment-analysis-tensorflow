Fiesta Flowers was very helpful in accomodating my request for balloon delivery.  I took in my own "weight" and they attached balloons to it and then delivered it for me.  They are super friendly and willing to step out of the box to work with you.

Definitely recommend them for any flower, balloon or plant needs!
