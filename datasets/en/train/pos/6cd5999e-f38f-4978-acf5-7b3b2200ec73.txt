Had dinner here for the first time and we will definitely be back.  Our server Seth was the best I've had in a while. He knew everything about the menu and made great recommendations. I'm surprised we hadn't heard more about this place before. The crab cakes are fantastic, as were our drinks. Very enjoyable dinner!
