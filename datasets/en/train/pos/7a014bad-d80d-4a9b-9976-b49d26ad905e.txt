Green's food is good enough to turn me vegan (just kidding i love meat)! But seriously, before ever trying Green, I thought "how can this vegan crap possibly be any good?". Eat here, you'll understand. The "no-harm" chicken parm is out of this world, as are the "burgers" and the buffalo chicken wings. I've never had a bad dish here, and the texture of the faux meats are strikingly similar to the real thing... if I didn't know any better, I'd swear it was! 

Save room for dessert! The Tsoynamis are a vegan version of a DQ Blizzard, yet again somehow just as delicious, if not better!!!
