I found myself here on three separate occasions this week.  Yeah, a bit much, I know.  I had the pleasure of tasting their new brunch menu on my last visit which was awesome.  I had the B.E.L.T minus the B.  It was a great little egg sandwich!  It came with a side of fruit.  I also enjoyed the freshly squeezed mimosas.

Also, my bruschetta suggestions are:  Tuscan Tuna, Warm Artichoke Spread, Roasted Peppers & Goat Cheese, and Brie & Apples.

I'm a pretty big fan of this place, but am glad that I can have a boozy brunch here when I feel it necessary, now.
