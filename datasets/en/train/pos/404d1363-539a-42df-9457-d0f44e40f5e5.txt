The staff is simply the best. I frequent this hotel for business and recently had an odd assignment---11 straight nights where I worked a graveyard shift (7pm-7am). The challenge here is that my working/sleeping hours fell outside the normal housekeeping schedule. 

I explained this dilemma with the hotel management and they simply said they'd take care of it. They arranged to have my room serviced first thing in the morning so that it would be ready when I came back in the morning and ready to sleep. 

And it worked out well like clockwork.

The staff is accommodating and make the effort to remember guests by name. What a personal touch!

Internet speeds are adequate, HBO on tap, and a decent breakfast spread. Overall, great value for the business traveler.
