I went to "the best pizza restaurant in phoenix" and this place blew it away in taste, atmosphere, service, and price.  The place is decently roomy yet still cozy with the pizza oven in the background glowing.  The menu has a nice selection and everything I've had there has been fresh and tasty.  They have some unusual alcohols there we cant find anywhere else and I always enjoy their espresso after dinner.  Really pleasantly surprised by this place as it doesn't look like much from the location.
