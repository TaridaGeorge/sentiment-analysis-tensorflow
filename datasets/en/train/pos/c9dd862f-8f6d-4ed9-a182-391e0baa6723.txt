Kronos brand Gryros, good tzatziki and the right pita are pretty much all you need for a good gyros.  This place has it and they put the right amount of everything on it.  

Who cares about great service or ambience...it's a gyros place.  In fact, it would be out of character for those types of restaurants.  (cheeseburger, cheeseburger no fries??)

p.s. the kabobs are really, really good too.
