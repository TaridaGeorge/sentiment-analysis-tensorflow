Mastro's 2.0....ambiance is as expected the streaks are awesome.  I had the ribeye and my wife had the filet, both were  cooked perfectly and had the texture and flavor only Mastro can provide.  We have have steak in many, many places in the country and they are always compared to the Dominick (Mastro) brand and none come close.
Now we have to decide.... Dominick's, Mastros, Domincks, Mastros.... Mmmm warm butter cake is good but why not stick with the original creator?
