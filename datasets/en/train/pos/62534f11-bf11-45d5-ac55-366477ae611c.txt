I've been here a couple times and it was fun.  Both times had really good bands and there is also a DJ and dance floor for the girls that like to dance.  There is also a large outdoor open seating area with downstairs and upstairs.  This place is really like 3 clubs in one.  Service is hit or miss but expected like that for a busy weekend night in Scottsdale I guess.  Rock Lobster is a great 80s cover band, probalby the best I've ever heard and they are hear every Saturday.
