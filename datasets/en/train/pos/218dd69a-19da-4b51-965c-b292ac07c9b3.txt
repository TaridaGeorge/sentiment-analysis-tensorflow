I have yet to try something at Yoli's that I did not enjoy. The chorizo skillet, green eggs & ham omelet, French toast, and cheddar biscuits are just a few highlights. My bf & I have been going here for Sunday breakfast for over 6 months now, we love it...the courtyard, the food, the staff, the ladies singing in the kitchen! :) The only reason I hesitated before giving a 5 star review is the more people that try it, the less chance I have of getting my favorite window table on Sunday.
