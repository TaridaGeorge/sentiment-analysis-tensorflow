This place is AMAZING! I was driving by every couple days for a few weeks, waiting for it to open and it has definitely exceeded my expectations. I have been several times and tried most of their cupcakes with my family and each one is SO delicious! I highly recommend the banana nutella, my very favorite. Look out, Sprinkles!
