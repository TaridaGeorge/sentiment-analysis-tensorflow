Mido has become my go to place for sushi.  When we just want a lot of good food, the all you can eat option can't be beat.  Other times, their sashimi and the rolls not included in the special are also outstanding.  The staff is always attentive and quick to bring drink refills or put in orders for more food.  Both the sushi chefs and the servers are friendly and happy to insure everyone enjoys themselves.  Unlike a lot of sushi restaurants, Mido also has an excellent selection of other options on their menus, providing options for those poor souls who don't care for sushi.
