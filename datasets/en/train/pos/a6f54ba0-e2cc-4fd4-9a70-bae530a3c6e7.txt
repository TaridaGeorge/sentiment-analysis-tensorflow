From pork dumplings, fried eggplant, duck, softshell crab! What a variety. Took a while for the carts to roll our way but the place was packed on a Saturday at 11:30 and a line when we left. Authentic Dim Sum - you wont get a lot of help or translation so know what your in for aand have fun. The duck was the only dissapointment- had to hunt for the meat. The second cart coming around looked better- so hit or miss on that Im sure. They are open 11 - 11 and 1am Saturday.
