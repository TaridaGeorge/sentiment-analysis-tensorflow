I didn't realize Dilly's was a chain until I went to add my review to yelp. Dang! I though I had "discovered" this place! Ah well, the food still tastes as good. 

Dilly's bread is the bomb. Baked-before-your-eyes, this bread is the perfect combo of crusty outside and soft yummy goodness inside. The meat is Boar's Head and piled high. The soup is great, esp. the clam chowder, cream of broccoli and Wisconsin cheese. And even if it weren't, it's served in a bread bowl-- so who cares?
