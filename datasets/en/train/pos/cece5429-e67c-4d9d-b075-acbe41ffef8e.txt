You know how most chicks love Michael's?
Think of this place as the Michael's for dudes.

Aisle after aisle of craft beers. 
Handles of everything including Jager.
And when they say Total Wine, they're not kidding. I saw wines from practically every country in the world except maybe Somalia or those really sandy, oily countries. 

They even have a tasting room, which you'll want to get the schedule app'd into your Iphone like right now. 

If there was ever a Mecca for the budding alcoholic, this place is it. 
Well maybe not exactly Mecca, since you'll likely be facing south after coming here.
