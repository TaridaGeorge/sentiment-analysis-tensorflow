My favorite theater in the valley!  This place is so clean, it has leather seats, an option of DBOX seating (when th seats move to the movie, like a ride), and 3D!!  It is also great because NOBODY GOES HERE!!! HAHAHHAHAAAA!  The parking lot is also never full which is nice because I don't have to deal with 900 retards when I want to see a movie.
