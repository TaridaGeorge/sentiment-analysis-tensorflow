This place is a true hidden gem! We went there with my husband for dinner on a Friday night and couldn't be happier that we discovered it. A bottle of Chateau Saint Sulpice Bordeaux 2008 cost us $25, which is unheard of for a restaurant! Not to mention a 4 course meal for $15 (too much food for 1 person). 

The service was outstanding - you can tell how students were trying to impress their supervisor hehe. I'd recommend it without a doubt. 

The other nice thing is that it's on a 2nd floor with huge windows, overlooking scottsdale rd (not that it's a great scenery, just something different) - it gets romantic if you sit by the window.
