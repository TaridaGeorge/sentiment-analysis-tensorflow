Great beer. Some of the best around. My suggestion is the Devils Ale and Epicenter and they will do the rest for you.

My only gripe about this place is it can get loud, so you will have to speak up.

Food is always good and I suggest calling ahead to get your name in so you don't have to wait at the door.
