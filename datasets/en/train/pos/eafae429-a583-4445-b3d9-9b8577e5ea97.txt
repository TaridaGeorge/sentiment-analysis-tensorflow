LOVE this place. Lisa and her staff are always super friendly and welcoming. There has not been a single time when I have not been IN LOVE with the food. I have tried a ton of stuff on their menu and it is always fantastic. The atmosphere is just wonderful. If you have not tried this place you really are missing out. This is my favorite place in Phoenix!
