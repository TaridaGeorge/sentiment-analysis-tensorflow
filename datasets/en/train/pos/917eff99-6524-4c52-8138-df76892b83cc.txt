This place is the best!! I've been going here since it firsted opened as a bar and deli! Pasta is awesome, especially mama's lasagna! Debbi is the best bartender in the valley!! Always fast and friendly and a strong drink!! Enough TV's to make your head spin!! Im from Chicago and Id even give their pizza a thumbs-up! Go and enjoy - beware game nights are packed!!
