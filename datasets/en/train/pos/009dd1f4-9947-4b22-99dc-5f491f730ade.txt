Better than Pizzeria Bianco...NUF SAID!!! 

Seriously, this is one of my favorite places to dine in the valley, phoenix, arizona, um...anywhere for that matter. I've had some of the best pizza there is, from new york to chicago, italy and back. Cibo is my favorite. The service is always spot-on. The wine list smart, the appetizers tasty, salads luscious, deserts to die for, the location is adorable and of course the pizza is perfect! This place has palpable charm and the ambiance whether its quiet or busy is somehow always what you hoped for. Just writing this is making me change my plans for dinner tonight!
