-Open Wed-Sat. 10am-5pm.

-SUPER cute Romantic Shabby Chic shop with a Scrapbook store attached to it.

-The owners and employees are very friendly and helpful.

-I LOVE the home decor stuff they have, some Rachel Ashwell textiles/fabrics, etc. Plus, painted white furniture pieces (which were kind of pricey). 

-Cute Scrapbook merchandise, very Shabby and Vintage. Nice little rubber stamp section too.

-Cute Shabby Chic baby accessories and decor.

-Overall, this store is decorated very well.

-Parking is out front and has never been a problem.
