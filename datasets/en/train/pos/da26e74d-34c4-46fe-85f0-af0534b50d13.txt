The breathtaking White Tanks are located in the far west valley, some 15-20 miles north/northwest of Goodyear. I recently spent a half-day hiking the Ford Canyon trail, and looping around through the Willow Canyon trail for a total distance of 7.7 miles. The trails were among the best-marked and most well-maintained ones I've ever seen in Arizona. The scenery was exhilarating. At different points on my route I encountered typical Sonoran desert plains vegetation, pools of water, huge white granite slabs that give this range its name, an abandoned dam, what appeared to be an old miner's rusty spring bed and assorted other really old-looking stuff, and paths that ran along rolling hills without a soul in sight. This was truly one of the best hikes I've enjoyed in years.
