Went with rada  this evening and this place is starting to grow on me. Had three flavors; birthday cake, chocolate, and sample of the strawberry lemonade, topped with some yummy rainbow sprinkles. 

This place is much better than that nasty, sticky floored, crappy toppings, and quick melting yougurt, YOUGURTLAND in Tempe...
