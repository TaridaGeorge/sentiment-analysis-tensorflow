My sister and I had a really lovely lunch here the week before Christmas.  The hostess noted that I was wearing dark denim and gave me a black napkin as she seated me so I wouldn't leave with white lint on my jeans.  What service!

We had the brie appetizer, two different salads, and split the blueberry cobbler.  All were excellent.  We went back just to try the lemon meringue pie the next day as carry out and it did not disappoint! 

If you're staying at the Westin across the street, this place is better in terms of service, pricing, and food quality than the couple restaurants I tried on the hotel grounds.
