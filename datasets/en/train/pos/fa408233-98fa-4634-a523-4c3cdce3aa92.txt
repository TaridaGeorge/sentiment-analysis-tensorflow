The Paper Studio is a fabulous place.  They have beautiful paper and a variety of wonderful products for the crafter.  They have lots of 7 gypsies stuff (a personal favorite) and a wonderful selection of rub-ons.  

I must say I was shocked to read the reviews about getting bad service- every time I have been there, it has been wonderful.  it is owned by a couple and usually one of them works in the back and the other is out front helping out.  It might have something to do with the fact that they were robbed (electronic hardware only) fairly recently?  I know that had them backed up as they lost all of their templates and whatnot.  

If you are an artist/crafter, and can appreciate beautiful paper and craft items, this is a must do!
