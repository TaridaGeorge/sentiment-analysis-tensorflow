I really enjoy this place. It is usually busy but we still find a place to sit.
I almost always order the NYer with pastrami on rye. Just too yummy. I have on occasion order other foods and yeah it is all good.
One thing that does sort of freak me out is when I get in line and it is my turn to order the guy taking the order always alerts his co-workers to look at me and they mutter in Spanish quickly and then smile and go back to business. It has happened every time I have been to this or any other location. I know why they are looking but they are so blatant it is strange. Oh and yeah some white guys understand Spanish too.
