Amazing place!  The food is spectacular - the atmosphere wonderful.  The food is "clean" not mucked up.  The staff is great.  Poolside lunch is great too!  And they dont sweat you for being a "local" to enjoy the pool/resort!  This is my favorite resort in Scottsdale, hands down!  Mainly because I don't feel like I am in Scottsdale!  Love this place!
