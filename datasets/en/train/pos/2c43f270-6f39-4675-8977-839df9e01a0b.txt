I called Erik when I was concerned that my computer had spyware, viruses, etc.   We set up a home appointment and he arrived on time.   He was very knowledgeable and patient in answering all my myriad questions.   I have trust issues with anybody getting into my computer, but Erik put me at ease and proved to be a very good resource.   I highly recommend him.
