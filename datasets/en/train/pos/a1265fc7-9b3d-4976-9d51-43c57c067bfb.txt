Huge, delicious portions at an incredible value. I'm hooked.

I really enjoy the egg rolls. The pho is delicious, and you can trick it out with the crazy assortment of sauces and condiments available at every table.

The lemongrass tofu is very good. My favorite menu item so far is the utterly divine wonton soup, with a wonderfully rich broth, tasty wontons and a great variety of vegetables all striking the perfect balance of tender and crisp.

The interior is clean, including the bathrooms. The service is good - our waitress remembered our drink and heat-level preferences after our first visit! And has brought us a free dessert every visit! I can't help but feel taken care of, both in her concern for my enjoyment and in the freshness and high quality of the food served to me.
