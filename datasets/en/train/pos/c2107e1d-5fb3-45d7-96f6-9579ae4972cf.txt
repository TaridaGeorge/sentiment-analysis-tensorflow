So after reading the reviews I made it my mission to come to this restaurant. I wanted dinner but bc of scheduling issues with my friends we decided on a bday brunch on Sunday. I am so glad we made it!! The food was AMAZING and Chef Chris was awesome. This place is a must do for any "foodie." I can't wait to go back. Schedule your reservations as soon as you can bc this place books up fast which is no doubt because of the pure awesomeness of it. I already have 2 reservations for dinner this month!  Thanks Chef for a great bday celebration. Yours truly, the bday girl from the table of women who of course love bacon. Lol!!!
