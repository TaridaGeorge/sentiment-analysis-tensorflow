This is not your regular DIVEY Vietnamese joint.  If I want that I'll go to Da VANG, where truth be told I'm afraid to go to their bathroom, but enough about that.  Cyclo has the best seafood crab soup! The spicy green beans are amazing and yes Justina is half the reason to go.  The prices are higher but the quality is BETTER.  There are so many things on this menu that I love.... the cake noodles are the BEST!
