Outstanding! - I hit Durants again last night for the new date's birthday and Its going to be hard to think of a negative thing to say. Everything from the entrance to the decor and lighting  to the incredible food and wine was perfect. Shrimp cocktail, bisque, steaks and a great dessert..there is nothing else to say.
