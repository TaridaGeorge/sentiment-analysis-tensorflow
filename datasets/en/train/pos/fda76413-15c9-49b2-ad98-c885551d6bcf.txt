I absolutely love this place!!!  Prompt and friendly service, great atmosphere and AWESOME food.  You cannot beat it.  This is our favorite place for date nights.  We recently went during happy hour and can't wait to go back.  Their happy hour specials are great.  The food is just incredible, we've tried several items on the menu and they are alll good.  Their mojitos are to die for, hands down the best in Phoenix.
