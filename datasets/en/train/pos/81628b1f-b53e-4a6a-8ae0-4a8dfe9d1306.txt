I have to say I am very impressed with Smart & Final. Time after time they deliver. And best yet, they have SALES on already discounted wholesale items. 

I find the oddest, hard to find foods there too! So if you have been searching high and low for that speciality item, try looking here. They just might have it.

I buy filet mignon from here too and I have to say that their meats have always been fresh, good quality meat - at prices lower than other wholesale markets that we shop.

Even better yet, is the quick in & out time. I never have to deal with crowds or long lines. It is quick, comfortable and affordable shopping.
