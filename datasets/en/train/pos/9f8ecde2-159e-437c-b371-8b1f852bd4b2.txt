It's official ... I love The Herb Box. Been here for lunch, been here for brunch, you can't go wrong.  There are still quite a few things on their menu I want to try... Blue cheese stuffed Queen Creek olives? Yes please!  Their smoked gouda mac n cheese is super tasty and I'm not even a mac n cheese fan.  Those crispy fingerling potatoes are to die for!  Their brunch offers red velvet pancakes which are delectable... The Chilequiles were some of the best I've had. Oh! Did I mention you can do bottomless mimosas or bloodies with an entree for $24 at brunch?  
It's a yum-yum-yummy option any day!
