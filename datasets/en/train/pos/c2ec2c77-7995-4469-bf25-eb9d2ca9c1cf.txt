I visited here again in September and was wowed once more.  The service is great, everyone is very friendly and they take the time to talk with you and truly seem to be interested in what you have to say.

I visited on a Thursday and had the daily special, the meatloaf. This was seriously the best meatloaf I have ever had... just exploding with taste.  I am going back on a Thursday again!
