Hooked me up for FREE! Thanks guy, you rock!

So, my tire went flat. I pump it up and head straight there. Its Lunch hour, but they take my car in within 5 min. 20 or so min later its all over. Fixed where air was coming from, balanced and even put in a new valve. I was gonna pay them, of course but got waived away - "Do not worry about it, have a nice day." WOW Like seriously! Super quick and did not wanna charge me nothing. How can you not appreciate that?

All the stars!

"I Like"
"Very nice"
