Sakana in Mesa is my favorite restaurant ever!  Why, not only is the sushi so fresh and amazing, the staff is what makes me want to return again and again.  Dai is always there serving up his artwork displayed in his sushi, Nan is always happy to greet her guests, they are like family!  The house smoked salmon is fantastic, its all fantastic.  If you can, sit at the bar and let Dai serve you!
