I love Z Pizza so much it is almost always our Tuesday night meal plan (because of the buy one pizza get the 2nd for 5$. used to be free but still a great value,). My favorites are the Mexican, the Zbq with the thai being a close third. I have ordered from this location and the one on Hayden and they are both good but this one edges the Hayden one out I think. I want to branch out and try more but I'm so hooked it makes it really tough to change! 
We always order 2 mediums and have them for dinner and lunch the following day! So yummy!
