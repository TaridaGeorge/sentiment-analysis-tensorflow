Somehow, I have neglected to review Postino Arcadia... so let me correct that mistake.  And now that there are 300+ positive reviews on here -- this is just to pile on the love.

Love the atmosphere
Love the food (the bruschetta! my mouth is watering now...)
Love the friendly service
Love the location
Love live music (though it can disrupt conversations)
 
The only "don't Love"?  Parking.  
But that is a small price to have a nice spot to enjoy food with friends.
