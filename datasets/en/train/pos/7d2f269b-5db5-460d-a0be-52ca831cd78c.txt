For fantastic food, personal service and charming eclectic ambience this place satisfies 100%.   I always give myself plenty of time to savor the experience, particularly if the weather is nice enough to enjoy the outside patio.  Christopher serves up such fresh and unusual fare I let him choose what he wants to make for us.  This man is an artist in every way, so bring your friends, a bottle of wine or two and enjoy being treated to delicious and artfully prepared food.   Your faith in the goodness of life will be restored and you be plotting your return!
