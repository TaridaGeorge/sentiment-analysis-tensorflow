My husband and I just moved to the Gilbert area, so we weren't sure where to go for a dentist. Boy, did we luck out when trying this dentist. Dr. Neilson was fabulous. He offers Saturday appointments about once per month, so he saw us on Saturday morning. He was super thorough, pleasant, and extremely concerned about our comfort. He explained everything he was doing, even though it was a routine cleaning. He discovered a chipped tooth and asked if I wanted it filled. He was not pushy about getting it done since it was a small chip, and even offered to do it that day (which I went ahead and did). I felt like he truly cared about my husband and I and our dental health.

We hope to be life long patients of this great dentist!
