This was my first time hiking the WHOLE thing today..I must say it was a gorgeous, challenging and perfect hike trail. It is very well maintained and even though I am a total dog lover, I think it is wonderful that they aren't allowed to keep Pinnacle Peak as beautiful as it can be. Bring a lot of water, camera, and if you go in the middle of the day like I did- SUNSCREEN! It was breathtaking views from all angles, enjoy!
