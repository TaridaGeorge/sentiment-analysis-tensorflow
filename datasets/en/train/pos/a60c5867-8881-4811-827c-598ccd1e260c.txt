I get an italian sub from here practically every day, they're awesome. So are their southwest chicken salad wraps and their cucumber chicken wraps with caesar dressing. And, the chicken salad croiisant sandwiches, though it seems those were just a test run cuz I only saw them for a week or 2. 5 bucks for one of those, a drink and some chips, a good deal and a quick healthy lunch, nothing wrong with that!
