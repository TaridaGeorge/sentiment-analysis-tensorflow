The best hamburgers ever!!! Forget going to chain hamburger places like Five Guys or even In N Out...if you want a juicy hamburger cooked on a real grill, this is the place! My dad came here when he went to ASU and passed this restaurant along to me! I always get the small hamburger, because even the regular hamburger is wayy too big! Plus an order of onion rings, zuchhini, or mushrooms completes the meal!
