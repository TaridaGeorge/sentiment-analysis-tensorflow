Mmmmmmm......sushi.

I wish the economy would turn back around for the specific reason that I would be able to increase my visits to Yasu.  

The blackened cod is friggin unbelievable.

I pretty much order sashimi here, always fresh, delicious.  I rate a sushi restaurant based on the sashimi, and yasu is top notch.  

Definitely order 'chef's choice' for a delicious surprise treat.

One thing about Phoenix is that you can find a little gem like this tucked away in a strip mall between Circle K and the Army Recruitment office.  Totally weird if you're from a big city.  But totally awesome when you find one.
