Great park geared towards younger children. The park is large enough to host a picnic or family gathering, and the grounds are well kept. The main attraction, obviously, are the railroads and trains. Prices are really affordable ($2-$4 per ride), the kids get a big kick out of riding around the park on a "real" engine locomotive. We took our 11 month old and she had a blast. There's also a railroad museum but we didn't have time to check that out. It's a great place to spend part of a day, especially when the weather is nice.
