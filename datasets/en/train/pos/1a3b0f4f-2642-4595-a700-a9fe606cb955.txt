Great place.  Sandwiches are fresh and use good ingredients I LOVE the itialian with everything but Jalapenos.  But Gyros are also great and my wife likes you can dress them with whatever toppings you like.  Owners are friendly and its nice to have a great little ma and pa place around still that gives great service and great food.
