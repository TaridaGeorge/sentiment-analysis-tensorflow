Otto is on a roll - a very big pizza roll. For only 9 bucks, I received a monster meal that in my case had chicken, mushrooms, tomatoes and mozzarella cheese inside the incredible fresh pizza dough. All of this was served with a side of marinara. The crust was perfectly cooked with some slight burn marks and the inside was even better with all the fresh ingredients and tons of white meat chicken chunks. The entire thing (see photo) barely fit into their small pizza box, so unless your famished like I was, then your looking at tomorrow's lunch also. The menu covers most Italian favorites, so it will be nice to try the calzones or pasta next, but those rolls are what is going to keep me coming back (3 other varieties available). The greek with mozz, spinach, tomato, feta and garlic might be next.
