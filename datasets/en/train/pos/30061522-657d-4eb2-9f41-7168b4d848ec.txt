This place has amazing pizza and great service. I've been 3 times and have not been disappointed. We've come for mostly group events such as bdays and going away parties, and you can do family style and share or get individual portions. Bruschetta and breadsticks are great starters, and I love the signature spinach pizza. Our waitress suggested getting it crispy to avoid getting soggy spinach and I'm glad I took the suggestion! Coworkers got Chicago style calzone with au jus and raved about it. Since there was a bday they comped a canoli and gave us an extra one for being cool :) pitchers are also half off on Thursday's so 7 bucks for 4+ glasses worth of fat tire made us all extremely happy!
