I'm not a fan of sushi in general, but there are a few things I will eat, as long as it's chicken or salmon... and cooked. That being said, my review doesn't necessarily hold any weight, but I just wanted to give props to the Happy Hour crew for tolerating my coworkers and me on a random ladies night out! Special shout-out to the Las Vegas Rolls for being as scrumptious as the menu described. :)
