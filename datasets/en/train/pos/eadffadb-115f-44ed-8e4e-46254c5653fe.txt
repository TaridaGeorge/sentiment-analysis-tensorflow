Pita Jungle is one of my all time favourites. We loooove going to this one in particular. The service is wonderful, all the waiters are extremely down to earth, smile, and make you feel like they're your friends instead of just bringing to you what you pay for.

Their prices can be somewhat spendy, nevertheless, I must say that if the food and service is outstanding as it is here, I don't mind paying whatever the ticket is.  

Very good environment for friend gatherings, families and dates. In fact, we had our first date here :). Love it.

Love their Pistacho covered Tuna salad, and their BBQ Glazed Chicken Pizza among others. Highly Recommended.
