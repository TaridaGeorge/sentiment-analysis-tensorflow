HOT DIGGITY.... Wait should I say COLD DIGGITY!?! Ha ha ha

I was so excited when I walked in and found a VERY nice staff of Ladies looking to help a Gelato Newb! The ladies let me try MULTIPLE flavors of Gelato AND Sorbet! 

Most of the time when you can sample at an establishment you get this vibe after 2 flavors that you need to hurry up... NOT HERE! They want you to be happy with what you purchase... at least thats was the vibe I got! 

Whenever I try a new place I always ask "Whats your Favorite or What do you Recommend" & I got some FANTASTIC Recommendations! 

My recommendation: Try, Try, Try before you buy!
