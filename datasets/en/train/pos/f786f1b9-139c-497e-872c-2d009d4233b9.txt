After all of the recent rains, my car was looking less than wonderful.  Pretty bad, actually.  While I like/prefer to wash my own cars (I am pretty picky about these things), there hasn't been time.  Too many fun things to do on the weekends!  Car wash, here we come...

I was pleasantly surprised to find out this morning that Classic Car Spa is offering an "early bird" special - Monday through Thursday from 7:30 - 9am you will receive $5 off any wash!  As an added bonus, at 7:45 there wasn't a wait - I was in and out of there in less than 20 minutes!

A shiny clean car is a good way to start the week.
