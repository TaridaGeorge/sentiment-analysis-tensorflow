Best tucked away spot in Arcadia. I go there for the friendly bartenders, cool crowd and best wings in PHX. You need to order "The Works" wings (secret menu) Julio is the cook and he does a great job! You will find JT sitting at the bar usualyy drinking with the patrons. There's a juke box and great daily specials such as: 2 for 1 burgers on Tuesdays. A can't miss spot.
