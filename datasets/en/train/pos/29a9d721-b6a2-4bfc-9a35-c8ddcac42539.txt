For those of the shoe-addicted variety, DSW is your heaven.  Almost any type of shoe you want can be found.  Black patent leather flats?  No problem.  Formal strappy wedding shoes?  Also no problem since I got mine from a DSW!  I love their clearance section.  You can pick up some really good deals for shoes that are still very fashionable.  I got 40% off of some black leather riding boots today in the clearance section even though they were selling the exact same model and color for their regular price in the boots area of the store.  Service is exceptional at this store, from the cashier at the counter to the manager on duty.  All in all, a good place to feed your shoe addiction.
