Tried this for dinner again last night...

This is such a good, healthy meal and at such a reasonable price. The ingredients are so fresh and the experience of getting it right off the grill is really cool. Dinner was exactly $10 each and included the drink, tax, etc... 

The atmosphere here is nice for $10 meals. Lunch and dinner rush can get a little hectic.
