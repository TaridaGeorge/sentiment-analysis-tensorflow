Love this store!! They have everything from produce, ingredients and meat! The produce is always fresh. The meat is good and priced very well and they have good seafood also!! They also have lots of ingredients and seasonings from many different nationalities! I'm Puerto Rican and they have a whole aisle of 'GOYA' products!!! So I'm able to get my PR seasonings and buy my meats and produce in one trip. And if I'm hungry then i can stop @ their in-store restaurant & eat some good Hong Kong food! =P 
Highly recommended!! =)
