What I love about Grazie....

1) It's in the old town area so you can go out after, but not  an "old town touristy"  restaurant which I like.
2) Sunday wine tasting!!!  Usually around $20 and you get apps, maybe 5 tastings and to sit outside.
3) Sausage bruschetta
4) You can enjoy the company of your friends without getting hassled to eat & leave.
5) Nutella calzone with vanilla bean ice cream!!! love love love
