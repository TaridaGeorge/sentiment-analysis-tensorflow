We leased our Volvo here from Licia 3 years ago (fantastic experience compared with our other car buying endeavors).  Now that my lease is almost up, I've been looking for a car to replace it and also considered buying my existing car.

When I called Licia to ask her opinion, she was extraordinarily helpful and actually suggested I not buy or lease a new car from her since buying my car outright made a lot more sense.  Then she transferred me to Judd in servicing to explain the warranty I would be getting from the other company so I could make an informed decision.

If Licia, Judd and Powell Volvo are the standard, the rest of the Phoenix dealerships need a wakeup call.
