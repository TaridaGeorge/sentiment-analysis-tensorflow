WOW--What a cool concept! They have a humongous, funky retail space, thats maybe half full of vintage fatigues.....old school soda bar....produce stand....home accessories & nic nacs etc..... On the other side there's an eclectic old bar that was transported to AZ from a Chicago jazz club(Super cool), old timey cocktails & beers.....The Margarita was a bit too tart(due to--too much "fresh lime juice"-def ask for a lil extra agave nectar) but the brisket sliders were to die for & the Noodle Krugel (SP.) was by far, one of the most amazing  mouth experiences I've had in a while!!! Thank you Ellen for the Suggestion!! On in all--super cool new DT Hangout spot! Ooooooooh & apparently on Wednesday nights their doing a "60's themed party" with funky decor & drink specials-they suggest coming in costume! I dig it!
