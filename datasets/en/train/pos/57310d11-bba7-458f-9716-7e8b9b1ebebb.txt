When I needed a realtor for my rental property I hired Cynthia.  In all of the years I have been leasing I have never had such a well qualified renter thanks to her.  She made the process stress free and had my place rented in less than 30 days with a one-year lease!  Cynthia is an expert when it comes to how to market your property and make it more attractive to potential renters.  She took goregous photos and posted my lisiting on several websites so I would get the most exposure and qualified applicants.  I will rely on Cynthia for all of my future real estate transactions.
