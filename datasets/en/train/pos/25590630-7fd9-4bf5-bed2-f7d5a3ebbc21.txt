I love living in the same neighborhood as this bar.  As a new dad, I don't get out to the bars much anymore, but I'm happy to come here when I get the chance.

Owned by the one time owner of TT Roadhouse, this place is dark, clean, comfortable, not particularly divey in my book (I think of it as kinda fancy for the area).  

Excellent juke box, clean bathrooms, dark as hell, and I've always had excellent service here.

Solid 5.
