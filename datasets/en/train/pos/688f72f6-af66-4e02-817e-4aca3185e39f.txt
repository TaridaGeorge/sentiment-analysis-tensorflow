Whole Foods rocks! I love going there to check out their fresh and wide variety of produce and admire their amazing desserts. My fave purchases at this store are the 3.99 2 pack of ciabatta bread made daily (great for making garlic bread) and their 2.99 wine. I know right, 2.99 for a bottle of wine? But Whole Foods makes it work and I pick up a bottle of merlot every time.: D
