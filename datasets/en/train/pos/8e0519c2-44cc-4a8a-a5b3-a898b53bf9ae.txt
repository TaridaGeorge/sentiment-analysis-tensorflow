I am in love with Echo Coffee. It's tucked away in an unassuming strip mall in Scottsdale that you likely wouldn't notice if you weren't looking for it, which adds to Echo's charm. The small coffee shop serves up delicious drinks and a great menu of lunchtime classics and snacks that are sure to please. 

I showed up for the first time on a day when the power had been out in the store for most of the morning. It had just come back on and the staff were friendly as can be. I must say, my favorite part was the soundtrack playing in the background, which featured some of the best mellow, coffee shop music I've experienced in town. It's a great place to meet a friend, study, or settle in on the comfy sofas with a good book and some comfort food. I'd definitely recommend this place!
