This is an awesome venue for concerts.  We went to the Metal event held on Friday December 17th.  Several great Metal bands played.  Plenty of parking in the private lot.

There is plenty of seating/standing room inside, and there is an inside/outside stage.  The outside has tons of seating/ standing room.  

The staff was soooooooooo friendly, helpful and attentive.  The waitstaff, bartenders, and security were GREAT!  It was such a pleasant experience, we will definitely be back for more concerts/ events.  

Women - the bathrooms are very, very clean!  plenty of toilet paper/ paper towels, locking stall doors.  LOL.
