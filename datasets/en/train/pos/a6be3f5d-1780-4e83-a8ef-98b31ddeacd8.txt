Our non-profit organization solicited four bids for our full-color brochures when we needed to re-order. We were very satisfied with a previous order A&J Graphics had printed, and were happy that his bid again came in lower than the other three. The quality couldn't be better: vivid color, sharp impressions, neat folds. The work was done quickly, delivered to my door, and carefully packaged. I will recommend A&J to anyone looking for an excellent printer at a fair price.
