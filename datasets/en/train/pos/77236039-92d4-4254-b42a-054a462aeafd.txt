Now this is a hike more my style.  It's quick (maybe 30 minutes up), well marked, and there are a lot of people around with cell phones if disaster strikes.  I heard it was aptly nicknamed "Nature's Stairclimber." For sure.

I'm not sure what's wrong with those people running down it.  Perhaps they have an early death wish.  I stop, move over, and let the crazies run past.  No need to spend more time near them than is absolutely necessary.

If I did this every morning, I'd surely have a gymnast's ass.  But I'm lazy and will choose to do it from time to time when I feel I need a lift.
