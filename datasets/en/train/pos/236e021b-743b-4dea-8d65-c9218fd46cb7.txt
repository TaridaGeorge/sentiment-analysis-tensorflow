Sanctum is the place to be in central Phoenix on a Wednesday night. Its goth themed interior and hot bartenders are definately a huge plus! I tend to join my friend on Wednesday who loves to dress in the goth clothes, I dont however... I just go in club clothes. Its very inviting staff and customers make you feel in place. The music switches to 80's and some goth... its somewhere that you WILL know a song here and there. LOL Drinks reasonably priced. Beer was like $4. 

The art in this bar is SIMPLY AMAZING! Check it out!!
