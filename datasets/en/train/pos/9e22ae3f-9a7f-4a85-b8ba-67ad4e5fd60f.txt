I am now on Team Jessica. Walk-in appt. and they seated me instantly. Thebfirst thing I noticed was that this place was spotless. Jessica quickly made me comfy with some bottled water and mags to read. Foot massage, sugar scrub, neck/shoulder masage and then on to my mani. I have been wanting to try the new shellac method and decided it was a go.i decided on a color (they are limited but I Bet more colors will come soon). End result: ECSTATIC. Total was $45 for both. Had I decided on a regular mani it would have been $35. Everyone was very nice and attentive. I am definitely coming back.
