I'm not exactly sure why this place isn't packed on a 112 degree day like today. The paletas are so delicious! We just happened upon the place because we parked in front of it. After our afternoon activities in the sun, a frozen treat sounded so good, and man did this place hit the spot!

No short cuts with their product here. The fruit is fresh and the flavors are bold and well-blended. I got the mango con chili which had just the right amount of heat. Hubby got the Mora (blackberry with lavender) and it was delicious! So fresh!

Great customer service too. Very warm and friendly and she even offered to pack our treats in ice if we wanted to eat them later.

Price is on point. We got 2 paletas for $5. Great spot. Can't wait to return.
