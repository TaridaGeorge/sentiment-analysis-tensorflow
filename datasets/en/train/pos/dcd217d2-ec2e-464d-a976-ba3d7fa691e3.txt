I like this twice-a-week farmers' market quite a bit.  It contributed to my decision to purchase the condo that I did.  I can see it from my window.  8am rolls around every Saturday morning and I roll out of bed and walk across the street to check out the week's offerings.  It does die down quite a bit in the summers - that's expected.  (I do hope Nuna and the soap lady come back in the fall!)  But adjusting for seasonality, it seems to be getting bigger and bigger, which excites me  :)
