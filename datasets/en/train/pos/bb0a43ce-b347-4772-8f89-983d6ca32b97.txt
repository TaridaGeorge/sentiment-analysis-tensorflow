First off, let's get this out of the way...I'm Cambodian and I was so excited to hear Phoenix had a Cambodian restaraunt when I moved here...

After a job interview one day, I decided to come here for lunch...Place is a little small, so you might drive past it a couple times before finding it.

When I walked in, I was greeted by a waiter who was wearing traditional Cambodian clothes...Pretty cool...

I decided to get the Khmer BBQ rice platter. It came with 2 beef skewers, 2 chicken wings, pickled carrots/radish salad, 1 eggroll and rice. It was delicious...It felt like home cooking to me.

The only complaint I have is that it left me hungry still. The portions could be bigger but the prices are very cheap here so I guess it works.

I'll definitely be coming back sometime soon when I miss my mom's cooking.
