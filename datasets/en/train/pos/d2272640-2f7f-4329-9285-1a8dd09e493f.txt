I've always driven past them until a few months back and havent gone any place else ever since. I never go to the same place twice in a row simply because i really dont care about my haircuts and its pretty simple. I've been to the ones in paradise valley and supercuts, its really not something I think about... until I started going here. Now this place is nice. The people are friendly, they do their best to accommodate you and are very very good at what they do ! 5 stars !
