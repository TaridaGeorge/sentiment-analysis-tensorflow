Finally checked this place out during the Melrose Street Fair last week.  The selection is UNBELIEVABLE!  I even told them I would work for free on weekends!  Like High Fidelity!
There is vinyl.  Lots of vinyl.  I wish I still have my record player.  That's right.  I don't say turntable :P  I'm old skool.
The CD collection was awesome!  Went there with a male friend, same age as I am.  We kept shouting out "Holy crap, The Tubes!"  And "OMG they have Black Flag!"
Prices are very reasonable.  Staff is super-friendly.
GO THERE!
