Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.  Yea, it's got a similar feeling, but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.  The massaging chairs, pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.  And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping, it's a great place for them to just hang out too!  (Trust me - this works.)
