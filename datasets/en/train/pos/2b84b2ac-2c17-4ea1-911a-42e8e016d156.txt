Never a bad meal at Goldmans! The BEST matzo soup, I come whenever anybody I know is sick - like the saying goes, it's jewish penicillin! Stopped in there today for some to help ease a sore throat and I am feeling better already! :) they have a very extensive menu, all very tasty. They have wonderful baked goods, including delicious bagels and bialys! The restaurant is family owned and they always remember me, ask about my dog, who I brought on their patio 1 time 3 years ago, they really just make me feel good about patronizing a local business.
