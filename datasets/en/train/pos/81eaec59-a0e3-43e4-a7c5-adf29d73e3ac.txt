We had a great experience here.  We were suprised to have authentic Japanese sashimi, sushi, and appetizers in Arizona.  The sashimi was fresh.  Really enjoyed the Aji (Spanish Mackerel), Hamachi (Yellow tail), and other fish.  If your in town and love sashimi and sushi, this may be the best choice in the Phoenix, Scottsdale, AZ area.  Enjoy -!
