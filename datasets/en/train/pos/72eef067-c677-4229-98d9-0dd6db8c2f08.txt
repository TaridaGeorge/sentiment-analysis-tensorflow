BONE IN!  
Hands down, the best steak around.  
Get an order of sauteed mushrooms to go with it, you won't be sorry.  
The bar high tops are a great place to eat if you're not looking for the sit down experience.  The dining area is very nice, but I have a hard time being sat back there when I'm with my buddy looking for a stellar piece of meat and a stiff cocktail.  The service is great and Thurs - Sat evenings will host a good crowd in the bar.  The live music is a great touch too.  

Two words...Bone In.  Make it happen.  Period.
