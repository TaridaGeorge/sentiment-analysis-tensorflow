It's a no nonsense ma & pa kind of place with good food.

First things first: If you're perception of Japanese Cuisine is "Sushi and Hibachi" then this is probably NOT the place for you. The sushi selection is not extensive, they're more focused on Traditional Japanese Cusine.

The restaurant is not asthetically pleasing, it has a 1980's feel to it, but the food is everything you're looking for and more! 

It's totally worth stopping by if you're homesick for japanese food.
