My favorite spa in the world, this place is magic.

The staff is wonderful, and as soon as you walk in it transports you to a different place and pace. The robes and slippers immediately feel like heaven, and I could've just hung out all day in the waiting room sipping on their homemade limeade.

I had the la stone massage and a scrub over the week or so that I stayed at the Westin Kierland, and I still dream of this place.
