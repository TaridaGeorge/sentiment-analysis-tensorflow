I really liked this location!  The coffee is good...the same as any other location but I felt really comfy here. The place wasn't packed but they were busy. People coming and going constantly. I noticed that the people going there were definitely regulars as the staff knew everyone's name that walked in the door. Even though they knew their customers, it never interrupted the flow of traffic in there. The customers waiting never had to stand and wait because the barista was catching up with the regulars.
