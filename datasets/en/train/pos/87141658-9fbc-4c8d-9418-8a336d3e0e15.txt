This facility is excellent in every way from the staff to the cleanliness. From day one I knew this was a top notch rehab when my physical therapist spent two hours with me, getting to know my history, going through basic stretching, even getting a massage! I thought the massage was a one time occurrence but it is a standard part of each therapy session. My therapist is extremely knowledgable, thorough, helpful,and caring. I have noticed that in all of the other therapists as well. The assistants are friendly and professional and get to know everyone on a first name basis which of course makes you feel right at home. I am going to be sad when my therapy comes to a close! Highly recommend to anyone that has back problems or has had back surgery.
