I just went to their new shop downtown. I'm so glad it's only a block away from my work! 

I bought an oreo cupcake for myself and a french toast cupcake for my intern. We both thought they were AMAZING! The cookies look great too, and I can't wait to try the pie and coffee happy hour on Wednesdays!

Thank you treehouse bakery! I will be back.
