Tracy is the MAN. you should go see him if anything ever happens to your car. 

He might possibly be the nicest, most professional, honest man. 

I can't tell you how many times i have done something stupid to my car. And about 90% of the time I end up at Tracy's. 

I am a bargain shopper and Tracy always gives me the best quotes. My car looks PERFECT when I get it back. 

The last time I used Scottsdale Paint and Auto Body because Lexus told me it was important to go there but I think they might have some deal going with them or something. Take your car to Tracy instead. You won't regret it.
