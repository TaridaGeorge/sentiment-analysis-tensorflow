I have been to Sweet Tomatoes at least 30 times. Does this compare to a great steakhouse for dinner, well no... But guess what this is a Salad Bar. And this is the best salad bar in town. I dare you to find a salad bar where you can get 107 different items for your salad, 5 different soups, a taco bar, a pasta bar, a desert bar. I'm sorry but the people on Yelp need to learn how to review something. If you are reviewing a salad bar you have to review it against other salad bars not gourmet Italian Restaurants. There is no way you can say the good things you say about this place and then give it only 4 stars. This is a 5 STAR SALAD BAR.
