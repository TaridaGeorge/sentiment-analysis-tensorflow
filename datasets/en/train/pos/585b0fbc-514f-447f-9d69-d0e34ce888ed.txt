We've been to San Tan Brewery probably 30 times since it opened.  We love it!  It's got an urban vibe and a good mix of clientele.  Great beer; great atmosphere - almost always busy - but there's a lot of seating, so we've never had to wait for a table unless we wanted to sit outside on a nice day.  With very few exceptions, the waitstaff is usually very friendly and attentive, but not too much so.  For a brew pub, their food is outstanding!  We love the jalapeno caesar salad, the chandler street tacos, the la hamburgesa (sp?), the fried chicken, and many other entrees.  Right now they have a seasonal brew called Negro Nitron which is outstanding!  Get it now before it's gone!
