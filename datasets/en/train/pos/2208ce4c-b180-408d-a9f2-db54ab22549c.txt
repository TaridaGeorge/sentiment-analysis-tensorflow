Soooo glad to see Yogurtland come to the Phoenix area. This is my favorite yogurt place in LA. It's a do-it-yourself place with about 14 flavors every day, some regular and some tart. They have amazing yogurt (some of my favorites are tiramisu, Butterfinger, bananas foster, black cherry tart, pineapple tart) and great toppings (fresh fruit, cheescake pieces, cookie dough pieces, granola, sprinkles, candy, etc.). And the best part is that it's 30 cents per ounce, so you can get a pretty big serving for about $5. Now, Yogurtland, please add another location further north in Scottsdale, and I'll be a very happy man.
