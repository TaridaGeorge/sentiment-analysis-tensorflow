I really enjoy Flemings.  From the bar area to the dining room, this place is great.  We started with drinks - I enjoyed a couple Ten and Tonics.  The service in the bar was prompt and courteous.

For appetizers, we ordered the Flemings Potatoes (starch, cheese, jalapenos) - what could be better?  We also tried some green bean and asparagus.  These didn't survive the trip around the table.  I skipped the salad and concentrated on my fillet and baked potato.

Other than one of the servers spilling my client's steak on the floor, the service was great.  I'll still give them five stars.  No sweat.  He was very apologetic and they turned around another steak very quickly.

Their creme brulee is awesome!!

If Fleming is on your list to try, don't wait.  Great food and atmosphere.
