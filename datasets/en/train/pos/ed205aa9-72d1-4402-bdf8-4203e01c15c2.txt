Outstanding, a real gem!

We were in Goodyear AZ for 5 days. We found The Black Bear through a Yelp Breakfast search and didn't see a point in trying any place else. Great food and great service. We had Breakfast there every day.From the homemade corn beef hash and sausages to the biscuits all are OUTSTANDING!
