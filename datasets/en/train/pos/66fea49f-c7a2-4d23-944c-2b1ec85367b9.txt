Classic, Friendly Neighborhood Restaurant & Bar...John welcomes you and the slightly twisted southern menu surprises & delights. Their fried chicken & waffles are legendary. I crave their watermelon salad, lust after the stuffed medjool dates and miss their Oyster Po-Boy's tangy deliciousness. The atmosphere is perfection and the food is a close second. 

If you are on a diet, this may not be a good choice.. The mac & cheese especially with lobster a diet killer. If you're being good don't despair, the salads are amazing. This week, I love the baby lettuce with fennel, avocado, & pomegranite/orange vinaigrette. If you want to drink your dinner, the wine selection is affordable and robust. Don't be shy - just ask for recommendations.
