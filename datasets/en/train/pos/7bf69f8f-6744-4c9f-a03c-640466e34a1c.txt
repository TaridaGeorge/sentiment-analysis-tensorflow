Awesome BBQ!  This is a great place for BBQ if your in the area.  We used to drive to Cave Creek for BBQ, but now we have a second place to choose from!

There ribs are wet and cooked to perfection.  They have really good pulled pork, beans and home made fries.  We also liked their brisket and baked beans.  The only thing we did not like was their fried Mac N Cheese.  It was a little bland and needed the BBQ sauce to dip it in.

This is a a great place to go!
