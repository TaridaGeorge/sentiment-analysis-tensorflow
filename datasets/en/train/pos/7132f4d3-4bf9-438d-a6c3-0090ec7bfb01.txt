This place was a phantom for months for me.  My family lives down in Arizona and I'm up in the Seattle area.  Every time that I went down there it would be closed and I refused to go to the Scottsdale location.  I wanted the original =) After about 5-6 attempts to get here I finally made it.  I ordered KK's (3pc chick, giant waffles, grits, and eggs) and let me tell you.  I beasted up that whole plate solo and did not regret the caloric intake at all!  I'm only sad that there is nothing similar to this in Washington State =(   Service was so-so but you don't go here for service!  Jar of drank is awesome too
