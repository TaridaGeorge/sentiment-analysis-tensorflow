I love Target.
It has everything you could possibly want- all under one glorious roof.
Cute, casual tops and bottoms for working out? Check.
Fashionable earrings and necklaces? Check.
Electronics? Check.
Cleaning supplies? Check.
Food? Check.
Home decor. Check. 
I could go on and on. 
And best of all, they have the cheapest prices you'll find without sacrificing your integrity by going to Walmart. 
If you like the Morningstar Farm veggie foods, they have them cheaper here than you can get at any grocery store and they even have wine now at many of the Target's. What a dream come true!
