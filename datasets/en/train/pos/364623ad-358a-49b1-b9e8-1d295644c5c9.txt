OBSESSED with this place.  I am so so glad they finally have a location outside of Fashion Square, although the traffic at the quarter can rival mall traffic some days.

The employees are superb and so nice and helpful.  Everything is clean and organized and they have a million of everything so you can always find what you are looking for.
