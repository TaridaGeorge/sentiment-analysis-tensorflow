The Peppercorn Burger is amazing! Truly the best burger I have ever had. I'm not a huge burger fan as I prefer a steak or chicken but this is worth stepping out of the comfort zone. 
When you walk in it's a dark long bar on one side and tables on the other. I was really unsure about taking my kids in but they were welcomed and we found food for them on the menu. 
The only downside (for me) is it is far from my home. Great place!
