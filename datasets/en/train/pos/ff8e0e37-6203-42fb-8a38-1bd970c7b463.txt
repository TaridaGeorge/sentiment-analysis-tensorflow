Simply the best! I was there for the yelp event but could have spent the night I just couldnt get enough.

There is so much to explore and learn! I enjoyed laying on the bed of nails, and moving the ball with my mind. I have recommened this for people that live here and people from out of town on vacation.

Staff is incredably fun and happy to help and assist you.

I just cant say enough but , Ill simply say GO!!.. thats all I feel I can say wthout rambing about how amazing this place is.
