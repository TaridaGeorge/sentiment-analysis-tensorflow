Do not go around lunch time, it is far to busy, and you'll have to push your way in to the store.  Otherwise, a nice little store, where I got my MacBook, and where I can look at the different Apple products for a while just browsing.  The staff there are friendly and very knowledgeable.  Every time I go the Biltmore, I have to stop in and check out the Macs.  Now the employees have hi tech hand help registers for check out to make things easier.  Theres even a kid table with Macs lined around the table with games on them.  I find it hard for me to stop myself from drooling over the Macs, iPods, iPhones and software. 
There classes for new Apple product users are great.
