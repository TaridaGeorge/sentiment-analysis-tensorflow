Ingleside Animal Hospital was able to accommodate my dogs for a same-day appointment, even though they had never been there before, out of concern for their health. We arrived about ten minutes early and were immediately escorted into the exam room. I was pleased with the hospital's service and cleanliness. For exams and antibiotics for both dogs, I walked out with a bill for the same amount I used to pay for one dog at my old vet.
