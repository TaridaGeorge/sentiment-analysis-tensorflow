We just recently discovered this place and I just wish we have discovered it sooner!

The hot dogs are to die for! They are perfectly snappy with all the traditional Chicago fixin's on poppy seed bun. Yum!

I love the fries which are served in generous sized portions and always come out so hot, fresh, and crisp! 

The Italian Beef is a heck of a sandwich with tender meat, lots of peppers, delicious bread, and au jus!

My girls and I are huge fans of their sliders. Not quite up to the standard of my absolute favorite White Castles but still very tasty!
