I needed a haircut and was at the Desert Ridge Mall, saw V's and thought I would try them out. For me, my haircut was perfect and the hot towel & massage were added bonuses. This is my new go to place. If you are considering going to V's; at least give them a try.  the haircut I got was just perfect for me. Follow up with a visit to Total Wine & More nearby.
