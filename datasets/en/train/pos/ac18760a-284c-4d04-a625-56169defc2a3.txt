The Best BBQ in the East Valley, I've been here several times and ordered many different items and have never been disappointed. Food is wonderful and the people are great. I love the picnic atmosphere outside when the weather is nice. I normally get the sampler plate and it has been divine each and every time. A must when in the East Valley.
