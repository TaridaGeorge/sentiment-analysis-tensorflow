The Antique Trove is my favorite antique store in the valley.  It is not over-priced like a lot of other antique stores that I've visited.  There are many different vendors and the items change on a regular basis.  

There is a nice variety of both retro and antique items, and a pretty good selection of furniture (not tons of furniture, but there's always things I think are cool).  My past purchases include a retro sofa, throw pillow, and vinyl record so far.  Since there are many different vendors, prices and items vary, but it's a really fun place to browse if you like antiques.  It's located near Old Town Scottsdale.  And the people are friendly too!
