This is my favorite place for Thai food. Their Royal Curry is incredible. The Thai Iced Tea is perfect. The rice is exactly how you want it. The Pad Thai is perfect. Everything i try i like. The people are really sweet that work there and I have always had great service. I've taken a lot of my friends to this place and they ALWAYS like it and want to go back. Give it a try!
