Love KO's!  Fun, friendly sevice, everything I've had there is good.  Try the southwest salad.

Also really good chicken wings.

Only holdout on the menu, italian sausage sandwich, the sausage was more english than italian... i.e. really no flavor.

Aside form that, burgers have been great, appetizers, jummy, and for those days when I'm really wanting comfort food, fried Walleye!!!
