This place really doesn't have a novel business idea, it's just sandwiches.  But they do it well.  Probably some of the best sub sandwiches I've ever had.  I think the key is to just keep it simple.  And FRESH.  The ingredients look, taste and feel fresh and of a high quality.  Their prices are very reasonable. $5.50 for a footlong sandwich is on par with Subway's $5 footlong but this tastes better in my opinion.  Their bread is fresh and soft, not stale and crunchy like Subway.  Also, their tomatoes are red not green like Subway.  It helps that they don't have mildy retarded people and ex prisoners working there like does either.  All employees here have all their teeth and at least an average IQ from what I can tell.  Keep up the good work Goodcents, I will be coming back!
