Visited the Vulture Mine ghost town this past weekend and unfortunately saw a ton of damage to most structures and theft in some areas. This locations has it all, except for a working mine. Price has been raised to $10 per person since my last visit but still worth the trip. See photos and history at http://bit.ly/e6JY4U
