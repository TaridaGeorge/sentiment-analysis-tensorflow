Was at the Phoenician for a meeting and it was excellent. It is a very high quality spa/resort with amazing golf and tennis courts. The service is outstanding and the food simply fantastic. It doesn't need another review, since everyone on here seems to have loved their stay as well, but just wanted to add another 5 stars to the Phoenician. Go there to relax and indulge if you are in the southwest and are looking for a great place to stay.
