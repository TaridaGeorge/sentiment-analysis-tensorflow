I love the library.  This is my local branch, and frequent here often.  Membership is free, as long as you are a local resident.  Some of the benefits include computer usage, checking out books, all the local standard library stuff that you would expect.

What I love about this place is that they are open 7 days a week, and late during the week (I think until 8 PM.)  I love going here on Sundays to check my email on the computer, etc.  I think you can print here for 20 cents a page or something.  Plus, the staff here seems to be efficient and so far, has answered all of my questions when asked.
