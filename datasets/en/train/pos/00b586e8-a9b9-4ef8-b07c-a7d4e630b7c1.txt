I love this place primarily for either Chicken Schwarma or Falafels and Hummus. I am not a fan of their Gyros though. They have by far the BEST baklava ever! I especially like the Pistachio Baklava. I also go here and get spices and Chamomile tea. Their prices are very reasonable. I really like the food here! We once ordered a whole lamb they had roasted for a Pascha celebration, it was delicious!
