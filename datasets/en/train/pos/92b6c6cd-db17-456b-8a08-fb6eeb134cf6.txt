I wish that I could give The Melting Pot more than 5 stars because they made our company holiday party stress free and absolutely perfect!!

I have put together a number of company parties and they are always stressful and something horrific normally goes on. Tracy (rest manager) made the entire process a breeze, from start to finish. She even let me taste test the wines we were serving. That was a fun afternoon ;-)

The food was amazing, as usual, and the service was outstanding. I would highly recommend the spinach artichoke cheese fondue and the yin and yang chocolate fondue! Amazing!!!!

I would highly recommend The Melting Pot to anyone looking to host a holiday party or really any type of party for that matter. It is also a really intimate and romantic place to take someone on a date.
