I've been here twice since September.  The first time was for my birthday and the last time was about 3 weeks ago.  Everything about this place is great: the design, the service and the food.  The bar is small so the inventory is a bit limited but the food more than makes up for it.  Get the chorizo stuffed dates and mac n' cheese.   As my friend put it, "this is like an epicurean explosion in your mouth".  Very true.
