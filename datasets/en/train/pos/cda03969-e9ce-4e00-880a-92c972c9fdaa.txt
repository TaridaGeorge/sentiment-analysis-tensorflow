My 7 year old Daughter (2nd Grade) use to attend San Tan Elementary, but after every night of her coming home crying because of the lack of discipline in the school I pulled her out, and took the available spot Edu-prize had called me about.

Edu-prize has changed my daughters life, and she is reading better then ever, getting hundreds on her spelling tests, and is even doing really well in Math and LOVES going to school.

She has had such an easy time making friends in Edu-prize, and her teacher Mrs. Gant is AMAZING and I would ask for her if you have a kid going into the second grade.  So far all the teachers my daughter has dealt with at Edu-prize have been amazing and you are one of the lucky ones if you are able to get your kids into this school!
