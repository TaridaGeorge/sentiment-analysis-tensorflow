I have been to CK's several times. The service is great, and the pub grub is some of the best. We had the raspberry boneless wings for the first time last night, and they were awesome! A little breading, good raspberry sauce, with just the right amount of heat.

Good service, low prices, and big portions. Like Debbie, I also wished I lived closer.
