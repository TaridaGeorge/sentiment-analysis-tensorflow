Wow! 

I had the great fortune to happen upon this place after seeing a post on Coronado Historic District's facebook page about a sale. I went in today trying to take advantage of the sale that is going on and was blown away by the great selection, the beautiful art space and gracious owner. 

All of their items are reasonably priced, they have a great selection of clothing and accessories for men and women and the environment is chill. It is easy to miss this store driving by, if you don't see it... Look Again! :)
