Sidebar is a somewhat hidden-in-plain-sight gem of a bar in downtown Phoenix. Nestled subtly above a Starbucks on 7th Ave at McDowell, this bar is a MUST SEE AND BE SEEN AT! It's a very small, prohibition style bar.... unknown to most people, and happy to stay that way. Sunday night is industry night, and it gets pretty insane, like wall to wall packed, 20 minutes to order a drink, and don't even bother trying to use the single toilet bathroom BUSY! Monday is Margarita Monday... get there early for a free taco bar and $4.25 margaritas!

The atmosphere here is upscale, yet very comfortable, which probably has to do with the cozy couches and armchairs lining the walls! The beer and cocktail lists are nothing short of impressive, boasting a wide selection and freshly muddled drinks! And to top it all off: great tunes to set the mood!
