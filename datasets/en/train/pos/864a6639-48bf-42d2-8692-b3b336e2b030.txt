No pretense, but he very best cheese enchiladas in the valley!

I have been a patron for years now, eaten in all the old locations. The food remains the same, great!! 

Red beef burrito are huge and filled with tender meat and a wonderful sauce. 

Salsa bar, try the pickeled cucumbers. A family favorite. Prices are reasonable.

Huge bowls of albondigas soup or just beef and chunks of vegetables, delicious.
