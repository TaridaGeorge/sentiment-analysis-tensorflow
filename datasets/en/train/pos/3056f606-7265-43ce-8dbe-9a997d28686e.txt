I have recently found this place and LOVE it!!! The staff are always easy to find and give wonderful recommendations based on comics and graphic novels I previously enjoyed. Every so often they have great sales that save a graphic novel freak, like me, tons of money. I highly suggest you check this place out if you are into comics, graphic novels or comic memorabilia.
