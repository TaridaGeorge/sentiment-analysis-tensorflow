Jimmy John's gets 5 stars because they earned every one of them. They do everything right: 
~ the bread (it's the best)
~the cold-cuts (sliced on site, no low-grade Subway ingredients here!)
~lightening fast service. A nice sanny made from scratch at the blink of an eye.
~Totally affordable. My budget sub sanny is a Slim # 5 (salami & cheese) and it runs me a whopping $3.83 with tax!
