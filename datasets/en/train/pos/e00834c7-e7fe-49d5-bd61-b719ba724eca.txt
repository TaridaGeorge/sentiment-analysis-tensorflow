Last time I went it was lunchtime on a weekday.  Our server was very quick and attentive.  The sushi lunch deal was *amazing.*  Piping hot miso, delicate seaweed salad, crisp cucumber salad, flavorful sauteed veggies, fresh orange slices and the main attraction - tuna, yellowtail and salmon all absolutely fresh and perfectly prepared.  I left totally stuffed and happy.  One caveat - they should turn down the music a little during lunch; happy hour should be one level of noise and lunch should be several octaves below that.
