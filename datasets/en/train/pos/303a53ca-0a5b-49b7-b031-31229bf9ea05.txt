I take out-of-town-ers here for sure.  Always a hit.  I look forward to the growth of these types of establishments in phoenix.  IE: Renovation / reuse of historical phoenix architecture, combined with tasty, unique menu concepts.  It feels good to enjoy a nice meal in surroundings other than a strip mall.

And they have 5 dollar glasses of wine even on the weekend, 11 - 4 pm.  

Who can can argue with that.
