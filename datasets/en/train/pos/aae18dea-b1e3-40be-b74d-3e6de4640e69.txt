I really have nothing bad to say about this Seville Cleaners.  They have some of the, if not THE, most inexpensive cleaning prices in the Valley, and usually have my cleaning done the same day!  Score!

There are probably two dry cleaners located closer to my house than this one, yet my wife and I always go out of our way to take our clothes to Seville instead.

One oddity: They've never offered me a dry cleaning bag to bring my clothes in the next time.  Every other dry cleaners I've been to has offered a bag with their logo on it to encourage repeat business.  This wouldn't stop me from coming back, but it would be nicer to have something to bring my clothes in rather than my arms.
