First time going here was over the weekend and I can't believe I've never been before. I've had the macarons at the local farmers market and heard the review and it's all amazing. Actually, this place is better than the hype and blew my mind. Went for breakfast and will definitely go back for lunch some time. Mind you, hours are only till 3 pm and they serve breakfast and lunch only. If you find some other pastries you want (and you will), you can order them ahead. 

My only complaint was the wait staff did not clear tables or keep the dining area tidy. I know it was busy and the place is small, but that kind of makes it worse. Food was spectacular enough for me to overlook this minor issue and still give it a 5. What does that tell you?
