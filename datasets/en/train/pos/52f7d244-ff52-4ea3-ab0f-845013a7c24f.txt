Finally found a great hair salon thats near where I live.  I've been a fan of Aveda salons for over 15 years but since moving from San Diego hadn't found one that worked for me.  Secret's is great - relatively easy to get an appt, they stay on schedule and prices are reasonable for the quality of service.  My stylist is Mandy and every cut and color has been great!  I do wish the salon was open on Mondays because that's my day off from work
