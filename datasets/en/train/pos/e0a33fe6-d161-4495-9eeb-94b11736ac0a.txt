I first ventured into Forefathers about 4 weeks ago, and I must say those guys know what they're doing.  I've been to cheesesteak places where it took forever to get a sandwich.  I was in and out of Forefathers in about 5 minutes with a to-go order.

That being said, I was skeptical at first because of the speed it took to fill my order.  Nope.  They laid on the 'goods' something fierce.  The bread was as advertised.  It never got sloppy and held all the ingredients PERFECTLY.

I've read other reviews and must try some of their other foods.  Have to watch what days I do this on, because you never know when a 'grease bomb' is going to attack your innards, and I have workouts to consider. 

This place is LEGIT.  GO. NOW!
