Awesome Iced Coffee AKA iced Toddie (Toddy) using a cold brew process that doesn't pull the acids and bitterness out of the bean and leaves a smooth, rich and fruity cup of iced goodness. The crew formerly of Solas Coffee really provides top notch service. Snap up a chocolate chip and bacon cookie or a slice of the coffee cake that rocks. Cappuccinos and Macchiattos are for drinking in and have well crafted foam. If your looking for a super sweet 1100 calorie Fat-a-chino.. keep driving to Starbucks and sip on some burnt bean lates. Know, if you want a smooth well crafted cup drip coffee made for you or rich espresso, come see the crew at Cartel Scottsdale. They also have the OG Tempe, new downtown with kitchen and Tucson location (former ally Avenue Coffee).
