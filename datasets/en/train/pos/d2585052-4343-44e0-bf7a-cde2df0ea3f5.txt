Hooray for Artlink!  If it wasn't for them, there wouldn't be a First Friday event every month.  I think it really adds a little somethin' somethin' to our state to have a great event like this where artists of every genre gather together to display and sell their work.

The cool thing about First Friday is that not only do you get to check out artwork and other handmade items, but you can also drink while doing so.  In addition to this, there are a ton of cool little restaurants in historic homes, including Fate, which is right in the middle of it all. 

There are usually quite a few different musicians playing throughout the neighborhoods too.  Check it out!
