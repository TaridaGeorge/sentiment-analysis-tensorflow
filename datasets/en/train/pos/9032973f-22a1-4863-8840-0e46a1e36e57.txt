Of all the Goodwill's I have been to, this location has got to be the best I have visited.

I purchased my first piece of furniture at this 19th Ave/Happy Valley Rd. location.  It is the perfect vintage arm chair. So excited!

When I walked in, I could tell instantly that it was one of the better locations.  It was bright, clean and well organized.  Not a bunch of junk laying around and much better selection in the stuff I like best like handbags, books and kitchenwares.

The drop off area is covered, which is really nice too and the building is new.  I plan on finding more treasures here.  I am smitten.
