I've been to the Roaring Fork 4 times.  Every time has been excellent.  Normally I get the roasted chicken which is outstanding but this time I tried their famous big ass burger.  It was excellent and aptly named.  Of course no meal here is complete without a side of green chili mac and cheese.  My friends had the salmon and fried chicken and said it was outstanding.  The service is excellent and so is the food. I see a 5th trip here in the near future.
