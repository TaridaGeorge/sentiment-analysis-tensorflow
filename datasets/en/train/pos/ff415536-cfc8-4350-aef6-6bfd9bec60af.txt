Played the Lakes course with my daughters this winter...course was in great shape...Lakes course is par 62 to it was quick to play and perfect for the kids! 

Didn't play the other course but heard that one is good. 

Clubhouse has a ton of flat screens that had games on and grill had good pricing for lunch. Certainly recommend this course to AZ Golfers

Palm Valley is just off I-10 so it has easy freeway access.
