So I yelped up this place and looked at their website and had to take my honey to this restaurant! Wow it was wonderful. The Salmon cake with corn pablano was a feast for the eyes and for the palate.
The Thai ribs with fingerling potatoes had a sauce with just the right amount of spice. The meat was fall off the bone perfect and juicy. Perfect is perfect!
With a good cocktail,  Pama vodka and a nice simple single malt. What more can you say!
I will tell you - Chocolate desserts that are chocoholic quality.
Park the car and come on in!
