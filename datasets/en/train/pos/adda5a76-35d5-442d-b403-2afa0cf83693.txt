LOVE. This is a must in Phoenix. Reminded me of CA cuisine with the use of fresh vegetables and ambiance.

Pros:

-great use of space, love the architecture here. 
-comfy sofas to lounge in for pre-dinner cocktails. Reminded me of being in a living room.
-GREAT cocktails and HH specials. They do their own mixes. Dark & Stormy was great.
-delicious salmon special. If they have it (it's seasonal), you must order.
-was told their fried chicken is amazing but haven't tried, you might want to check it out

Cons:

-possibly long wait on weekends and during prime dinner time

Verdict:

-Go, go, go. This is an amazing hidden gem in Phoenix.
