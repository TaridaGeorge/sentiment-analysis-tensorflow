A true Scottsdale tradition, Kyoto offers fabulous sushi in a dive-y yet oh-so-hip atmosphere. Their Tako Salad is one of the best and the teppanyaki tables (for those who want cooked food) really are a blast.

Kyoto's hidden secret is its great lunch specials. You can get your sushi fix for under $10 and avoid the crowds that come in the evening.  Bento boxes with terriaki chicken will please your non-sushi friends. I'm so glad this place survived downtown Scottsdale's growth spurt!
