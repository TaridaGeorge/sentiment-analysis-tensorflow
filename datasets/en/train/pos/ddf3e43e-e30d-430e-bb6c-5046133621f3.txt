After reading a number of health articles and PBS programs that explained how so many common ailments can be eliminated by excluding gluten from one's diet, I've been trying to cut down on consumption of gluten -containing foods -- not an easy task since it's in so many common food items. This bakery is a great place to get prepared foods and baking ingredients that are gluten free, and they sell great stuff! The kitchen also serves gluten-free dishes for a quick snack or substantial lunch. The foods here are not as inexpensive as regular foods in ordinary stores; this is understandable since flours and other ingredients made from sweet rice, white rice, potatoes, and other gluten-free foods are not as readily available or as inexpensive as conventional bakery ingredients.
