I go up and down Rural/Scottsdale Rd to and from work everyday, and when I saw this place, I had to go in.

I felt at home! This place is completely my style! I wanted everything in the store!! 
Vintage Levi's, some destroyed and some still classic. The owner even custom designs some of his vintage finds. Just tell him what you want, or pick a pair already spruced up. It's a little pricey for those on a budget, but totally worth it. 

Everything I've bought in here I wear almost everyday, because I love the pieces so much. 

Customer service is awesome. I made new friends the minute I walked in. The decor is very trendy and hip, I love it. 

They have a new loyal return customer right here.
