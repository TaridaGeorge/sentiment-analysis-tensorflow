The staff is great, the quality of the food is high, and the prices are very fair. I'm picky about eating Thai food. And this place hasn't let me down yet. The attention to detail by the owners shows real pride of ownership. Give them a try and you will be happy!

The pineapple fried rice is outstanding. That said, everything I have ordered has either been above average or excellent!
