Awesome..not a bad item on the menu. This is a small international grocery store with a small restaurant attached. Gets very busy at lunch but moves quickly and gives you a chance to see the heaping plates of goodness being delivered efficiently to tables. I had a kibi  plate that came with super fresh tabouleh, lots of humus and beautiful fresh little pitas, and a great creamy yogurt salad. Friend had the gyro platter complete with a pile of tender gyro meat, rice, salad etc. add ice tea and it was under $20 and so filling that I was set for several hours. There is a reason that this place is busy. It rocks!
