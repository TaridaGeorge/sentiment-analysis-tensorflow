One of my new favorite lounges to go to with the girls.   1. I am a HUGE champagne fan 2. You can smoke on the patio 3. the drinks are great and 4. I LOVED the decor and atmosphere.  My friend and I were at Salt next door for a friends birthday party on a Friday night and decided to sneak next door for a drink to check it out.  The staff as a whole were awesome, everyone was very polite and sweet.  It has that chic feel with all the servers wearing cute corsets and dresses.  The DJ was great as well, fun music that kept the energy level up without making it too clubby and easy to still cary a conversation. Definitely a great new place to sit back and lounge in a place with a fun atmosphere and good service. Yay!
