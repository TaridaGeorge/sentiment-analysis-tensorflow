This is one of my favorite restaurants!!  I love all the delicious healthy options.  I feel that this location at Scottsdale Quarter is much better than the Biltmore location.  The atmosphere and food are both better here.  Everything I have tried here is great, including their drinks, so you can't go wrong with anything on their menu.  The only person who might not like this restaurant is someone who prefers "unhealthy" or greasy foods ;)
