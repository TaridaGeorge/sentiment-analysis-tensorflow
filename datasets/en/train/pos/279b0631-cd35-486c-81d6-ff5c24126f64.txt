How many boat tours offer cactus viewing as a main attraction?  The Desert Belle does, along with viewing wildlife like bald eagles and Arizona-style rock landscapes. The four-mountain profile on Arizona license plates is seen from the Lake. The tour narration is interesting and informative.  It's a first class event.

The boat is the New Desert Belle, which holds 143 passengers on two levels. The original pseudo-paddlewheel boat was retired at some point, apparently relatively recently. The comfortable new boat has enclosed seating on the first level and covered outdoor seating on the top level. The snack bar on the boat was reasonably priced, not the norm for tour boats. The Lake is sheltered, so the ride is very smooth compared to open water tours.
