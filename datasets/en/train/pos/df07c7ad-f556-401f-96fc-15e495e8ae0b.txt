I love Nutrition 101! The Smith family make it easy to feel good about yourself! I know lots of people think that they are just trying to fill their pockets but they are truely into changing the eating habits of society today. I am always there on the weekends because it is just fun to hang out and socialize. Oh and the owner is Maurice, not Carlos. Lots of people assume before actually giving them a chance. Come in and see what you get out of your visit!
