Creative food options. The flatbread pizza was loaded with toppings and can easily feed two people. They make their own sodas in two big tanks - lots of flavors. Highly recommend the vanilla cream. Friendly, down-home service.

Saw many folks coming in to pick up "take out" as well. Seems they do a great deal of this.
