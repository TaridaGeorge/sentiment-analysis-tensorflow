Lunch

While staying at the resort, I was not especially hungry, but really did not want to eat a bunch of junk. I went to the Wandering Horse buffet.

Price $12.95 plus tax.

I had smoked salmon, antipasta, salad, fruit, and then prime rib, roast pork, a few calamari and shrimp, more salad, and called it a day.

I could have had smoked salmon and prime rib all day but that would be really living it up, and I would have felt that I over ate at lunch. The thought did cross my mind.

At In-And-Out burgers, #1 is $ 5.50, so this was definitely 3 times better than a # 1.

If you are around here, really go to the buffet.
