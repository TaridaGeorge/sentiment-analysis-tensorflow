We were in Phoenix visiting family and my parents said we had to go here.  They were right!  Chef Sal's food is delicious.  I just wish I could have kissed Mama Rosa for her spaghetti and meatballs.  My wife LOVED the lasagna.  We took the Calabrese pizza home and later it was wonderful.  The olives, calamari and antipasti plate will all be ordered again.  Next time we are in town we will bring more family and friends and hopefully be able to order one of everything!!!  Order at the counter and they will take care of the rest.  Wonderful food and service.
