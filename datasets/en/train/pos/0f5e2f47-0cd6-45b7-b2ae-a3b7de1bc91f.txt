I visited the Cobblestone Auto Spa last week, the day after Phoenix survived the historic 100 year Haboob (dust storm). The lines were excessively long, so I decided not to wait to use the drive through wash. I came back a couple days later, and found shorter lines, and free vacuums. I have to say that for $4.99 -- you get a pretty good car wash. They advertise the $2.99 wash, but this is really just a rinse. I went for the basic wash, and thought my car came out very nice and clean. I really like that they have free vacuums (better than Weiss Guys where you have to pay to use them). Overall, I would rate this a five for quick service, good wash, and even a pretty good hand dry. My only suggestion is to bring a cloth or something to wipe out your own interior.
