I always enjoy local beers, so when we moved to AZ, looked up the local breweries and have loved 4 Peaks ever since!  Good food, great beer that you can get almost anywhere, good ambiance (with tons of TVs to watch games).  Kilt Lifter is my favorite all year beer, but the Pumpkin Porter is such a special treat that my wife and I will go down there at least a couple times in late Oct, Nov just for that.
