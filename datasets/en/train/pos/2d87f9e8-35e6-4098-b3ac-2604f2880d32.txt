OMG!!! I thought I died and went to booze HEAVEN..
Seriously, this place is huge and has everything you need to get over a bad day, bitchy wife or mean husband!!
I love me some vodka and they have every kind, flavor you could imagine. i prefer a brand called VIeL..it is 5 timese distilled and comes in a bunch of flavores, it is only 10 bucks, i know your thinkin I am one to maybe buy bottem shelf stuff but far from the truth cheap stuff equals a bad next day ALL DAY for this girl..
go in try it ohh an if you just so happen to be a Hello Kitty fan they have Hello Kitty champagne!!! i love her..
you will be in this store for a long time...
Plus they offer free tastings
