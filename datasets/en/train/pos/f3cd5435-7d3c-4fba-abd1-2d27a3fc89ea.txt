This is amazing place to visit in the Phoenix area. Of course, the flora and fauna of this desert is unique and there's no better place to get a comprehensive overview than the botanical gardens. Of course, they are also beautiful and interesting. 

I went with my 82-year old father, who has osteoperosis and emphysema. I was concerned he wouldn't be able to get around. However, the gardens had motorized carts available. Also, there are different trails with different difficluty levels. There are lots of shady places to stop as well as little cafes and etc. 

The docents are very knowledgable and really love what they do. Their enthusiasm really adds to the exerience.
