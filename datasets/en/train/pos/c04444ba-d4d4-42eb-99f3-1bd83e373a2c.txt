Amazing service, hip yet not trying too hard vibe, color everywhere!  Actually loved that there was color throughout hotel as I did not realize how beige the desert really was until I got to sit in The Saguaro lobby.  Gotta be sure you dine at Distrito once open (which is tomorrow).  Had a ton of fun here!
