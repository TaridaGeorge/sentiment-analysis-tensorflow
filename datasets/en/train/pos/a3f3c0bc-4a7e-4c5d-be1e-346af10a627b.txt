Big ass hamburger + cream cheese + jalapenos + fried onion strings = was like oral sex for fatties.. and I enjoyed every provocative second of it. 

Their Kilt Lifter was a brilliant, boozy concoction that sits on the tongue, dark and heavy like a dirty secret. My gal had the Raj IPA and it had the kind of curious sparkle to turn my eh-ness regarding IPAs to hell-yeahness. 

I absolutely regret coming here. All my local breweries are utterly inferior compared to this surprising find.
