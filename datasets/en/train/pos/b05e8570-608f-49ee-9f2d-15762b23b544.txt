City girls find Postino. Last night my cousin brought me to this place and I fell in love with it. The ambiance is warm and inviting. The staff was courteous, very pleasant, and incredibly attentive; they came around often to check up on us. Stevie (bartender) was great! Ahhh Bruschettas.. What can I say? Plainly delicious, amazing selection, our four choices were all sinfully mouth-watering. The star of the night, the Wine was just delightful. This is our new Tuesdays spot! This city girl just had New York City moment in Arizona.
