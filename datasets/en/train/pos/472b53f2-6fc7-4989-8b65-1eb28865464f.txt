It's swing dance club that happens on Wed nights. Other nights have other stuff. The dance floor is a floating wood floor and has nice space to it. The instructors teach a beginner East Coast swing dance lesson in the beginning and then it's open dancing. The best Lindy Hoppers in Phoenix go there to dance so it's super fun to watch. The DJ plays a real nice variety of big band, 50s, blues, and soul. Nice time. No pressure. Nice people. Doesn't feel like a club like everyone's hitting on each other and stuff.
