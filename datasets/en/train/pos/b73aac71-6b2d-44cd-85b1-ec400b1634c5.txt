LOVE THIS PLACE! 
Dim Sum is the way to go here. The food is so fresh. They actually have live fish tanks in the back with daily specials. 
Back to the Dim Sum. All of the shu mai and dumplings are fabulous. My two favorites were the Spare Ribs in Black Bean sauce and the Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf. OMG! (yes I just typed that). 
The Pork Spare Ribs look a little different than most pork cuts Americans are used to but the flavor is ridiculous! 
The sticky rice is filled with very flavorful pork and shrimp. 
Almost all of their Dim Sum is $2.18! 

This place is clean and the staff is very friendly. 

A must try!
