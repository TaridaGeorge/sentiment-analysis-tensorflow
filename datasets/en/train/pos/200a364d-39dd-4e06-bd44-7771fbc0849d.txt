Wow! We went on 4/20/11, and were appetizer and drink hopping around Scottsdale. On our way to dinner we came across this wonderful place. Nothing much to look at from the outside, but were pleasantly surprised, open and comfortable. My husband and I sat at the bar, ordered a few appetizers: Pork Belly Pastrami and Crab Cakes w/ brussel sprout slaw....sorry, I drifted off thinking about how outstanding and delicious they were! Thomas our bartender who knew EXACTLY how every dish was perpared and expaining w/ such passion, we can tell he loves what he does! Next time the reservation will be here! Looking forward to trying EVERYTHING! Hope Thomas is working!
