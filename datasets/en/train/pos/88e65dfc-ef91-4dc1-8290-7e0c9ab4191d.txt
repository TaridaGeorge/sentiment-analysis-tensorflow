I went in to HTC the day after Christmas, having read some great reviews. It definitely lived up to their reputation. 

There was a 1.5-2 hour wait, which to me is an indication of just how good they are. Paperwork was completed quickly and it actually took less time than they estimated to get in. 

Kevin was my piercer and he was really good at making me feel comfortable. He changed his gloves a few times during the process. They really have a focus on keeping things as clean and sanitary as possible. He gave me detailed aftercare instructions and told me to come back any time with questions. Really a great overall experience!
