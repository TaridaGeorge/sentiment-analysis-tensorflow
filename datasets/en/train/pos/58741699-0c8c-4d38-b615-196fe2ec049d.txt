YEN whoops all other PHX sushi bars boo-tays. 
Big time. 

Heres why: 
Freshest fish
Unassuming, genuinely nice chefs and staff
amazing prices
huge selection
fast..very fast. Especially since I recently fell out of love with Yasu when I placed a to-go order that they quoted me 30 minutes on and then when I arrived, they told me it would be another hour. (BOO on them, and yes I am still bitter) Thank god my search for a better place is over! No more of them acting like they are doing me a favor by waiting on me!! They also dont act like you are crazy when you roll up in there on a whim wanting a few rolls...

GO YEN! YOU ROCK!
