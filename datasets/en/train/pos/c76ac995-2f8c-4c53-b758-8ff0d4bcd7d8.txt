Our entire family goes to mosaic dental. We even take our 4 year old. He is great with kids!  We are very picky people when it comes to dental work. We have had bad luck in the past with other dentists. It is hard to find a dentist that is honest and helps keep costs down. This dentist does both. We have been going to mosaic for just over a year and think Dr. Sam is great. Very clean office too.
