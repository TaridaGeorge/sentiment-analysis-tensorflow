So, I just recieved a check in the mail from The W Scottsdale to replace the watch that was damaged by the belldesk during my last stay. 

Although it took a while to figure everything out, I have to say that I am pretty satisfied with the way they handled the situation.  This in combination with all the other positive aspects of our stay, I'm going to give W Scottsdale a solid thumbs-up.
