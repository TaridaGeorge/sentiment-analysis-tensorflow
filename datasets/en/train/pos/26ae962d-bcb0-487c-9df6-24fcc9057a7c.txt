There are so many good things about KO's ... I don't know where to start!  First, the food is excellent and reasonably priced.  The service is great, too! When I go in, I feel like the waitresses and bartenders have been my friend for ages.  Robbie is my go-to bartender, and recently was served by a girl Angela who was so great!  A couple reviews down someone talked about getting bad service and I feel like they have no idea what they are talking about.  I've had bad service before, but never EVER at KO's!
