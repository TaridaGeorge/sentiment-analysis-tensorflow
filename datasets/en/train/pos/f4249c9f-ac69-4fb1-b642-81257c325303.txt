Coming from LA, I am familiar with La Grande Orange in Pasadena. However, I never had their pizzas until I visited this little shop in Phoenix. It was delicious and the novelty and combination of taste - AMAZING! Between the 3 of us, we ordered:

Mushroom pizza: Pretty good, lots of 'shrums for those who like mushrooms
Corn and Avocado: Now that was delicious covered with chunks of goat cheese! I love goat cheese, tastes almost like cream cheese :)
The Gladiator pizza: Pretty much an all meat pizza
The Tomato and Basil: Yum

They even have vegetarian options for those who don't eat meat. It's a great late night snack. I don't usually eat the crust but they made it so well that I wasn't picky about it. 

Oh, and we also ordered chicken wings - it was alright but I would say stick to the pizzas.
