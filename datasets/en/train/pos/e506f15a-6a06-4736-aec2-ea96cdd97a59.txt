Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! 

I've been there about 5 or 6 times since I discovered it 2 weekends ago. Each time I visit, I try a different flavor and so far every one has been completely awesome. I haven't tried the custard yet but went last weekend with some friends and they said it was great.

The parking is kind of crappy but it is worth it.
