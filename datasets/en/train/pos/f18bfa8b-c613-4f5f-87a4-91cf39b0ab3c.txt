Hungry Monk has AWESOME wings, fish and chips and pulled pork (that's all we've eaten here) and no where else in Chandler has a beer selection like this.  

Finally, something for craft and local beer lovers that isn't some frat party of dudes just trying to get 'wasted' and hit on girls. 

Thank you, Hungry Monk.
