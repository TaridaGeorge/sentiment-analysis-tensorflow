"The Duck" has been a regular haunt for me as long as I can remember. Even as a child I loved going to the Duck & Decanter. The sandwiches are absolutely delish as well as original. If you're not feeling adventurous though, you can always creat your own favorite. The cheese selection is decent and the cheese plates are always generous. In the wine room, you will find an excellent selection wines and beers, and an always helpful and knowledgeable staff member should you, like myself, need help making a choice. The patio is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon, especially when there is live music and fabulous weather. (Plus dogs are welcome on the patio.) Family owned and operated, the Duck is a valley favorite as well as my favorite!
