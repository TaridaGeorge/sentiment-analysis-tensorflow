Being a huge fan of Roaring Fork I was excited when I heard that Chef McGrath had opened a new restaurant. The service was great and my meal was delicious. I ordered the country club salad and pot roast, the meat was melt in your mouth tender. Unfortunately, I was too stuffed for dessert. I hope to return soon, as their saturday special of dr. pepper braised short ribs sounds delish!
