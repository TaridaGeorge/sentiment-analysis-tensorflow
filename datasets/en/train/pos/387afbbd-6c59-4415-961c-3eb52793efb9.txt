This place is great!  We just moved from Peoria and this one is just as good as the one on union hills. Yummy custard and Ice, you can't go wrong for a cold treat!  My only wish is that this location had more flavors of custard instead of just the standard choc and vanilla.  Overall I highly recommend :-)
