Urias Landscaping and maintenance have been handling my yard care, yearly clean ups and general gardening - plant me a tree, put in a garden bed and the like for almost 3 years. Recently I used them to completely remodel my backyard - new concrete patio, shrubs, palms, fencing, pavers, outdoor lighting, anyway you get the idea. They are extremely accomplished, the owner has completed training at the Phoenix Botanical Gardens and they are also very affordable. I love my backyard, Thanks Jesse and Oswaldo.
