Easily one of my favorite coffee shops in the country & i don't say that lightly. Especially after going to Washington & Oregon, i'd still say Lux beats everything ive ever been too.
& i always take my friends here to experience the goodness of Lux.

Something else i'll say - i work at Starbucks, so if it tells you anything, i'm a coffee snob. i've worked for Starbucks since 06 & i would still prefer a lux coffee over Starbucks any day.

This place has charm. The people are inviting & great. Very raw atmosphere. Expect to get great coffee & great food. Everything is baked fresh every day with their cute little bakery in the back. Its worth the time to stop by!
