Atmosphere: very cozy, great for family or groups, but they have a small seating area.

Service: very courteous & prompt.

Food: This is now my favorite pizza place!  We started off with some bruschetta.  It was crunchy & full of flavor.  The pepperoncini rings gave it a little kick!  For pizza, we got the Mama Spinato's "Signature" Fresh Pizza.  I love the way they cut the pizza for you.  It wasn't the traditional big triangular slices.  They were cut into small squares, which made it so much easier to share, and to portion yourself.  The crust is thin, so it wasn't overwhelmingly doughy.  My sister ordered the same specialty pizza but gluten-free.  The crust wasn't as sweet, but still good for being gluten-free.  Definitely beats Picazzo's gluten-free crust in terms of taste.

I am addicted!
