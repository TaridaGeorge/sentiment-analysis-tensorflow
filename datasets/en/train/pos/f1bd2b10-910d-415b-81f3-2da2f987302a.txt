I was introduced to this hidden spot by Jamaican friend who has been on a mission to discover great Caribbean food in Phx. It officially fills a void that has long been standing!

The decor and feel is classy but not stuffy. I can imagine going here on a date for sure. There are great booths on one side for a hidden rendezvous for cock-tailing. 

I loved my dinner which was fish, rice and peas and green beans. It was flavorful and prepared perfect. My picky dinner companion raved about how much the food reminded her of home. Not one plantain was left on her plate.

Oh and my cocktail which was like a mojito but better was amazing! I would go back just for that drink.

Check it out! Its one of those rare gems that needs some support and the word spread.
