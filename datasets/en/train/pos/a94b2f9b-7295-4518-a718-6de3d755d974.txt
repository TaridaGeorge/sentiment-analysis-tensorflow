Finally, there's another coffee shop in the Kierland / Quarter area. Even better it's a locally owned and operated coffee shop with proprietary roasted beans sourced from only the finest corners of the earth. They seriously have coffee from Ethopia that naturally smells like blueberries and chocolate, and this ain't your flavored Gloria Jeans Mall stuff either. I ordered a regular coffee and enjoyed their house blend. I followed up with a sampling of their espresso, made by their machine that is one of eight in the entire US. The espresso is incredibly delicious, full of smooth rich flavor, that finishes pleasantly at the end. This where good coffee happens!
