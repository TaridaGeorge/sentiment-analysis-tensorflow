NOTE-- 5 stars for a hot dog joint, not for "The Four Seasons"

If you are jonesing for a good hot dog, this is your place.

The food is excellent, carefully prepared, quality ingredients.  Between me and my family, we've tried a whole lotta different menu items, everything is great.  Expect friendly service.  Extra clean and cheery environment adds to the experience.  Sports usually playing on the TVs.

Prices are a little stiff, but I guess costs are high for premium strip mall space, quality ingredients, and good staff. 

I've been here three times, and I'll be back.  You will not be disappointed.
