We live in the neighborhood and finally went to this establishment. I think we delayed trying this place when it first opened because it seemed to have some less than favorable reviews but I'm happy to report that our experience was great! It seems to me that it might have been the owners working so maybe that made a difference but the yogurt was excellent, as were the toppings! Everything was fresh and they offer lychee fruit as a topping, you don't find this often...very impressed. I was also pleased that the prices were reasonable. Some of these other yogurt places are so greedy. Keep up the good work Zen Zen, you have some new fans!
