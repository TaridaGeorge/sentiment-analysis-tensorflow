I have to say, these may very well be the best Paczki I've had since moving from the midwest. When it's Fat Tuesday and you've missed your Polish family's food for the past year and you learn about this place, it's like finding a hidden piece of heaven. The family at Europa is super friendly and seem very pleased to see anyone come into their shop. I will most definitely be going back to try more of their wonderful food in the near future.
