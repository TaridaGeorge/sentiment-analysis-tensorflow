This little place is so great. The owner really takes his time to explain and help. I had no idea about the nutrition in my dog's food and here is where I got my education.

I had also been checking into prices for getting his teeth cleaned- YIKES! expensive. around $400-500! And they knock them out (the dog- not the teeth!). Arthur told us to try a raw knuckle bone. At fist the dog was weary of it- but he learned to love it and it scraped nearly all the plaque off of his teeth- for the low, low price of $4.99. Woo!

 I cannot thank them enough for assisting us in choosing healthy food and treats for our dog!
