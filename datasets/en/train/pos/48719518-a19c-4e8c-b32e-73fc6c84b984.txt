When I saw that my 'hood was getting a new yogurt place... I was all like "pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee please please please be good!"

And you know what.  It is FANTASTIC!
OMG, the red velvet yogurt flavor... to die for.

I love the open concept of the place, and the water bowl for puppies on the patio!

This place opened two days ago, and I've been two times already.

They have lots of different flavors, ranging from 90-120 calories per four ounce serving.  It's a serve yourself type of place, and has a toppings bar.  
There is also a display case that sells Tammie Coe baked goods.

YUM!!!!
