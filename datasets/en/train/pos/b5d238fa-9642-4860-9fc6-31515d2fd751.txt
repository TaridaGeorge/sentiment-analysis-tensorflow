I have a thing with vegetables, I love them so much! I go crazy here walking down the salad bar line because I love everything. I usually get too much and wind up hurting, but everything is so fresh and tasty it's hard not to.
The soup selection is always top notch as well. Its hard to pass up all the great flavors! I took my non-veggie loving boyfriend here and he liked the pizza bread and the mac and cheese! Whatever your preference,  just remember to wear loose fitting pants when you go!
