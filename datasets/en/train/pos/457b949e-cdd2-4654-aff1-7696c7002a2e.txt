D'Lish is DELISH! 
I finally visited this darling establishment after reading my fellow Yelper's reviews, and I'm glad I did.
The guys that work here are super friendly and super cute ( that is soooo inappropriate for me to say at this age)  and they can make a very nice latte and wonderful food!
When you read that this is "fast food", don't be scared off that you are going to a chain-type establishment: this IS fast food that is freshly prepared and absolutely D'LISH!
