I have been a patient for over seven years and Dr. Pat Dietzgen is the best doctor I've ever had. Her and her staff are always comforting and caring and I can usually get an appointment right away when I'm sick. Her husband, Dr. Mark Dietzgen has helped me with acupuncture treatments and supplements. I would highly recommend their practice to anyone seeking a primary care doctor.
