The quintessential local spot that is hip, excellent food & service. But like an eariler review states it is cool but "not trying to hard".  A great place for groups or smaller parties. It definitely gets busy, and parking is vallet.  Just a great sense of style, taste and casual place to just hang out.

Excellent food, a great combination of different flavors and styles.  Service was excellent, prompt and attentive.  Full bar, excellent wine menu and beer selection.

The salads are excellent, very generous portions,and combinations of flavors.  Make sure you always ask about the specials.  Absolutely incredible.  Generous portions, you will be happy you popped by!
