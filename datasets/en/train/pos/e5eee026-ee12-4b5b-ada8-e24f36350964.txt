I stopped in here because I hate tea but I really want to like it. The atmosphere was nice and the employees were friendly. When I explained that I never drink tea, they made me something fruity and delicious that has made me determined to go back and be a little more daring. 

The only problem: I wish they had a little more space to accommodate groups. And I wish they opened a little earlier, so I could stop in before work!

Regarding the other reviews, it -does- seem kind of out of place. But I appreciate that there are some locally-owned businesses in a shopping mall like Tempe Marketplace (I think the clothing boutique next door to Tea Infusion is an Arizona-owned business, as well).
