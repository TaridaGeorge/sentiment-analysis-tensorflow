FANTASTIC wine and jazz bar! Went here on rainy Saturday night looking for some great wine and a fun atmosphere and we found it! 

We nibbled on the Walleye fingers and they were golden brown and just right served with two, red and white, sauces. 

We also had the spinach and artichoke dip which was also really good. 

We then split the Greek flat bread pizza and added chicken and that was delicious! 

All this great food and two bottles of wine while listening to a great jazz player and sitting in a relaxing ambiance. I would go back for sure!
