Okay, seriously, this store is kinda badass.  As a new home owner I really cannot stress how much I hate the concept of overpaying for something like a clear vinyl shower curtain or an ironing board - essentials that really shouldn't cost all that much...and here they don't.

Admittedly some of the items here are not great - but if I can save money on the small stuff then I can happily justify spending that savings on something that matters like a nice couch.
