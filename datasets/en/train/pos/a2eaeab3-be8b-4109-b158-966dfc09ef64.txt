Tried this place today for first time.  I office very close and have not ventured in for one reason or another.  Decor was very comfortable and trendy.  Sat at the bar with colleage and service at bar was fantastic.  Bartender/server was extremely tentative and certainly knowledeable about the many different menu items.  Price point at this place was VERY reasonable.  So many restaurants menu's read well but product lets you down in the end.  NOT HERE. 

Tried the BLT and it had a generous portion of HIGH quality bacon.  The bread it was served on was also a perfect accompaniment.  

My colleage had the Friday special of shaved prime rib BBQ sandwich and it too was perfect.  I will definately go here again.  Can't go wrong.
