In April of 2010, we went to the Bandera in Old Town Scottsdale after being treated like dirt at the Italian Grotto. Our food at Bandera was excellent and the service was top-notch. It easily is the nicest place in downtown Scottsdale for VERY good food, really nice atmosphere, and VERY good service !
