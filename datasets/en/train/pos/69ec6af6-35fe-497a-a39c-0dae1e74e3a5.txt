Stopped in today while waiting for a haircut next door, WOW! 

I had noticed this place a few times before, but was never hungry or didn't have to wait for the haircut. 

This place is awesome! Reminds me of the Italian deli around the corner from my grandparents house in Pittsburgh. Fresh, Fresh, Fresh! 

Had the capicola and hard salami with provolone, sub. Bread had obviously been baked that day, and the meat/cheese was so fresh you would have thought the cows and pigs were out back! 

I will continue to get a mediocre haircut over here just to have an excuse to drive out of my way for this food!
