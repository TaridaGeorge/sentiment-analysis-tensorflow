Aye Chihuahua!! This little joint has great seafood items where you don't peso much. Every afternoon this little crowded eatery's occupants nearly double as a 4 or 5 piece mariachi band comes in and entertains.
Table service with cold beers and plenty of appetizers.
My favorite dish is the pescado buccanero which is a sinfully delicious white fish fillet (probably fresh tillapia because they ran out one night. Frozen fish never runs out.) smothered in a savory red chili and cheese sauce... mucho gusto!
Oysters on the half shell are the gulf variety but very fresh and expertly shucked with no broken shell pieces to spoil your bite. I used to shuck oysters commercially and appreciate a good oyster shucker.
Don't let the dumpy exterior fool you, this place is clean, service great and you will come back for mas.
