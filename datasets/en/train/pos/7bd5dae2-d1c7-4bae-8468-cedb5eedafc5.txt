When we moved to Garfield 10 years ago this place was our splurge mexican food.  Yes, we were that ghetto -- barrio would be more appropos.  #11 no queso or sonoronan enchilladas.  Great peppery salsa.  Good tamales made with manteca.  One lunch effort was thwarted as la policia filled the parking lot.  Servers are sweet and funny and quick.  I suspect I've had food poisoning twice from here but their number is still programmed into my cell.
