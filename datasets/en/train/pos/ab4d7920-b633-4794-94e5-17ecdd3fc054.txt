Really really really good food. Love the drink options... You can nearly choose anything you want from the machine. I cringe to see the one reviewer here comparing this place to Subway. Laughable. Sorry... Of course Subway is cheaper. Their ingredients are cheap... Firehouse has a really well made sub and it can't be compared to the sh-tuff Subway makes.
