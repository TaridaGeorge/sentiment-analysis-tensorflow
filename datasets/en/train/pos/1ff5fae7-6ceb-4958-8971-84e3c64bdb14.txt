I'm rating this Starbucks against other Starbucks locations and not against other coffee shops-- 

I studied here last weekend, and I have to say it was the perfect environment to study in. There was plenty of space, and even tables that seemed like they were designed for studying or reading. The atmosphere was upbeat, but not too loud. The service was incredibly friendly. The drinks were typical Starbucks (as expected)-- take that for what you will. 

If I lived near this Starbucks, I would make it a regular study spot, but unfortunately it's too far away for me!
