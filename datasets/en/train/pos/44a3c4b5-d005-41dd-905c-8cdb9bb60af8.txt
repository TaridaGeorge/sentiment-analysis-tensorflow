My wife and I moved to California last year, and we really miss The Keg.  It was my favorite steakhouse in AZ.  And, of course, they don't have them in Cali.  We love the eclectic atmosphere and the wonderful service.  The food is amazing, and the bread they bring... let me just say that you would step over your own mother to get to it.  My favorite is the bacon-wrapped filet mignon with a side of asparagus.  My wife generally goes for one of the specialty steaks they offer.  It is darn tasty.
