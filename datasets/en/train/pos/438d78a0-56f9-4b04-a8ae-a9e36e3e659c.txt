Love, love, love Nellos! This location is definitely different from the rest, the servers are wonderful, they are always uber busy BUT seem to always slide you right on into a table with a very minimal wait if any at all. 

It always looks worse than it is due to the take out counter I think. 

The margarita pizza is the best!

Try it out you will be glad you did!
