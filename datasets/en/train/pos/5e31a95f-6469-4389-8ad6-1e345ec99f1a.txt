I've been going to JIm's Shoe Repair since I moved into the area in 2008. I happen to wear a lot of business shoes in which the rubber heal wears down to the metal portion, and I either slip or "clank" when I walk. Jim's work is very good, extremely quick and priced well. I have utilized many other shoe repair places in the Phx-metro area and even now that I don't live near Jim's - I still take my shoes there. It's a small mom 'n pop shop and I'm happy to help keep him in business.
