Of all the Mastro's restaurants, this is our favorite. Not that we don't like them all, but the staff just seems extra special at City Hall. Of course, you just have to have a few drinks at the bar with Christian before getting your table. Great drinks, great scene.

Once you sit down, let the experience begin. From your first pretzel roll through your last bite of dessert, it's just as good as it gets. The wine list is one of the best and we think these are bar-none the best steaks in town. If you haven't had them and feel like splurging, the lobster mashed potatoes are so good it doesn't even make sense.
