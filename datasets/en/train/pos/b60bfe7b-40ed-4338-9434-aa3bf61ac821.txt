I'm pretty sure a majority of people that work here are volunteers, so the customer service is going to constantly change. I've met the same guy in there 3 times now and he's always super attentive and nice. The first time we went in there he gave us bottled water! My husband played a show here a few weeks ago and he went out of his way to bring me a chair - he also had his bizarre cat do some tricks for us! The art is wonderful and the prices are really affordable. I love that it's student work, fresh and modern and really intriguing. Honestly, it's the only gallery in old town that I could spend more than 20 minutes in.
