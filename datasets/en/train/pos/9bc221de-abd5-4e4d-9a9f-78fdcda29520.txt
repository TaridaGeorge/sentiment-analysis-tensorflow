Goldie's is a real American Institution... you can also find the same great food at Zipps Sports Grill. The Monaco Focaccia is the best thing on the menu, you will be sorry if you don't order it. It's compiled of Chicken Breast, melted mozzarella cheese & ranch dressing served with a side of Sweet Jalapeno for dipping. The best thing about this place is the Sweet Jalapeno dressing that comes on the side... my friend Eric Henning will drink the stuff if it's in front of him (it's that good). 
Another must have is the Golden Wings - I like them Medium. I will just come out and say they are the best wings in town, nay, the best wings I've ever had. They are just delectable. If you go during Happy Hour you can get a cheap 32 oz. beer (or 2) to wash it all down.
