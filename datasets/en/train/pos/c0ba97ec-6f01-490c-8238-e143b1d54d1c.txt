I will make this short simple and to the point since there are 400 other reviews! Mondays and Tuesdays after 8:00pm this place is the best deal in town - $20.00 for a bottle of wine and some of the best (and generous portions I might add) bruschetta I've had! Heck even if it's not monday or tuesday this place is amazing!
Great location, Great service,Great wine, and Great food = A fabulous time!
