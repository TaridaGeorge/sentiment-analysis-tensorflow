What an neat place built on a great idea! The breakfast is fresh, local, and pretty reasonably priced. The big draw is the location, though; sitting outdoors in the great weather and taking in the farm and mountain scenery is very, very nice. Even if it rains, the place is covered by umbrellas that keep you dry. 

If you're in Phoenix with a car, it's only a short and worthwhile drive from downtown. It's a little difficult to spot, so you might drive by pretty easily if you're not fully attentive.
