I was so disappointed after reading that this place had gone downhill since I left Tempe last year when a new owner came in

But since it was one of my favorite lunch places when I was at ASU, I decided I had to go back.  I was so happy to see that on the white board, it said "Lydia is back!"  Yay!  

I got the combo of four with Indonesian rice, saffron rice, penne with feta & dill, and rice pudding.  They have the huge servings of salads and rices just like I remember.  And of course, they were all just as delicious as I remember when I was a student.
