I just took our truck in to have it looked at. We bought it almost new and my husband had some concerns with a few things. They checked everything out for me and said it was in great condition. I walked out with just the oil change I wanted done and all the info I needed to put my husband's mind at ease. Great prices too. I will definitely be using them again!
