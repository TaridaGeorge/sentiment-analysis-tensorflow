I honestly needed about 2 more days to see all of old town! with its unique shops, restaurants and museums - there is so much to do! It is def a romantic place to go visit if you are in scottsdale - then it is a must see!! the parking is free and it is walking distance. Best off all everyone is super friendly! I can't wait to come back and explore the rest of the town. My fav are the sandwich club and the tavern!
