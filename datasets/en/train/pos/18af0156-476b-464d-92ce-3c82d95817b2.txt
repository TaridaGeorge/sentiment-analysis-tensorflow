I recently moved to Chandler and was in desperate need to find a Chiropractor. Ive always had lower back pain and visited a chiropractor about 3 times/month back in Missouri. A friend of mine told me she had great experience with Dr. Ryan Wade at Axis Wellness Center so i figured i would make an appointment. I was very impressed at how they accommodated my busy schedule. They were even able to get me in the same day! Dr. Wade was very friendly and so was the rest of the staff. He took the time to listen to my concerns and focus on my problem areas. My back feels great! I'm proud to say i have found my new chiropractor and will be back very soon!
