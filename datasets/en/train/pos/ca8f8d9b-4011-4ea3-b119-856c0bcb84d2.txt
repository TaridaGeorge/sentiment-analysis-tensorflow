I have zero complaints about Lowe's! Since moving to the Chandler area, my fiance and I have made countless trips to Lowe's to buy flowers, sprinkler heads, shovels and even solar-powered outdoor lights. Customer service is helpful, there's never any lines and my favorite part about the garden center is if you are not 100% satisfied with flowers you can return them with a receipt! We had some Ice plants that were starting to look a little sad so we returned them (brown and all) and got our money back, no questions asked!
