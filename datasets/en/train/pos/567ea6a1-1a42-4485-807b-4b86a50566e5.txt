Have been a couple of times now and have ever been disappointed.  Honestly, the main reason I went back is their desert, and specifically, their bread pudding - I DO NOT LIKE bread pudding, but this one is to die for - it is frigging awesome.  They use croissants - OMG.

Anyway, their regular food is good too - steak sandwich, salads etc, but just make sure you leave room for the bread pudding.

Service is always good and just love looking at the bar as well - it is so pretty.
