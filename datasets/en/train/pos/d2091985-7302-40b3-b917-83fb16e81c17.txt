This place is a rare find in the heart of Scottsdale. If you love delicious Indian, great service, lively ambiance, then you'll fall in love with TD just as I have! My favorite dishes are the Chicken Tikka Marsala, Lamb Vindaloo, Paneer Makhani, and their garlic naan (the best naan I've ever tasted). If you enjoy super spicy, make sure you request the chef's spicy! You may be disappointed if you don't request extra spicy.

 Every Friday and Saturday the exotic spicy cuisine is paired with its spicy, exotic belly dancers. I highly recommend checking this hidden gem out.
