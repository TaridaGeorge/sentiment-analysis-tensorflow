Sprinkles who???
This is my fav local bakery (I often pick up a treat from LGO) for their amazing OOEY GOOEY cupcakes. The name should say it all!
The cake is rick and moist while the frosting is a little piece of heaven. 

You must stop by and grab yourself a treat, you will forget all about Sprinkles cupcakes and be in love!
