I visited this place when it was Bada Boom and totally dug the space then. Now it seems even more perfect as a sports bar. 
The space is laid out well and roomy. The bar is big and seems easy enough to get a drink. The booths are great! I am a sucker for a good booth- these are comfy and have own TV. 
I had buffallo chicken and it was really good. It's nice to have bar food but not feel like your in some dumpy hole.
Good spot for watching the game or hanging out with a big group.
