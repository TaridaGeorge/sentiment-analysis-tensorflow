Love this salon. I noticed the other reviewer mentioned Jorge. I have been going to Jorge for the greater part of almost 10 years. He is friendly, fun, and his cuts and color and styling are always on point. I always have long hair - having been going to Jorge so long, I trusted him to cut my hair short - and God did it look amazing when I left that salon! He is very talented with both short and long hair and has a sharp eye for color and style. And you will leave laughing everytime or you are a gremlin. Other good ones are Foster & Jenny. Beware Daniel - he takes your requests as mere suggestions and does his own thing whether you consent or not!
