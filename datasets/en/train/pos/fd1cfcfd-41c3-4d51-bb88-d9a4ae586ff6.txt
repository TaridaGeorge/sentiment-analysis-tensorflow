Pizzeria Bianco's deliciousness can not really be explained.  Mouthwatering, delectable, amazing.  If you have not had a Pizzeria Bianco experience it should be on your list of things to do.  The atmosphere only adds to the charm!

I would recommend having a strategy to make the wait time easier.  I went with a large group of friends and was lucky to have a couple of friends volunteer to do most of the waiting for all of us.  When they reached the one hour mark the rest of us headed to the restaurant, had a drink and were in.
