Salon Sandoval was my saving grace. Years of boxed color and cheap haircuts left my mane with much to be desired. I met Gigi through a mutual friend and she totally nursed my hair back to health! I won't trust it with anyone else now! Plus she is just a really fun person that is so easy to talk to. 

Both salons are great. They serve fabulous sangria and the best part is they don't have the harsh lighting that makes you feel gross looking.

Try them out and request Gigi....not that they all don't rock.
