What an excellent dinner!  Having been to northern France, it was amazing to have a little piece of it here in AZ. The staff was courteous and helpful. La Potence was cooked really well and very tender. The crepes were just like in France and the chocolate fondue dessert was the best! I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants a genuine French experience.
