This is a fantastic salon because the 2 owners work together with their 2 assistants.  It is small and they cater to you as an individual.  They show respect and are not "high up on their horses."  They listen to what the customer wants and suggest what they think would work best for the client's hair.   They are both exremely talented stylists and colorists.
