I recently stayed at the Princess in their Casita suite. It was nothing short of amazing. The property is gorgeous. The Willow Stream Spa within the hotel is great. The best thing about it was the staff. Customer service seems to be their top priority. The front desk staff was kind and very helpful. The best is Jarrod the valet guy with the cowboy hat. Everytime I go there he hugs me! Who doesnt love a hug? Kudos to the Princess for all the great things they do.
