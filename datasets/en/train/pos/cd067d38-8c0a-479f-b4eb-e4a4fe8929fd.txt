We danced and drank, drank and danced to Soul Power Band. Then we drank and danced and drank and danced until they closed this joint. But what a joint. the band Soul Power (http://www.myspace.com/soulpowerbandaz) as amazing, they played everything, a round of drinks for 4 was only $14.50 so it was all good. 

Looking forward to going again to dance and drink, drink and dance to the  Soul Power band.
