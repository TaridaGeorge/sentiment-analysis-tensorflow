This review is going to be a bit lopsided because I only come in on Tuesdays for their drink specials.

The food I've had has been really good: flat bread pizzas, spring rolls, lettuce wraps, burgers, and best of all, their pizookie. All of it is great every time. Tuesdays are definitely the days to go; $2 BJ's pints from 10 to close. You'd think the selection of brews to have on special is too narrow, but they've got a beer for anyone. My favorites so far have been the Jeremiah Red (pretty strong Irish red ale), the Nit Wit (Belgian spiced ale), Big Fish (a pale ale stronger than the Piranha pale ale), and the Grand Cru (10% Beligian!). The servers we've had over the past couple years have all been great and really friendly. Totally worth it, if only for the Tuesdays.
