You can't live in Phoenix and not eat at Cibo!  This is one of my favorite retaurants in the State.  It's in an old house in a historic part of downtown, tucked away in an old nieighborhood, and the food is incredible.  All of their sandwiches are perfectly done and flavorful and the service is always first class.  Very easy to get in and out quickly, and with a full belly, during the lunch hour!
