The sushi here is delicious and very inexpensive! Their sushi has a more authentic and classic look than say at RA where they are so perfected and glamourized with sauces and things. We tried the shrimp tempura, spicy tuna roll, spicy yellowtail and the chicken teryaki - everything is so good! Even the edamame here is the best I've tried anywhere.

The staff are extremely friendly, helpful and very genuine! They are very knowledgeable of the menu and take the time to layout the menu and describe what they offer. Their drink menu looks great too. 

The only downside is, the atmosphere is very plain, small and casual. Better for a quick weekday night/ casual meal out. 

Definitely try it out! :)
