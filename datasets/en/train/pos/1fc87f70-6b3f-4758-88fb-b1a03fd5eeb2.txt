Was signed up there about 6 months ago by Andrew. This is the second time signing up. Canceled before because of money issues. And Andrew was amazing.  Of the other clubs I've been too this on is my favorite. 
It is very large and always clean. 
A nice variety of equipment. 
The classes are very fun. 
The staff are friendly. 

I love this place 5 stars!!!!
