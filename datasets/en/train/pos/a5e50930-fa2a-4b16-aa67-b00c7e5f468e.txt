Tonight I went to Jade Palace.  We have several restaurants in the area that are mediocre and somehow continue to stay busy, so I wasn't sure about Jade Palace.  Besides the food tasting delicious, the service was really good.  My ice tea was constantly refilled, and dirty plates removed promptly. It's always a nice surprise when you get both good service and good food.  Definitely, try the egg rolls!
