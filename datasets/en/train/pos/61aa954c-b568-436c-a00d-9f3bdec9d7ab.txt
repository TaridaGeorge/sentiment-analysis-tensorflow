We were visiting Phoenix and I needed to try Joe's Farm Grill after I saw it on DDD. We tried the Cheeseburger and Onion Rings. I think the burger was the best burger I have ever eaten, it had that great char-grilled flavor that I love in a burger and the size was more than I could eat. They also have a condiment bar with more choices than I could even imagine. The onion rings were the best I have ever eaten also. They had a great breading with a hint of Rosemary..yummy! Everybody's food around us looked great too..I doubt there is a bad item on the menu. It's so good we were contiplating driving out of our way to hit it before we went to the airport. Well worth a trip, you will return!
