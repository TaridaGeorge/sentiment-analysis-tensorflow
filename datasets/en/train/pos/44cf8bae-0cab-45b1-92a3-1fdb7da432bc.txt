My sister and I were looking for a cheap place to get pedicures that we wouldn't have to wait. Drove over to Pink Polish first and there was a huuuuuuuge line. So we looked up the next best place on Yelp and ended up here!

I'm glad we did! Awesome experience, super nice people, my feet look great, and I will definitely be going here from now on!
