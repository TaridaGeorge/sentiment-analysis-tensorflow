Great place - just moved from Seattle where Chinese restaurants almost outnumber Starbucks. Food good, great portions, fair price, and the person at the counter was very pleasant. 

I have finally found my Chinese food place (at least when I'm payin' ! )

I had to use the bathroom and it was clean, Paul. 

I'll definitely be going back......
