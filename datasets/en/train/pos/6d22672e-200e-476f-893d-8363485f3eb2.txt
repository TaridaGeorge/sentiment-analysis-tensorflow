Kiddo enjoys it here. I like that they try to build their "paying attention" qualities because they re-iterate it several times during their program. Just after a few weeks my lil'un is more confident with movement and is having tons of fun. David the owner is there all the times that we have been and the helpers are a lot of fun too.
