Best Moscow Mule I've had in a long while.

Have been here a few times now, and it never disappoints. Everyone knows the drinks are fantastic - I doubt you'll find better mixed drinks anywhere in Scottsdale except for upstairs at R+D. 

What surprised me was the food. The mixed salad (the one with its own Facebook page) was great. Awesome mix of things, with just enough meat to give it substance. The hummus was well prepared with tasty pita wedges.
For the main course, the coffee-crusted short ribs are can't miss. It comes with a tart cherry sauce that sets the whole thing off.
The scallops were amazing as well, perfectly cooked which can be hard to find.

After dinner we went up to Citizen R+D where the drinks are on a whole other level.
