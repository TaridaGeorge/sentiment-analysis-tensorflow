Had a lovely meal here last night for my husband's bday. We enjoyed the $5 aloha happy hour at the bar. All of the drinks were fabulous. The lobster roll was good and fresh, but it was difficult to taste the lobster. The calamari was great, but the sauce was far too spicy for our tastes.

They had a special birthday message in the menu as well as chocolate bday wish on a small dessert plate of cookies and a picture of the two of us to commemorate the special occasion.

My Mahi was very good, although slightly dry. The husband's shellfish sampler was superb. The chocolate souffle was delicious! The restaurant made it a very special dinner.
