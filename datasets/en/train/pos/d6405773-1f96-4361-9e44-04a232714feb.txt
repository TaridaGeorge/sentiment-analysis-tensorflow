I second Kristin's nomination of this Target as the best Target ever! It's a super-clean and well-stocked location, and the staff is definitely really friendly and helpful. Every time I've gone, I've had employees ask me if I needed help finding anything, and today, when I had a full cart and left my wallet in the car, one of the team members offered to watch my cart while I ran out to the car. It also has a Starbucks inside, which is a huge plus for those Saturday or Sunday morning trips!
