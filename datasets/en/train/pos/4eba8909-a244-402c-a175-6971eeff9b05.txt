Having a BMW for the first time does not prepare you for the cost of repairs- I could never afford the pricing that a dealership charges :( I am so grateful that I found Kenny Hasanoff at German Car Service- He is amazing ! Stayed open late on a Sat to get me back on the road again and far less money was spent based on many quotes I got at other services houses.

I recommend them to anyone with a German Car- simply the best !
