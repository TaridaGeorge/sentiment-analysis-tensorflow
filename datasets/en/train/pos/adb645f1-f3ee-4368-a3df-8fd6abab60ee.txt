This place is amazing. We lucked into their Monday/Tuesday night special ($20 for a bottle of wine and a bruschetta platter after 8pm - an epic deal, if you ask me), and all four bruschetta were delicious. Try the prosciutto with mascarpone and fig spread - it has a really interesting salty/sweet thing going on. The Rickshaw Pinot Noir is also excellent. Salad also great, and the ambiance is fun and vibrant. Will definitely go back, especially on a Monday or Tuesday night!
