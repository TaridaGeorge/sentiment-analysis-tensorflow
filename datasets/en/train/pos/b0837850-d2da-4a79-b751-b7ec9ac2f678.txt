Just had delivery for 1st time yesterday and I was so happy to finally find a Chinese restaurant in the area that was good.  I have tried several over the years and usually they are way to greasy, chewy or bland.
I had the Mongolian beef and I really liked it.  I had the lunch special, good price, so I also had their egg roll and crab puff.  It was all really good.  Our office ordered so we received free pot stickers with the larger order, we all enjoyed them.
I will be calling them again and trying different items on the menu.
