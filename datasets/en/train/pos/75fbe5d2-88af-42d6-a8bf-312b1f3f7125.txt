This place is awesome....The nicest husband and wife staff...Very clean and tastefully decorated..casual and comfortable atmosphere..The food is great, my favorite is the Pho p6. along with the crispy eggrolls.  Try this place, you will love it. They go out of their way to accomodate you if you call ahead..
