Michael C (our favorite Yelper) introduced me to this place when it was still Brackins Bar.  From the minute I stepped foot inside I knew I would be coming back for a long time.  The service is fantastic (even when it gets crazy busy on Friday or Saturday night), the new live music is awesome, and with Josh and Holly behind the bar couldn't make for a better night.  Tuesdays (when I usually go here) are relaxed and if you start commenting on some of their facebook stuff too... they might just put the drink you want on special!  :-) Thanks Holly!
