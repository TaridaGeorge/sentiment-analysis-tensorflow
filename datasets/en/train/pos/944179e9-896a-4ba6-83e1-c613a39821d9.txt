CLOSING FOR GOOD IN OCTOBER!

I eat here, maybe twice a month, and have never had a bad meal.  I was shocked when Suki (sp?) told me they were closing in October, for good.  Apparently they are having problems with a difficult (to put it nicely) landlord. 

Make plans now to go and enjoy it while it lasts.  

Heidi, have you tried the Egyptian Plate?  We usually go in and start with Hummus, Lentil Soup and then move on to the stuffed grape leaves or Egyptian Plate.  I also like the Falafal pita.
