I have been to the Apple store 2x for warranty service... Once for a power supply, another time for a new battery. The Apple Geniuses are friendly, helpful, and fun to interact with. The layout is neat, clean, and efficient. Overall they do a great job of using their retail space to communicate what it's like to use their products.
