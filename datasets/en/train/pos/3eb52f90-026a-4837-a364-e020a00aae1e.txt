Jerry came out the day I called him and beat all of the quotes that I had.  They came back the following day and removed a 50+ foot Eucalyptus tree and six stumps.  I got home to a clean yard, no damage, no branch or leaf debris, no signs that they were working in my yard allday.
His price was 1/3 of the highest bid, and that bid didn't include the stump grinding.  I did alot of shopping around, they were insured, professional, and inexpensive.
