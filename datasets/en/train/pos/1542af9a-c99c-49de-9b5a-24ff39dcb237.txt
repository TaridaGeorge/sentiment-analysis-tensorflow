The funny thing about Civic Center plaza is you don't realize how cool it is until you go there on a day where there is no festival, or event being held!  There are unique art sculptures in the park and tons of little coves that are tucked away, where you can go to read a book... or make out! The plaza also connects you to some fantastic bars, restaurants, the library, a historical museum, SMoCA, and the performing arts center. If you go there on any weekend during the spring, you are bound to find some live music, and local art displayed in the park.
