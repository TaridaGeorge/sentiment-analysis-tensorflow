WOW!!!  I've had pizza throughout Italy and the US.  I've always said I would pay upwards of $25 for a pizza that is done right.  It really takes an artisan with a passion.  I went into Bianco's with VERY high expectations.  Well, this guy crafts pizza better than anyone else.  Anywhere.  AND, incredibly, he asks 12 bucks for his Margherita.  TWELVE BUCKS!!  You can also pay 11-15 bucks for his other signature pies.  As my friend said, "It's like getting brain surgery from the world's greatest surgeon for $19.99."  This is pizza at its apex for a pittance.
Of course, when you sell a quality product like this people will line up in droves.  So, you have to wait a long time as has been noted.  BUT, I will wait even longer than 2.5 hours next time if I have to.
