One thing I look forward to when I am working in Chandler is going to Joe's.  The food is great and after a long day in and out of the car, I enjoy the casual let your hair down atmosphere.  The food is delightful, I have tried nearly everything on the menu, after going there for years.
I think it's one of Chandler's star locations
