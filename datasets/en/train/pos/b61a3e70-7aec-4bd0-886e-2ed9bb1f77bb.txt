Loved the tour! This place was really nice with 2 levels full of Italian artwork covering the walls made the atmosphere warm, fun, and inviting.  Like your grandmother's living room! Everything about the restaurant is "large." Huge portion sizes made it perfect for sharing and separate private rooms made it cozy for large families enjoying a night out. Our service was awesome as it was my friend's birthday they brought an oversized birthday card signed by the staff and gave her a special happy birthday song rendition. I enjoyed the Spicy Chicken Rigatoni and the Cheesy Bread Florentine, while the others had Baked Rigatoni; there were no complaints and plenty in our to-go boxes!
