This place is awesome!  I have been here twice already within a week and I love it.  Fresh, hot, spicy if you want and very delicious.  I had a #23 (Mi Cao Lau), #5 (Banh Khot), a Sing Ha and finished with fried bananas with vanilla ice cream.  Loved it!  Especially the fried bananas!  So crispy on the outside and moist on the inside...best I have ever had!
