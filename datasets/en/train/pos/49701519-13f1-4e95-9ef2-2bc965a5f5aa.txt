Arrived early for lunch on their opening day today, but lots of others had the same idea.  Registers weren't working and the guys making the hot lunches were working fast and furiously to get the orders out.  Food was great!  Looks like an interesting concept.  Just have to work some bugs out, to be expected in a brand new store.  Will be back for some wine/cheese in the evening after work.  Great location, perfect downtown people watching place.
