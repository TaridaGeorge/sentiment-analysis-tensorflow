I went in yesterday in a bind because I had put my wifi SIM card in my phone and completely messed things up. I was in a hurry as I work in medical sales and had some patients trailing my equipment and I was asked to be avab....Kathleen and another gentleman were SO friendly and patient. Kathleen had my phone working very quickly. Thanks your help! You are awesome!
