Unique atmosphere, great food, and the best wine choices! This place has all of what I need to enjoy myself. Their wine list is always the best and any of their servers can make a wine recommendation based on what YOU usually look for in a wine. ALL of their bruschetta is out of this world! The wine, food, service, and atmosphere always keep me coming back to Postino Central. I don't think they take reservations and know that they are busy just about every night. Just try to get there ahead of the crowd and know it is worth the wait. If you enjoy their Arcadia location, you will be equally pleased with Central.
