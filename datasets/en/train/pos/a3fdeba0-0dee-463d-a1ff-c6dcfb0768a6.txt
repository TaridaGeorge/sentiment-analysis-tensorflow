Dear Jam,

You have convinced me that I need to renew my relationship with glitter, glue guns and relaxy, sunny afternoons on the lawn. 

Never heard of Jam? Well, it's a boutique/classroom wrapped in one. If you're feeling shoppy, check out all their accessories made completely of recycled and reused stuff - think jewelry, hats, handbags, art and more - and if you're not in the mood to shop, check out their roster of classes. Wine tasting, crafting classes, cooking instruction and much more.

The owner Shauna is a gem, and will make you feel like a rock star. Really. 

Cliff's notes: Go there for the shopping, stay for the classes and the energy.
