When my water heater went out, I called a trusted friend to recommend a plumber.  Without hesitation, he told me to call Hansen's Plumbing.  Within 45 minutes, Hansen's was at my door, and within 4 hours I had a brand new water heater.  Very professional and courteous.  The best part... the price I was charged was the price I was quoted.  

Thank you Hansen's Plumbing!!
