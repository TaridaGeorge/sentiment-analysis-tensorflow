Dilly's Deli is a wonderful spot for lunch. It is NOT a traditional deli. It is more of a "boutique sandwich shop." They offer unique sanwiches with a diverse array of toppings. Everyone in my office likes it and I often take vendors there. They are always impressed.

The bread is baked fresh every morning. The bread is toasted on most sandwiches, but they have wraps, salads, and soups too.

My favorites are the Yahoo (roast beef, onion, cheese), Blazing Buffalo (turkey, buffalo sauce, lettuce, tomato) and the Gobbler (turkey, cranberry sauce, mayo, lettuce).

FYI, this place is MUCH better than the one on Southern Ave in Tempe.

Bottom line: Awesome sandwiches.
