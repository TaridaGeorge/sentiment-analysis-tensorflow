The search is officially over. Call off the hounds and rendezvous at Bobby Q. With a name so simple yet perplexing, it must either be the greatest or worst barbecue to have ever existed in this Quadrant. Like a gift from a god, their smoked ribs and brisket are tender to the touch and have the tendency to fall onto the table before reaching your plate. Such tragedy. Minus 1. Their sauce oomph is somewhat mild along with its sweetness and to me that is a blessing. Being a victim of the great-bbq-but-bad-sides or the so-so-bbq-but-good-sides, Bobby Q has made a believer in me that there is a higher power out there that watches over us and to those that do great things, rewards us. Mission accomplished.
