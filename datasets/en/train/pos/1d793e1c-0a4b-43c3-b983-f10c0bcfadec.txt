Its an adorable little local place very intimate seating, the place is called TASTY THAI because that is exactly what it is, best food and prices I have had in awhile. 

no happy hour because no booze, but one does not need booze with every meal especially when the food is this good! 

this is more of an adult setting don't bring children its small and cute!
