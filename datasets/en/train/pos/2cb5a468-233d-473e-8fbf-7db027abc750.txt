You have to get lucky at DSW when it comes to finding cute shoes in your size.  I have been here many times and found nothing and then stop by one time and find more than I can carry.  

When I first walk in, I always go to the back to the sales racks.  You can find shoes at an even deeper discount than in the regular part of the store and you can find some darn good deals.  After that I troll the regular aisles.  

Hint having gone through a wedding in recent history...check out DSW first and frequently.  Their wedding shoe selection can be very good and much better priced in comparison to wedding shops.  No one's going to see them anyway!
