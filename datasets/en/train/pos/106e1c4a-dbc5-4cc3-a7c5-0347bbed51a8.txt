This restaurant is located right by my house. We have been going here for over a year now... And we LOVE it. The food is so delicious and reasonably priced. You get a lot for your money. My husband and I always order the gang pang chicken (extra spicy) and share it. I believe you get fried wong tongs before the main dish for free.. free rice...and free fortune cookies. We can eat dinner for under 12 bucks including tip. The service is extremely fast & the employees are very welcoming & friendly. Literally my all time favorite Chinese restaurant.
