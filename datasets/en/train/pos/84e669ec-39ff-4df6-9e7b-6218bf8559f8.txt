Had lunch here today. Staff was friendly and attentive. Great place for some quick Italian eats. Pasta is always very hot and their marinara sauce has a nice acidic flavor which I like. I would recommend the classic spaghetti and meatballs. The portions sizes are reasonable but not huge. For pasta it's a great pick. Pizza's are pretty good as well.
