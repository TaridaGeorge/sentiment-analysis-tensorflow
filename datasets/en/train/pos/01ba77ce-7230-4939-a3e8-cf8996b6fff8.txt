Go on Monday get the $5 dollerrrr make you hollerrrr special. I got the Vigazz burger with sweet potato fries. My burger was delicious! Juicy and flavorful. The sweet potato fries were good, not awesome, they could have been a tad more crisp.

I also got a cocktail that had strawberry and basil muddled with citrus vodka and lemonade. Very refreshing! I've had this combo before and the Vig's version was superior to what I've had before. Although it was $9 it better be good, right!?
