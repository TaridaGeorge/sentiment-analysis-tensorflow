Sun is probably my favorite bike shop- and I frequent bike shops since my bike is always broken. They have a great selection of Nirve, Electra, Phat, Schwinn, and others- plus a nice smattering of vintage bikes for sale. The selection of parts and accessories is large too- if you don't see what you want, ask. Chances are, they have it in the back. 

The staff is great- they'll help you find what you need, recommend something new, or order what you're looking for. 

The prices are comparable to other bike shops, but the service is why Sun has been so successful.
