No one is writing about this place because we don't want the classrooms to get too big and we like all the special attention our kids get here. My child has learned to read at age four, speaks spanish, does karate, knows all the continents, counts to 100, etc etc etc....the list goes on and on and on....the school is an extremely small loving environment. I am very thankful that I found this place, and believe it has helped lay a great foundation for future academic success.
