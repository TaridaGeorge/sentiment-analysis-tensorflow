I LOVED it! Phoenix was not too exciting, but this hotel was! The staff is friendly, very helpful, awesome and creative rooms for a very good rate (the rooms were almost apartment size) and to top it off you have a great pool and a whirlpool with couple of plastic ducks swimming in there - that kind of plastic ducks kids would usually have in their tubs - but ducks also in XL size for XL kids ;-)  -very lovely, great idea! Makes you feel like being 5 again, and you dont want to get out of the tub although momy wants you you to get out cause your skin starts to wrinkle. If you ever have to stay in Phoenix: Stay there!
