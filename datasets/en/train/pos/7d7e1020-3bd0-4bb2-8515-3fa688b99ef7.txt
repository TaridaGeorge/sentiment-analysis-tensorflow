I checked out this location based on the one review I read.  I showed up and there was nobody in line, so it was helped right away by a very  nice woman (forgot her name).  She got my information and since I used their Chandler location, I was already in the system.  

Richard (who was mentioned in the previous review) came to talk to me about some services that were needed, but not pressing.  I was happy that he wasn't a pushy salesman like most places.  I got some new windshield wipers on top of my oil change along with a filter.  i was out the door with about $70.  I was happy.  I appreciate their honesty and their timing was perfect.  I was there probably about 20min max.

Would definitely go here again!!
