Review for Zoolights only (although we go a few times year round as well).

The Zoolights event was fantastic this year, loved some of the new things this season and it seemed somewhat better organized.  Always a lot of complaining about traffic, but to me it is no worse than leaving a sporting event.   Going on a weekday night, particularly the day or two AFTER Christmas seems to thin it out quite a bit from when I have gone in years past.

The biggest tip to give is to buy your tickets online and print at home.  When we left last night at about 8:45pm there was a HUGE line still waiting to buy tickets and go in.  I've pre-bought every year and never had to wait in any line.

Great job Phoenix Zoo!
