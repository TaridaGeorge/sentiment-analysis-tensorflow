My friend hired these guys a couple of years ago from an ad on Craigslist. She said she was nervous about going off a random Craislist ad, but they ended up being great, so I used them for my move.... What a great service for a great value! 

Damien is the owner and he was very helpful and professional. They were on time and very careful with all of my belongings. They wrapped and padded everything. They moved a full bedroom set and a couple other furniture pieces and I think my move ended up totaling $130. I would highly recommend Muvit!
