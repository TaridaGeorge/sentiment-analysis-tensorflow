My husband loves Indian food, so we stopped by for lunch since we were on Bell Road already. I had to order the Chicken Tandoori wrap again. It was good and the naan was just fluffy enough... My husband ordered the daily special (Beef Stew, Garlic Naan - extra $, and comes with rice). The daily special was AWESOME! We had great service and the waiter was good to look at too. Great food, good scenery, I am one happy woman!
