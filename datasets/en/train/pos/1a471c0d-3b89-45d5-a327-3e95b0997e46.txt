I really like this theater because it is a little out of the way and apparently unheard of, judging by the lack of patrons.  They have the latest movies, stadium seating, and none of the lines.  The theaters are smaller than those at bigger chain theaters, but since there are less people in attendance, this has never proven to be a problem.  I go most often on weeknights or for weekend matinees and on a couple of occasions have enjoyed the theater to myself and my party - can't beat a "private" showing!
