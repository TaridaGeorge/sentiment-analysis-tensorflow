Joe is the man. I went here with my buddy one time and he came right over to the table to talk to us both-- about the business his life and ...oh yes I almost forgot. pancake batter. Yum yum yum. Joe's pancakes are legitimate. I come from NE so I am pretty picky about my pancakes -- these were great and also they came with eggs bacon all the good stuff solid Americans love. 
Great diner with a chill classic feel (its connected to a garage-- that you can even look into!).
