I recently moved to Phoenix from Chicago and purchased a home here.  It seemed that overnight we had a huge crop of weeds sprout in our rock landscape.  I'm familiar with plants and weeds of the Midwest (I even worked at a landscape center for 7 summers), but I don't know much about desert landscape.  I went to the Bug & Weed Mart, and I found exactly what I needed.  The salesman was extremely helpful without being pushy, and he didn't patronize me (being a woman - which I've experienced at numerous other landscape/hardware stores).  He made sure that I had everything that I needed to get this job done, and he recommended a product for my next course of treatment on our landscape.  Go to the Bug & Weed Mart for great customer service!
