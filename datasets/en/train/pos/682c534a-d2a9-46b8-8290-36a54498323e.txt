We joined the Club this summer and could not be happier with its organization, efficiency, convenience and $aving$!!! We were paying twice as much for our laying hens feed and they just love the Big Sky Layer Mash. We are already loyal Baker Nursery customers and are so very appreciative of their willingness to support this Club, and someone took the care to cover our products in the August rains! We are very pleased and satisfied Club members and highly recommend that you join us.
