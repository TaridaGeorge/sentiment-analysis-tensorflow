The Phoenician Resort is one of our PREMIER facilities in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area. The flower budget yields a beautiful year round display of color. Stop in for the Salmon Burger at the 19th Hole Clubhouse, after a beautiful round of golf. Breakfast overlooking the swimming pools makes for a GREAT way to start any day. The staff is professional, attentive & helpful. You pay for what you get, in this case...a FIRST CLASS experience of the best Arizona can offer.
