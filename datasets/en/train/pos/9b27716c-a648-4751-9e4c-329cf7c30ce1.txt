Had this for the first time when it was catered for my niece's graduation party.  They had the shredded pork, riblets and chicken but I only tried the riblets and chicken and they were great! There isn't one close to my house or anything BBQ that is worth going to but I now drive out of my way on the weekends to have the Wilbur beans, cornbread, chicken wings and the strawberry lemonade! Love the Sweet and Tangy sauce!
