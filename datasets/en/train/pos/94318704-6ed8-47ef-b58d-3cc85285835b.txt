I am from NY and I stand by the food here at Crust. Being from NYC I know good pizza and they are awesome. Also a 20" for $10 carry out. What a deal. They are the best place around. So all the haters that wanna complain... go to olive garden then. Nobody needs you at crust. I go there every week and it is awesome. Keep it up. Friendly staff, good food, cozy joint. Must visit.     - D from NYC
