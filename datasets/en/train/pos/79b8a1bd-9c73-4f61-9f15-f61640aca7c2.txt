BEST BREAKFAST I'VE EVER HAD! Literally. Go and have the breakfast, Chicago Pizza. Yes, I know it sounds weird, but it is so good you will end up eating the entire pizza by yourself, even if you tell yourself you're only gonna eat half. It's not possible, its just too good. Price is pretty good, maybe slightly pricey for breakfast (i think the pizza is like $9 ish) but completely worth it. Outdoor seating available if its not too hot. But seriously, go here and eat.
