hillstone is my new favorite!  

i almost always sit at the bar with friends to eat and watch what ever game is on.  

Jill is usually my server and she is wonderful.

the food has always been perfect.  i'm a huge face of all their sushi as well as the japanese ribeye.  Saturday is their Chili and it is also exceptional.
