Tonight was the fourth time that I've been there and everytime we haven't had one bad thing. Tonight we decided to do the dinner for 2 for $42...what a deal! For $42 we got a 500 mL bottle of decent red wine, the Court Bouillon for 2 and beignets with 3 different dipping sauces!!!! Because I can't leave well enough alone, we decided to share a couple different apps before the festivities began.... 
First- the shave cantalope with sweetbreads...unbelievable combo!
Second (a special for the night)- fried shrimp with a heirloom tomato/basil "soup" and a salad made of white beans, bacon, tomato confit, bacon and olives.......very, very good!
Run, do not walk, to Metro.....you're going to love it!!!

Bonus-they're open for late night dining.
