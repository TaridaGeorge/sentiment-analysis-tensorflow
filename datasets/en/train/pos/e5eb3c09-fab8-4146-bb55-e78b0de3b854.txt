They really have done a spectacular job with the remodel- they put the luxury back into luxury shopping. The handbag arcade looks so fresh and elegant! I like the cosmetics expansion, and I also dig the mega-mega jewelry section. 

If I could only figure out how to make a few boatloads of cash to purchase some of these wonderfully marketed objects, it would surely be retail heaven.
