Wow... what a surprise Liberty Market is. I'd lived in the east valley for about 3 years before ever setting foot in Liberty Market. It honestly doesn't look much different from the outside than all of the other places I've never set foot in inside downtown Gilbert (although that's probably MY problem, not theirs). But, with help from a lot of friends who swear by Liberty Market (and seeing them be so interactive on social media sites, like twitter), I have now been there multiple times. Their food is amazing, I have yet to be disappointed by anything they have served. 

Ice Cream Cookie Sandwich, FTW :)
