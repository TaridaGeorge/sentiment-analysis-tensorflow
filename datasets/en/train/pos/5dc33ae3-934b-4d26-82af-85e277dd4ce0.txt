Tried their food last night at First Fridays, and I'll definitely be seeking them out again in the future. 

I got the BBQ nachos, and my boyfriend got the tacos. The nachos were incredible. Served on the heartiest tortilla chips I've ever had, which prevented any soggy nacho situations from happening. They had big, delicious chunks of tomatoes, and no shortage of pulled pork & cheese. The tacos were also delicious. They have the southwest slaw on them, which I definitely think I'll be ordering as a side next time I visit. 

Extremely friendly people working, great food, cheap prices. What more could I ask for? Highly recommend.
