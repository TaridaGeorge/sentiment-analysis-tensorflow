Dr Dave who did my eye exam was very quick, professional, and nice.  This location had a huge selection of glasses.  I told the lady I wanted purple glasses, and we just walked around the whole place trying on purple glasses.  I really liked the selection.  And I did find a great pair that I really liked, felt and looked good.  Everyone at work noticed right away the next day.  :)

The computers were down, but the lady was patient and tried to be a quick as she could.  This location was really busy on a Sunday.  I didn't think it would be, but I like that they are open all weekend.   My glasses were done in an hour, but my husband and I went out for lunch.  So, time flew on by for us.
