I am bumping District up to 5 stars.  Why you ask?  The Buffalo Sloppy Joe with tater tots.  That's why!  De-Lightful.  It came on this buttery/potatoey bun and was the perfect mix of sloppy and tasty.  The tots came in this little cast iron pot.  They were great, although I did find myself longing for about another 100 or so.  I was also able to sample the tomato soup my lunch companion had ordered.  Very delicious as well.  Plus they are open for lunch on Sundays.  Most places downtown were closed.  I heart District!!!
