this is by far one of the better bars in the roosevelt area. great selection of beer. atmosphere very hip. deffinelty a hipster bar, i think the bike rack outside says enough.

the price is average for a psudo speak easy. 

if you have never been to lost leaf, think house party. the "bar" is basicly a converted kitchen. beer bottles crown the cabinetry and instead of a traditional fridge, there is a clear face beverage fridge. they also have below counter coolers as well. 

accoustics are decent, but gets very very loud when they have a live jam band. great experiance.
