I love this place. I don't even think I can say a bad word about this place. Their food is pretty cheap and it's always been awesome. Their pitchers are cheap they're less than $7 and  the service is awesome. They've got 3 patios, 2 of which are smoking. They don't mind if you make a ruckus and they've got free pool which is great. Their drunk driving thing is great too if you live within 6 miles and it's free.
