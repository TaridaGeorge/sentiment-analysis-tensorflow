My new FIND in the valley. While killing time before my first gown fitting near San Tan, my friend and I wandered into Charming Charlie. Always in the want for new accessories, we were in heaven. But theres also cute tops and dresses. Affordably priced too!  All color coordinated with accessories in each area. The place is big and abundant. But not like Forever 21 so you are overwhelmed. The staff is sweet.. Like I said.. new find!
