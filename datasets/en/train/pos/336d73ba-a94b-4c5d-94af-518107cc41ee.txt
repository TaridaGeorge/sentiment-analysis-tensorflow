In NYC people line up 'round the corner for the shot to sit at one of the small tables at Grimaldi's Pizzeria under the Brooklyn bridge and order one of their famous thin crust pizzas.  Now, on one of those days when you're tired of waiting well over an hour, it might be tempting to board a flight to Phoenix to eat at one of the OTHER Grimaldi's locations (none of which are in NY).  Yeah, can  you believe there's a Grimaldi's in Scottsdale, Arizona?  I couldn't.  The menu and the story is the same, but, of course, it doesn't feel completely authentic outside of NY.  The coal oven is massive and the pizza tasted great.  These Arizonans don't know what they're missing!  They should be lining up for this.
