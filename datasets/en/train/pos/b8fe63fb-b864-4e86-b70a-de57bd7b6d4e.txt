Simply one of the best antique malls I've visited. It is a MASSIVE 2-story shop and has a little bit of everything. There is a lot of junk but also a ton of treasures so don't be afraid to do some digging. The staff aren't experts in the field so you don't have to worry about getting bent over on prices (this also means that they aren't extremely knowledgeable though either, so you'll be on your own).

I highly recommend this place!
