One of our favorite places for pizza!  Their antipasta salad is wonderful with their house Italian.  Mama's Signature spinach, tomato and garlic pizza should not be missed.  The kids always get the pepperoni and sausage pizza.  Spaghetti calzone sounds odd, I know, but if you're feeling adventurous, you should definitely try it.  They also have the best gluten free crust!  I order it even though I don't have any problem with gluten.  Their family recipe sauce is sweeter than most but still very good.  If you're looking for a local pizza place you can't find anywhere else, you don't want to miss this!
