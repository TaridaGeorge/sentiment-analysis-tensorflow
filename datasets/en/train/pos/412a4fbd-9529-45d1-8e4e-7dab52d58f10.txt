We just ate here yesterday and it was wonderful.  I had the strawberry waffle combo and it was delicious!  The portions were out of control, the berries were very fresh and the food was very hot when served.  The rest of my family enjoyed this meal too.  The kids meals portions are also very large and both my kids loved their food.

The owner/manager was so nice.  I loved how she new many customers by name.

I only wish they had one of these in our home town!
