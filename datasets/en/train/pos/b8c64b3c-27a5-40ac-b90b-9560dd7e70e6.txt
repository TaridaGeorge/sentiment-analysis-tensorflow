I love this place...when I walk in the door I am greeted and the manager already knows my order even though he has not seen me in a couple of months. 

I have a very special order and every time it is right on. I have eaten at many Indian Restaurants and he has been the only person that can tell me the difference between the two chicken tika dishes...and I have asked every one. 

My dinner is always served hot and to my liking I would recommend this restaurant to anyone with a taste of Indian Food.
