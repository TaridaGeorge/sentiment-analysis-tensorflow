The Sunday concerts in the park are chillin'! Our group dons blinky lights and glow sticks and sits in chairs and on blankets on the far end of the park to the right of the stage.

The park itself is well groomed and beautiful. One of these days I will take the train ride around the park, just because.

The park is leashed dog-friendly. Peekaboo experienced her first rabbit in the park.

Bring a blanket and a cooler and come join us for a Sunday evening in the park, jammin' to some awesome tunes.
