I took my dog to East Maryland Animal Hospital and I was extremely pleased with their services.  My little Cock-a-Poo had gone to  Banfield and after a few visits and a total run-around and emptying my pocketbook, I took her to East Maryland Animal Hospital and they treated her Thyroid problem and some other things and I'm happy to say this sick little dog is so much better now.

I found the employees to be so attentive and caring and I did not have to wait forever either.  When I call once a month to refill her prescription, whoever I speak with is so courteous and the medication is ready when they say it will be.  I also used the 50% off coupon and luckily had no problem.
