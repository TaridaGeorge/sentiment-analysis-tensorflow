Lee Lee is more than an Oriental Supermarket... it's international.  They have aisles of things from South America, Africa, and Great Britain in addition to the expected Chinese, Japanese, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese, and things from other Asian countries.

I found some Dutch things there that I had not seen outside of the Netherlands, and some things from South America that a friend from Dominican Republic would bring home with her.

The place is huge, and always crowded.  In this case, crowds are good.  I am always able to get help finding things I need from other shoppers who can read the Chinese and Japanese labels.

They have restaurant in the corner.   Walk behind the low wall  on the north side of the building and through the door into the seating area to find a counter that has light fare.  That's were you can find the boba drinks.  Boba rulz!
