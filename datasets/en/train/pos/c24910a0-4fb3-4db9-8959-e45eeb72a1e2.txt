With the lack of clientele (we were literally the only people there), the cook hanging out the serving window bored to tears, and absentee greeter I was not prepared to be impressed.

The veggie pizza was really good!

I'm concerned this hippe little place may disappear despite what it's got going for it, I asked the server if they're usually busier; they're allegedly seeking new management.

Good Luck Miami! I hope you make it!
