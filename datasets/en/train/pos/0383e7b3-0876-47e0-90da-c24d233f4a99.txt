LOVE Yogurtland, always yummy! But in this review I wanted to highlight the people behind the yogurt :)

We had received a Yogurtland private party through a recent charity auction, and decided to go there last night to celebrate my sister's birthday. Tammy was so helpful in getting it all organized for us, and even had balloons when we arrived (she had remembered we were celebrating a birthday from when I scheduled it a month ago)!

The other two employees there were also SO friendly and so nice, always making sure we were taken care of and asking if we needed anything. The party ended up being so fun and in such a great environment, thanks to all of them!

Besides Yogurtland being delicious (which is clearly covered in the other 100+ reviews hehe), definitely go there for the great people! :)
