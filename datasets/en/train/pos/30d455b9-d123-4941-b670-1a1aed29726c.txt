WELL. Being the caffeine junkie that I am, I feel that it is about time to review another Starbucks! 

Went here a few hours ago, picking up a hot latte to help me concentrate on prepping for a speech tomorrow. (Those Vanilla Lattes really get the job done...)

Anyway! Walked in, said hello the employees who were all cheery and friendly. Plenty of laughs and small talk, which is nice. I like that comforting small talk, makes me feel like I'm not customer 456,554 just  waiting for an overpriced latte. I'm "Wesley" on that Venti cardboard cup, and that's what I was called. No sir's here! 

Also, wasn't too crowded, yay! Five whole stars for Starbucks PV Mall, you guys earned it.
