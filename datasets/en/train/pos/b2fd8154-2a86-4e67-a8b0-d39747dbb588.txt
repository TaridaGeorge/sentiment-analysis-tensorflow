I highly recommend this restaurant, especially for their happy hour! Totally worth it and the food is excellent! My favorite are the Seared Blackened Ahi which tasted superb and the Black Mussels. I tried the escargot, bruschetta and catfish bites as well and they were all tasted wonderful! I highly recommend to try this place as I found it's the best restaurant for happy hours and dinner! Great choice!
