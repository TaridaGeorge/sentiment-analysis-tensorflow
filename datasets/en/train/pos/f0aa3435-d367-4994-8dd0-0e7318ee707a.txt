I luv their fancy decor and their service!! Everyone in there was soooo nice and attentive.  When the kids finished their water, the waiter would bring another clean glass with a fresh straw each time without ever being asked!  I ordered the apricot drink and it was a little strong so the bartender came and brought me back a new one and told me if I still didnt like it, he would make another one till I did enjoy it! Now that is service!!  The food was very tasty as well and portions were just right!
