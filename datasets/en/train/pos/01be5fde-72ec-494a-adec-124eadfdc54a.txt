Visited for the first time on Wednesday, Oct. 10.  Three barbers on hand so the wait was very short.  The cut and care received were first rate and I have difficult hair to cut - stiff, thick Asian hair.  The barber did a masterful job.  The result was greeted by high praise from the severest critic - my spouse.
