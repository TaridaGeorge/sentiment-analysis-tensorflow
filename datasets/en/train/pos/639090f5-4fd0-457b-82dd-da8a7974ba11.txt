Breakfast math.  quality real ingredients + cooked  well = Great food

My wife and I stopped by to find that we were too late, the place closed 20 mins earlier.  Nuts!  
As we were walking away discussing how we were going to come back another day, the door behind us opened and we were invited in!!! yahoo!!! What a treat.  That never happens!!!  Thanks Matt's you rock!
