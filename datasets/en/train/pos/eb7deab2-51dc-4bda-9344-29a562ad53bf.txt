I still love this place and it maintains its rank as my favorite Thai place in the Valley. 

A couple of helpful notes I wish I could do a better job remembering: they open for lunch, close for a break and then re-open for dinner, so you may want to call first to make sure they'll be open when you get there, if it's not normal lunch or dinner time; and, they are closed on Sunday. 

The hospitality is genuine and unobtrusive. The Thai fried rice is really delicious -- Other than that, see my original review for more menu suggestions.
