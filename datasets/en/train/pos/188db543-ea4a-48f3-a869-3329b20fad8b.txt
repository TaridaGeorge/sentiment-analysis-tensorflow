This place exceeds any expectation I ever had for brunch. The food was fresh, the service was amazing. When you eat at Wright's you get so much for your money. You will leave this place satisfied beyond belief. By far the BEST eggs benedict in all of phoenix/scottsdale. The breakfast buffet that is included with your meal was amazing. It is pricey but so worth it.
