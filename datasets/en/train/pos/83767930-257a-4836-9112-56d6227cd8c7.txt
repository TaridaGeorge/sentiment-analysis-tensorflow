Went late, late last night after the Fez hangout.  I feel guilt-free when going there!  We arrived a bit after 11:30 and let me just say I am soooooooo thankful (or scared) to know that it's open till midnight!
Had the peanut butter (yes, another cream in my "Make Me Yelp" boyshorts) and a chocolate caramel brownie orgasm in a bowl.
Service was super-friendly and the place was really clean.
