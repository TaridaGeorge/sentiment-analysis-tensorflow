I work right next to Donna's... and I just think these guys are the bees knees. Great breakfast... totally reasonable prices... incredibly nice staff people. I am addicted to their breakfast burritos.

For what it's worth, Donna's is actually the bakery that supplies a lot of the Asian Markets around town.
