I spent a lot of time shopping to find the best carpet I could buy for the lowest price. I looked at several companies on Craigslist and even tried to buy the carpet and pad myself and just have a different installer put the carpet in for me. I wish I came across these guys earlier in my search process. Not only did they get me a much better carpet than I originally was looking for but the total for carpet, pad, and installation was much less than what it would have been for much lower grades of carpet than I was looking for. The quality of the installation was great! I would highly recommend them for any carpet installation that you have.
