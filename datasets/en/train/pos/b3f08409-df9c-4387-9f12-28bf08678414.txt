I just got back from a family reunion in AZ and if I still lived there I would be thrilled to make this my resident studio.  The staff were super friendly and welcoming and the prices were on par with other studios I've been to. I brought my sister to her first class and the instructor (I think it was Heidi) was really great  about giving her (and the 5 other newbies) pointers on many of the poses.  AND she was cracking jokes, by far the most I've ever laughed in a Bikram class. 

The room is the biggest I've been in, which in some ways was really nice but if you aren't early you can end up in the back row with no mirror space :(

Huge locker rooms too, that alone deserves 5 stars!!
