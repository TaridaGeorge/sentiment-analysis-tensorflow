I'd like to give a huge shout out to William at this location!  I am not in often, but when I am, he never fails to greet me with a smile and nice conversation while ringing me out.  Recently, I bought a Christmas tree and he happily wheeled it to my car, and placed it in my trunk cautiously, avoiding getting any scrapes or dust from the box on my interior.  Great job William!  He's the best!
