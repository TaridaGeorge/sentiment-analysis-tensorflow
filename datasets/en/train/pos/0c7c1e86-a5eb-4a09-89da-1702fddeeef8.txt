On my first trip here I had a very good one, I beat the lunch time rush hour and I ordered a bacon cheese burger. The burger was cooked to order, and very delicious! I wanna come back here during breakfast hours so I can try out a few things I saw on the menu. I have had some bad experiences with local cafes in the past, but I will be back to this location in the future as long as a certain waitress is there to help me, Erin :-)
