I'm surprised this place hasn't been review more! Talk about supporting local business! This place is amazing; from the moment you walk in to the moment you walk out, smiling at the orgasmic chocolate you just bought.  Everything is made with such love, and the shop owner stands 120% behind their product.  I love it, I hope that more people go to visit because that place is definitely a rare gem in Surprise. We need a Phoenix Surprise, Tempe Surprise, Scottsdale Surprise.
