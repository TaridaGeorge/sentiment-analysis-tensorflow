The gluten-free pizza at this place is amazing. In fact, I'd say it's the best gluten-free pizza I've had since I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease seven years ago. Unfortunately, I don't live in Arizona, but I can pretty much guarantee I'll be ordering the spinach special gluten-free pizza every time I come visit family. Bonus points: Redbridge gluten-free beer for only $3 a bottle!
