Had another Great Quick meal here. The calazone with mushrooms' olives & ricotta Cheese. Delicious! As luck would have it they were also televising the EPL Arsenal Vs. Tottenham Hotspur match. I lingered here alittle while longer to watch. While enjoying the game, I had a few good blonde ales from a great local brewery and really enjoyed my calazone. This is a nice little local place to eat great food on the go and enjoy a few surprises as well. Cheers!
