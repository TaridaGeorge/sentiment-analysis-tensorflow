This is a small restaurant with max seating of 45.  The ambiance is intimate with subdued lighting and close seating.  The service is usually prompt and willing to answer questions.  The food is delicious!  With sushi and main entrees hailing from several Asian countries, this place has plenty of options.  My favorite dish here is Green Fuel, but have not had a dish here that I didn't like.
