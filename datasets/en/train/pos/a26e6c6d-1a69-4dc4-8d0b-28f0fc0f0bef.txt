What a great experience. Great location, great food, and great prices. I ordered the El Greco Calzone and it was massive and delicious. I seriously don't remember the last time I didn't finish all my food but this thing was huge. Between that and a drink my total check was less than $15 before tip. Thanks for fun experience and good grubbin.
