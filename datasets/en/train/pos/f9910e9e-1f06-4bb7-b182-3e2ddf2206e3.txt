I was disappointed that they ran out of the mussels I ordered.  I ended up having the short ribs.  Amazing.  My wife had the shepard's pie and I tasted it.  It was also amazing.  I also had the red pepper soup.  Probably the 2nd best red bell soup I have had.  We also had the chocalate covered bacon smores dessert.  Yes we did.  And yet you should at least try it.  Our server was perfect and the decor is very modern rustic.  Make a reservation, this place is packed (as they deserve to be)
