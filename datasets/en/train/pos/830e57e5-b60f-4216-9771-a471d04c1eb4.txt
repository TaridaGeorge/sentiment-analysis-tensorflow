I have not found a gym of this caliber for an unbeatable price of $10 per month with no up front initiation fees or long term contracts. (I think they are charging $24 now)

The machines are brand new and never have to wait for something to open up. 

Short on time? No problem. They have a 30 minute circuit area that combines strength training and cardio. Red light cool off, green light go.It goes by super fast!

They also have personal trainers if you need some extra motivation or want to create a fitness plan tailored to your individual goals.

You will not find classes, pool or court, but most everything else is there to get and keep in shape.
