If you love Italian food, THIS is the place to go! The food speaks for itself, I could eat it everyday. From the salads to the sliders- OMG!!! I love the Eggplant Parmesan, I actually crave this food. The garlic knots are awesome and you kind of get a show out of the owner. His catch phrase- "hey- who's betta than you?" Nobody!"... 
Great prices-, very, very reasonable!  The owner could easily charge so much more for the big taste you get out of this food. Italian food is my favorite so, I've been to so many.....I've been to the little hidden spots to  Italian restaurants that are "high end" and they're excellent- but you pay through the nose- -THIS food is so much better and ,as I stated above reasonably priced. Oh save room for the dessert...kind of like a brownie with cannoli "stuff"...EXCELLENT!!!
