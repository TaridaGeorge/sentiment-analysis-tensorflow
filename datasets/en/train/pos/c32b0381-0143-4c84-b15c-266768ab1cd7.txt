I bought my car at Acura Scottsdale and have always gotten it serviced there. However, after they wouldn't return my second call about setting up an appointment for my 3rd battery in 2 1/2 years, I decided to call Tempe. They got me in with no problem. Since I had been at Scottsdale for the last 2 1/2 years, I was so pleasantly surprised when someone greeted me when I got out of the car, showed me to the area for free coffee, drinks and snacks. This is the COMPLETE opposite of Acura of Scottsdale. I will now be making the 20 mile drive to go to Acura Tempe. They were so friendly, helpful and accommodating!
