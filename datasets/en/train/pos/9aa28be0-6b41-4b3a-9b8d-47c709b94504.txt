Absolutely awesome! Met the owner he was great. The food was delicious! Its a small place so I can picture it getting crowded really quick on a busy lunch. But overall the store was clean, the staff was friendly and funny. My fiance and his dad went back 2 days later and the guy remembered them and their order! They had only been open 10 days as of Saturday and seems to be off to a good start. Kinda tucked away and not many signs on the street to them. So if you know where Kohl's is at 53rd and Bell they are in the same parking on the East end. We will be back thanks guys :)
