Delizioso! Ate here with friends on the fourteenth anniversary of my 29th birthday (I'll let you do the math!) and had a splendid, splendid meal! The service was attentive, the food was delish and I want to go back -- NOW! I'm not much of a meat eater so had the Quattro Formaggi Pizze -- but have to admit the other meat-laden pies were looking mighty good. Complimentary Nutella crepe on your birthday (money)! And I would highly recommend the Bellinis! Evviva! (Sorry, practicing my Italian!)
