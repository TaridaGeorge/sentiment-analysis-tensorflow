I'm from Wisconsin so Culver's is a little piece of home to me.  Midwest meats make the patties for the delicious butter burgers... yes, butter makes those burgers SOOO delicious.
The dairy to make the custard is from wisconsin, the cheese curds to make the fried cheese curds are from wisconsin... it's too good!

There's always vanilla custard, chocolate custard and flavor of the day.  And when I say custard I don't mean ice cream or anything like it... it's FAR better, creamier and more flavorful!  Check their website or drive by to see what the flavor of the day is.
