I went to Discount Tire on Pima to ask about an estimate for new tires for my SUV.  I had the unfortunate experience to hit a curb(rather hard) and my tires have seen better days.  The employee(wish I would have remembered his name) who looked my tires over thought I had at least another 10,000 miles left.  I questioned him to make sure....he told me that if I really wanted new tires he could sell them to me but I did not need them.  I love the honesty and will be back when I need new tires.  I was waited on immediately and treated with respect.  This is the place to buy tires!!!
