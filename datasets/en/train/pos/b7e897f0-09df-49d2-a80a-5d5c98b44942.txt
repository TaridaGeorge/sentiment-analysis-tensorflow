This place rocks, plain and simple. It seems to be run by one big Thai family and they know what they are doing. The service was better than expected but the food was even better. I ordered my usual Pad Se Lew (sp?) and was not disappointed. It is the best Thai food I have found in Phoenix. I'll keep trying new places but right now this is #1 for the area. If you have any other suggestions let me know!
