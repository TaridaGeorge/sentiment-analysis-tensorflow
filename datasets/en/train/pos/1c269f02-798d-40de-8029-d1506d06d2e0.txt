This has been a fave of mine since they were a teeny, rectangular spot on Apache.  I have been so happy to see how much they have grown and the success they have enjoyed and that they STILL make awesome, healthy - so YUMMY food!  The hummus & taboulleh combo is killer - the chicken schwarma is super good - I love the Mediterranean platter... and the fatoosh salad is way too yummy to be that healthy!
