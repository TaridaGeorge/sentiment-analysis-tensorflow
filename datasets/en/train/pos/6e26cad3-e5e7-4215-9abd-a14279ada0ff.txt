I haven't stayed here but have been a repeat pool-hopper during those hot AZ summers. I haven't been there for a while, so I am not sure if it's still fairly easy to sneak in. It's gorgeous, so I can only imagine the rooms are very nice and the food must be awesome. A stay at this place is definitely on our to-do list.
