Please stop reading my Yelp and go here. NOW.  The food is pretty good, the fries are fried in LARD, which may sound disgusting but is 'Effing delish.  The waitresses are cute little naughty nurses, barely dressed,  that will sit and flirt with you no matter how fat n' ugly you are. They have burgers, fries, coke, beer, a full bar (?) and smokes (lucky strikes baby).  This is not a kid friendly place nor is it a good idea to bring the Mrs. here for your aniversary dinner.  But go, and you shall be rewarded.  Also if you finish (or attempt at the very least) a double, triple or quadruple bypass burger they wheelchair you out to your car.  Awesomeness ; free of charge.
