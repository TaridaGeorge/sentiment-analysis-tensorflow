I love this place.  I had to get a couple of pieces fixed and they did an awesome job.  I ended up buying a vintage ring too.  I lost a stone a couple of months later and they helped me find a replacement.  They have some unique and beautiful jewelry in the store and the prices range but you get what you pay for.  The service is great.  In my opinion, It's hard to find a jewelry store that you can trust.
