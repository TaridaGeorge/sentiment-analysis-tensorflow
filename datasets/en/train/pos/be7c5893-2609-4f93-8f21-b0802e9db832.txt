I love everything about Pita Jungle.  They have big portions, a big menu, and delicious food every time.  I've been a loyal Pit Jungle Junkie for a while now and I have never once left being unsatisfied.  I can't say what is my favorite dish [they're all delicious!] but I will say that they have a Raspberry Mango Cheesecake you HAVE to try!

The atmosphere of this place during the nighttime is great for a date, the staff is super friendly, and everything about this place screams ARTSY!
