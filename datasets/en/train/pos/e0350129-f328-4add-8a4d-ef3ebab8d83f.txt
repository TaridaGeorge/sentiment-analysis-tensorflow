Warm butter cake! It is the signature dessert of the restaurant that is sweet and fluffy in a round cake that can feed 2 or 3 easily. I really don't have the words to describe it but suffice it to say you need to get it. And do what we did...have your dessert first! That suggestion got the server an extra tip!

As for the rest of the meal, it was heavenly. The steaks and the sides were huge. I had the prime rib and my companion had the ribeye. Both were delicious. There wasn't anything bad about the meal. 

We were there two weeks ago and the restaurant was full particularly the bar. The dining room is dimly lit and intimate. For those who are visually challenged in dim light, bring your readers!
