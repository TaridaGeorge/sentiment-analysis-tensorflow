We went to Roy's for my birthday on Sunday, May 1st.  I made a reservation online and the online form asked if there was a special occasion, so I entered that it was my birthday and it asked for my name... when we got to the restaurant they had personalized the menu's with a welcome and happy birthday page which was beautiful and a really nice surprise.  Each of us (me, my husband and two teenagers) had something different and everything was delicious.  They also brought a complimentary birthday dessert as well as took a group photo and delivered it to us in a frame.  The birthday desserts as well as the chocolate lava cake and the pineapple upside down cake were a perfect way to complete a wonderful evening.  I really would recommend Roy's for any special occasion.
