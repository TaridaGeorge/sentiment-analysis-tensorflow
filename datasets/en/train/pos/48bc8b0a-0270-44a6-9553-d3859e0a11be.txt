Eating healthy is not exactly the most fun thing to do, UNLESS you go to Pita Jungle!  The desert ridge location has a great patio, a great bar and is always busy!!  The menu is incredible!  The chicken and hummus on the "starter" menu is sooo good!  This weekend we tried the Mediterranean chicken salad and the black bean burger.  Being a meat and potatoes girl, I was a bit skeptical.  The meal was flavorful and filling!  We get take out there all the time too!  If you are looking for a great meal, and a great patio, look to Pita Jungle at Desert ridge!  Yum! Yum!
