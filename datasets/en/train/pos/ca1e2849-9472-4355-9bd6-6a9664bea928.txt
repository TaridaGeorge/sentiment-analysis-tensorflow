My fiance and I stumbled upon John's shop when her car needed some work a few months back, and we count ourselves very lucky to have found him! He is an honest mechanic, which you don't find much of these days! John is determined in every job, quick to come up with a solution, and charges fair prices! Now we take both our cars to him for any problem! John works on domestic and foreign cars (I drive an audi, she drives a pontiac), and if for some reason he can't do the job, he is always able and willing to recommend you to another shop that is just as honest! GO SEE JOHN for all your routine maintenance and unexpected car problems!!
