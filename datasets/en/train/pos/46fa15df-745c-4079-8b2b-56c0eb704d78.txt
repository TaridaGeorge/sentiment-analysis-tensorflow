I am writing this for my son and husband.  They don't have Yelp accounts so I am yelping for them.  

My husband had a sandwich that he said was delicious.  He even noticed how cool the place is!  This is saying something, from a guy who rarely notices his surroundings when chowing down.

My son walks to 32 a few times per week.  He's really into good coffee and claims this is the best!  Loves the outdoor seating and the fact dogs are allowed.  Yay!

There you have it, a review from a couple of my loved ones.  You can bet I'll be going there soon.
