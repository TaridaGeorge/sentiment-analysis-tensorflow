Learned of Cap's when I worked in close proximity to the place... I was told about it by a co-worker who lived in the area.... I have never been so thankful for a recommendation as i have been for this...

I feel my review is rather biased, I say this because the only food of theirs I have tried is their Cheesesteak... They have many other tempting items on the menu (as another reviewer mentioned, the Capistrami), however I can't seem to pull myself away from the Cheesesteak.... 

Cheesesteaks are my thing... they're what i do, they're what i eat... I can say that Caps has my favorite Cheesesteak... followed closely behind by Corleone's on Mill...

Note: Cap's uses real steak on their Cheesesteaks, not steakums :-)
