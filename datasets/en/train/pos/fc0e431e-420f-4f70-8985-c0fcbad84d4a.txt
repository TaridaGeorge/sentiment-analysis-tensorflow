although I have yet to see the museum part - I have been to see 3 shows there and I have purchased tickets for 3 more. The acoustics in the theater are phenomenal and there is not a bad seat in the house! The seats are comfortable and raked appropriately - so no trying to see around someones head. The price is a steal (I hate to say that and jinx it.. but its true) - I am hoping they get a little more variety for the coming season. I love the fact that when you are looking at the lineup, they have a video to see if it is something you would be interested in, even if you have never heard of the act before. 
Check it out!
