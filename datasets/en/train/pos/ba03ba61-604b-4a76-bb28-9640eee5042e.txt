"Don't judge a book by it's cover"!  Well your momma always told you this growin' up and it still holds true today for this little gem.  From the outside this strip mall is a little run down, but don't let this fool ya.  
 I have personally been going here for twenty-four years, and the food has always been consistently  good. In fact their sesame chicken is probably the best in the valley.  
The atmosphere inside isn't fancy/stuffy but instead warm and inviting.  The staff is attentive and friendly, and has been owned by the same family for twenty-five years.
The neighborhood and cliental have changed over the years but a good value for your money hasn't .
