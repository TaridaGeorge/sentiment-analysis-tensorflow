best croissant and pain chocolat since paris. this is the real thing, folks! no. joke.

CROISSANT is supposed to be warm, airy, drippy, buttery, savory, crispy, flaky, crumby, messy, and just DAMN good.
It should be so good, you can eat it plain.
If you want to take it over the top, slather it with fruit preserves and drink with cafe longe or cappucino.

PAIN CHOCOLAT resembles the croissant, but hidden inside is a row of rich -- you guessed it -- chocolate.

Breakfast of the gods. No Joke.

My next browse will be to zillow.com to find a flat across the street from this bakery! I AM GOING TO MOVE to this patisserie!

Now, who can make me a proper baguette sandwich mixte avec crudite?!
