I am in love with this place.  We live in Surprise and make the trek at least once a week to get awesome food.  Everything I've tried has been amazing.  The new firey roasted mango salad is good, the traditional wildflower salad is good, the chop salad (minus feta) is good and I always have to get a chocolate chip scone.  My only gripe is the small drinks and the location of the soda machine.
