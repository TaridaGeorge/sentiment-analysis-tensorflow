Cheba Hut in Glendale is every inch as awesome as its sister stores in Mesa and Tempe.
The vibe is so open and friendly and the service is always the best.

I get the five-oh sandwich on wheat bread... so good. They also have really great soups and the munchies are so good... I cant even tell you with words how much I like me a Cheba Hut Peanut Butter Brownie.
