I guess different strokes for different folks, but I think place is absolutely amazing, and I hope it stays open until the end of time.

The bartenders are awesome. They dont have their head up their ass like many of the places in town.  The midget bar is fantastic as are all the midget seats.  The place is decorated and lit in a way that just says come into this wacky place and have yourself a damm good time.  The music was good on the juke box, and there was a lack of the 30k millionaire attitude that many of these places have.

I love fun original places and this place takes the gold medal for that.
