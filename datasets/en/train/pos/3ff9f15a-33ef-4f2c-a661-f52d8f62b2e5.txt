This little place just opened in a strip mall and you'd probably miss it if you didn't know it was there. Fortunately, I knew thanks to a well-timed coupon arriving in the mail.

The Cajun-inspired fried chicken is juicy with a crispy skin and just-right flavorings. I had coleslaw and mashed potatoes with gravy for sides and they were great. The gravy had just the right kick and the coleslaw was among the best I've ever tasted.

They also carry fried shrimp which I'll be back to try and they have many other sides including fried okra for those with the stomach for such things.

Friendly, helpful, and quick counter service in this to-go-only restaurant. It's small, but it has a big heart. It's part of a chain of restaurants, but this is the only one in Arizona so far. Here's hoping it's not the last!
