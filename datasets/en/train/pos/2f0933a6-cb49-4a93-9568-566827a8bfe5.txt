Last  year I had a company come out and do an AC tune up and they recommended over 2k in repairs and maintenance, I didn't think it was necessary so I ignored them and left the air conditioner to run as it was until this year.  I received a card in the mail for Benefit Air to do a tune up for $64. They came out on time, cleaned the unit and inspected it for over an hour.  They said it was in perfect working order and they didn't recommend any maintenance or repairs. The repair man was friendly and informative. I would use them for any repair services in the future.
