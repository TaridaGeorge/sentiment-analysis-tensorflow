OK, so there seems to be a party going on here everyday!. my local grocery store has never made me want to dance like this place does..haha...so when you want a quick pick me up, head over there:) Music is upbeat, place is colorful, food is delicious and fresh made drinks pretty darn tasty too! Nothing beats the cheap prices for the quanity and quality of food. The Tacos are gooooood.......As for the store part if it, they have a huge selection of things, haven't shopped there much, but the food never fails...
