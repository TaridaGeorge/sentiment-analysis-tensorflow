I am so excited to have the Hillside spot in my neighborhood.  The Croque De Monsieur sandwich was mouthwatering, The Red Velvet cake melted in my mouth. The service was outstanding. I felt like I was in Portland.  I loved it.  Great patio, great ambiance.  Go check it out. The baked good are amazing.  I loved the place.
