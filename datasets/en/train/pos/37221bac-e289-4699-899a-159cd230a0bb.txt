Been MANY times. Done Happy Hour, Bar, Reg. Tables, Patio, and of course the Teppanyaki Tables (Awesome).  Every single visit, all food, all drinks, service always good.  Mind you, if you try the bar on a Thur or Fri Happy Hr, good luck even trying to find standing room, let alone a drink!  You have to fight for your rights.  All in all GR8 experience.  Luv the Kobe burger (& sweet potatoe fries).  BEST SUSHI anywhere AZ.  I think this is a dressy place & hate seeing casual attire there (flip flops, caps, runners).  Great Place for see/B/seen, fabby lunch specials, kids will luv cook tables - always an experience with out of town visitors :-)
