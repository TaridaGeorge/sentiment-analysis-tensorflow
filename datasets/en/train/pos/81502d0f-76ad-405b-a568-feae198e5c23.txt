Zur Kate is a real treat - the atmosphere feel's like your dining in a traditional German pub. The staff are very accommodating to folks unfamiliar with German fare. We loved every bite and managed to eat about half of our massive portions. An accordion player started playing as we were leaving around 7:30pm. The place has some real history if you read the story on the menu. We will return!!!
