This isnt just a Dental Office, this place is a getaway! The receptionists are impeccable and always kind and considerate. The staff behind closed doors are great and this place is clean and organized. Do plan though to make an appt for wks out in advanced, cuz this place is busy but I cant complain, its good that their busy.
