I recently discovered them. I love this nursery! 
The staff are not only incredibly helpful, but KNOWLEDGEABLE. Someone there will have a good answer for any garden-related question. They were super sweet about helping me with my own gardening questions. 

Their prices are also great, competitive with the big stores like Lowe's and Home Depot, but their plants are much healthier. 

In addition, they also seem to care about "society at large", and not just profits. They gave us super-discounted prices for my kids' veggie garden at school. :)
