They are the best in Arizona. These donuts are done right, fluffy, and not too sweet. Rainbow is only 2 or so miles from my current residency and so I went in, ordered a dozen, a mean cup of coffee and left. I sat in my car and ate 1 chocolate with sprinkles donut [a classic] and enjoyed it with that wonderful cup of coffee. They will most definitely be seeing me again within my last couple of weeks here in Phoenix.
