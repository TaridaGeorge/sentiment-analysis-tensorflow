Absolutely delicious pizza, enjoyable atmosphere and down-to-earth prices. Make sure to grab a reservation way in advance, but definitely worth the hype. Cool area, too. Come early and enjoy a nice bottle of wine at Bar Bianco next door. As we walked out after our meal, every employee genuinely said thank you. We will be going back.
