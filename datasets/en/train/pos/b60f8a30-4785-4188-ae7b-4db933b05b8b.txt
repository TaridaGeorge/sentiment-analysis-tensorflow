This place is everything I like when we want a good beer and great food.  Hook me up with the fish n chips and a cold 8th Street and I'm a happy man.  I've tried nearly everything on the menu and it's all very good.  The 1st time I had the veggie pesto pizza I didn't think I'd like it and my bud told me he'd pay but I had to try it.  I wound up taking it home.  I've seen other reviews that the food is ho hum.  Loosen up and stay away.  Hard to get a table anyway.
