Thanks to all the yelpers whose reviews prompted a date night trip to Thai Rama! Woo-freakin-hoo!!!!

We started with the beef satay, which was out of this world. Perfectly seasoned and barbecued meat that was non stop good. I had the Panang Curry with medium heat and was completely wowed.  Hubby's meal - a completely unpronounceable chicken dish with cashews, peanuts, water chestnuts, onion and pepper was similarly amazing. Medium heat that was right on and a non-curry sauce that was to die for. 

Neither one of us wanted to stop eating, but we did and were able to bring home leftovers...With tea, appy, meals and tip the whole thing came to 35 bucks!  OH MY G!! We are so totally going back. .. And we'll use the drive through window too! GO. Its totally worth the trip.
