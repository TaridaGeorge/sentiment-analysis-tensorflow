I've been back to Secreto a couple more times, and I'm becoming more and more of a fan. I have yet to taste a dish I didn't like. This last time I tried the Chicken Smothered Burrito. Ahh man, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This place isn't really a secret anymore; it was packed last night. Still, if you haven't given Secreto a try yet, you're really missing out. Especially if you live in Ahwatukee, you need to go here. Seriously.

Oh, one negative from last night: the soundtrack. What's with the 70's Soft Rock? Didn't seem to mesh well with the "loungey" decor. Why not some Downtempo or something that fits the atmosphere better?
