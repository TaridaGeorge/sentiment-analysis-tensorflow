I always  look forward to eating at Thai Basil when I visit my daughter,who lives in Tempe. Thai Basil's food is consistently tasty, attractive and healthful.....lots of fresh vegetables, .rice and your choice of protein, with yummy curries or sauce.

I am originally a New Yorker,  who grew up with an abundance of ethnic foods and numerous restaurant choices, so I am fussy about my Thai  food.  Recently I brought a friend from Chicago to Thai Basil and she . . loved it too.  We both agreed that the food was delicious and fresh, the service was quick, the restaurant is clean and Troy is delightful!
