Wow what a fun little antique,etc. store I stumbled across the other day!  I stopped in at the Starbucks for a refresher and noticed all of this funky stuff out in front of the store!  I went inside and it was a combination of an 19th century hardware store and art walk.  There was just a little bit of everything-
some vintage, shabby chic, crystal door pulls - industrial - toys. The owners are great and are going to help me find a little period table I've been searching for. Lot of great accents!  I'm hooked!  I'll be back with a vengence!
