I had my doubts about tropical fruit and beef, but this place proved me wrong. I had the beef sausage with mustard, pineapple, onion, cilantro, and some kind of "volcanic" spicy sauce. Also, the tater tots here might be the best tater tots I've had in a long time. 

The owner also was working the counter and was super helpful and friendly for recommendations. 

Heads up, there is an $8 minimum for cards here.
