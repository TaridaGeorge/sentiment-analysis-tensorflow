I have been going to the Chiropractor for about 25 years now.  I just started going to American Chiropractic this year.  They are the BEST!!  The entire staff is knowledgeable and friendly.  Dr. Genet and Dr. Amoia are fantastic!  I usually see Dr. Amoia and when he is done adjusting me I feel great.  Many Chiropractors try to get you to come back several times  a week unnecessarily.  Once Dr. Amoia got my back in alignment he didn't push me to come back several times a week.  I call them when I need an adjustment and after 25 years I know when I need an adjustment.  That usually works out to about 2 times a month!  Thank you American Chiropractic!!
