D-E-L-I-S-H! This place is yummylicious for sure! We went for a charity they were a part of and I had never been there but always wanted to try it. The food was absolutely PERFECT! and the prices were decent! My food was sooo good. I wanted to try everyone else's plate. We all ended up sharing everything! From the appetizers to the meal, the side dish and dessert...we weren't disappointed with a single thing! And the best part is they grow their own food or get it from local farmers right here in Arizona!  

Aside from the food the staff was super AWESOME. They were all nice and accommodated us perfectly! The place is a little crowded, the line is a little long, and it's kind of loud inside but these are all GOOD things not bad! Go in and you will see why I say that! :o)
