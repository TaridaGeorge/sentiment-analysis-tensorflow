I'll admit, I was a little skeptical when I heard "chicken and waffles". It's just a curious combination, especially having grown up in the Northwest. This idea is all new to me.

Then my food arrived. I was no longer a skeptic. I could swear I had a full half of a chicken in my three pieces, and they were smothered in some delicious form of gravy, which I could have just as easily poured straight down my gullet. The chicken was cooked to perfection, as were the waffles. Even having everything mixed together on one plate which could barely contain all of that food didn't deter me one bit.

I do not have a single complaint about this place. Everything was amazing.
