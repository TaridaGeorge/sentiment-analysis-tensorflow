I love shopping at this Target! It's always clean, the food court staff are always so friendly, and that damn dollar spot always has tons of stuff I don't need at great prices. I never spend a dollar. 
Now that this store features a lot of grocery products I find myself shopping here more often. I prefer it over grocery stores and only shop at grocery stores because Target doesn't have a lot of meat, seafood, deli, or produce choices. Great store, great employees, ... Right on Target!
