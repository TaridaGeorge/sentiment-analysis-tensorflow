The atmosphere & food are amazing!  We tried the beef stroganoff and the chicken. The first was preferred. The pretzel fondue is unreal good!  And, the cheap salad was very tasty. The bartender even created a special drink for one who had a taste for something not on the menu. Be sure to try this place!!
