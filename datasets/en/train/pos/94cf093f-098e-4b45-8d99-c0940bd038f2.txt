Surprise was definitely the prettiest stop along our Spring Training tour this year. Parking was free.  The ticket lines (despite having 9 functioning windows) were slow.  Luckily we got to the window to find out they had just opened up seats right behind home plate for only $22!   I was however, completely turned around by entering from the ticket windows to the outflield.  

This stadium is still crisp and clean and have the most seats in the shade out of the three we visited.  We are definitely ready for the season to begin!
