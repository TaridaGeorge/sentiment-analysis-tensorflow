This place was INCREDIBLE!! We got to LO-LO's at about 11am. We ordered and within 2 min we where eating. The portion sizes are very very big. You could share a plate. I had the BABY RAY, 3 piecec of fried chicken with onions and gravy and waffles. GREAT GREAT GREAT. I cannot say enough about this place. The only down side was LOCATION, we ate at the downtown location. If you are scared or think you are too good you can go to Scottsdale, BUT A MUST GO EAT!!!!!
