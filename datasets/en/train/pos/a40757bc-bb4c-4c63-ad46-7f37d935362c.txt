I highly recommend Dr. Julie Crawford of Estrella Internal Medicine and Pediatrics. She is by far the most caring, thorough doctor I have ever had - and I've kind of had a lot of doctors. :-)

Both Dr. Crawford and Dr. Johnson are board certified internists and pediatricians, so you may be waiting in a room with Nemo on the wall - which I find charming. Perhaps it's that pediatric touch that makes her bedside manner so refreshing.
