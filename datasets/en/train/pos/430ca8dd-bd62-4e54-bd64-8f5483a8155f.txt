Since it's trendy to review this circle K.

This is the only circle k I have seen that lets you use the restrooms, and about the one you'd least WANT to use them. It's pretty gross. The bums hang outside all night, but not the indian ones (feather) as they all hang at 7th street and roosevelt. This one is more for the blacks and disabled. I once went here with a few friends to buy beer, and we actually made it to the westward ho and sat and drank our 18 pack of milwaukee's best out in front. A few bums came and made friends with us. We felt right at home here.

So yes, craziest circle k, but not the creepiest or scariest.... if you're wasted.
