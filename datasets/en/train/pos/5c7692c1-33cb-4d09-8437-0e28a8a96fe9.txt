Best burger in AZ!!! I love this frickin place. The golden wings are bomb too. I may be partial, as I grew up in the area, but damn I love this place. And the $2.50 steins are a great deal too. I highly recommend the green chili burger w/ half fries / half onion rings. Great for a quick bite and great for a group that wants to hang out for a while.
