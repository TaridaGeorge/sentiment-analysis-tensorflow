This music venue is set up perfectly! They are efficient and the staff was awesome!  The separation of the dining and actually music ballroom was a nice change, it was good for us because we were able to eat and drink at the same venue.  The ballroom had bleacher style seats in the back and had the middle pit area for those who wanted to stand and watch the band.  AND LASTLY, THE A/C was blasting, kept us comfortable all night and we enjoyed it very much!!! The food, service, venue, doesn't get any better! This was our first time here, and I hope to see more shows at the Crescent Ballroom!
