I eat here at least 4 times a week!! Pat and Ernie are good people and are always friendly!!  Their menu is so much more than just hotdogs.  I've had almost every item on their menu and I've never been disappointed.  The atmosphere is great and their establishment is clean and comfortable.  EVERYTHING is cooked fresh to order and thier grill is right behind the bar, so you can watch your food being prepared and chat with the staff!  I love this place!! Highly recommended!!
