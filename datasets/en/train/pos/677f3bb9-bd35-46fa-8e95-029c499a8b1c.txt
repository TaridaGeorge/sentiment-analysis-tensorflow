This is my favorite TJ's in the area! I love the layout of the store, the employees and most importantly- the goods!! They have the best prepackaged salads and wraps if you need a quick lunch and really good lasagna and other pasta' when you just don't feel like cooking. They also carry my absolute favorite pretzel- the pumpernickel variety! Love those! 
Besides the food, they have an amazing selection of wine and specialty beers. This is where I come to refill my wine cabinet or prep for party at my house. You can't go wrong, especially with the knowledgable and friendly employees who are always on hand if you have a question. Keep on being amazing TJ's, I'm a fan!!
