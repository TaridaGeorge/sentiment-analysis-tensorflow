My name is Aaron Gagnon and I own Miss Details Design, a Scottsdale graphic design firm.  I was really nervous about setting up a website and heard that Extreme Internet was a great local ISP.  Well, it is absolutely true. The service and price points are outstanding. Really nice people to work with.  

I love giving local companies my business whenever possible.  I highly recommend Extreme Internet.
