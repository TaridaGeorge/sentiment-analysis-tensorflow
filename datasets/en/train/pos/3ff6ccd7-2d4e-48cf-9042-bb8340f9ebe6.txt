I was a regular at Mia's first location in Wrigleyville/Chicago. Scott (the original founder/chef and present owner) is the reason Mia Francesca is what it is. Not sure if us folks up here in Scottsdale know how lucky we are he landed on our door step. Food, service, vibe...if I could give it six stars I would.
