Just moved to the neighborhood.  Excited to see a good Mediterranean / Middle Eastern place on Yelp.

Started with the plain hummus, and it was fantastic.  Best I've had in Arizona by far.  We might have to try the beef combo as recommended next time.

The soups were fantastic, especially the tomato cream.

I had a special lamb roast that came with mint jelly and a fantastic rice bed.  My girlfriend had the moussaka.  Both were perfectly seasoned and cooked.  It's sad to think that the lamb I had was only a special and not a constant menu item!

Fantastic staff, extremely knowledgeable and proud of their food.  We'll be back.  Can't wait to try the shawarma.
