We had a really nice dinner here.  The staff was super friendly, the food was excellent and the prices were reasonable.  Our food came out quickly, and the restaurant was clean.  The staff answered our questions and were courteous. We had the Vege Curry, and the Curry with Okra.  We also tried a very cool looking triangular dosai.  It was our first time trying dosai and I think it was the best meal of the night, though the others were quite yummy.
