Stopped in on 2/18 because I was in town for a wedding for a few Monticristo Whites. Ended up spending $70! I can't say enough good things about this place. If first impressions were everything these guys would rule the world. Both employees working that day were outstandingly friendly and outgoing. I've been to dozens of cigar shops and its rare that I find one that has good prices AND good customer service.  Not only this, but knowing I was from out of town they were still just as nice as they could be. No fear of getting ripped off here. I really wish there was a place like this in my town. Thanks a lot guys, the groom was really happy!
