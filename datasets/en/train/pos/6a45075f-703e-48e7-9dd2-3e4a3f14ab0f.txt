I've lived in old town for 5 years and somehow just heard about this place. I'm a little embarrassed about that because of how much I love to eat brunch.

The other reviews are quite accurate, so I'll keep it brief. There will be lots of older ladies with hats. But they go there because the food and ambiance are exactly what you need for the perfect Sunday brunch. I got a made-to-order omelette and loved it. My date got blueberry crepes and she was raving about it. This is a foofy brunch spot, but even the guy's guys would do well to mix in brunch here occasionally. 

If you're looking for the most "brunchy" brunch spot in town, this is the place. Or if your mom or grandma is in town, this is where you should take them.
