As Colin G. said "Sex on bread!"

Excellent home cooked style tortas aguas frescas and many other foods! I wasn't even in the mood to eat, i had just eaten and was full but once i got a whiff of the torta de hamon and carne asada i decided to eat again and MAN was it worth the bloated stomach LOL. 

The sandwiches are big, very fresh, the steak fries are awesome, and the aguas frescas are made from real frutas or rice, not from mix packets. Ive gone back several times and never disapointed yet! 

Definitely worth every penny; its a mom and pop shop i would endorse with my own money if i had some!
