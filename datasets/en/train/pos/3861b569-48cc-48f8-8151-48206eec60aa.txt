I really love this place.  Arcadia Farms is very quickly becoming my go-to favorite spot in the Valley for when I just need to feel good.

The food is great, but I'll be honest - I don't remember much about the food.  Instead, it's the atmosphere.  The restaurant is just so wonderful, and the back patio is so beautiful. 

I also just had a private party here in one of their private rooms, and it was fabulous.  Great service, great food, and the event went off perfectly.  We even had gorgeous personalized cookie favors.

The only bad thing I can say about Arcadia Farms is that it's too pricey to eat there every day, otherwise I think I might!
