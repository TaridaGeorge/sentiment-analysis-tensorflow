One of the best happy hours for food in town. Try the Maui Burger--it's different, excellent, and definitely a steal for $5 (it comes with a good portion of sweet potato fries too). I think that we've sampled everything off of the happy hour menu (which has been so good that we've never found it necessary to go during non-happy hour times) and have always been pleased.
