I have found that most of the gelato shoppes opening up around the valley aren't really gelato. This is the real thing! The only place I have had better gelato was in Amalfi, Italy! Great service, they are happy to let you try before you buy, really good portion sizes, and great selection. Beautiful displays. I also like that they have charts showing how much less calories/fat that gelato has then regular ice cream.
