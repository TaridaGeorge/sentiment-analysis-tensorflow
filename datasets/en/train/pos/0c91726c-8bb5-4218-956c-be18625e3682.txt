I love Lee's homemade alcohol infused ice cream!! There are so many great flavors to choose from. I find myself craving this delicious treat!  The Black Russian Kahlua and the Peppermint Schnapps are my absolute favorite!!! The non- alcoholic ice cream put a huge smile on my son's face!! Great service!! We will be back!!
