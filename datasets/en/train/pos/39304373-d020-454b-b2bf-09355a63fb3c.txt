Great store! It was closing time and I just needed to pick up one item. The manager was so nice and let me in to grab what I needed. He went an extra step to help out a customer when it would have been easier just to say "Sorry, we are closed" and shut the door. Even though it was after hours, ALL of the staff were in a good mood and very friendly. 

Also, the store is clean and well put together. Lots of merchandise. Good location in the Arrowhead area with tons of other shopping very close. From the phone rep to the manager to the cashier all of the staff is super friendly and helpful. I will definitely keep shopping there....!
