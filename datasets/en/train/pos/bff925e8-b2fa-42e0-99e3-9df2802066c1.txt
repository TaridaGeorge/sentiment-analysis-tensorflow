Food - OH BOY!!!!  The wraps are not only beautiful, but huge and excellent, the burgers magnificent, the fries hot and deLISH!!!  Stopped in to watch the KU game on a warm February Saturday afternoon with some friends.  We had called the bar to ask if they were going to have the KU game on that afternoon.  The waitress told us she couldn't find the game, so it probably would not be shown.  BUT....in 15 minutes she called us back (Caller ID scores again), and told us they WOULD be showing the game. The waitress was very attentive, refilling drinks and checking back with us without being intrusive.  Great atmosphere, open patio area, GENEROUS wine pours, and a fabulous bloody mary/margarita (make your own) bar.  Really my kind of place!
