Paula Howell is the BEST colorist around this city filled with fancy salons and people. When she was on maternity leave, I went to another recommended stylist and while she did an adequate job, it was not Paula's keen eye for color and complexion.  This is a humble salon, but when you walk out after Paula's talents have brightened your hair, you feel like a million.  She is so worth trying her out!!
