Had a ladies night out at Prime Bar at the Scottsdale Quarter the other night. Loved the food, Loved the atmosphere, Loved the live music! Showed up at 2 min until happy hour was over and the waitress asked me if I wanted to order off of the happy hour menu for food and drink anyway which was AWESOME! They had 1/2 price drinks and food for the deal- can't beat that. I liked that we could still talk and didn't have to scream over each other but there was still upbeat music in the background.
