Awesome take out Thai food!
I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes to pick up my take out order.  They have always thrown in an extra appetizer for free.  

The pad thai is pretty decent.  I LOVE the green curry.  Its some of the best I've ever had.  And I always get the crab puffs.  Delicious.
