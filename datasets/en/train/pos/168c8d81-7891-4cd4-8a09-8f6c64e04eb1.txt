Love, Love, Love this place!  I'm a craft beer nerd, and this place has the best selection in town.  All taps rotate daily, so you never know what you're going to get to choose from when you go, which is half the excitement!  Their refrigerated case also has pretty much anything you could ask for if what you want isn't on tap - they even have a few domestic mass-produced beers for your friends who aren't fans of "fancy beer". :-)  The staff are well-versed in what they have on tap and the differences, and even allow complimentary samples if wanting to decide between a few for a pint. They have a smaller food menu, but most of the staples are on it.  We love the pizza. And if  you've had enough, but aren't done... you can take a mix-and-match six pack from the case home with you.
