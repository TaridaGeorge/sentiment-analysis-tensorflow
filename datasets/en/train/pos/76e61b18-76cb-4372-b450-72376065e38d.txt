I went here the day it opened and thought it might be just another Italian place..and now every time I go I check in on FourSquare! It's totally addictive..the restaurant...I love their inexpensive Monday-Tuesday Spaghetti & Meatballs. Their onion bread with basil is really great..they even have a little bar. I go here once a week; the staff is super nice. Say hi to Tim the Manager cause He is always a charmer!
