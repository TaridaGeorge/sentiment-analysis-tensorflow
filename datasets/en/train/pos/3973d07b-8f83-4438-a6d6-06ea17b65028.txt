Fantastic service matched by the quality of the food and atmosphere!  The waiter made time to interact with everyone in our dinner party, even the kids!  Great food and drink specials.  Regular menu is not too pricey either.  Lots of tv's to choose from.  They serve peanuts in a dog bowl on your table and you throw the shells on the ground.  Great option for a family dinner or catching that sporting event with your buddies.
