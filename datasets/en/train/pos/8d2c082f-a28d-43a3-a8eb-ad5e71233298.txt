This is my all-time favorite hangout/ coffee shop/ work-out-of-the-office place in Phoenix. The coffee is fantastic (and so is the green iced tea), and everyone is super friendly. But THE thing to go to FTC for are.... 

the vegan brownies. 


I'm not a vegan; I love most meaty things. But if all vegan food could taste this good, I'd plaster Phoenix in PETA stickers.

Only downsides: chairs are uncomfortable, and there aren't enough outlets. But if you get their early enough, neither are issues at all.
