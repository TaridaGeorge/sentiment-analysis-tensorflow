This place has fabulous sales...I bought some cool bbq items...some wire rack thing to grill burgers...a thingy to make stuffed burgers and smash them into perfect circles, a cookbook and this hostess was sampling a capuccino maker...cost was around 2000 dollars i think but the cappucino was very delightful! I love this store, I just got an email that tons of stuff is 80 percent off...Im scared to go as I know I will find some awesome stuff.
