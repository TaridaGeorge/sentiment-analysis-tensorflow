There's not much more I can say about Taliesin West that hasn't already been said before.  I'm a person who doesn't know the difference between an architect and draftsman and didn't know anything about FLW until I visited.  But even I was fascinated with story and details in the guided tour.  I went on the Panorama tour that lasted a little over an hour and visited the music room, the front lawn, movie room, reception area, and meeting room.  
So, what makes this a 5 star review???  
THE WHOLE TOUR WAS FREE!!  
With the new culture pass for the library, you can check this gem out gratis!!  And seeing that several reviewers mentioned the high cost of the tour ($27), it seems as if there is no better time to check it out!
