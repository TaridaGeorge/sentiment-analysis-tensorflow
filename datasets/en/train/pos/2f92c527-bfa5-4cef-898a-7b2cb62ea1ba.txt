Why 5 stars, you ask?  They covered for my screw up when I made the reservation for one too few people.  Our table inside that tiny place was quickly switched to a larger one and we were sat in just a few minutes after arriving.  The fact that it was almost empty on a weekday probably didn't hurt, but I am no less grateful.  The meal was without question the best I've had all year; the duck with risotto was richness beyond belief and better than perfection, and the pork tenderloin and steak frites I tried were excellent too.  All my guests were very impressed with dinner.  Thanks, Petite Maison, for covering for me - I owe you one.
