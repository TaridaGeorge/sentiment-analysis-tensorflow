So it has been a little over a year since I was here last. The place still holds a 5 star review from me. 

I tried the CFS and it WAS good. I never really cares for CFS but figured if I was going to like it I should get it from the best. 

It is a 7inch plus slab of tender beef, lightly battered in a airy type of batter. Think of soda water infused batter. They then slather the middle with a creamy and yummy white gravy. They serve it with mashed and corn with a biscuit on the side. 

The corn was cold, the mashed were OK and the biscuit was just OK. 

The price for lunch was $7.99 of something really reasonable. 

The Chef salad with chicken looked killer.
