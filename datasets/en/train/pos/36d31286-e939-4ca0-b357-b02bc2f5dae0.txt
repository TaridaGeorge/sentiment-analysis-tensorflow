My husband and I LOVE Daily Dose!!  First of all the food is consistently great and they always put a creative and delicious twist in their dishes.  The mac & cheese is amazing!  The pretzel twists, the salads, and the tacos are all fabulous!  We also like supporting family owned businesses. The owner is very conscientious and is always on the floor taking care of customers.  The service was questioned  with other reviews, however they must have corrected it because we have always had good service.
