Sports Illustrated rated this place as one of the twenty best sports bars in the country.  While that's probably a stretch, the food and grog here are very good, and there is always a TV nearby featuring sports.

I'd be torn between 4 and 5 stars for Majerle's, but one time I was here eating a salad at the bar and Thunder Dan himself came up and asked how I was enjoying everything.  Very outgoing and friendly guy, so let's give him 5 stars.
