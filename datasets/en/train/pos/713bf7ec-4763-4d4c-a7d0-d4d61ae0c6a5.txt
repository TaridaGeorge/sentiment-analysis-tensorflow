Went to North one day after work with my wife and started with the appetizers.  Ended up getting two pizza's thinking they would be small since they were on the happy hour menu.  We were wrong!  They were delicious thin crust with lots of good toppings almost normal size.  Tasted great! North also has a great vino selection which we loved to see.  Unfortunately, being filled with za and wine left no room for dinner.  The bright side we'll have to go back again soon because everything on the dinner menu sounded awesome.  Cool atmosphere, very industrial modern, and the staff are great!
