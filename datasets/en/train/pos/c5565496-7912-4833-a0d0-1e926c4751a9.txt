Wow!  That's what kept coming to mind while having dinner at Roaring Fork.  Everything, including the service was incredible!  I had the tortilla soup and the chicken literally fell apart in my mouth.  I ordered the carnitas and it was the best I have ever had.  My husband had the pork tenderloin and it was incredible!  There really is nothing we had that needed any improvement.  This place is definitely a new favorite!
