This is currently the single coolest bar I have seen in AZ.  Kick ass decor.  You could pull off Awesome Dance Party here or Super Chill Out Lounge Night.  The guys behind the bar (Jeff?) were really friendly.  They actually shook my hand and asked me my name.  The owner was also behind the bar the night I was there.  He was pouring a round of my new favorite drink.  I think he called it the Linden Palmer? Clearly a take on the classic Arnold Palmer since it has a delicious sweet tea liquor of some type mixed.  To die for!  I would have had another if we didn't have to leave! 
And an impressive beer list!  Anchor Steam and Dead Guy? Nice.
