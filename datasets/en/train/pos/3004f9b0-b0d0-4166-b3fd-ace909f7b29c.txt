More like...Chez Yummy!  What a quaint place.  Having been to Paris I had high expectations and Chez Vous didn't disappoint.  We tried the Chez Vous Crepe, one of the sandwiches, the Nutella crepe and creme brulee.  Everything was authentically delicious!  They even had Orangina and outdoor tables.  I really did feel like I was at a french cafe watching the world go by.  Service was friendly and excellent.. definitely worth checking out!
