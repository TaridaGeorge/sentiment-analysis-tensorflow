This has a pretty great selection of crafted beers, drinks, and other items.  It was the first time I tried a Draft Beer Float (with Chocolate Stout).  It was not something I would really recommend.  I do like their Sake Bombs, though.

They do think they have pretty good appetizers and desserts.  The Souffle Trio is large (and it is more than enough to share).  Overall, it is a nice place to visit at Desert Ridge.  I would recommend it highly.
