A hole in the wall in South Phoenix.... 

I order: The "Betty Boop" - a plate with 1 waffle and 1 fried chicken breast.  Add a huge mason jar of the sweetest & reddest Koolaid (or Sweet Tea - depending on my mood) and a side of grits drowning in melted butter and I'm a happy girl.

Their Red Velvet Cake is also amazing. 

I know fried chicken and waffles seem like an odd combination but it's really interesting and satisfying - with the syrup and hot sauce for the chicken.... Yum Yum.  

It's one of my family's favorites!!!  

TRY IT!!!!
