Exceptional is the word that comes to mind when I think of Kokomo! 

-Exceptionally fresh toppings and variety of selection

- Exceptionally clean

-Exceptional customer service

-Exceptional frozen yogurt ( not too creamy or icy, they also have sugar-free and non-dairy)

I love the layout of this place, and it is definitely a Chandler hotspot, even during the weekday. My favorite is their Vanilla and Cake Batter with Cheesecake bites! The employees are also very friendly! Two thumbs up!
