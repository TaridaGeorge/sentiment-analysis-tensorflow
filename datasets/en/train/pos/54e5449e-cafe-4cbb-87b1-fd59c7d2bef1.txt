This was my first vietnamese experience, and WOW!

I am extremely allergic to peanuts, and was worried about my allergy impeding on my culinary excursion.

However, the staff at Pho Sapa was more than accomodating, and once I showed that I knew nothing of Vietnamese cuisine, they walked me through the menu and gave me many suggestions.

For my boyfriend and I we ordered
-  Pho Special
- Lemongrass Chili Chicken
- Spring Rolls

It was all sooooooooo good.  We requested spicy level 4 (out of 5), and I actually probably could have handled the 5.

We also had the Vietnamese iced coffee, and it was so good it puts Starbucks to shame.

We ordered all the food to go, and the staff even helped carry the food out to our car with us!

Excellent experience, food, and service, we will be returning A LOT :)
