Bungalow is awesome.  The food isn't exactly healthy, but it's delicious.  I've had the veggie burger and fries and the grilled cheese and fries.  

What?  So I like fries. Don't judge me. 

Moving right along.  They also have amazing bloody mary's- they're spicy and filled with all the deliciousness that is a bloody mary.  

Plus, the location of Bungalow is cool.  If you have lunch there, you can take a walk around Old Town after and burn some calories.
