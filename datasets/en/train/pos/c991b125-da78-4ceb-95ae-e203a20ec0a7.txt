Love Joe's Farm Grill!  The food is tasty, service is great and the environment is fun. We usually sit on the back patio. It has heaters in the winter and misters in the summer. And it has easy access to the drinks and condiments. On the day of your Birthday you get $10 off your meal, just show your ID. My favorites are the veggie pizza and fontina grilled cheese.
