I have not had frozen yogurt after McD's replaced soft serve ice cream with frozen yogurt.  OK, so a freaking long time.  So, I was a little bit not sure when our group wanted frozen yogurt.  I saw all the choices for frozen yogurt and starting to imagine the possibilities and then I saw all the toppings.  OMG!  

Got the oatmeal cookie and vanilla frozen yogurt.  Toppings - mochi mini-balls, snow caps & dark chocolate chips.  Love it!  The oatmeal cookie was SO SO GOOD.  

There are over a dozen selection of frozen yogurt and over 70 toppings.  WOW!  Everything is clean and fresh.  I am hooked now.
