A+ overall.

I sent my parents there for a bigtime anniversary, and from the moment Mabel's on Main picked up the phone the experience was excellent. 

Word from my parents: Perfectly attentive staff, beyond generous Hospitality Director (she even put roses on the table without me soliciting that favor), and a comprehensive sense of perfection in the aesthetic and the quality of the food and drinks.

My parents don't typically venture outside the norm as I do in NY - so I wanted to send them on a more adventurous, magical anniversary dinner.  And they had it!  They enjoyed every second, especially the deviled eggs, the bites of filet, and the professionally-concocted mixology-style drinks.

A+.
