Went here for dinner with my husband.  It was really good.  Everything came out hot fresh and super fast.  They were ready for us.  

I usually go for my usual either the fried shrimp dinner or old timer's big breakfast, but tonight I wanted to try something new.  Their chicken dumplings looked really good.  They came out pretty good.  Very southern home cooking and hearty.  

Our waitress, Sheryl, did a great job of taking care of us.  She was always around and very helpful.  

We were so full, we took a lot of food home, BUT we had to have desert.  We tried their new pineapple upside down cake.  Very rich, but sweet and yummy.  It really hit the spot topped with ice cream.  You get a really large piece too.
