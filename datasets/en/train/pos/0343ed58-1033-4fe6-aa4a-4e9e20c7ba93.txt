Absolutely amazing service. I was greated immediately, they were extremely nice. The office was clean. Checked in online. I did the WAHOO (wait at home or office) with this program you wait where you choose and they call you when they have a room ready. They were very knowledable and personable! If I ever have the need for urgent care again, you can bet I will be back!!  Thank you!
