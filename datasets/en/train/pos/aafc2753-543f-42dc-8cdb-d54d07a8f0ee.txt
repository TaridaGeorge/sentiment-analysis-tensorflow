My husband and I were married here over the weekend, and it was fabulous.

Vanessa was *very* good at keeping in contact w/ us either by email or by phone. She was amazing, absolutely amazing.

The reception was beautiful, as was the ceremony (we had it on the patio of the restaurant). 

The food was great, our guests were able to go to the regular hotel bar in stead of our cash bar for drinks (credit card users), and we received a free suite for our wedding night.

All in all, money very well spent.
