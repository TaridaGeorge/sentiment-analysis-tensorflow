Diners that appreciate the freshest ingredients combined for unique flavor experiences won't be disappointed at Crudo. I have eaten here a dozen times and have enjoyed a dozen great meals. We usually order a combination 8 to 9 items from the three main  catagories (not including deserts) for four of us and share. I have recommended Crudo to several friends and family members and at least two of them have declared it's their new favorite restaurant.
