My favorite breakfast and lunch spot in Scottsdale! 

Went for lunch last week. Had a Mahi-Mahi sandwich with Sweet potato & regular potato fries. Super tasty and healthy. The Mahi-Mahi was cubed with lettuce tomato's and avocados over a flat bread. I didn't eat all the flat bread but folded it and took a few bites, very tasty & healthy. Then I polished the fish and ate 1/2 my fries. 

Then went back the next day for breakfast. Had a egg-white omelet with spinach and mushrooms - and it came with homestyle potatos and a butternut squash hash. One of the BEST breakfasts in months! Decaf coffee was good too!! I think my breakfast bill was almost as much as my lunch bill ~ $17+ so not the cheapest breakfast but I'll reluctantly pay to get my day started off on the right foot and w/ this healthier option.
