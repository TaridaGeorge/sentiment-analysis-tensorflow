This is a great new restaurant in the Grayhawk area!  This restaurant is owned by the same people that own Arcadia Tavern in Phoenix. 

The burger was fantastic; they have a large selection of burgers on the menu but I had the Ring of Fire without the jalapeno with fries; it was only $10.  They also have a huge selection of beers at this place and several TV's to watch football or sportscenter. 

I will be back very soon...
