Fantastic service.  We see Dr Nania, whose opinions I've really grown to respect.  She's kind, and takes the time to explain her decisions/recommendations.  I really appreciate this.  She also remembers little details not only about my two boys but also random things that I've mentioned to her.  This just underlines that we are not just a medical chart to her.
We've also seen Dr Ramirez and Dr Miller a few times, both of whom have been pleasant.  Dr Matsumoto seems a little more rushed (though in fairness, we've only seen her a couple of times and they were both times when the office was fully booked and they accommodated us to fit us in last minute).
I also have to comment that the nurses are wonderful.
We're very pleased with TLC.
