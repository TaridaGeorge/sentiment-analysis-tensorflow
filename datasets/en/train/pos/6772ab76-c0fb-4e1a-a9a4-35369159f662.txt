Dilly's Deli is a great lunch time spot.  My coworker suggested going because it is her favorite soup place, she loves the potato. I usually call ahead because it gets crowded.  They have the best soups, very creamy with lots of flavor.  I'm not big on chunky soups, so I like the crab and lobster bisque (only served on Fridays) and the Wisconsin cheese.  The chicken noodle is good too, lots of noodles in a creamy broth.  I like the sandwiches too, the Southwest (comes with sweet honey mustard) and chicken salad (has lots of dill) are my favorites.  The more traditional sandwich options, like the dilly bird, are kinda boring and bland to be honest. So, go with the more adventurous sandwiches.  I probably end up here once a week for lunch, it's hard to resist!
