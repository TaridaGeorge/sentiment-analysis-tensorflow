This is just about my most favorite spot for an easy meal anywhere in the valley. The food is good, the Kiltlifter is cold and tasty and the atmosphere reminds me of some of the stuff that the McMenamin Bros do with old buildings in the Northwest. Fortunately (or maybe not), it is really close to my office so I eat lunch here often. The only complaint I have about Four Peaks is with the lack of parking. But I will put up with it and I keep coming back so I guess it doesn't bother me too much.
