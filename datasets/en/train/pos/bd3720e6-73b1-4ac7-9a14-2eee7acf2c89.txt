My son told me about Culver's a few weeks ago.  Well . . . I tried it and now I love Culver's burgers and fries.  No, it's not In-N-Out, but pretty darn close.  I happen to like burgers that are a bit greasy and crispy.  And best part is they let you add "what you want".  Lettuce, tomato, mayo.  Love it!  Fries were hot and crispy.  This place is very clean and that is one of the things that keeps me coming back.  Looking forward to trying their custard (not now . . . I've got a standing appointment with a treadmill this week).

Culver's, I'm glad you're in my neighborhood.
