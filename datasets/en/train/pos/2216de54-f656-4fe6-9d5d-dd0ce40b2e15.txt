Great food and wonderful atmosphere. Try the WOK SEARED LAMB
Lamb marinated with scallions and sesame. Served with cilantro over shredded lettuce. This was a surprise menu find. 
The service was prompt and very courteous, especially when the waiter dropped a plate of our leftovers on the floor. What I mean is he had the cooks make up a fresh order for our to go bag. Good stuff. Anywho, the place is polished, the staff is courteous and this place beats with the heart of Downtown Tempe. Stop off and share a plate of noodles on your way out to the scene!
