This review is based solely on salads, carry-out. I eat salads. Lots of salads. Lots of really dull, average, sad salads. Thanks to the countless reviews for both locations, it seemed quite clear that this was the place to go to get some.. exciting salads. EXCITEMENT is what's packed into the salads here! I had the Chicken Tikka salad, which is two hefty, hot chicken breasts and the standard fair of lettuce, onions, etc.. Fresh! Crispy! Tasty! The folks both had the Sausage Salads which were even more incredible.. they pack like.. a pound of really tasty homemade sage sausage, with a really incredible creamy mustard dressing, all under $9 each! What a score!!! I can't wait to go back to Cornish Pasty!
