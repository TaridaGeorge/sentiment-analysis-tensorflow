Ok
There is a sushi bar in this AJs
And, from 2-4:30pm every day (including weekends) they have a sushi happy hour.

The sushi is soooooooo fresh, and with happy hour you can ordered 4 salmon nigiris for 7$
AMAZING

I've gotten to know the regular sushi chefs, and they're totally cool and will basically make me whatever I can dream up that day.

I love it.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it.
Mmmm, sushi.

(also, near the sushi bar theres a section of cold dips.  I happened across a very small container of "black diamond" brand dips.  I've tried a few, and found that the spinach con queso dip is TO DIE FOR.  Its pricey, 7$ for the small tub, but its so worth it.  Everytime I have people over I'll get a few of these black diamond brand dips and my guests love them too)
