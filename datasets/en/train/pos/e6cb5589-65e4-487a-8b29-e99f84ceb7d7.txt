Best.  Massage.  Ever.
I felt restored after my massage and John really customizes the massage to your needs.   I have had massages that were predictable and by the book.  This is not the case here.  Massages at Space are truly eclectic and he draws from a wide variety of styles e.g. Thai, deep tissues, etc.  The ambience of the massage room is very serene and the music selection is soothing but not dull.  Will definitely be coming back!
