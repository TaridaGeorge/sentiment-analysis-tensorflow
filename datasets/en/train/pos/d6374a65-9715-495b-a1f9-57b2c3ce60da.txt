What a great new restaurant.  Cozy booths inside and nice patio seating outside.  Gourmet menu items at great prices.  Multiple salads with different ingredients (kale, corn, etc), fresh bean side dish, so many choices to try. Staff was extremely friendly and we were even pampered with valet parking  We will be regulars.
