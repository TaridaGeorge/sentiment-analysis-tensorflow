Oh, Taste of Tops, I kind of love you.  Luckily, so do many of my friends so I find myself here on a semi-regular basis.  They have great beers, wines and bartenders.  I also should probably pretend it has never happened but they don't ever flinch when I bring in my random slice of pizza from next door.

I'm always down for some Taste of Tops!
