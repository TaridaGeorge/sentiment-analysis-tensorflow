Love this place.  I've driven by there several times and have seen the facade change to its present "lovely & inviting" state. 
I walked in with no appointment and was greeted immediately.  Everyone there was so nice and pleasant.  I had a simple 1 hour massage and left feeling rejuvenated & relaxed.  My therapist was Kelly, she was very proffesional and gave me the very best massage I have EVER had! I was Amazed! She also explained of all the different scrubs and wraps they offer. 
I will be going back for one next month.  It's nice to have this simple yet elegant place in the neighborhood with such good energy. I love good business!
