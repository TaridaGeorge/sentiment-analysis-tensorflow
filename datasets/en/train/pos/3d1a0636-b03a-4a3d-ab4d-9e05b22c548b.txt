Me and my friends are from the midwest and the Midwest has good burgers. OMG Zinburger has the best burger ever. The patty is cooked perfectly and juicy. We had the zin burger and it blew our minds away. The service is also excellent. We didn't like the chocolate shake we ordered and it was replaced at no cost for a chocolate vanilla shake that was incredible. Love the burger. Love the shake. Love the service. Please open up in California.
