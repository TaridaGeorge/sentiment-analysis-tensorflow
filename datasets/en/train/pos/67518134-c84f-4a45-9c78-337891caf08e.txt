Words cannot describe how completely awesome this event was....mostly because I was stuffing my mouth with food all night! This event tops all the ones I've been to thus far. Thank you Lindsey and Tanzy for putting this together!!!! 
I was completely impressed from start to finish. From our glass of champagne to the goodie bag and everything in between. The staff at Tanzy were great-helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu and delicious wines. 
What a nice idea during the holidays too, to seat all of us together and serve family style. We had a blast and can't wait to check out a movie at iPic with our passes!!! Thank you!!!
