Love the food. Love the patio. Love the decor. Love that it is so close to our house. 
The bar is gorgeous. The food is great. They have a Brie soup that is to die for. My husband orders it every time we go there...The food is cooked in their pizza oven and is fabulous. 

Great wines too. I had an unusual white wine last night that was fabulous. 

I think I'd be totally happy with a glass (or 2) of wine, an order of their incredible bread straight out of the oven, and a bowl of brie soup!
