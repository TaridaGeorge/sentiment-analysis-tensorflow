Okay, just last Thursday night my wife and I went to Buca di Beppo and had an incredible dinner.  We split the Shrimp Fra Diavolo, and it was absolutely incredible.  We also had the lobster sauce appetizer that was to die for.  The atmosphere is a typical fun Italian style atmosphere, and our waiter was wonderful.  Old Town Scottsdale is always a fun place to go, and if you're there try Buca di Beppo.  I recommend it highly.
