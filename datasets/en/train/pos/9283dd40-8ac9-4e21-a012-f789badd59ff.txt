Love PF Changs, have been coming here for years. We have had bad services at other P F Chang's however this one has had better waiters. We have tried just about every item on the menu however my favorites are the Shrimp Dumplings, orange chicken, Mongolian beef, double pan fried noodles and for dessert the banana spring rolls. There's many more that i loved but these are the ones we always get. The price is a bit high but we still come the food.
