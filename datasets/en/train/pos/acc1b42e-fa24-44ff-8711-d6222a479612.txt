It's a nice newer gym with a good amount of amenities and a relatively friendly staff.  I see cleaners in the club every time I am there which I dont see a lot of at other gyms.  They have a stretch room, full wet area with steam and sauna, free aerobics classes,  a large number of equip,etc.

The evenings do get crowded even with all the equipment, so I try to get in and out before 5 or so.

All in all a nice spot to get a work out in the area.
