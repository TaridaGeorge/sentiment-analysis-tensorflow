So I used to go to Bahama Buck's in high school in North Scottsdale until it magically vanished! Out of business? Who knows why this busy bad ass little spot stopped serving Shaved Ice and Smoothies to the teenage masses. It wasn't until today (about 13 years later) that I realized there was another one! Hooray!
