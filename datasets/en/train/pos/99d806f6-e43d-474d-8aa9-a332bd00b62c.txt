Christy was great! She made us the most beautiful cake and was wonderful about getting us samples. She doesn't hold your hand every step of the way but she always delivers beautiful and tasty cakes. 

She did my wedding and two of my sister's wedding cakes. We were all very pleased. And I must say, though I don't really even like cake, she somehow makes them super tasty. We already ate the top, even though the wedding was a month ago :)
