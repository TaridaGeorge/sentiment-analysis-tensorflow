Love, love, love Indian Fry Bread house.. so warm and comforting, speaks directly to my heart and my arteries. I only indulge every once and a while but damn these are good. My favorite is the version topped with green chile, lettuce, tomato and cheese, grab a squeezy of salsa and you're set!

Definitely one of those home grown places that you should take out of towners!
