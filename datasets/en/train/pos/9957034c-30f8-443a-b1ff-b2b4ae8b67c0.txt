This place is awesome.  I was walking back to Dillard's, yes, shocker alert, when I noticed this new store.  I knew I had to bring my hubby back.  He loves anything spicy, that's why he chose me, haha.   They have a great set up.  I usually don't taste stuff that is open for the general public, but I can appreciate that they offer tasting for so many of their products.  With so many spicy products, I am sure it will kill any germs.  They few I tasted, really burned, but were delicious.  We ended up buying 7 bottles, some salsas, barbecue sauces, dipping sauce, hot sauces, all of them were great, can't wait to make stuff with them.  I will come back for the Frostbite, I tasted it combined with Margarita mix and it gives drinks a great kick.
