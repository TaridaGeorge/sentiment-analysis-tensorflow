All around awesome experience!  Took advice from other reviews and ordeed the very popular bisquits n gravy (w hash browns &eggs).... ok, so I'm picky, I will admit this freely!  If I'm going to pay for a meal w my money AND my hips...it had better be HOW I like it...and damn good!   
One word....YUMM!  They did my eggs and hashbrowns just like I requested (yes, there is a little meg ryan in me...harry met sally...) and the bisquits n gravy were as good as people said!   Service was great.. Sunday morning...wahoo!  No wait!!  Ben was our server.....very prompt, very personable, friendly and a great server!  can't wait to go back!!  
yay!   love new finds, thanks yelp!!
