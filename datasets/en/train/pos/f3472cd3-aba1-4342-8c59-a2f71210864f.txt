After going there again on Thursday night after the OYE, I have to give 5 stars now.  I tried the Grilled Cheese and Tomato soup.  Holy Shnikes!!!  I could have had that tomato soup poured in a glass, with a straw, and just drank it all night.  Phenomenal!!!  Made me forget about the sauna/bathroom, which was still ridiculous, btw.  The grilled cheese was amazing too!
