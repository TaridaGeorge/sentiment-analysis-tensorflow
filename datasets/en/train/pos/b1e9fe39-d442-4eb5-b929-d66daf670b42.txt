I love Bashas donuts and Friday is buy a dozen get 6 free.  Now in my office we do not need 18 donuts, there is only 2 of us...but I love their custard filled aka Boston Creme donuts..Yum Yum...and they are sooo good.

Let face it, who wants a donut with a little creme filling? Well you do not have to worry about getting only a little dollop.  These donut will not leave you disappointed!
