I love this place, let me repeat, I Love This Place!

I have been here several times now (not sure why just reviewing now) and I will continue to give them my money and shovel their food and drink into my soul.

I have be here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and all meals have been delish.  I especially enjoy the short rib anything (breakfast burrito, short rib dip, and the dinner platter).  Oh and those damn sweet potato fries are the best I have had.  They have set the benchmark for SP fries.  The wine selection is good and I like the way the break it down on the menu.
