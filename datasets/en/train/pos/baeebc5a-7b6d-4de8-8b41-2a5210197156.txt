I have been a customer for 20 years now.  I moved from the east valley years ago and really miss the food. I do know they have had new owners in the last ten years or so and had heard it wasn't the same. I was happy to revisit Buonos last month before an author visit at Changing Hands. Still great! One of the best NY pizza places in town. YUM! If you like that oil on top, greasy NY slice type of pizza then Buonos is for you. Manga!
