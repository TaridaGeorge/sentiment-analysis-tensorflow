Why aren't these guys at the Best in the West Nugget Rib Cook-off?? Their ribs are literally, physically, whole heartedly, ballistically, supercalifragilistically fall off the bone tender. The meat was holding on for dear life but didn't have a chance. I ordered a full slab just for myself. Mmmhmm pick up your mouth from off the floor, I sure did. AND....ANDDDDDD, when they give you your bill they bring it with fresh, just fried, pipin hot mini donuts sprinkled w/sugar!! 

If you're in the Phoenix area and want some bangin BBQ, take yo a55 to Bobby-Q. You'll be glad you did.
