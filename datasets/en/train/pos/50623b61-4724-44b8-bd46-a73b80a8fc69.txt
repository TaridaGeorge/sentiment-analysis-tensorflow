The reviews say it all! 

Brad, called me back within hours of leaving message. I scheduled service for later that week. On the day of service, he called to say he was going to be a few minutes late (kudos in my book for consideration). He arrived dressed professionally, friendly as can be, and with a big smile too. 

Brad, did a great job cleaning my windows and screens!   

I did not shop around and went with my gut based on reviews, and our conversation. As far as price, I was/am happy to pay his rates because Brad, exemplifies quality, professionalism and  friendliness!
