I love coming to this place! The food is delicious and alway consistent! If your lucky enough to get a table out side u will have the pleasure of watching the private plans take off and land! Hopefully soon they will be able to expand so it isn't so crowed! Best breakfast spot in C-town. However the service isn't the best... But I've had worse at other Chandler hot spots...
