Best fast food chicken nuggets.  Period.  

I love this place.  I've picked up food for the family from this location at least 2 dozen times, and they have never messed up my order.  On top of that, service is always speedy and friendly.

As far as fast food goes, it's tremendous!  Not sure how they make their chicken nuggets and patties (and probably don't want to know), but they always taste great.  Love their Ice Dream cups, also.

One minor complaint:  the fries are hit or miss in regards to seasoning.  Sometimes, they put salt on the fries.  Other times it tastes like no one did.  It's a little annoying.  But that's the only complaint I have.  I love this place.  One of our favorite options for family food pick-up night (Thursdays in our household).
