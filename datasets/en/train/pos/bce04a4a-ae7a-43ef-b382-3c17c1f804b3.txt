Wow, what a cool museum!  I went on their free day, which falls on the 1st Sunday of every month but it's absolutely worth full admission price.  My first impression was so cute too because they were letting all the lil kids have fun with sidewalk chalk art.  Then, once I stepped inside the building, I was super excited... they have some pretty impressive dinosaur skeletons!  Walking on, each room was filled with wonder.  It is a must-do if you have kids, and a should-do even if you don't!   :)

See ya there!
