I'm not sure why this place is getting such tough reviews when everyone seems to love it.  The food is phenomenal, the cookies are perfect, and they have an AMAZING turkey cranberry sandwich.

It can be a little pricey, but they always have great deals on cookies (buy one get one).  It's very clean, the staff work quickly to keep wait times down.  I'm not sure what more you could ask from a bakery.
