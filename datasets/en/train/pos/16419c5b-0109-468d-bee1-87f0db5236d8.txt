lol @ Gary in Chandler
I'm not a friend or family member of the owner ... and I love this place. I meet a friend here on a pretty regular basis when one or both of us is craving the biscuits and gravy. She often orders a steak & mushroom omelet. It's exactly what you'd expect from a greasy spoon in IN. I was born and raised in Lake/Porter Co in IN so my curiosity got the better of me when I found a breakfast place called Hoosier :) I'm glad it's as good as I hoped.
