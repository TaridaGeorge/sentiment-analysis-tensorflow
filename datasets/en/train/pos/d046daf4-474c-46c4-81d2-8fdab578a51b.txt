This has the best pastries I've had thus far in Phoenix. Sorry, Sprinkles.

I had a butternut brownie and a gooey ooey that i split with a friend. To be honest, these were some of the best pastries I've had. Like ever. Not only were the good tasting, but the frosting was perfect. Not too soft, but meant to be eaten with the pastry rather than just a garnish. My mouth was watering when I saw the cakes they had inside. I'm waiting for just the right occasion to come back in and buy one.

As far as sweets go, this is the place to stop by. I haven't tried their bread yet, but I hear it's good.
