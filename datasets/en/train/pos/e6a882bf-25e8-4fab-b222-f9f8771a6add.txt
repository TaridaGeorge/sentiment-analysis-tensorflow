I've been back to Miracle Mile at least every other week since my last review and it is always excellent.

I've branched out a bit and tried the chili dog, kosher dog with mustard and sauerkraut and the New Yorker sandwich - all are awesome but I find it hard to get anything other than the Reuben, I swear it gets better each time.  Husband tried the chicken salad sandwich and he was absolutely impressed.  Good pickles too.

I received a nice note in reply to my first review so I tried the mac and cheese again last week, it is much better than the first time so I'll keep sampling during future trips.  I also love the redesign of their website, it's much easier to navigate.
