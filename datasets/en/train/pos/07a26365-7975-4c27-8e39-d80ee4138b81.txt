Mid-summer AC issues in Arizona are not fun!  Greulichs gave me a quote that was substantially lower than the other shop I took it to first. They started the repair and it ended up being a much more expensive fix then they originally thought. But they stood by their word and fixed it for what I already paid them even though it cost them more. They also paid for a rental car since the fix took longer than expected. These days it is hard to find a place whose word you can count on, greulichs is a rare find in that aspect. Customer satisfaction is clearly a priority. They come highly recommended by me!
