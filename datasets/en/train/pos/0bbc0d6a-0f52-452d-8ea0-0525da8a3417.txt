Right up there with Grimaldi's as my favorite pizza in Arizona.  Spinato's pizza is delicious.  The crust is thin and a little chewy, the toppings are fresh, but what sets their pizza apart is the sauce.  The sauce has this rich sweet flavor that is absolutely amazing.

My favorite: pepperoni, onion, and bell pepper
