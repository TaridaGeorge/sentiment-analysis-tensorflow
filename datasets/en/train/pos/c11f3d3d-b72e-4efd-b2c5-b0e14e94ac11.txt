I eat here weekly.  At this pace I will be as big as five guys.

But I can't help it.  Big juicy burger double stacked, topped just the way I like it, and served with enough cajun fries for three guys, this place makes the food I like.  It's a man meal fit for a trucker.   

It'd take five guys just to keep me out of this joint.
