The Superstition Mountains are the perfect embodiment of the Arizona desert beauty that I imagined as a kid growing up in Utah.  This park allows you to nestle up to this unique landscape.  One of the better places to mountain bike in the area.  Ride the place at sunset and you will be amazed at what mother nature can do.
