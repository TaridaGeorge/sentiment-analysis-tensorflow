The owners of Yellowtail Sushi are extremely sweet; my bf and I went on a Sunday and surprisingly it was dead.  We really weren't sure why but it's a sin they do not get more business.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere was cozy, prices are right in line, and (most importantly) happy hour specials ALL-DAY Sunday through Thursday.  I highly recommend Yellowtail Sushi if you are aching for some tasty food!
