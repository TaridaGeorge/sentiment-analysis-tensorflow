Came here to get some ice cream after sushi.  I never knew this place existed until I searched for ice cream nearby.  This place was amazing.  We had the brownie swirl and peanut butter chip in a Sundae with hot fudge, whip cream, and dark chocolate peanuts.  Everything was perfect.  The ice cream was not overly sweet and was just creamy enough.  

Though the price was kind of high for the small amount of ice cream you got, it was still delicious.  
Awesome ice cream! Keep up the good work!
