I generally don't believe five star reviews myself, but this place is the real deal. Great coffee, fantastic food, the best service around. The people who work here are genuinely happy that you walk in. They will chat with you if you want, or let you do your work on their free WiFi.  The Breakfast Buzz has been deservingly and glowingly reviewed here at length, and is well worth the hype.  One of the best surprises on their menu is their tuna sandwich. I am extremely fussy about tuna salad, and this one is my absolute favorite. I could go on, but your best bet is to just come on by and see (and taste) for yourself!
