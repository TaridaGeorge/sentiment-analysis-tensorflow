Get past all the cheezy places east of scottsdale rd by the Martini Ranch/ Axis/Radius,etc and you will find a dive that rivals some of the best bar experiences in the country,
The Coach house is cool,  you see. During the summer and spring training, they offer free bbq on the patio, a great outdoor setting with sprayers, and if you hang inside you have the juke box + video games.
Most diverse and interesting scene in downtown Scottsdale. 
Those that scuff at it, just  don't know! Cheap drinks too!

A classic in AZ.
