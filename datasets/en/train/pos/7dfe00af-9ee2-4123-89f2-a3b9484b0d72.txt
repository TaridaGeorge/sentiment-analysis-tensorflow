S and S has been there since the beginning. They were my first choice in getting off-road tires for my mini-bike in 6th grade,  turf tires for my go-kart in 7th and getting my oil changed as a poor and devastatingly handsome college student now.

    They do require an appointment for getting an oil change and it takes about 45 minutes. Included with the oil change was a full diagnostic of your vehicle and are in no way pushy about any repairs. 

    It's too bad they don't share my enthusiasm for the go-kart version of The Fast and the Furious as much as I'd like them to be.
