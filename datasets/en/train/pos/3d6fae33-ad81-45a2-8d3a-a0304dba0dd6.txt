One of my new favorite places in Phoenix. All the Ah-So's are a chain but they do not all offer the same food choices. I really enjoyed a California roll, the tepanyaki show, and left overs. Delicious miso soup, salad, fried rice, veggies, chicken, steak, and shrimp. The sauces for each were also pretty good. I even had enough food left over for 1.5 more meals. Awesome sushi happy hour prices as well (as low as $2). I really enjoyed the beautiful waterfall separating the two aspects of the restaurant. Hope to come back soon!
