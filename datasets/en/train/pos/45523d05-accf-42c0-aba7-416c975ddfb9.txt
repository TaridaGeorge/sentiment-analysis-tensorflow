I love DV. It's right behind the Pier 1, next to Sub Factory. Yes, the nail techs will talk shit about you in their native tongue, but there are 2 techs I never stray from: there's the hot scrappy one with the bad teeth who always wears really cute heels, and then there's Tina, the most awesome nail tech ever. Don't let the anglicized name fool you, she hardly understands a word you're saying, other than the basics, so I don't have to do the small talk thing. I can just zone and enjoy. I love Tina!

Also, this place is way cheap.
