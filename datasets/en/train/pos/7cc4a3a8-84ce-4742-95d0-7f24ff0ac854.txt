Loved this cute hole in the wall! Had breakfast here with a girlfriend and her young daughter, and loved it! Wish there were more local owned places like this. 

I had the goat cheese, arugula and prosciutto - it was delicious! The service was friendly and prompt but not overbearing - just perfect. Prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is very nice- it was busy, but not too loud or crowded. 

I'll be coming here again for brunch. My only request is that they consider accepting Amex :-)
