This is the place I would go if I were choosing my last meal...it is fabulous!!! I have been going here since I was young b/c my family and I would be downtown all the time because we would be at Suns games...all the pizzas are to die for and I mean that literally...I do not care if I have to wait for 2 hours and I do not care if its raining I am going to wait and enjoy it!!  The owners are so sweet!  I love how they have not changed things or done a lot of expanding!  Everything on the menu is imcredible and if I could I would move in right next door...TRY IT!!!
