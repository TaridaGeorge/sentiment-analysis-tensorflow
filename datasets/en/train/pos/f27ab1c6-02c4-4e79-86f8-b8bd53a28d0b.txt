Sugar crusted brioche buns were DELICIOUS and they have macaroons in large and mini sizes. This was my first time eating a macaroon. I selected the caramel flavored one after being told it was the ''original'' -- so I was easily convinced.  It was yummy but I'm not a fan of creme or frosting inside. I definitely want to try their croissants. They had other pastries items that looked divine. 

It looks like a nice brunch/lunch spot with tables and waittresses, but I just bought my goodies to-go. They have lattes and other beverage options. I ordered an iced coffee that was just okay. 

The place was packed and busy even at 11am with limited parking. That's a sure sign, this is the place to be!
