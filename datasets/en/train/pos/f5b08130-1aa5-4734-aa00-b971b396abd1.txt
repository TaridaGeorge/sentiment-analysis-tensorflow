On Wednesdays the Phoenix Art Museum [PAM] is free, and having dinner at Palette inside P.A.M. makes for a great date night. 

Palette has something for everyone despite the short menu. I had the grilled chicken caprese sandwich with a side salad and a belgium wheat beer.  My date had the grilled quesadilla and a belgium wheat beer. We sat facing the sculpture garden overlooking the twinkle lights and perfectly manicured lawn.

Service was excellent.

Now they are expanding the theater so there is construction to the south view...we just didn't face that direction.

The only disappointment was that all the beers are in bottles, no tap. However, they have a good selection of wines.
