Home to one of my favorite dishes of all time; lobster mashed potatoes at Ocean Club. There are lots of mid-price home decor stores like Crate & Barrel, Z Gallerie, and even a few kitchen/cooking stores like Sur La Table. It's the perfect size to walk around, even when it's a billion degrees out (misters!!!) Parking is usually decent, too. If you do go, do yourself a favor and skip the giant chains like PF Changs and Cheesecake Factory. They're still chains, but try Ra (lunch special or happy hour), North, Zinc Bistro, etc.
