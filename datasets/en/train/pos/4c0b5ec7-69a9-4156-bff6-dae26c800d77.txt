We were staying at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak.  Had a long chat the concierge about the local restaurants.  My favorite North Phoenix restaurants happened to be the same is his (Hana for Sushi, etc).  We wanted top notch meat but are very picky. We refuse to eat grain fed or medicated meat.  He was excited to tell us about Sierra Bonita.  Grass fed, local beef, exceptional flavor, tex-mex etc.  

It is a definite top of list choice for anyone visiting Phoneix.  Close to Biltmore and the Pointe hotels.  Close to Downtown.  

Everything was excellent.  Service, Food, appetizers, cocktails. Desert-  Bread pudding and chocolate something to die for.
