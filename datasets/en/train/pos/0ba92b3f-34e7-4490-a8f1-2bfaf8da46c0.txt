Been going here about 4 years. Hands down the best Dentist I've ever been to. No problems getting appts. (not open Friday or weekends), both he and his wife are very up on current treatments. What is amazing is everytime I've had any major work done the Dr. has actually called me to see how I'm doing. Office staff is very friendly and very little turn over.  

I actually, kind of, enjoy going to the dentist now. And pricing is very fair and they handle insurance well.
