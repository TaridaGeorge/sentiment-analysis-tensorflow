As the number of check-ins I have shows, i eat here a lot. And I never get bored of it! 

The owners are super friendly, and they are always genuinely glad to see you when you walk in. 

The Gyros are probably 2nd in the valley only to Haji-Baba in my opinion, but they are far from the best trick up the sleeve here!

Try the shish-kabob. Trust me, you won't regret it! Also, the souvlaki is amazing, and the dolmas are delicious!

Personally I get a gyro salad to go on my way home from the gym 9/10 times I come, but i also try to change it up and I've yet to come across something on their menu that wasn't delicious!
