Wow!! That about covers it right there! Hadn't had gelato in a while and we stopped in for a treat. The counter was set up like a fine deli and all the goodies were arranged in a pleasing fashion. Of course, tasting was encouraged and I got a scoop of coconut and a scoop of Ferrero Roche....delish!!! Pleasant employees are always good to note too. :O)
