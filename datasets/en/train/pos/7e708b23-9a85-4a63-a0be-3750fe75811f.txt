Great beer choices!  Think i counted 20 something on tap. 

The beers are strong and unique enough the they put the % of alcohol next to each on the menu. 

Cozy on the inside with lots of seating on the outside.  

Great service. 

If u are looking to try a purple/few exotic, strong beers...this place is perfect.  

If ur looking for good prices on pitchers of beer, this probably ISN'T your spot.
