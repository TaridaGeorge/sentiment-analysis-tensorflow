What can I write that already hasn't?  Excellent all the way around from service, pricing and taste!  This time I had the catfish.  Awesome cornmeal batter and flavorful catfish.  I took a friend temporarily staying in Phx working that's from Montana.  He wants to come back before he leaves.  Oh, and great sweet tea also, not too sugary, just right!!!
