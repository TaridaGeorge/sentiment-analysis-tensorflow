This is by far my favorite Indian restaurant in the Phoenix area and the best!

The food is very delicious and the owner, Preet, is very hospitable.

Too bad I no longer live in Ahwatukee.  All I could think of when I was at a restaurant down the street from my place earlier, is how mouth-watering Star of India's chicken tikka masala is.... Yumm!

A must visit!
