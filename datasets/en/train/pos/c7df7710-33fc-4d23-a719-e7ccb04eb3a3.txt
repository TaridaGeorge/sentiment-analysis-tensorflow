Oh how I love Fuego Bistro this place is top notch.  They even opened up another room for more indoor seating.  

I ordered the Pernil Asado which is my favorite and their signature dish.  It is slow roasted suceulent pork served with an orange habanero mojo and local corn tortillas.  The pork seriously melts in your mouth and with the sauce I can't get enough of it.  

For the two sides that go with it I love the Jalapeno Creamed Corn which is actually perfectly spicy and yummy.  I also got the Chipotle Cheddar Mashed Potatoes which are very good as well.  

The Mojito's are a must have I usually can't go without at least two and they have many flavors to choose from I really like the Blood Orange flavor.  

The best part is they usually have groupon's which make it very cost effective.
