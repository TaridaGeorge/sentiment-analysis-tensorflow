Can you say Cherry Cobbler?  OMG I am a huge dessert freak and this is the very best Cherry Cobbler I have ever had.  Not too sweet, not too tart.  I literally licked the bowl.  I didn't even have ice cream on it.  I know they serve a lot of other things and those are also good but this cobbler was outstanding.  My husband picked up dinner there last nite and i remembered seeing a sign that they had cobbler so I asked him to get some too.  

Now do not eat it all because I will be coming back for more and I expect the fridge (I think that's where they keep it) to have a portion for me!
