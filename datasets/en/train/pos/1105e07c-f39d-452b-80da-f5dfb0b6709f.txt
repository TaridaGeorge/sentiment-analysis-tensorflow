My family and I have been coming here for three of four years now on a regular basis. We know all of the staff and the owners and they know us. TJ's is delicious without being too pricey. Not to mention Don's pies are the best in town. Everyone knows us all by name and eating here has become a weekly event. We love TJ's!
