***** This place has always been AMAZING and close to my heart!!! 
Everything from their food, the service and the ambiance!! It is always relaxing to come in to La Grande Orange both the grocery store and or pizzeria. 
It has a very nice uniqueness to it as well as a very tasteful satisfaction. 
     As for our meal my boyfriend and I had their amazingly minty Cesar salad to start, then their exquisite ceviche and to end the MUST, The Rocket Man pizza!! lets not forget their fruity sangria!! VERY YUMMY!!! Oh and yes everything was GREAT!!! :)
    Honestly, last night was my best visit so far, we got to sample their complimentary wine tasting and this to us was a perfect touch for our night!!!
    La Grande Orange is simply as best as AZ gets, so experience it yourself and thank me later!!! :)
