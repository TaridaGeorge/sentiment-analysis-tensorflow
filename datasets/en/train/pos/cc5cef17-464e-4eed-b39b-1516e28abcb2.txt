IMO one of the best in the country.  CLEAN.   Free Wi-Fi!  Easy layout.  Security is fast, and organized.  Buses run from parking lot frequently (max wait is 10 minutes).  Parking is cheap (8-10), and they are upgrading to a train service soon.  

BUT, Best of all is that the food here is not only good, but they don't rape you with prices like most airports.  I pay just a bit over what i would pay outside of the airport.  Thats a miracle.
