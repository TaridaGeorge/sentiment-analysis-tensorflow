The first pizza I tried in the Phoenix area, and so far with 5 other locations, the best.
First time was the lunch special (Just under $2 for a large slice of most common topping choices, at the time,) and another time was at a different location* with my family. The bill for pizza and breadsticks seemed high, until we got them and realized it's enough for a family of 6, not a family of 3.
