I tried this out because I really like Panera Bread and this is really close to campus.  After trying this on a whim, I'm now a regular customer 4+ days per week.  Admittedly it is quite busy around the noon hour, but I feel that is true of most good restaurants.  I order a salad every time I go and they are great about remembering my order  and the tweaks I make to their salads.  They always seem willing to fix any mistakes that I've seen and I think the staff is great.  The salads are great and the cookies which are BOGO are amazing.  Like most establishments in this niche they are what some would call pricey, but the food is good and if you're a Midwestern student you get a discount.
