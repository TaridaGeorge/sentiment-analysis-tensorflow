My most recent visit here was quickly headed into the 2-3 star category, but thankfully turned into a positive one.  The restaurant was only half full, and granted we had a party of 12 show up at 7pm on a Monday night, they told us it would be 45-50 minutes of waiting for a table.  We even offered to be split into two adjacent tables, and still, the hostess was convinced it would still take nearly an hour.

So, we contemplated getting takeout, and were about ready to order when miraculously *poof* a table opened up.  The service was excellent, and the Big Beef Sandwich was great!  Good food, decent atmosphere, although the "Legalize Marinara" T-shirts are a little over the top, especially in a heavy conservative part of town.

Anyway, I'll be back.  The unique and tasty dishes will ensure that.
