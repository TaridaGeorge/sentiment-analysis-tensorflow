I think this is one of the best fast food restaurants in Phoenix...and I can be a very picky guy! I used to live in the Biltmore area and often found myself stopping by for a quick bite. Their staff was ALWAYS friendly and kind...and food hot, fresh and tasty. I think their prices are good and I can honestly say I've never gotten a bad meal there.
As for the other review here, it may be possible this Carl's Jr location is a franchise and not financially linked with other restaurants with the same name. So...location may matter ALOT!!!
