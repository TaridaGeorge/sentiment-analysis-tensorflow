I go to Azool pretty regularly. The service is always good and they have something for everyone. I definitely do not recommend it as a "family friendly" venue, as its more of a sports bar. But they have pool, darts, trivia, off track betting, a large viewing screen and cornhole. Ask about the specials because they tend to be varied and different than the menu items.
