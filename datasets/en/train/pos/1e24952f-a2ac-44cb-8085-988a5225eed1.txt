I made an appointment with Jeannie for a Shellac manicure.  Shellac is awesome but there is a very limited number of colors available.  Jeannie recommended that I go with Gelish instead.  It is the same type of system as Shellac but there are many more colors to choose from.  Jeannie is very friendly and does a wonderful job on nails.  My nails look fantastic!! I already made my two week appointment for my next Gelish removal and application!!  Check out her website if you've never been her customer before as she has some wonderful specials for first time customers!!
