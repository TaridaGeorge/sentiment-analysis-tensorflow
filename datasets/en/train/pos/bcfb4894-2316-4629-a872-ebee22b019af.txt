Mmmm. Delicious tiny burgers. Made with strange and mysterious beasts from afar. Quail, bison, alligator. All delicious and all served in smaller-bite morsels so you can try even more of them. Trust me, at this restaurant, variety really is the spice of life. Nothing I tried was bad. The quail burger was a surprising winner of the spread I went through. But even that was a hard call. Even their sloppy Joe was awesome. 

And if you go, do not forget to try their chorizo and cheese topped tater tots. It. Is. Amazing. A definite do no miss.
