Lyons Roofing came out to do a roof inspection.  They told us our roof was actually in good order - what we saw was not an actual issue with the roof - and that our roof had 8-10 more years of life.  He went further and recommended some things that should be done -- and here is the best part -- they told us what and how to do it all ourselves.  The cost for this was exactly $0.  We will definitely be calling them when we do need more extensive repairs.
