Right across the street from my house is the new park and boy is it awesome!  I love everything about it.  The "Her Secret is Patience" sculpture, the light pillars, the solar panels that offset the park's energy use, the hills, the chess/checker tables, and the rehab of one of my favorite buildings.  Everything about this park makes you want to go there.  In a few years, those trees will be full and cover almost 75% of the park.  Tons of shade, tons of grass, and tons of love for the new Civic Space Park.
