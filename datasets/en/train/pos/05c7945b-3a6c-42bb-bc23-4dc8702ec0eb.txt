My 2 daughters have been taking dance classes here for about 9 yrs. Our experience over the years has only been positive. Before settling on the Ballet Centre, I researched numerous studios, but have always been thankful we decided on this one. Although we drive further out several times a week to take classes, it is well worth it.  My daughters feel comfortable and the teachers are wonderful.  I have had many conversations with Marilyn and have found her to be warm and compassionate with her students.
