If you like the Merc bar in Biltmore area you will like this place. The two are similar . Very sexy dark atmosphere at this lounge, well dressed professional crowd, not to big of place, brick wall interior, leather couches, a secret Scooby Doo bookcase VIP room and great music mixes the night I went.
