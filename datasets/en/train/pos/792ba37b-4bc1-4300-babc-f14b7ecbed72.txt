My husband and I just discovered this amazing place, we stopped by for happy and hour, what a great price and awesome selection. While we're waiting for our order we got complimentary edamame and (what a great treat on a rainy day!) cup of hot miso soup, also complimentary. I've ordered squid salad and I'm telling you its a best squid salad I've ever had, bits my favorite Sting Ray's octopus salad by far! Then we got our sushi, absolutely wonderful, tasted very fresh. I highly recommend every sushi lover to check this place out, this is not your typical busy, loud sushi restaurant, place is small, very quiet and laid back, you can actually enjoy your meal there.
