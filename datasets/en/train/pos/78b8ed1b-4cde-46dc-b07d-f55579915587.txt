Definitely one of the better coffee shops around the area. I got their cappuccino which was very smooth and rich, and my friends really seemed to enjoy the hot chocolate as well.  Their americano was very strong, which is the way I like mine.  I love that they play a variety of music and don't stick to just one genre, and the decor is vintage yet modern.  It's a nice place to go by yourself to study, or with friends for a chat.  The owner is very friendly- we discussed whether a zebra-donkey is called a zonkey or a debra. I only wish that this place was open longer!
