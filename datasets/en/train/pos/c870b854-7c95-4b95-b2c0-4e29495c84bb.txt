Incredible views, beautiful peeks into large stately homes and 'bet on it every time and you'll win' beautiful Arizona weather makes Camelback Mountain a must do for anyone in the area. 

We stayed at a hotel located on Jackrabbit just about 2 miles away so we had no concerns about parking. As we began our hike, our experience was much like Greg M.'s, plenty of other people around ranging from probably regular hikers to most likely first timers. 

No matter which category you fall into, Camelback offers a great work out and memorable views - check it out.
