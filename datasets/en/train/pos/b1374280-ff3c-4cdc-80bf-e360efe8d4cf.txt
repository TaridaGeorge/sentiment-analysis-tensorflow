Just go eat here. Get the cheese curds, I think they may be developing CCA (cheese curd anonymous) soon, but until it becomes a diagnosable disease I will continue to indulge.

Oh yah, the Pine Steak, is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies. 

Oh, oh, oh...  the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in Phoenix. 

Just do yourself a favor and go check this place out. And try the home made ginger ale, tonic or lemonade by them selves... or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits.
