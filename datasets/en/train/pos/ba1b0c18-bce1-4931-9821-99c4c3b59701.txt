I discovered this place while i was getting my hair done at the salon next door (my stylist opened up her own place now so I don't go to this one anymore.) It's a total italian deli/grocery that is authentic in every way. I've only had on thing on the menu because it is the most amazing thing ever - the caprese sandwich on focaccia. Oh...my...god. I got into the whole tomato, mozzarella, basil, balsamic combo when I visited Tuscany a few years ago, and this is the BEST - it's so fresh and delish. I want to go there right now and get one!
