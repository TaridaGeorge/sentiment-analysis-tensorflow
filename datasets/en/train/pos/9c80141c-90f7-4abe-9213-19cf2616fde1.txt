Had a wonderful birthday dinner at CIBO last night. This was about the 3rd or 4th time visiting this quaint house turned restaurant, and now is the time to YELP. 
CIBO has wonderful appetizer of antipasti that played with my taste buds! Fun to make your own brushettas.... 
My husband and I shared the Rustica delightful, delicious, delectable.... 
And the creps...what can I say...I didn't need it, but I wanted it, so I had it, so there! Fresca creps with fruit, vanilla ice cream and fresh whip....Mmmm...food coma. Lovely service and birthday!
