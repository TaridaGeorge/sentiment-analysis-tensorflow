Being a Nutrition fanatic, I decided to incorporate Veganism into my diet (6 days on with 1 cheat day). I went into this place and absolutely everything is vegan so I don't have to worry about modifications. The atmosphere is laid back and cool and so is the staff! Very friendly and unique personalities to be found here.
The coffee is delicious and the food is good as well. I wish there was more to choose from other than only baked goods and quiche, but that won't keep me from becoming a frequent customer.
