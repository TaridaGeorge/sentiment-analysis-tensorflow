Gorgeous property and such friendly staff, from the bell hop to the front desk and housekeeping, I enjoyed my stay to the fullest. 
I was attending a Halloween event this past weekend and booked a room to alleviate any hassle of getting home.

The decor of the rooms were beautiful, modern and classy. The novelty of having a phone in the the bathroom was just comical to me, but nice touch. And the view I woke up to was amazing. Overlooking the pool, and palm trees and in the distance were the mountains. 

I wish I would have had the opportunity to experience more of the amenities the property had to offer but can definitely say, though I literally live right down the street, I will be back.
