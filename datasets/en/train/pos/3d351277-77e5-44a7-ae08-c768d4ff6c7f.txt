Had dinner on the patio with live music last night and breakfast there this morning.  I have to say many of the bad reviews really piss me off.  Good food takes time people!  If you want fast and cheap, go to  McD's across the parking lot.
The food here is better than anything else in Ahwatukee.  I don't mind waiting and the servers are relaxed and friendly.  
Don't change a thing!  If the people who don't like it here stop coming, more great food and atmosphere for the rest of us.
