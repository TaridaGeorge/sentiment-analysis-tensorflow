Sometimes I think people are too hard on Olive & Ivy, the beauty of this place is how simple your meal can be (if that makes any sense)! 

Although there are some $$$ items, there's also some fantastic reasonable dishes. Here's my idea of a wonderful Olive & Ivy dinner- a drink on the patio along the canal, then sit at a booth inside and enjoy truffle fries with the aioli dip PLUS the house focaccia bread with pesto to start. wow. Then I eat the chopped Mediterranean chicken salad to make myself feel better. The salad is AMAZING. Beautiful place, very romantic. It's probably my fav Fox restaurant. Other items on the menu are great too like the fish and risotto. 

I think the service is great, although you can tell the server is bummed I'm not ordering more expensive stuff, but who cares!!?! Still a great experience.
