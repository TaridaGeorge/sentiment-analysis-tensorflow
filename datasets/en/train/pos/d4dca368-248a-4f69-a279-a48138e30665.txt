Delectible & Digging the far out flavors....  I think I steped back into childhood when I walked in to this place.  It's mod retro look and Yummy velvet cake/cheese cake frozen delight made me absolutly gitty as a school girl.  I'm loving the vibe and the fun activities Dana.  Great Job on the new place and my compliments to the whole team.  You get a YEAH BABY from me!  (Austin Power quoted here)

PS  Left a message on the old Type writer,  a couple of drawings at the desk and sat near the TV to watch the Winter Olympics on the TV.  That TV makes it not feel so much like summer. :)  All that was missing was a Hula Hoop so I could TWIRL around alittle. :)
