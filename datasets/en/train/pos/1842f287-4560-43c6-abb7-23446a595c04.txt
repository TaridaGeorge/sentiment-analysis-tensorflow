Although I knew that I needed a tooth pulled (extraction), to make way for an implant, I delayed having this procedure completed.
  
After finally going through an extraction with Dr. Espinoza, I realize now that I should never have delayed this event.  The staff at Central Dental Care was amazing; from the time I walked in the door, to my exit after the procedure. I was helped and comforted through the entire process.

Hosselly and Izzy were both gentle and considerate assistants to Dr. Espinoza from beginning to end.  They both communicated well with me, even when I could not speak.  Finally, Dr. Espinoza kept the atmosphere light with his own style of humor; and yet the entire time I felt I was in very capable, wise hands. 

Thank you, Dr. Espinoza!
