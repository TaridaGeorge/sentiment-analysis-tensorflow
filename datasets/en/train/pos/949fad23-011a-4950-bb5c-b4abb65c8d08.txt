In-N-Out, one of the last great hamburger joints in America.  What I love about them more than anything else though is their consistently great customer service.  The employees at every store I've ever seen are well trained, extremely polite, and appear to be genuinely happy to be at work.  Clearly this company has strong values and their teams live them every day.  Keep it up!
