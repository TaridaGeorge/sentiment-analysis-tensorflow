I took my girlfriend here for Valentine's. I couldn't have taken a better choice. The place was AWESOME!! Very cozy atmosphere, very elegant, very good food, easy access, great service, they even had a live opera singer on stage, it was a very pleasant experience! True, it was more expensive than what I had anticipated, but worthy for that very special date.
