DJ HartBreaks made the party happen at my wedding and I could not have been more thrilled! People danced all night. In fact, everyone was so pumped up that one of my guests started a "soul train" -- DJ HartBreaks was a huge hit! On time, easy to work with, appropriate volume control and timing for all the wedding moments, great mix of party jams and sentimental songs. Of course, I've been to many of his events around town and the same holds true...he always delivers a great night, no matter the occasion!
