Best pizza in town!! Everything is made with fresh, top notch ingredients. The staff is very friendly, they definitely aim to please. We have had several different pizza combinations and also their calzones and have never been disappointed. I"m not a cheesecake fan but they have a specialty cheesecake each month that has been nothing but pure delight every time I've tried it. If you want deep dish pizza this is not the spot for you. Thin crust is the only thing they serve here. Give them a shot. You won't be disappointed.
