Dude, this thing is so cool. I found it while riding my bike along the canal, and I was like woaaaaah! 

The canal is funneled through a maze of waterways and aqueducts and then plunged ~10 feet below. It's a public park and you can basically walk right under it, you're so close you can touch it, but ew don't if you'd like to avoid Salmonella. It's serene and relaxing. If you live in Arcadia then you're lucky you have such a sweet little park in your backyard. Like Fred said, it has an interesting history and is free. I'd like to check it out at night, since I saw lights under the falls which would probably make it look pretty sick in the dark. I'd recommend it for anyone with 15 minutes on their hands!
