This area is very large. I have not even been able to see all of it. It is a flat trail for hiking, walking, walking the dog, or bike riding throughout Phoenix and Scottsdale. Along the trail you will see signs describing what wild animals can be seen there. We prefer to enter the hiking trail on Tatum, just south of Mayo, but you can enter on 56th street and others. There is plenty of parking. I've been told there are snakes and coyotes in the area, although we haven't seen anything dangerous. I've seen many lizards, squirrels, and something large hopping away, but couldn't identify. This is a very peaceful place to walk or bike.
