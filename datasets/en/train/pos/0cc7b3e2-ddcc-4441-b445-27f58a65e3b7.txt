We had an excellent lunch at Oscar's Pier 83 today.  We sat outside on their patio and had a delicious feast.  I had the salmon and my sweetie had the fish and chips with halibut.  We shared and loved them both.  The place is very clean, and we like the friendly service.  This place is great and a good value.
