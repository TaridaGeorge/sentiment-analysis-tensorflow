OMG. These are not the boring bruschetta that you are used to. Fresh, quality meats and cheeses on fresh ciabatta bread. Between the 3 of us we split 8 different ones. Along with a great bottle of wine, 2 glasses of dessert wine, a creme brûlée and coffee, we were all satisfied, and all for under $100 total! I've had $500 dinners that weren't as satisfying. The manager overheard us mentioning that my brother and his wife met here on their first date and we were treated to Prosecco on the house. Great experience, AWESOME food and excellent wines, left me happy without spending a fortune. Alyvia, you would love this place!
