lovely. absolutely lovely.

ate here a few weeks ago with the hubby and a friend of ours. we'd just discovered it several days prior(despite the fact that we've been living 2 miles away for 2 1/2 years!).

we sat outside, where the guys ordered a pizza(which they loved), and I had a salad with walnuts and cranberries, whilst enjoying a delicious Czech beer.

in between conversation, sips of beer, and before our food arrived, we nommed on some great, warm rolls with a bit of soft butter; just the thing to whet the appetite.

the ambiance was perfect--intimate, cozy(especially on a cool Autumn night), and quiet(despite being seated amongst several full tables--the conversation was a dim murmur). another plus? fantastic service.

the prices were a bit on the high side, but definitely worth it--and definitely worth a return visit(or two) before we move next month.
