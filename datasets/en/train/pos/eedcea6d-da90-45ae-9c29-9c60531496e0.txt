Fantastic food + impeccable service = 5 stars, baby.

Let me just say something about Lauren, our server.  She was incredible!  There were ten of us at the table and by the end of the dinner had learned all of our names.  Just absolutely great service.

The food is upscale American classics, like green chile mac & cheese.  Go here when you are in Scottsdale!
