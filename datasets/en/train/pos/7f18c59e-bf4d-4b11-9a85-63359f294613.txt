One of the best happy hour specials in the valley. I was amazed by the food, wanted to ask if they were kidding. $5 Martini? Sweet! $8 for Wagyu Beef on a hot stone? Ahi Tuna Tartare...beauty. Sadly, no gulf oysters for obvious reasons but everything else was amazing. There're doing the happy hour all night too,,,,I feel like a traitor but WOW
