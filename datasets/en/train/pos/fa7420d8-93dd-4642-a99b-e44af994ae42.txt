So, I kinda grew up on chicken fried steak.  Healthy, I know.  Anyway, after moving to AZ I was desperate to find a good chicken fried steak.  I found it here!  I'll be honest.  The 5 stars is really just for the chicken fried steak.  I don't care that much for their other steaks.  The service is prompt so I don't mind too much that they don't smile.  Just bring me my chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes and gravy and leave me alone!  

Oh yeah...if you go at lunchtime the chicken fried steak special is only $7.
