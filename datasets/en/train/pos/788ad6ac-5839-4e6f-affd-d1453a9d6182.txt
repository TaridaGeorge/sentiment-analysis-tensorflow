Miss Tara has been cutting my 3 kids hair for over a year and does a consistent fabulous job! She is patient and listens to exactly what you want your kids hair cut to look like.  You can't beat the price and the kids love to play video games while getting their hair done.  In fact, I love her so much she now cuts & colors MY hair! She has over 18 years experience and is a color magician!! Make an appointment with Tara and you will not be disappointed.
