Just had dinner there with a friend.  Friendly wait staff, good food, decent prices, and close to the Scottsdale Gun Club where my friend and I like to go shooting.

They seated us quickly at a nice table and our waitress was there quickly to ask about drinks and appetizer.  The appetizer did come out wrong as we made a special request for it, but they quickly took it back and brought us out another one the way we ordered it.  

The meals we ordered were very good and I intend to go back.  I especially enjoyed my fish taco's as it is hard to find a place that makes good ones.

I will definitely go back there again!
