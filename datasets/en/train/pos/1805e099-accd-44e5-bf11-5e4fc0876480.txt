Everytime I go near the East Valley I make a point to stop here.  It's so yummy and all the options...I have tried a limited amount of the sandwiches but as a creature of habit.  I always get the #14 and a jackfruit smoothie if I am really hungry.  =) It's so cheap and awesome.  I am glad they opened one in AZ.  
Bring cash and be willing to try some interesting meats or you can go the safe route and eat the "Euro" sammys.
