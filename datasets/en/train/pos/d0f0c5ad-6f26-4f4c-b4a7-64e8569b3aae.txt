I can't say enough about how much we love this place! We first went to the farm for my son's second birthday and did the hayride and petting zoo tour. We loved picking flavors at the milk bar and hand feeding the animals. We went again after purchasing a Groupon and are now Dairy Club members. I really enjoy getting close to the source of our food and trying out all the special nosh that the chefs whip up. From peanut butter ice cream, garlic & herb butter, red pepper aioli, to the awesome chicken salad- we are hooked!
