It was a great, all-around experience. The food was fantastic. First, my girlfriend and I started with the grits and sausage. I have never had grits as creamy and smooth as these. The sausage was cooked well and had an amazing flavor. The Osso Bucco was very tender and the sides were great. The Mac and Cheese side dish is a must. We finished the night with the death by chocolate, which apparently changes every week. Very cool. Excellent service... good job Mike. We will be repeat customers and are probably their best advertising campaign.
