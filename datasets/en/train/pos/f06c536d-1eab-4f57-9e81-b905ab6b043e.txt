This is far and away the closest thing that I've found in Phoenix that rivals the great hot dog/gyro places back home (Windy City Gyros in Wrigleyville [on Broadway just south of Irving Park rd since someone asked]) would be the gold standard-it almost brings a tear to my eye just thinking about it...).  
The gyros are very good, with solid tzatziki and pita.  Their Italian beef is also quite good piled high with giardinera.
