The Tom Kha Gai is to die for. I pick it up weekly to enjoy at home. I also love their Pad Thai, Crispy Shrimp and Cashew Chicken. 

While many of the eateries in Anthem are sub-par, Dara Thai stands out among them. Even if I didn't live in Anthem, it would be worth the drive for their fantastic Thai cuisine.
