Yupha's came highly recommended by a coworker so we went here for lunch.  The ambiance of the restaurant is very cool.  It's open, calm and even though it was very busy, it was somewhat quiet.  

I ordered the Pad Pak with chicken and a side of fried rice.  I'm really sensitive to spiciness and their "mild" has a bit of a kick to it - but not to the point where it's unbearable.  The veggies were cooked to perfection.  My dish was incredibly flavorful.  And that fried rice!  I will be going back there just to order the fried rice!  It's the best I've ever had in my life!

Definitely a great restaurant!  I can't wait to go back.
