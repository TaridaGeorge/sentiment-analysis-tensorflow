I am torn between wanting to tell everyone about this great little neighborhood restaurant and just keeping it to myself so that I don't have to wait in line behind all of you.  Incredibly friendly people running it, delicious and very fresh food, reasonably priced...I loved it.  I highly recommend the pork schnitzel cordon blue.  Be prepared for a wait, since everything is made to order.  They have been open for 3 months and they just got some very good reviews in the local paper, so it was pretty busy last night.  The owner said they are going to add two more tables and she is hiring/training more staff.  You get a discount when you get the food to go, just call your order in ahead of time.  Added benefit:  They have orange soda!  I love orange soda.
