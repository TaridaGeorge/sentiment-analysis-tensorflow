Have been here twice and both times a fantastic experience.   Have had several things on the menu and here is what I recommend.   To drink:  Cosmo Fresh.   I had never had a cosmo before.   Decided to try this and it was one of the best drinks I have ever had. The Smoke and Ginger Margarita is great also.  Definitely very smoky.  Would not recommend the "New Fashioned Old Fashioned."   Entree:   Trout, Halibut (when they have it for a special), filet.   I have had the wedge salad and it was fantastic but they recently have changed the menu and it is no longer available.   Would not recommend the Pear Salad.   Not enough pears or blue cheese.  Crab cakes and brie are great for appetizers.  S'mores for dessert.  Don't miss the pretzel bread.   The service is great and the decor is beautiful.   Great place for a special date.
