My 2011 New Years Resolution was to find the very best mac n' cheese in the Valley.  So far, Cheuvront's is in the lead.  They have 6 varieties, and a wonderful trio option that lets you sample.  Adored the blue cheese, but I think the traditional was reallly the best.  Amazing play on flavors.  

Loved watching the light rail go by, and enjoyed the quiet atmosphere.  Thinking I need to take my dog for patio dining next time.
