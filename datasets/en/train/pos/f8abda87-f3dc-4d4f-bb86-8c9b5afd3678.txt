Sephora is like crack for me. I went in here last weekend for the first time, and I came out thinking how the hell did I survive without this glorious land of sparkly makeup and excessive purfume? Screw you Ulta and Target, Sephora stole my little vain heart. 

I came out of here with several wild shades of eyeshadow including purple and lime green, which I am sure I will never wear since I usually wear neutral or coal colors. But whatever. I am an eyeshadow fiend.
