My Husband and I decided to give this place a try tonight and take my parents along with us. The staff was friendly and helpful. The pork was great, the brisket was perfect (and not fatty!), the waffle fries were tasty and the mac and cheese was awesome and those who ordered them, liked the beans. My Husband liked his Midwest Monster and tore that sandwich up! Even the kid ate the pork slider and we can't get him to eat much of anything these days! Needless to say, we will definitely be coming back for more! The only thing I thought they could improve on are the buns. They were cold, not very tasty or toasted.
