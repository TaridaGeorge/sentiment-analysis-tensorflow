I was a little leary after reading about the customer service. Wow, yes it's busy and the staff is squeezing through small passages since the tables and chairs take up a lot of room, but I have no complaints. The food was AMAZING, the drinks were strong, and the service was fine (aka busy!) HINT: Go early or you will be waiting for a table. I would love to see them move into a bigger place, like maybe next to Postino's in downtown Gilbert! Hint, hint!
