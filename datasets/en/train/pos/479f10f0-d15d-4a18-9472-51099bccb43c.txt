I went there on Thursday at about Noon.  Wow what a fun place to shop!!  If you want to be a part of the buzz finding that perfect vintage, industrial, one of a kind item for your home, this is the place to be.  The prices are very reasonable and you can find small accent items up to large upholstered items.  I had no problem parking and there was uniformed staff on hand to help move larger / awkward items.  Definitely a unique shopping experience.  Loved it.
