What an excellent facility this was! I had never been to the symphony or the opera until receiving Yelp tickets to see Faust. The building was larger than I expected, yet easy to navigate. I didn't feel herded like I do trying to move around Gammage. The lights and decor were wonderful and multiple areas to purchase drinks made it easier. Also the availability of restrooms made it much easier than Gammage. We were in the back section of the lower seating and the sound was wonderful. The play was in French, but a nice display provided subtitles so that we could follow along. I would definitely go back to see either the symphony or another opera. It was a great evening out! Parking was also convenient in a nearby parking deck ($12).
