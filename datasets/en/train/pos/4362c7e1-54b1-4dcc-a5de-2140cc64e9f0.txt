Several things on sale. The sales women were helpful and talkative. The first one I talked to was anxious to help me as she apprroached me a few times. As I was leaving the store I saw a shower curtain I was interested in buying, another sales woman approached me and we had a lovely conversation regarding the curtain. She informed me that Pier 1 doesn't do all matchy matchy, they focus on incorporating colors to form a set. Pleasant experience today!
