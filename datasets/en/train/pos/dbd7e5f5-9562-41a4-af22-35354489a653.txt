We are normally regular patrons of the Vig on 40th Street.  We tried this location out of curiosity.  The high quality was just like the other Vig.
Delicious sandwich we shared.   All of the staff was super helpful and friendly.    This location is worth a trip just to appreciate the decor and design of the place.  Different vibe of the client√®le at this location...not better or worse...just different.  Great job.
