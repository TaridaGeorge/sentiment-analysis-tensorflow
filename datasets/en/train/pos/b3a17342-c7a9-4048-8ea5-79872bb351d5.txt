It takes an astounding restaurant to motivate me to login online to leave a review. This one definitely deserved it.

I've tried several Pho restaurants in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area and this is the best one I've tried. 

The Food is amazing, the staff is friendly, the location is always clean, the menu is not overpriced, the selection is great, and the food always comes out very fast. I always leave this restaurant impressed. 

If your looking for a great pho experience this the best pick in town, no competition.
