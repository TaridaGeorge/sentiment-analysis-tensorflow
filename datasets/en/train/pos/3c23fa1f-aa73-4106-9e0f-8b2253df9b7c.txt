This is my new favorite No. Scottsdale spot for dinner!  Hubby & I went for Fashion Night Out at Kierland Commons and enjoyed their price fixe menu. (It saved us about $12)
Starter - Smoked Salmon Bruschetta  Very smokey and plentiful. So good I took the leftovers home for breakfast the next day!
Main Course-Short Rib with creamed potatoes, carrots and pearl onions.  They couldn't have prepared this dish any better in my opinion. Short rib was flavorful, moist and plentiful.  I had to take half of this home too.  The creamed potatoes were "lick the plate clean" good!
Dessert-Chocolate Cake, this was my only disappointment-kind of bland or perhaps I was just plain too full to enjoy another bite!

We received great service and loved the comfortable, yet upscale feel.
You may have missed Fashion Night Out, but don't miss this gem of a restaurant!!!
