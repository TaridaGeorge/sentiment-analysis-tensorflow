Olive & Ivy has been a business lunch place of choice on three occasions. I originally had an amazing salad, which continues to produce a drooling pair of lips. Can a salad merit 5-stars? Yes. Yes, because I do not enjoy salads 99/100 times. Unfortunately, I don't see it on their menu and I've only been back once since I first ordered it here. If I return, it's the chopped chicken salad (+corn) for me!

They also have delicious mac'n'cheese, pizza, and WINE! Who doesn't enjoy a personal-sized carafe of wine during lunch? There's nothing like jumping into the office with a few of your worries thrown down the hatch like a chilled white in the early afternoon!
