I had my first waxing experience (other then eyebrows) here last week. 

I was nervous as I had never been waxed down south, however the girl I was with was amazing and made it as quick and comfortable as possible. 

The place itself is very nice and has a spa like feel to it. 

I booked an appointment for another 3 weeks so ya :)
