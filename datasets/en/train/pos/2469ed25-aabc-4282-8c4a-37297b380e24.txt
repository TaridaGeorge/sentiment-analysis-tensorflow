This place is a little wacky...  but there's no better place on the south side to get a sandwich,   and when the season's right there's nowhere cheaper to buy berries,  avocados, or other short season fruits.  

Be aware that there is an upcharge for using a credit card here,   best to bring paper cash if you want the best deal.
