My new favorite from this place is their Tom Kra Gai soup... The flavors are amazing! It is just SOOOO good and nothing I could ever replicate at home! Place is a tad pricey so I don't eat there as much as I would like to, but I still get take out about once a month and I have never been disappointed!
