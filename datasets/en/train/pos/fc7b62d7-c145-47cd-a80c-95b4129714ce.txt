My wife and I would like to thank you for the fantastic job your company did installing the new carpet in our home. We were thrilled with the entire process. Everything from the product selection, installation and clean up went perfectly. The installers were polite and really took extra care moving and replacing our furniture. On top of all that, the new carpet looks spectacular. If you ever want another customer to see how our Tuftex 'Heat Wave' looks installed, they are welcome to visit our home.
