Drop in and see Matthew if you're looking for an authentic barber in CenPho.  His place is quaint and nostalgic, the service is personal and genuine, and he won't ask you for an arm and a leg in exchange for a haircut.  He even offered a ride to my vehicle several blocks away since I had walked in.  This is my new barber.
