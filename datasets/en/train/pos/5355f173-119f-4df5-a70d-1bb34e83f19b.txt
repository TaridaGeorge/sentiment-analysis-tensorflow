This is a gem. They recently opened other sites, but this one is the best. Nestled on a small road behind Home Depot, it's a wonderful suburban breakfast nook. 

My favorite meal here is the pork carnitas, and I barely have to wait for a table (don't got at 1030 on a Sunday though, if you don't want to work).

We don't go every weekend anymore, but the wait staff always remembers us and greets us with a smile. We've barely ever had a bad experience here. If you want a southeast breakfast place along the 60, go here!
