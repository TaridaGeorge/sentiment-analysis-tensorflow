Duck and Decanter is not the type of place that offers tons of crazy unique sandwiches. If your idea of a good sandwich involves shaved truffles and roquefort cheese, this is not your restaurant. The sandwiches are generally straightforward, using common ingredients.

However, the reason I keep returning over and over is because I very much like standard deli sandwiches, and I've never had better ones than at D&D. (A simple ham-turkey-salami-cheddar on ciabatta is my usual.) The bread is fresh and soft, the meat is flavorful and shaved very thin, and the portion sizes are just right for me.
