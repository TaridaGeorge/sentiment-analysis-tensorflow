If you're new to the Valley and have absolutely no idea what grows here, come to Baker's.

If you've lived a long time here, know what doesn't shrivel to a dead dry crisp as soon as the thermometer hits 100 and are looking for plants and shrubs and trees, come to Baker's. 

If you're just really, really into flora, come to Baker's. 

Sometimes, hubby and I just drive over to spend a couple hours nosing around all the great stuff here--like roses, garden ornaments [not just plants], herbs, and lots of useful advice. All the folks who work here know their stuff and have probably been working here since they were kids themselves. We've even purchased an apple tree that thrives in Phoenix and produces little apples from Baker's!!

So green up your thumb and get yer yard stuff here.
