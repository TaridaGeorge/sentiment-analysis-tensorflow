On and off for the past couple of years we have used Farmyard as our Community Supported Agriculture farm. They produce wonderful tasting fruits, vegetables, herbs, and bonus products, like their Honey Mustard dressing. I swear I could eat off their tomatoes alone for a month and never get bored! I highly recommend you get their eggs too which are consistently fresh and delicious.  

They're timely on delivery and offer recipes in each weekly harvest basket. I loved not having to worry about what was in the food I fed my toddler or what to buy each week in the store. You're always eating in season and I barely had to grocery shop.

Besides all that wonderfulness, they do garden planning and planting as well as sell seedlings and delectable baby plants!
