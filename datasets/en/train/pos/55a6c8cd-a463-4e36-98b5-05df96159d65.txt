Ice Ice Baby...
Ice Ice Baby...

All right stop collaborate and listen;
Ice Now is here and it's got my attention 
Make some drinks - not warm but frosty;
And believe me when I say they are not costly
Will it ever melt? yo I don't know.
Give them a call and they'll show
To the extreme I yelp like a sandal;
Ice your drinks and get lit like a candle
... Ice ice baby

PS - not sure where the sandal line came in but writing a review in lyric form is a challenge!  This is the best I can do for now...

Need ice for an event?  Call Ice Now! They offer free delivery and their pricing is surprisingly cheap.

And good luck getting the Ice Ice Baby lyrics out of your head... (sorry)!
