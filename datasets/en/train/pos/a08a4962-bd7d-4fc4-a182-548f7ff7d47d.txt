My favorite pasta place in Phoenix. There is a great variety of pastas here, not just the "typical" spaghetti, lasagna, etc.  I think their pricing is great too, with the average dish price being $10.  I personally love the brussel sprout and panchetta pasta, and can't get it enough. The decor of the place is very nice and contemporary and the bathrooms have always been very clean. I can't wait for the Chandler location to open, then I'll start going ALOT more! ;)
