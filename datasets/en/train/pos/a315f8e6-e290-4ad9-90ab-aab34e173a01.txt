As a person who regularly stays at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix, I consider 5 stars a big deal.  I stayed here, with my mom, for one night before staying 2 nights at said Ritz-Carlton, and I was upset that I didn't stay here the entire time.  The rooms at this resort far exceeded my expectations.  It's usually a timeshare type of place, so the full kitchen and separation of the bedroom was expected, but the enormous and luxurious bathroom was not.  I mean, the tub can easily fit two people AND has jets, and the shower is big enough to have a decent-sized party in!  Also, the sofa has a pull out, so the rooms are very accomadating.  This is by far the best place I've ever stayed in the Phoenix-Metro area.  I have a 3-night stay booked for the first weekend in September, and I can't wait!
