One of my favorite places in Phoenix, that I don't frequent nearly enough.  Great selection of wines by the glass.  The atmosphere is sexy, industrial pseudo-warehouse, I-don't-think-I'm-in-Phoenix type lounge.  I think on Tuesdays they have a live DJ in the mix.  

It's more of a wine bar than a restaurant and the menu reflects that - with the heaviest of items being their paninis.  The autostrada panini comes loaded with several meats (soppresatta and prosciutto among them) and cheeses and is amazing.

UPDATE - Great service just recently.  A bit of a wait, but forgot about it because of the great servers - Michelle I think, was one of them.  Just had a Tobin syrah that was incredible...
