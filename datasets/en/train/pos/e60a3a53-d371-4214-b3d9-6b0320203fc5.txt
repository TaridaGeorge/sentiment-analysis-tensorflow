One of my favorite Sunday night go with the family in shorts place!!!
Menu is small but doesn't have to be any bigger.  Just get a burger, the sweet potato fries and kick back with a beer or 2.
The only complaint is that I end up eating too many fries before the burger comes and I am full.  
I would go every night if I didn't care how much I weigh.
