Wow, I love this place!  Westworld is amazing.  It's an outdoor horse arena, with about 10 show rings for horses.  They host mostly horse events, but there are occasional dog shows, the barrett jackson car auction, and a few other random shows as well.  They also have a polo field where the scottsdale polo team practices regularly.  You can watch them play and practice for free as well!

Most of the events are free, and parking is always available.  Rarely do I ever have to pay an entrance or  parking fee.  This is a great place for anyone to go to..families, kids, dates, etc.  Theres also stuff going on pretty much every single weekend, so you can almost always count on something happening there.  Its located off Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and the Loop 101.
