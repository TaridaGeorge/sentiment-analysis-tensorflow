My boyfriend and I tried this place while on vacation after hearing about it on the food network.  We heard it was rated the BEST PIZZA IN AMERICA, and my boyfriend being from NY had to try it.  We headed over after a Diamondacks game and put our name on the wait list which was 2 hours long.  Was it worth the wait?  YES.  Was it some of the best pizza I've ever had?  YES.  Make sure you try the BiancoVerde pizza.  It is unlike any pizza I have ever had in my life.  The ingredients were so fresh!  The waiters were super nice and the food came out pretty fast!
I will DEFINITELY hit up this restaurant the next time I am in Phoenix!
