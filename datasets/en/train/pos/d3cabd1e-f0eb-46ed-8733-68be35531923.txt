After reading a couple yelp reviews, I headed out and hiked the Cholla trail, and sadly did not make it to the summit, due to the nightfall.

Bring water and a FLASHLIGHT if you leave later in the afternoon.  I misjudged the A. Distance to the mountain from my hotel and B. the sun setting so early in late november (duh) 

Otherwise it was a beautiful hike.  As a novice hiker, I found the cholla trail totally manageable, even though the more experienced hikers hate the fact that the noobs are out on the hill.

Had kind of a hard time trying to iPhone the location while driving there so hopefully this will help.
