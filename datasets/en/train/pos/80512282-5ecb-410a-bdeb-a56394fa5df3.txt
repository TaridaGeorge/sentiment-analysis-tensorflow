This place is (pardon my 90's slang) off da hook! They have a variety of Polish (and other European) treats! I'd love to try it all even though I have no idea what is in it. The workers are very, very nice and happy to answer any questions. It's a refreshing menu change from my usual donut places! Though I still order pastries, including awesome donut-esque things filled with jam. Yum!
They also sell imported foods, so if you're looking for a specific ingredient to make a fun European dish they may have it here!
