I love Cho Dang!  The tofu kimchi soup was perfectly seasoned, just spicy enough, and had the perfect texture.  Good flavor also in the bulgogi and jap chae.  The kimchi tasted housemade and not from a bottle and all of the panchan was fresh. Excellent and friendly service and more reasonably priced than other Phoenix area Korean fare. A new fave!
