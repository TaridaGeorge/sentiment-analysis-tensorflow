Had a great time here ==Seafood wontons with vodka voodo sauce...well i had to order it with a name like that...and we had shrimp with beer chili sauce...very tasty...the flatbread that comes out with the gorgonzola butter...one taste of that and i decided i was going to go ahead and cheat on my diet....i had the sea bass and my date had the halibut and seared tuna combo...which i wish i had gotten that...we had fun and took some pics. It was fun to see that bartender at the front bar...he has been there for like several years...everytime i go, he is still working there
