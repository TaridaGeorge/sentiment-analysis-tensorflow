LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!! Best Mexican food we have had in Arizona yet. We are partial as we just bought in Fountain Hills and its close, but its also small and although lively, never crowded or noisy. The service is friendly and fast and the Mexican style music is great but not too loud. You can easily talk and relax. Loved the guacomole dip and shrimp cocktail and the fried ice cream is fab and big enough for four people!!!
