We went here with a group for my girlfriend's birthday and had nothing but great things to say about the place when we left.

Upon arrival everyone on staff new it was her Birthday and promptly wished her a happy birthday before we even sat down. The menus, created just for our party also had her name on them with a celebratory theme. Sure its a small detail but the amount of effort they put in to make her feel special was truly top notch.

On top of the amazing customer service the food was top notch and  well prepared. I recommend the Filet if your willing to spend the extra coin for it. Easily one of the best I've had in town.

Overall, in case you can't already tell, this place earns its five star rating from me and I wouldn't hesitate to send anyone back here!
