Let me just say that if I lived ANYWHERE NEAR Scottsdale, I'd eat here several times a week. I've eaten here twice and loved it both times. The food is amazing and creative and the staff is fun and efficient. The mozzarella and heirloom tomato salad was perfect and the seared tuna salad was a mix of amazing flavors. I had to stop myself from licking the bowl. 
I work in Scottsdale a few times a year for less than 24 hours at a time, but I'll be back the next time I'm in town.
