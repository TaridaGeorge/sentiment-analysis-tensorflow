Love this place. 

Went here on a Wednesday night (avoid Thursdays unless you like pickup bars with guys wandering out of the bar and into the seating area)

They have a huge seating area with teppanyaki tables in part of it, and a big bar in about 1/3 of the place.  

The Happy hour prices made it worth going (before 7pm)

VEGAS roll is the bomb, Spicy tuna is excellent. 

If you can look past the music and the cheeseballs at the bar on the way in and out, this is some GREAT sushi.  Don't bring a date on Thursday!
