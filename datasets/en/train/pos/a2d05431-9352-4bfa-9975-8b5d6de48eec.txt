bagels are one of my top breakfast meals and this place has the yummiest bagels i've ever tasted.

i'm a stickler (p.s. why do i feel like a fifth grade teacher whenever i use the word "stickler"?) for good bread, and i hate bagels that taste like bland, toasted white bread (l;ike the kind you get at safeway).

these bagels are hard to describe - buttery? rich, tasty... a good consistency and texture, pretty much perfect. the cream cheese is pretty good, too - heavier than the "whipped" variety you would get at like Einstein's. and all the standard flavors of both bagel and cheese. the bagel sandwiches are fresh and good, and they have salads, too.

can get busy during the semester in the morning, but not ever absurdly long wait. i think ithey have free wi fi, too.
