Olive Garden is the favorite restaurant of my fiance and myself. We can't get enough of it and we even got engaged at an Olive Garden.

This location is probably the one that we have visited most of all. I love it, but like most Olive Gardens the wait for a table can be long. Other than that Olive Garden is almost the perfect restaurant for us!

The breadsticks and salad are amazing starters, and we almost always order an appetizer of calamari as well. So by the time we get to the main course we are already almost full from great food. Everything I have basically ever had here has been very good! We usually end up with some great leftovers. I love the Andes mints that they give at the end too!
