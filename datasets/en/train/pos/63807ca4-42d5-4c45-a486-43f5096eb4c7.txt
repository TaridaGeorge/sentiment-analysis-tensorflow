Fantastic place, with relaxing healing atmosphere.  I purchased a groupon here for some massages and I'm glad I did.  I divorced my previous spa and after using up my groupon i think I may doing a prepaid option.  Yes, they have prepaid specials here so you can save some $$.  Staff is wonderful, my massage therapist has been administering trigger point and doesn't upsell me for it.  I appreciate it in the age of never ending upsell.  She also gives me after massage tips and is not afraid to apply some good pressure.  This is an issue for us males, who encounter therapists afraid of pressure.  I left sore after my first massage, but it was a good sore, and in combination with my physical therapist, I'm making slow but sure progress on my injury.  Proformance is my first stop for my massage needs.
