Four Peaks has been our "watering hole" for a few years.  The food,  beer and staff are great.  There are several "regulars" that hang out and it really feels like "Cheers" bar.  Most sports bar don't put the level of care into their food, not Four Peaks, their food is fantastic.  If you are a Vikings fan (like me) or a Boston (any sport) you'll feel at home.
