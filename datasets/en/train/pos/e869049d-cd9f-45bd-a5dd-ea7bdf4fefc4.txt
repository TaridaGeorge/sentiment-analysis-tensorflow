Can't get enough of this place. It's adorable and delicious. Also, the staff is very friendly and nice. I love looking at all the trinkets sold here and the baked goods. Our favorite flavors are PB, blackberry, vietnamese coffee, and strawberry. My parents love the butter pecan. Pretty much what I'm saying is that you cant go wrong with any flavor! :)

The only negative is the parking. We love parking right in the front of the shop, but it is usually full. It seems silly to get our car valet for ice cream.
