Great atmosphere. Awesome service. Laid back and accommodating staff. Loved the look of the place and the out-of-the-box menu choices. They focused on their customers enjoyment of the food and overall experience. We started with the crocodile potstickers, they had a unique and full taste. The bruschetta was awesome (especially the honey + prosciutto). The beef + Guinness stew was incredibly delicious. Food was amazing....can't wait to try more on their menu.
