I just bought my scooter a few weeks ago and had no idea what oil it needs.
I went to the AutoZone and they were extremely helpful. Took me to the area for two-stroke engines with fuel injectors. 
They carry both regular and synthetic oil. Surprisingly, the synthetic oil (better than the rest) was only $3.99 for a quart.

Sweetsa!
