This is the best value in The Upscale Steakhouse segment in the Valley. A couple of great pointers.. The Lounge overlooks the city, is amazing, start here with a drink.. Linger into the dining room. For $18 dollars, roughly the price of a small prime rib at Outback, You can have a USDA Prime Flat Iron Steak with Pomme Frittes, and a selection of some of the best sauces on the Planet.. Look into your lovers eyes, and go back into the lounge for dessert. For about 120 clams, you can have a fantastic destination dining event...  The atmosphere, service, and the food is incredible.Def in my top 3..
