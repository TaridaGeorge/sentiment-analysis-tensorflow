Tony is one of the kindest people I have met and a wonder with animals. He is so good with my behavior-challenged dog that I boarded her with him when I had family in town. With Tony's help my fiance and I are no longer afraid to take her out in public because she is not barking incessantly at strangers. 
If your dog needs help, call Tony. He is extremely dedicated to his work and really good with animals. He also works with us to teach us how we can continue to help our dog progress. When we first contacted him I was having second thoughts about keeping our troublesome second pup and thanks to him we are still a two dog family!
