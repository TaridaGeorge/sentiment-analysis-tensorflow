This was the best sushi/sashimi  I have had in the U.S. hands down.  I have had fresher in Japan, but the taste here was incredible.  I live in Tucson, but came up to Phoenix to take my Mom out for a late lunch and asked her where she wanted to go.  It is her favorite sashimi place also.  Even the teriyaki chicken my daughter had was tasty.  Grilled the chicken first, then put the teriyaki sauce over it.
