Had the pleasure of getting together with Scott W. for lunch here today.  It was my first visit to this Macayo's & I ordered a "Mex 'n' Match" Lunch Special, with a bowl of Tortilla Soup, a (Pablano) Chile Relleno, shredded beef taco, steamed mixed vegetables, & of course their great chips & salsa.

The atmosphere here was just right, as was the service from Rene, every bite of the food, & the price, so it's a big 5 Stars for Macayo's Glendale!

Mex 'n' Match Weekday Lunch Special with two main items & two sides:  $9.99

Â¡Yumamundo!     :-))
