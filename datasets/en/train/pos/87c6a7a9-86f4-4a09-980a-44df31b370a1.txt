Healthy Authentic Thai Food at a great price!!!

The new vegetarian menu is a big plus.  It's my new favorite restaurant!  Every time I go there, the owner introduces me to one of her new dishes, so I don't just order sweet & sour every time.....

For groups that buy four entrees, they get the 5th entree free or a free appetizer.
