I took my daughter here for her 6th birthday.  The employees really embraced the event!  They set the table with birthday confetti, had all signed a card beforehand, and were very kind and accommodating.  The chef prepared a few extra treats for us, including mini grilled cheese sandwiches that were quite delicious.

The meal was delightful as well, of course. Our server made wonderful recommendations that were kid friendly.  The appetizer, the muses, the main course, and dessert were all spectacular.

Highly recommended for any occasion.
