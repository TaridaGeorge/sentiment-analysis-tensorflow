very nice museum and time goes fast! i wasn't expecting too much. I was surprised how intuitively they set up the galleries to sync up with the headsets that are given to you in the entrance of museum.  you are able to listen to the sights and sounds of Africa, Asia, Latin America,US, and Europe. some of my favorites were the the Arizona native American big drum, the Bahamas, Brazil.  Aileen joined me and she didn't have enough time to visit each exhibit but I was able to squeeze in everything by quickly going through the exhibits that did not interest me as much.  I think its worth the fifteen dollar admission fee since i was able to learn and enjoy the entire MiM experience. I will be adding some pictures.
