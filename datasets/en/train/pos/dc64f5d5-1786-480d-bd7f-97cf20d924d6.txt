Oh how I love Jose and his tailor skills!  A friend recommended this place to me when I had to get one of many bridesmaides dresses altered.  It's back in an older strip mall, by Active Body, and upstairs but once you find it you won't go anywhere else.  He's a quiet, sweet man who knows his stuff.....and will get it done quickly.
