Dr Erik has been great in helping me with my dental nightmare!  After trying a few dentists over the years I am very pleased with my choice in Dr Pease.  His knowledge and expertise in dentistry is second to none and I would recommend him to anyone needing dental work!  His staff were great at prepping my crowns and making me feel comfortable every time I came in!
