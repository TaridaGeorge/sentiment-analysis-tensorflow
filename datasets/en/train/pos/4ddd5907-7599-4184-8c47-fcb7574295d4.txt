Great selection of steak and seafood. Not a place you go without increasing the limit on that Visa a little. We got the special salad, steak, seafood, 2 sides and dessert. After all was said and done we paid a little less than$200.00 for for an amazing meal and two glasses of wine for two people. It was worth every penny. We both got the Fillet Oskar, crab cakes,  asparagus, mashed potatoes, cheese cake, and the Merlot. It was a cozy 1940's type atmosphere with dim lights and attentive wait staff. It made me feel fancy :)
