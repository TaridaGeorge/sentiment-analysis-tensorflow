Boba Tea House is always consistent with their boba.  I've been to so many boba places.  Many places just don't make them quite right -- if it's right, it's soft and squishy; the places that get it wrong don't cook it long enough, and it turns out too hard and chewy.  Sometimes I'll find a place that made good boba, but when I return on a different visit, it's not the same.  Boba Tea House gets it right every time.  I always just order their boba milk tea.  My sister likes their mini-boba, but that's only good if you like a lot of little boba balls swishing around in your mouth -- it kind of tickles. 

The service has been good here on all of my recent visits, and I'm always satisfied.  I pretty much always stop here when I go shopping at Lee Lee's.
