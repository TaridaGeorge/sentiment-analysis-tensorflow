This is one of my favorite spots in Phoenix. The pizza is wonderful, the pesto salad is absolutely amazing, and the fresh fruit crepe is delicious. They have a great patio and I've never had bad service here even on busy nights. The servers always remember my husband and me even though we don't go more than once every few months.
