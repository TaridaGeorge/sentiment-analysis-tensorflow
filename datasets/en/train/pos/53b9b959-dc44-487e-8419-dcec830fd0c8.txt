This is a great addition to the Neighborhood. The chocolate is divine and the coffee outstanding! I can't forget about the pastries either. I had the Mocca Java cookie today along with a few chocolates. So good! I highly recommend the Salted Caramels and the White Chocolate and Goat Cheese Ganache truffle!

If you are in the area go and check this place out. I promise you won't be disappointed!
