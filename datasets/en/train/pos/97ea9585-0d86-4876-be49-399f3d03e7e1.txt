Zipp's is my spot! I love their happy hour, it's till 7:00 PM! I have not tried much of their food, because I always go because I am craving the wings! Even better, while you are eating and or drinking there are plenty of TV's so you can watch your favorite team! So if you want a reasonable priced meal, and some entertainment, head on over to Zipp's!  I recently sat outside on the patio in the evening with the fare pit going...it was great! So head on out tonight to Zipp's tonight, I might be there!!
