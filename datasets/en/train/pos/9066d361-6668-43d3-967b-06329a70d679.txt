This pizza is awesome. I am such a critical pizza consumer and I can tell you that this is so good. Crust perfect, with just enough crisp balances with a warm softness, not a cracker, not mush. Sauce tastes like tomatoes (not too sweet, but great quality taste). I would drive an hour or more to eat there again.
