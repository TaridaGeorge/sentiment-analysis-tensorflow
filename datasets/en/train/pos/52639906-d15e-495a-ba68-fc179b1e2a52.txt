We broke a hiking pole and expected to ppurchase a replacement set. Instead, Jeff. A remarkably knowledgable and effective customer service rep offerred to repair the pole. Minutes later, he returned with the pole in like new condition. Great customer service!! In the end we purchased an additional pair of poles as well. Count us as very satisfied customers!! REI ROCKS!! Thanks again. Jeff!!
