I've been going to Valley spas for about 10 years now, and while there are some fantastic, beautiful spas around, I still hadn't found the right massage therapist.  I finally found John.

I've never scheduled a massage on an "emergency basis".  After months of traveling without any down time, my body had finally said enough.  With how tight my shoulders, neck and lower back were I thought I must be walking around looking like Quasimodo.  Within one 60 minute session, I felt like the world had been righted.  

I was a little hesitant trying someone new, based only on Yelp reviews, and going to their house, but when every single person who has done a review has concurred with 5 stars you know that something special is going on at Space.  I'm so glad I gave it a whirl!  I booked my follow up appointment before I even left.
