I am soo impressed with the level of customer service at this store. I went in today because I had a slow leak in one of my tires. They not only patched the leak for me, but also took the time to reset all of the tire sensors (that the last tire place screwed up) to the correct tire. I was so impressed with how fast and friendly everyone was. Best of all it was FREE! I will never go anywhere else again.
