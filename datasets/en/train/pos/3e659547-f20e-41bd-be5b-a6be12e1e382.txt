I've been here a number of times and have had consistent quality and service every time.  With the countless restaurants I eat at for my work this and Curious Kumquat (Silver City, NM) are the top two...and I eat at the best of the best.  Really wonderfully prepared food.  If you're picky just stay away, but if you want quality ingredients prepared will and in interesting ways, get over here.  And Eliott has always been such a gracious host to me - I normally dine alone and he knows how to make me feel welcome but not awkward.  As for the cotton candy...I could do without that shtick.
