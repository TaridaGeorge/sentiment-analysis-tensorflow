My husband started going to this restaurant over 4 years ago and I have been going for over 3 years. It is family owned and they always remember us, no matter how long it is between visits. It is so awesome to walk into a place and see faces that you remember. They are very attentive and service is quick! 

They have a huge variety of crepes from sweet to savory. The Italian sodas are amazing and their hot chocolate is so fancy! 

I recommend this place to everyone!
