Visiting family is Arizona and stopped by for a quick bite to eat. The decor was great, restaurant was nice and clean and service was decent. It was our servers first day so it's hard to judge. However the food.... AMAZING. Make sure you ask for your pizza well done. We also had the pasta primavera with a tomato cream sauce, best tasting pasta I've had in a while. The sangria wasn't the best I've had but it certainly wasn't terrible. GO, you won't be disappointed!
