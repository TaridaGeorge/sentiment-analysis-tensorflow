I visited Drybar today for the first time and left a (wanna-be) regular. Heather was my stylist and helped me decide on a Cosmo-tai...lots of loose, large curls and volume for my normally straight hair. By the time her work was done she turned me around and I went straight to hair heaven! It was seriously the hair I've dreamed of having. My husband commented it was the best my hair has ever looked and my friends were also in awe. Drybar offers memberships which I would gladly purchase if it weren't for the fact that I'm moving to Denver in two weeks. Sadly, there are no locations there but I'll be back to this location whenever I'm in town!
