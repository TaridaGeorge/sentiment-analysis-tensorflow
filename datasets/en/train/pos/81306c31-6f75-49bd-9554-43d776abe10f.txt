I have been to most of the local fish stores and this is one of my favorites. Its owned by a great couple who do  a fantastic job of keeping a nice clean storefront.  The Livestock is always healthy and they have lots of dry goods as well. On 2 occasions they were out of stock on something and they ordered it for me and it was there in about 2 days.  If you want REALLY good friendly service this is the place to shop, its only the owners who work here and they want your business so they go above and beyond to treat you well. They are more focused on salt water and fresh water fish, they have a small coral section and hopefully soon they will get more. They have been around for quite a while and i can see why, they give great service !
