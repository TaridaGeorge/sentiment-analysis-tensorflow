Expect a long wait for a table on weekends- but it's so worth it! You can hang in the bar while you wait.  If you have to park in the bottom parking lot= just wait for the shuttle because it's a steep climb up.  SHINER BOCK on tap!!!!!!!!!!!!! served in mason jars. First you get a big basket of fry bread with cinnamon butter. Don't bother with the rattlesnake app- unless you have $20 to burn. Then you get a huge bowl of house salad. It's very addicting due to the saturation of ranch dressing. Steak and enchiladas were phenomenal. Very fun atmosphere- go ahead and get loud. Never had so much fun at a restaurant before
