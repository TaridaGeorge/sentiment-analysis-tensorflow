Just saw the all Balanchine program Saturday night -- going back Sunday to see it again!

It's AMAZING to me that a ballet company can go from startup  to being a destination company is fewer than 20 years!  But, BAZ did it in 15.

Next season is their 22nd, and I renewed my season tix a couple of months ago.

BAZ is a 'must-see' every show.
