Located in Corta Bella gated community, but if you do not live in the area, simply tell the gate attendant you are dining at Anacapa and he or she will raise the gate for you without question. Anacapa's service is superior, very nice ambience, great view of the outdoors. 

I have been here for the Xmas Eve buffet, April 15th Hawaiian buffet, and lunch during the week.  All were excellent.  The chef is truly amazing here!  The lunch quesadillas w/steak were delicious (definitely ask for extra salsa as it comes in a very small cup), and the buffet selections for both occasions were great!  This is my father's favorite restaurant, and I'll have to say it's by far one of the better restaurants in the area. 

Please do not make this a resident-only restaurant!
