I pledge allegiance to the Republic of Chuckbox...I haven't found a burger that as good and consistent as this place.  Never ever had a bad burger here.  It's dirty, dank and rustic.  Add some local color, and you have the Chuckbox. Get your mind straight when you get in line and you will be rewarded with bliss when you sit down.
