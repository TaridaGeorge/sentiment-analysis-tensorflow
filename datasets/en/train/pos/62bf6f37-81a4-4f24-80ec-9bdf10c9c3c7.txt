My new favorite place to eat breakfast!  Despite the parking lot being packed, we were seated right away, served great food, the man was able to watch some football, and I had plenty of people watching to do.  

Finally, a flexible menu, none of the same ole'. 

Big servings, definately splittable, and the cake looks wonderful.  Next time, we will grab one on the way out.  

4.5 stars.  All that's missing is crepes.
