Wonderful!  My husband and I took a little adventure to try Culver's  and landed there smack dab in the middle of the lunch rush.  I liked the way an  employee greeted us at the door and helped get everyone settled in to a line to order.  This made the crazy rush move so quickly it was unbelievable.

While I enjoyed my butter burger it had nothing on the cheese curds and the marvelousness that is Culver's custard!  So smooth and creamy I told my husband we should go back for dinner. :)  I'm glad I don't work in one of the office buildings surrounding the restaurant or it'd be all over for me.

Yes, it is a chain but a chain worth visiting.
