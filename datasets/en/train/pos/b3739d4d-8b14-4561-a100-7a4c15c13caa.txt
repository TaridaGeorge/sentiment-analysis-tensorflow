This is currently my favorite restaurant in the Scottsdale/Tempe area.  I really have not been able to stay away since going there for my first time in December.  Their coconut soup with tofu is amazing --- sweet with bit of a lasting bite.  Tofu can be subbed into all of their dishes, so it is an excellent vegetarian restaurants.  Their curries are particularly good.  I've had a number of dishes there and I have never been disappointed.  

They ask you how spicy you would like your meal.  The spiciest option has a nice flavor and a bit of a burn, but it is not overwhelming.  Lunch specials costing around $8 come with a spring roll and soup.  Dinner is slightly more expensive.
