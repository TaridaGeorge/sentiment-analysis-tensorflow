Local bar does good to Scottsdale man.  Cheap drinks, GREAT CHEAP FOOD.  AMAZING SERVICE!!!  Let me repeat.... AMAZING SERVICE.  I feel like I am at home when I go here.  The waitress and bartender know me by name (maybe I shouldn't brag about that)

I go here some Mondays and alot of Thursday's to play a round of free Texas Hold 'em Poker hosted by Pioneer Poker.  It's a great way to meet people and play some cards without being under the pressure of gambling.  Try it out sometime.

Also the stage is pretty good.  They have a good blues man who plays traditional blues on Thursday nights.  I saw a comedy show here once too and it was decent.  At least is was something new.
