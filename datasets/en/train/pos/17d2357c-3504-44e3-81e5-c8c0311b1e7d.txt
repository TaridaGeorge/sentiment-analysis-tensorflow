Been going here for almost 4 years....LOVE their new "sweet" section, best baklava, cashew is the best!

Service is awesome....sometimes I come with a friend sometimes with my husband but the waitstaff always recognize us and know what we order!  Food is delish, hummus is fantastic, I've had the kafta, falafal....hubby has had the lamb....everything is always 5 star....

Really good place, parking isn't too bad, but bring change because its metered....

Yummy!!!
