Wow... this place, Urban Cookies, was designed for indulgence!  Really... how can one go wrong with a cute lil bakery that specializes in cookies and cupcakes?  The only problem you'll encounter here is making up your mind on which to choose.  

I went with the Carrot Cake cupcake and it was delicious... even the frosting was top notch!  I also sampled lil bites from my friends choices and all were good.  

Not sure if I'd come here often as it's not so good on the waistline but I believe in balance and this place will definitely fit onto my 'cheat days' list!  I've been to other places that were good but didn't make the cut... Urban Cookies and I have a date really soon, however!

See ya there!
