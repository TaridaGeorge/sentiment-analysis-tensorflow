ok so I've been here a go-zillian times. This review is just a formality. This place is great. The food is consistently good. Extremely affordable with the portion sizes. In fact, I usually end up taking half of my meal home with me for lunch the next day! I have loved everything I've eaten here: the salads, the pizza, the veggie wedgie (which I repeatedly order when I should be trying something new), the artichoke lasagna, and the pizza cookie! There are few things worth blowing the calories for......this is one of them! 

Can I also mention how the service is so friendly every single time you go?! These people are great, and they make you keep wanting to come back.  We eat here frequently and every out-of-town guest gets a trip to Oreganos. So far no one has been disappointed. Thanks guys!!
