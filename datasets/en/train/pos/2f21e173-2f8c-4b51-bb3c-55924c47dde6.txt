WOW! This is my new go to spot in Phx. I tried it for dinner last night and was blown away with their fantastic scicilian pizza and delicious cheese plate appetizer. This is a fantastic date spot as it has a breathtaking patio overlooking camelback mountain and an extensive wine list! It would also be a great place to relax with friends and enjoy some beers. They have 14 premium beers on draft and many of them are locally brewed! They nailed it! Simply perfect, I know I will be back sooner than later!
