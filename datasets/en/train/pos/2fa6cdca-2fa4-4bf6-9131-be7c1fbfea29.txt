Hung out with Eugene on an UYE from the talk thread. We again visited an empty Chez Monieux. People!! Get your butts in the seats. Ask for some Purple Haze one of the refreshing beers they have and hunker down for some New Orleans chow. I got some wonderful calamari, not overly greasy despite being deep fried and the rings weren't strings they were tubes. Eugene got a fried Tomato salad. We ate Etouffe and a Mama's Bowl. We all had pecan pie. Wish we lived closer, it's very tasty. I was too full to get jalepeno hush puppies, but now that I'm writing this update I want some. They are closed on Sunday's and if people don't come... well I'd hate to see them close more.
