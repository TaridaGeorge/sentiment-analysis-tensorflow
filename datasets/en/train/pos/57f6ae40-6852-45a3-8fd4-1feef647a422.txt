Me and my family went in here last Friday the 21st for the first time and after reading some of these review I was scared but to my surprise it was amazing great food awesome price and best of all the service was incredible! Our server was really good and our expositor was very attentive and made sure we have everything we needed! Me and my family will definently be going back! Way to go TCs
