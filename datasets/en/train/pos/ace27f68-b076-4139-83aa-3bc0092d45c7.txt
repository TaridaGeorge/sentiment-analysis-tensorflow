We were told that this is the best place to eat in Phoenix.  That is quite a high expectation.  We were able to sit in the courtyard, which was set up beautifully.  The menu contained variety and the food was certainly delicious.  The margaritas were also amazing and service was excellent. Overall a wonderful experience.
