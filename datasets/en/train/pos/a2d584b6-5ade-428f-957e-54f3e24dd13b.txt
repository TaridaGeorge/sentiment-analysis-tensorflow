So I went here for LUNCH on a SATURDAY while in town visiting friends and it was sooo good, for one their lunches on Saturdays are 5$ but even when not on special they are only 2$ more... and let me just say it was sooo delicious I shared about four dishes among 2 people and myself (we ate semi-light) my favorite of the 4 was the sweet and sour chicken it was very crisp light breading and juicy wonderful chicken... tone of the other members in my party enjoyed the egg plant chicken, and the other said she most enjoyed the pork fried rice so it is clear to say ALL the dishes were tasty. I would def. reccomend
