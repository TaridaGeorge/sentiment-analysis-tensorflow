Another thrift store where once I enter there is no coming out empty handed. Love how well organized, open and clean this one is. Dressing rooms are awesome. Some prices are a bit too high yet just as many and maybe more are surprisingly low.  I'm definitely a fan and it's great that they offer daily half price promotions and that the money the store earns goes toward a good cause.  3$ off coupon if you donate (anything) and a stamp card where once you fill it up you get 30% off your entire purchase.
