I have been here so many times... to many to count in fact.  And I always resisted writing a review because there are so many already that I didn't think it would matter.  But last night I went to dinner there with Michael and a couple girlfriends of mine... we had a great time and the service was awesome!  Our server's name was Jaime and she was wonderful!  I just wanted to let everyone know that good service at delux is possible:)  Of course I got the delux burger and a basket of sweet potato fries... Yummy!
