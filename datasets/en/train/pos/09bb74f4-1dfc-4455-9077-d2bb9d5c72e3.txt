Imagine...you walk into a restaurant.  All the waitstaff is dressed like they belong in the fifties with collared shirts, long khaki shorts, colored socks and loafers.  How could it get better than that?  

Well, it does.  The skillets are the best I have ever had.  This whole in the wall, strip center joint is my favorite brunch place...and on the weekends, prepare to wait.  I have dined at the celebrity infused bruncheries in NYC, all the brunch places I can find in Dallas, but still no one can match the Eggington cajun potatoes.  They are perfectly crispy and have a little kick.  I have heard great things about the sandwiches and soups, but I always opt for breakfast when I am in the Valley.
