Best place to buy fruit in the Valley of the Sun.  As a former Silicon Valley babette, I can tell produce from produce.  San Jose down to Gilroy has the best fresh produce anywhere to be found.  Sprouts comes in a natural second.  Always great prices, always fresh product.  Everything they offer here is top notch and delicious.  Service is good, and this store is conveniently located across from Paradise Valley Mall.  Easy access for disabled patrons.
