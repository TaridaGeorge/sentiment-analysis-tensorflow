Going through laser removal of some tattoos on my neck and trying to keep them concealed for work can be stressful. Well, the removal is going to take awhile but Thank's to Joanna at the SHISEIDO cosmetics counter in the PV Mall, the cover-up is going to be simple and lasting with Dermablend. Joanna helped me find the right color match and showed me how to apply it and it's easy! Thank's Joanna for all your help!
