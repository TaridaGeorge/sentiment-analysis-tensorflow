Time Square is a surprising hidden gem in North Phoenix.  I love that they always seem to be improving either the exterior or interior.  Right down the road from the Motorcycle Mechanics School, there are frequently some cool bikes out front.  Great pizza and Italian food, they ALSO have a wonderful breakfast and if you get here before 9:00 am you can get $3.99 special....I LOVE the homefries.
