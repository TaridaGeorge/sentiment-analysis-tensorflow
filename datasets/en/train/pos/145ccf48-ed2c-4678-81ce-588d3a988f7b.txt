Probably my overall favorite coffee shop in the Valley.  Wonderful atmosphere in an inside cafe, inside lounge, and outside patio.  Amazing homemade muffins, scones, cookies, pies, and sandwiches.  Wonderful owners and employees.  Great coffee from the serious (they have a cubano actually written on the menu!) to the crazy, fluffy, lattes and mocha combinations.

Great for a quick snack, or lingering to chat or surf the web on the free WiFi.  

Located NW of Higley and Ray, behind Joe's Farm Grill.
