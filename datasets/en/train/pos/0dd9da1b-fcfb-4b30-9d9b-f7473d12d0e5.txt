This place was beautiful. Easy to navigate (the boulders have small blue paint as markers throughout the trail), with great views! 

We got there early to beat the heat (before 6am), and the place was surprisingly crowded with others looking to get a work-out in before the temperature was unbearable. The hike is easy enough for the novice, but pretty enough for those who are more experience to thoroughly enjoy.

Loved it! Next time I want to try the other side (Echo Canyon) which is supposed to be much more difficult.
