I'm in love with this bar.  It's the perfect neighborhood bar. A little rough around the edges and that's what I love about it! Darts are fun, and the pool table is available often. The patio is chill and the staff gets it done!  

If you're looking for a place to chill, wearing jeans and flip flops to fit in, this is your place. Seriously, I think my favorite in Scottsdale... period.
