We would give this place 6 stars if we could! This place is nothing to look at from the outside; in fact, we probably never would have stopped there if I hadn't read some reviews. This place is phenomenal, it's family owned and run, the owner is always working and friendly. They have the best gyros in Phoenix (and we have tried a lot!) and their hummus is made fresh daily and amazing! We always get top notch service when we go in there and they have fun little trivia booklets to keep you occupied while you wait. The gyro house is definitely a favorite!!
