Great store!  Although they don't have a huge supply of cards, the store staff are friendly and willing to talk with you.  Constant stream of tournaments.  The owner is friendly and excited to have customers come in, without being pushy!

Update - R2L, ManaWerx and Imperial Outpost Games are now side-by-side, so they have almost everything for the gamer:  MtG, Board Games, RPGs, supplies, etc.  Their MTG selection is pretty good!
