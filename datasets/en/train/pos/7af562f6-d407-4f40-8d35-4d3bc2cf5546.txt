I went to go to Subway and Lobby's was next door and I always like to try out new places and support a small business whenever I can. 
The Bacon Chesse Burger was excellent and the fries were hot and crispy without me having to ask, which is really unusual. 
The price was a little on the high side, but the food was really good and I wish them all the best.
