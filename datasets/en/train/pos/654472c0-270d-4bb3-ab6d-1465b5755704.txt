How are there not more 5's!??!  Best pizza that has EVER EVER EVER touched my lips! Try pepperoni and ricotta as toppings and you won't regret it.  My boyfriend loves it now.  My last trip to NYC included a visit to the original in Brooklyn.  That was a lot of fun, but I'll say the version in PHX is even better! 

People like to have rehearsal dinners or even weddings here.  Cute place.  Good first date. 

GO.
