We've become a stable at this restaurant so much we know the family that owns it.  The happy hour is a great deal for getting some of the common rolls and the Climax roll is one of the best if flavors I've seen.  I like trying new sushi places both in Phoenix and when I travel, but this is the resturant that I keep going back to each time.
