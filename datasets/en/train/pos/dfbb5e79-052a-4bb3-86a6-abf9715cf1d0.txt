Kashman's is a perfect Jewish Russian American Deli with all the trimmings. Everyone will rave about the soup, but instead of the Matzo Balls, ask for the Kreplache. Unbelievable, and they are the hardest to find in this town! During the holidays, they will also see you a bulk amount for such a reasonable rate.
