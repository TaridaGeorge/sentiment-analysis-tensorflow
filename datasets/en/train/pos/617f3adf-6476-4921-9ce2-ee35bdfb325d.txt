This is my favorite Middle Eastern Restaurant in Tempe. I'm so happy they reopened in their new location! My favorites are the Chicken Tikka, Veggie Sunbusek, and the soup. If you've never had Sahara lentil soup you need to go there now! It is to die for. 
The owner is always super friendly as is everyone else that works there. I highly recommend anyone to check this place out.
