Wowie - never have I been so impressed with an airport restaurant!  And this comes from a gal who's been to a WHOLE lotta airports 'round the world over the years.  Five of us had a nice, filling meal before our flights.  No alcohol, so the bill came to less than $50 bucks for the lot of us.  We shared hummus, fondue pretzels (omg yummmmm!!), and a tasty burger.  So good.  If you're in the terminal A area, hit this place up.  The pretzels alone are worth it.
