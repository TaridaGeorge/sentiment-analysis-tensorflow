Hubby and I stayed at a nearby hotel and stumbled upon this breakfast/lunch spot. 

The service was fabulous! I asked a few questions about the menu and our server suggested an item that's no longer on the menu. It was great! Potatoes with melted  cheese, topped with corned beef hash and eggs. Hubby got a some sort of benedict: biscuits topped with bacon, sausage, and ham, covered in sausage gravy. Our iced teas were never empty which is a huge plus!
