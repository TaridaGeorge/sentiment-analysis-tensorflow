One of the most unusual dining experiences of my life -- and fantastic! Chicken and waffles definitely work! I can also vouch for the red koolaid, mac-n-cheese, cornbread, and the smothered potatoes. If you're into grits I hear they are spectacular too.

Just be wary of the neighborhood, after dark you might not make it out alive. (not likely they are open long after dusk anyway...)
