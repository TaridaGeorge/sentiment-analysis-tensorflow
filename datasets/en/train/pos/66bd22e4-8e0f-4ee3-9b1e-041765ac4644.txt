Just wanted to add that the Humane Society's partnership with VCA Animal Hospitals (offering up to $500 per pet of free post-adoption care for certain standard infections and medications) was amazing. Do note that there are time restrictions (I think the offer is up 2 weeks after adoption). We ended up going to VCA Elliot Park in Tempe (see my separate review for them) for our two new kittens and having two visits each, as well as antibiotics, completely covered. This was such a big help, as the costs right after adoption are often the greatest (because of shelter conditions, etc). I hope it incentivizes a lot of people to adopt who otherwise couldn't afford it. More good homes for all of the adorable kittens we see every time we go!
