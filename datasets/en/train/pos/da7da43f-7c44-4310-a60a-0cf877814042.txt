I've been waiting for Jimmy John's to arrive in Arizona for soooo long!

This was one of my favorite spots for lunch when I lived in Chicago. Close to the office, quick service, friendly employees and great subs for a chain restaurant.

We were initially headed to Five Guys in the same plaza, but after seeing the menu we headed over to Jimmy John's and I'm so glad we did. The employees are friendly, my Italian Sub was delicious and the place was bustling. 

This place stands head and shoulders above the other chain sub competition.
