A favorite of mine. I had discovered Nello's back when I lived in Ahwatukee during my college days. I would dine in and take out. It was that good. The atmosphere is great. The service is great. The food is great. 

I dropped in there today, for old times sake, and it was still just as good. I had the lunch special which was a house salad with their signature tomato basil based vinagrette, an 8" pizza with homemade sausage and mushrooms, and a Diet Coke. All for $9.95! What a deal!

If you want quality pizza, go to Nello's.
