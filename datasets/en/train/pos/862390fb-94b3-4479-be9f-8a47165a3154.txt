Nice, simple dog park. There's a fence dividing the large dogs from small ones so there's 2 separate areas. In the large dog section, there's water fountains in the front and back. I've only been here around midnight and 5am (my Akita is not social) and found it hard to step in anything, although most dog waste is cleaned up.

Side note, the paved trails that run along the canals behind the dog park are very cool. Basically, you can go East towards 19th Ave, West or North several miles to Thunderbird. The North-South trail has underpasses at Peoria and Cactus so you don't have to stop for car traffic. The West route also goes under I-17 and 29th Ave, but only the path that's between the two canals.
