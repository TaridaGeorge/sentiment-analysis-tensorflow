Another kickass restaurant that I had the pleasure of dining at while me and the boyfriend visited a friend in Scottsdale.  

-Strong drinks
-Friendly & attentive waitstaff
-Tasty & interesting specialty appetizers that just had to try: "kettle of green chili pork" & "green chili mac 'n cheese."  
-Absolutely delicious entrees. I had the trout topped w/ almonds & capers and a side of cilantro lime rice. The other entrees ordered were oven roasted jumbo shrimp; & braised beef short rib. 
-This is bargain eating at its finest. I remember walking into the restaurant thinking this will be a pricey dinner, but to my pleasant surprise the prices they were charging for the quality and amount of food was a steal.

Another definite to-do the next time I'm out in Scottsdale!
