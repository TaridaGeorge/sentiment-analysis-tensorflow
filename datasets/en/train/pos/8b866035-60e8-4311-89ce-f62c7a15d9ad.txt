I love this place. I wish it was a little easier to figure out the ordering situation.  The people that work here are so helpful and patient and nice! I've always been really really overwhelmed by the menu at most locations because they don't have any descriptions next to the sandwiches but this one did- Thank goodness!! The salad i had was so fresh and the half sandwich half soup deal is really a great bargain.  i'm really looking forward to the location close to me in Tucson opening soon.
