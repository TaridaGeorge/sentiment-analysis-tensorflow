I love breakfast here!  Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had (sorry mom).  They have all the basics plus you can build your own scrambles, omelets, etc.  I love their vegetarian style scrambles.  The portions are so large that you can easily share with another person.  You have to try the warm cinnamon rolls for dessert (or take one home with  you).  Again, it is quite large and you will need help finishing it off.

The interior is very clean and simple with a monochromatic color scheme (much like what you expect from an actual farmhouse).  The staff is always very friendly and warm.  I guarantee there will be a wait on the weekends so get there early and put your name on the list.  

I did try this place for lunch and I feel the breakfast is far superior.
