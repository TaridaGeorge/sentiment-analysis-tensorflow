I have been coming here since the first week it opened on Signal Butte. The bagels are homemade and are delicious. My favorite item are the breakfast bagels (Arizona Bagel is my fave), but we also come here for lunch and the sandwiches are very good too. They even make a pretty good hamburger! Coffee is freshly ground and very flavorful. 
The owners are very dedicated to their shop, and they love to talk with patrons. They remember me and what I order, which is a great sign that they pay attention to and appreciate their customers.
You definitely need to try them.
