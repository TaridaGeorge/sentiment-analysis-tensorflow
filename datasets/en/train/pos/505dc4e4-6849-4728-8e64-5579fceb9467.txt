Ever been somewhere and had service that just made your morning?  A Chinese couple sat down at the booth next to me.  The server came up with their food, delivered it, and then softly asked, "um, how do you say 'thank you' in your language?" They told him (it's 'xie xie' though my spelling is probably off), and he smiled, bowed, and said "xie xie."

His manners, his approach, and his openness were like a warm hug. He could have been brisk and to the point, he could have just said "thank you." He could even have been surly. He chose to take 20 seconds and reach out to a total stranger. 

I'm not saying this makes CB the best place ever. But it sure gave me a smile at the start of a long day, and I am very grateful. In my ancestral language, "tusen tak."
