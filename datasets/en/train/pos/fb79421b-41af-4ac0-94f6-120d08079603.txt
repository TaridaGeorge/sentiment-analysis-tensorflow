Tuesday is opposite day.  Or is it Thursday?  I don't know anymore.

I'm bored with reviewing at the moment, so I'm going to write this as exactly the opposite of how I actually feel (save for the star rating, which I will rate accurately so I don't mess up the average).  I'll let you do the decoding.

Delux is awful.  I hate that they have Arrogant Bastard on tap.  Their cheeseburgers are a huge step down from Applebees, my personal favorite.  Or maybe TGIFridays is my favorite...life is full of such difficult decisions.  Anyway, the french fries at Delux remind me of deep-friend cardboard: flavorless and tough.  When my server accidentally spilled an inconsequential amount of fry sauce on my twenty dollar jeans, he didn't give me 30% off.  Oh, and I hate the decor too.  I'm not already planning to eat here this coming weekend.
