Amazing food!!  Is it me, or has this place gotten even better lately??  They even have a separate gluten free vegan menu, which is helpful.  LOOOVE the chili fries and the buffalo wings.  Favorites include anything with their chicken in it...the sweet and sour chicken is to die for.  LOVE that this place is next to Nami.  It's perfect...get our yums on here and then head to Nami for dessert.  The brunch is very good here as well.  Have I mentioned the buffalo wings?  oh myyyyy.
