I never knew this store existed until I accidentally got lost looking for the Super Target. Then I was like what the hey, I will stop and look around. LOVE IT! This Home Goods is attached to a TJ Maxx. Even better, they have home items and clothes too. I was in awe... 

I found diffusers, bed sheets, decoration for the house, and then wander over to TJ Maxx for the clothes. I never make it to the Super Target. I found everything and more that I was looking for. The prices are decent too!
