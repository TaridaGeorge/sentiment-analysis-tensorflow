Tl;dr-This place rocks!
I come to this bar time and again because of the awesome atmosphere, great service, and delicious menu. 
I hear bands like The Knife & The Xx playing here often.
The happy hour prices are always reasonable and the drinks never disappoint. 
There's Wednesday night Trivia! 
The food is on par with restaurant quality & the menu exceeds "bar food" expectations. The pretzel w/soft cheese is [housemade]amazingness.
The service is truly great, I feel as comfortable as a regular there. 
Awesome place!!
