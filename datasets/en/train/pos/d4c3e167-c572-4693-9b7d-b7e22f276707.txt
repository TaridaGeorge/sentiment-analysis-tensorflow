Felt like a trip to Burma - a little like Thailand, a little like India, but it's own special place.  The ginger salad, like the green tea salad, was phenomenal - lots of flavor and crunch.  The tilapia curry was great.  And the service was excellent - lots of guidance with the menu and our water glasses were never empty.  Th And a discount in January made the bill very reasonable!  What a find.  Sure we didn't live 1000 miles away.
