Hillstone, while on the pricey side, is worth every penny. The service and food are both above par. Though the name wouldn't imply that sushi is a specialty item of theirs, it should NOT be missed! Also, the crispy fish sandwich is delish as well. The only complaint that I have about Hillstone is the lack of Happy Hour. My girlfriends and I would frequent the place more often for afternoon chat sessions but right now, we would break the bank! Hillstone has a trendy feel - especially the bar / patio area but the service and food prove that this place isn't just here for a minute. Give it a try!
