I have been wanting to try this place so I finally got the chance to this weekend. We didn't eat only had drinks. I had the amber it was good. This place is a great place to listen to the others that are regulars there. They made me laugh. The bartenders were nice. For my second beer I had the vanilla porter! OMG, it was good. 

Want to go back and try the food!
