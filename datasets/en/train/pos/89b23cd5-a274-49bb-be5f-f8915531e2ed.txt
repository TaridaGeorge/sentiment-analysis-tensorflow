This place was a great surprise.  I thought it would be intimidating based on their website, but I felt immediately at home, they were even welcoming to our sleeping baby.  The server was extremely friendly, and altered everything to be completely veg-friendly for us.  The food was great, and the desserts blew us away.  We were very, very happy with our visit.
