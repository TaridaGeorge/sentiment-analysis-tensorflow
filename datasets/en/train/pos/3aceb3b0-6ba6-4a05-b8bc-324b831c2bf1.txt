I love this place!  The drinks are awesome.  The food is wonderful. The staff is always friendly!  There is something for everyone on the menu.  I love their home brews, specifically the Kiltlifter!  I really like how they suggest one of their beers to match every meal on the menu.  Nice touch!

I've been here several times and have NEVER had anything less than a wonderful experience!
