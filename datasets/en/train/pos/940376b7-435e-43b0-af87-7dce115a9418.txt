All I gotta say is their thin crust pizza is so bomb. The sauce they use has so much flavor it makes me want to buy it but then I know I'm too lazy to go home and make a mediocre pizza and waste their awesome sauce on it so I just come in here and eat it :).  

Also their garlic bread is bomb also, a must order with pizza and anything really. Haha. Dining in or Togo its awesome. One of my face pizza places next to al forno on Glendale and 57th ave.
