If my house was a store, I would want it to be The French Bee.  Such great great house stuff and even some cool jewelry.  The prices fluctuate on everything.  I saw a necklace that I had to have and figured it must be too expensive so there is no way  I can buy it but it was reasonable!  So reasonable that I bought 2! -- Don't you wish we were friends?  When i find something great, I buy them in multiples to give one away. 

The last time I was in there, it was around the holidays and they had the BEST CHRISTMAS STUFF!!!
