My husband and I ordered the Pizza Blanca again last night. He came home exclaiming how awesome the service is at this location and even went as far to say that it's the best service he's received in years! 

Apparently he was greated by a hostess who opened the door for him, while another pleasant hostess assisted him as he entered the door. He was even offered a complimentary cup of pop. That went over BIG with him as he was very thirsty and appreciated having a beverage to enjoy while waiting for his order to be ready.  It's hard to find an establishment that offers delicious food AND excellent service these days. KUDOS to NYPD pizza!!
