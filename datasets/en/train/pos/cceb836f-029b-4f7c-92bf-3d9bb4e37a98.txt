This is truly a great studio that I would recommend to anyone. Everybody is very welcoming and friendly and the instructors are very helpful and knowledgable. They take the time to learn about each individual and what makes them unique. They also make a point to personalize the lesson toward each person and they're great at building upon your strengths so you leave feeling good about yourself and the work you've accomplished!
