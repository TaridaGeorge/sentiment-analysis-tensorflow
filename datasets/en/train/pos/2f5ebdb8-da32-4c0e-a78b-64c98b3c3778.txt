I love this place! They usually serve some sort of free bread and spread before your meal for free! Great thing for a small family place. :)

This restaurant is totally one of the most hidden treasures of Phoenix. I mean it's right next door to a Circle K! But the food is great, and they've created a very warm atmosphere inside.

I have tried a few of the house made pasta's, and while they're good I say go for the pizza. Their pizza has some of the freshest tomato sauce around, and the cheese is to die for. Actually that's all I need on a pizza, no more toppings please. I love the margarita pizza.

I came here for my birthday and got some free tiramisu, awesome!

Check it out if you love rustic pizza.
