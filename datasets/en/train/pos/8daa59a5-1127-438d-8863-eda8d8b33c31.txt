This cute caffe nestled in the Scottsdale airport is my new favorite place to go for great food, a great atmosphere and great service. Their food is out of this world delicious and the owners are hands on - so their customer service is incredible. I've been several times and I've never had a bad experience. I've taken a liking to working from the restaurant on days I need a break from my office. The free wifi is pretty awesome!
