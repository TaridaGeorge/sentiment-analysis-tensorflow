Brunch at FEZ was at once delightful and delicious.

I was memorized by the $3 alcoholic selections, including mimosas and a greyhound (grapefruit juice and vodka) among many others; I enjoyed the latter, which was strong and pleasant tasting.

My friends all ordered the breakfast panini, a sandwich overflowing with eggs and breakfast meat.  I opted for the "best egg white omelette you'll ever have" and it truly lived up to its name.  Adding a spicy filling was an incredible option and the eggs were fluffy, with generous portions of spinach and tomatoes.

If only I lived in the area, this would be my brunch spot.  I can't wait to revisit this brunch nirvana.
