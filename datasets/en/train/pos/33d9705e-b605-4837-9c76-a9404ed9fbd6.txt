Let me say that this is by far the best Thai food I have had in Phoenix. The atmosphere is great very friendly staff we were seated right away and made to feel right at home. I had the strawberry Champagne Martini it was very well made. I must say this place is great for a first date anniversary or valentines the owner is wonderful I recommend this place as a romantic spot for a couple. I will continue to go back as long as they are opened.
