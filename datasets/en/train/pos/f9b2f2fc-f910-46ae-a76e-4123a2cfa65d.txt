They have my favorite Chicken Parm sandwich AND the best French fries in town.   

The fries are thicker than most but smaller than a steak-cut and they practically melt in your mouth.  I had never had fries like these...they are incredible.

They finish the sandwich off in the oven so the bread is lightly crunchy when it comes out.  I did get a sandwich that was a little overdone for my taste once, and didn't notice it until after I had left with my to go order so keep an eye on that.  I think the food quality may suffer a bit when the owner isn't working. 

The Calzones are huge and taste pretty good. 

The Cannoli from their deli are a favorite in our office.
