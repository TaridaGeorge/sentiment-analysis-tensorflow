Best shuttle service I have ever used

Doug took amazing care of our Bachelor Party back in May of 2012.  Went above and beyond with our raucous group of shit-talking drunkards.  He even supplied some "beverages" for the ride.  I would recommend him to anyone. Super friendly guy, very reasonable prices.
