Liberty market is fast becoming one of my favorite lunch time treats. They have a menu that while not huge seems to have something for everyone. I am in love with their white pizza. The bread is fabulous and while it has some unique ingredients(Arugula and pine nuts) they are not just their to be trendy they truly add to the flavor of the pizza. 

The atmosphere is great and it is going to sound weird, but you should make a trip to the bathroom while you are there.
