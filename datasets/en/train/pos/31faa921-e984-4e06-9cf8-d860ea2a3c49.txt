I was on vacation and went here for dinner and not to be repetitive but it's like the best burger I've ever had.  I couldn't understand the point of waiting for a hamburger but it was totally worth the wait.   The restaurant is so cute also I couldn't believe it.  My brother got the chicken panini which was good but if your going to go there get a burger.  I do have to say I shared a burger and a salad with a friend and it was the perfect amount of food once the sweet potato fries were added.  (those are adorable they are served out of a mini-shopping cart)  I would say go there...I loved it.
