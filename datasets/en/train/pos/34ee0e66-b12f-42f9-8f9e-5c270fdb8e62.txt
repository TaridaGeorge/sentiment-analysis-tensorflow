ATTENTION LADIES WITH LONG HAIR

Have long hair but want style without cutting all the length off? Paul is the stylist to see then. He gave me the most AMAZING haircut, it has layers but not choppy, it has movement and it's still long!

First off, he gives a relaxing scalp massage when he washes your hair and bonus, the shampoo bowl is very comfortable, no achy neck after

The building he is in is super cute, very clean and if you want your nails done, a facial or a killer brow wax there are other studio owners that can hook you up

Paul knows how to cut AND color, not something all stylists can boast.

So do yourself a favor and check him out.... it doesn't hurt that he has a totally sweet personality too
