I had Treasures design my wife a Mother's Ring.  It turned out beautiful!  My wife was thrilled when I gave it to her, she gets a lot of great compliments on this ring.  The price on their high quality custom work rivals that of bulk made 'junk' from the massive retail and big box stores.  I will definitely be a return customer to Treasures.
