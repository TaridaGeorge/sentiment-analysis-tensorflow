One of my favorite dishes in pho. Chicken pho. And the chicken pho here is unbelievable.  The broth is so flavorful and savory; I could eat it all by itself without the noodles or anything.  But, the noodles are delicious too so I am glad that they are in the stock.  I don't even add any sriracha or hoisen sauce or anything because the soup is perfect as it is. And I love that this place is in a little strip mall and owned by a local family.
