Buying a car can be a stressful and painstaking process. When I decided to buy the first car that was all mine, I visited a number of local dealerships looking for something that I loved. I was so turned off by the salespeople at the first 3 or 4 places I looked that I was sure I would never find something I wanted. They were pushy, condescending and rude. I stopped by Hyundai of Tempe and everything turned around! 

The salespeople there were friendly and helpful, walking me through a process I knew little about. They were patient, worked with me, and made me feel comfortable and at home with them. Even the General Manager made sure I was well taken care of. My family has purchased four cars from Hyundai of Tempe and I would recommend them to anyone I know.
