If you like Antique Malls, then this is a really fun one to visit. I think it's mostly because it feels like you are exploring an old house with all sorts of secret rooms!

There's the main level and another level downstairs with even MORE stuff. I think I saw two additional sets of stairs aside from the main steps near the front. It's a BIG place!

 I found STUFF for great prices - which can be rare at an Antique Mall! Usually, most Vendors have stuff overpriced, but I was very pleased with my findings...just need to look, you never know what you might find.

There were employees randomly walking around if you needed help or to bring your items to the front check-out. 

Friendly service too.

I will be visiting here again for sure!
