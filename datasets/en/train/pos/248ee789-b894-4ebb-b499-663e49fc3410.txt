Best Poutine I've had in 6 years, since I was in Ottawa...

I've tried all the poutine in the valley that I've come across and this is truly the first one that got it right.  You would think that D'Arcy McGees would get it right, since they have a chain in Ottawa, but they don't.  Bacon restaurant tried and failed.  Others try to put mushrooms in it, use the wrong cheese, the wrong sauce...

From the fresh cheese curds to the dark brown sauce that Americans can only compare to "gravy", THIS is the French Canadian delicacy that I've been trying to fake in my kitchen for years, with shredded mozzarella and a can of imported St. Hubert's poutine sauce.  

Now I need only drive to Broadway and McClintock!
