My dog asked me to to write this review to tell you all how much she loves her Hale pet door.  Actually, we are both very happy.  Our experience with the company was great from start to finish.  The door was installed through the (stucco) wall, and the installer saved the neatly cut out portion in the event I (or the next homeowner) ever want to remove the door.  Speaking of installation, the process was clean, clean, clean!  I actually think he left the kitchen floor nicer than he found it!  :)

The door itself is very well constructed with two sturdy flaps to keep the cool air inside.  Of all the changes/improvements I have made to my home since I moved to AZ, this purchase has made me the happiest.  I don't have to worry about my furry friend languishing outside on a hot day.
