They made my wedding cake and it was amazing.  The decorators there are artists. The wedding cake was my first experience with them, sense then I have ordered a number of cakes for different occasions and never been let downs.  They are now making my sisters wedding cake. Also if you like pastry and bite sized sweets they are the place to go. Their cinnamon buns are the best I have ever had.
