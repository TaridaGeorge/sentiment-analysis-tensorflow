What isn't there good to say about Play All Day! Pet Care. She took perfect care of our two dogs and kept us up-to-date on what they were up to each day. We saw photos and they looked happy as can be. We had an ant infestation inside while we were out and Conni even took care of all that for us. Went way above and beyond what we expected! I highly recommend Play All Day! Pet Care for all your pet sitting needs.
