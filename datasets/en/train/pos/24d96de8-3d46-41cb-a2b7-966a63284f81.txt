Sooo U! recently opened across from Pita Jungle.  My husband and I just went in and had a great experience.  They have a really great selection of fashionable, new and gently-used women's and men's clothing and accessories.  The owner, Sylvia, and staff are genuinely friendly but not at all overbearing - just helpful.  We left with a silk suit (with dry clean tag attached) and blouse for me, and two nice shirts for him.  All for about $85.  Check it out!!
