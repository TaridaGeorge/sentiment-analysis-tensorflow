St Francis is one of my very favorite resturaunts in Phoenix.  Their menu is super interesting and everything I have had is delicious, though I have only had one thing because it is so delicious I get it every time.  I usually get the chicken which has green olives.  Also it has a very kind of swank, trendy feel without the least bit of pretension which makes it very nice.  This is demonstrated by how super kid friendly the place is!  There is even a box of toys that your toddler can play with and one time when we went there the hosts practically babysitted our daughter, playing with her at the toy box.  It is so nice to go to a very grown up kind of resturaunt where they welcome children so throughoughly.
