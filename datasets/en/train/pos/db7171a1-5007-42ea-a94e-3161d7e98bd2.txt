I drive 25 miles to get to this place but not for grocery. In side the grocery store, there is a little food corner. just 5 chairs. nothing to talk about. but food is the best korean food I have ever had in America. The lady who cooks - she is so good. Her cooking reminds me of my mom's cooking. I go there at least once a month to get my 
Korean food and side dishes She also makes different side dishes - they are always fresh and good. awesome little place to taste the real korean food - cheap and good. each dish is less than $8 but better than any of Korean restaurant.
