This place is awesome.  The 60s decor is very well done and looks straight out of Home & Garden.  The room was very cute, the attention to detail leaves you feeling that the people who run the Ho really care.  Prices are very reasonable and if you have the HotelsTonight app on the iPhone I noticed a $75 a night deal that can't be beat.    

The Saturday pool party was a bit packed but their are a ton of seats.  Drink prices were reasonable and they had shot girls that made sure you always were supplied with a beverage.  

Can't wait to go back.
