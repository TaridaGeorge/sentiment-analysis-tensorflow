I have now been to Fez for two events, brunch, lunch, dinner and time at the bar, so I figured I should update. I also checked my bank account, and it looks like in the past 30 days I have spent over $300.... yikes!

I'm a big fan of consistency, and every time I come to Fez, I have a consistently warm and amazing experience. The food is always top notch, aside from one busy Saturday night the service has always been pretty good, the drinks are strong and you cannot beat the environment. Or a smiling, happy, hugging Thomas. 

Fez. I love you. My bank account hates you. I need to start working some swerve and get someone to take me on an all-expense-paid date here.. ha ha 

PS The green pasta rocks my socks
