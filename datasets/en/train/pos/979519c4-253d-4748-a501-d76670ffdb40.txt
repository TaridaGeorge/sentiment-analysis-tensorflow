i've been to thai rama off of camelback a handful of times, but i just recently found out about this locaiton. i live on the border of gilbert and chandler and i was thrilled that they had this locaiton. 

oh my goodness...this is just absolute yumminess!!! i've been inside to eat once while a friend was visiting from out of town. it is such good food!! i ordered the yellow curry and she ordered paht se ew. both were excellent dishes!! the service was pleasant and we had a great dining experience.

since then my husband and i have ordered to go and we haven't had anything but wonderful dishes from here. it has quickly become one of my favorite new places to eat!!
