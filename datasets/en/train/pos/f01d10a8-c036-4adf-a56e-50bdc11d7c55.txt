my favorite coffee spot of all time.  i just love this place!

soy lattes-delicious!
muffins, scones, baked goods-addictive
music-amazing
atmosphere-cool

i can sit here all day, have cup after cup of coffee and feed on their homemade goodies.

i didnt expect to love a cafe so much, but this place seriously gives me a reason to stay in az! 

they have expanded and serve etoh along with bfast items like dutch pancakes, eggs, etc.  love how they are next to pane bianco too. yumminess after yumminess.
