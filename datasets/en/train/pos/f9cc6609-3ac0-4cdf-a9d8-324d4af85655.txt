Fresh Bagel sandwiches are the best! Coda B was obviously still under the influence when he wrote his review because there is no " $7 Arizona Classic" here. All breakfast sandwiches are less than $5 and come with heaping portions of eggs and meat/cheese of your choice. Lunch is also served anytime with mounds of turkey, ham, bacon, or my favorite the "Nosh French Dip" roast beef. Fresh brewed tea is fantastic. You are always greeted with a smile. You are treated like family when you walk in. Thanks for all the great bagels!!
