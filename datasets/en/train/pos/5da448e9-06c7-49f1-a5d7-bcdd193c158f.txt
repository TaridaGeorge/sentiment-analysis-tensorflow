I must admit that I was skeptical when I heard that Tops Liquor Store (which seems to always have a homeless man getting arrested outside its front door) had opened up a bar next door. I envisioned a room with long, flickering, florescent lights, plastic-tiled floors and tables and chairs fashioned out of stacked up 30 rack boxes. 

What an awesome surprise! Not only is Taste of Tops surprisingly nice inside, but the beer selection is incredible. They have beer on tap that's hard to find even in bottles and their fridge selection warrants excessive drooling (and drinking). 

Hooray for finally having a bar nearby where the beer actually tastes good (eh hem...Casey's).
