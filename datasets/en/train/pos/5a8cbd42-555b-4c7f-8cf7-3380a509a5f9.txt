I drove by this place dozens of times not really knowing what it was about, though I assumed it was some kind of restaurant. A steak place? Who knew, but there were always lots of cars...

So I finally gave it a try, and I've drug lots of people back many times since. It's an old school cowboy diner, more or less. HUGE breakfast plates that include all the standard American classics with some Southwestern faves as well (chrorizo, huevos rancheros, green chile breakfast burritos, etc). Every massive plate comes with a big steak knife on top to help you cut your way through all the goodness. For the portions, the fresh ingredients, and the atmosphere, it's a $7-8 breakfast which is a real deal.
