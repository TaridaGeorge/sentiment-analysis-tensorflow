I am a fan! 

My PC doctor sent me to Dr Moschonas because I've been having some heavy duty migraines. It took almost THREE months to get in, but now I can see why the wait is so long, he is GREAT! 

Super friendly, takes his time to talk to you and really seems to listen. 

If you are in need of a neurologist for sure go see him!
