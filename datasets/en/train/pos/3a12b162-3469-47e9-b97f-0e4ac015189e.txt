Great place for Happy Hour.  Good food, Great beer, fun atmosphere.

Update 12/2011 - Four Peaks continues to be (4 years later) my go to place for lunch...  The food is always, always spectacular...  And I can say this since I eat here at least once a week when I'm in town...

At least two different people have told me they have had their "best fish and chips" and "best sandwich" of their lifetimes at 4P.  Enough said.
