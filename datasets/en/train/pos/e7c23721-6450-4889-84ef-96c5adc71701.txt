5 star for any Cracker Barrel on the West Coast!

i was on my way back to LA and I didn't even know that they had a Cracker Barrel in the West.  Having lived in the East Coast for a few years I enjoyed the meat loaf and then some snacks at the shop.

I spent $50 here just on snack, buying the cream soda and candies for my boys.
