I like Mountain Shadows. The boys I nanny take lessons here and it is never too busy and has beautiful camelback views. There are a couple ponds and running streams and bunnies hopping around, cactus and palm trees lining the course, it's very serene. I highly recommend Marv as a teacher as well, he is very patient, the kids are learning so much from him.
