Really good gelato. Our third visit.  We try to come here when we visit San Tan Village.

Numerous flavors, some of which change seasonally (no orange tonight!!).  Others are pretty stable (e.g the dark chocolate and limoncello).  The flavors are strong, but not overpowering, and very nice.  I ended up with limoncello.  Reminds me of Firenze (Italy).

They probably need to me more mindful of how they pack the cups because sometimes there are voids, but if you show them they make it right.  Tonight the void was small, so I ignored it.  Last time is was large, and they gave me a whole new one (that had no voids).

They may also be introducing a frequent visitor or loyalty card of some sort, based on what the owner was saying to me.  I'm sure I'll get to make good use of that!
