So, this is one in the series of reviews I'm throwing up there during my #transientweek adventure during the first week of July thru Southern Nevada and Arizona.

I normally censor myself to the general public when writing things on-line, but I may say this about Four Peaks - fuck yes. I love this place. Their nachos are humongous and the Kiltlifter always draws me back. In fact, whenever I go to Arizona, it slips into my mind that I need to drink a crawler's worth of it minutes when entering the city limits. Great atmosphere and near Tempe, so all the beautiful people are out. A definite must go to while in the area.
