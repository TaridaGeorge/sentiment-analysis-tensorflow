This is our favorite in Scottsdale. We loved here so much from our last trip. We came back! Their salad is exceptional with light dressing with lots of flavors. My husband and I were impressed from appetizer to dessert!
Love their ambience as it's casual yet comfortably classy. Price is just right for the portion and the quality of food. We will definitely go back before we head back to New York.
