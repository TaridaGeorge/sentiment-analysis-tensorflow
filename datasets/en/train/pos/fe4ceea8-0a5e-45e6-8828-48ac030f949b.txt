everytime I go there is something delicious to be had.

went this past week to "break up" with my room mates
and the mango yogart with fruity pebbles on top was extremely delicious; made the whole "i just don't think we're a good match"(when really I'm thinking I REALLY hate living with you, get me out ASAP) talk a LOT easier and faster and more understanding.

In fact, when I had finally gotten home that night (they drive, I ride), we had some wine...haven't hung out with them, well, since before I moved in.

Although I avoid Mill usually, Mojo you made my life a tad bit easier this week...thanks.
