If I could live off of Postino's Bruchetta Board I would. Actually now that I think about it that isn't a bad idea. The only downside of loving something so much is that I hardly venture out and trying something else on the menu. I think my favorite is the red peppers - I don't know how they get so much good flavor in a tiny little piece. 

The only other thing I have had their is what I call the "magic sandwhich." Also known as the chicken and mozzarella panin but I sub the mayo for a pesto sauce. Yum Yum Yum!

Plus they have an amazing selection of drinks and a great happy hour (if only it went a little longer in the afternoon it would be perfection).
