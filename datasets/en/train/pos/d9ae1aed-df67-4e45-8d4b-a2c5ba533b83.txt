One of our favorite local joints... Bartender/owner is SOOOO great and the one girl in the world my lady has a girl-crush on... 

That means great service... I think... 

Anyway, I'm originally from Utah so I am not sure what Cajun food is really supposed to be like... but I know what I like, and I like this food. Look, if you dare to serve deviled eggs as an appetizer, you KNOW your food is fresh and awesome.

At age 43, we are usually the youngins in here, but when Ms. Crush serves a 3 oz scotch, you gotta respect.

Get your butt over here; it's great.
