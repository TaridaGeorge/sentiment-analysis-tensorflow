This company has really impressed me in more ways than one! First of all, amazing customer service and they were easy to work with and set up an appointment for cleaning. The staff was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in answering any questions I had, and even recommended ways to keep my carpets clean and spot-free! The service was quick and the carpets looked AMAZING after he finished. I called to ask a question about removing a spot months after the cleaning service, and they took the time to talk me through how to remove the stain and even called back a few days later to make sure it came out ok! The best companies out there are the ones that truly care and are passionate about what they do. Barefoot Organic Carpet Cleaners has proven to be one of those companies and has my five star approval!!
