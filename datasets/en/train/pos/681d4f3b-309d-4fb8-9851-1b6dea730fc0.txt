This is how it's done.  Wonderfully friendly people who remember their customers and make good food for a reasonable price.  This is not your grody fast food stand in the food courts of yesteryear.  This is good stuff.  That's about the best tabouli I ever had.  The falafel was excellent, if a little salty, hummus was perfect and my taste of my daughter's gyros was very good, not overly spicy.  It took me awhile to get here after reading about it on Yelp since it's inside the mall, but well worth the stop.

This is the first time I'd been here, yet the lady remembered me just from a phone call I made a month ago to inquire about their location when I couldn't find them and didn't realize they were inside the mall.  That impressed me.
