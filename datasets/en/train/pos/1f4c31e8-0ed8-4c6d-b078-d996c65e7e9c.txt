I've heard great things about this place, and eating here did not disappoint! For starters, my friend and I had 2 mimosas. Added fruit to the drink just made it even tastier. My friend noted that the drinks weren't "strong" so the waiter gave us 2 free extra drinks! For an appetizer, we ordered a $6 red velvet pancake with cream cheese icing on top. This is one of the better pancakes I had. I could eat this everyday for breakfast! The next item we had was the tenderloin enchiladas! We ordered the double stacked for $12.95. Next off we had the $9.95 Blue Adobe Burger. This is ranked in Phoenix "top 10 burgers." My favorite part was the red velvet cake! Superb dish that I will have to come back for again! Yum! What a great "New Mexican" experience!

Note: The beans, rice, and fries are just average.
