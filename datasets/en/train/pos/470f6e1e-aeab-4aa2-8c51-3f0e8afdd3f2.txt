Romantic, cozy and beautiful environs. The staff is top notch. Our room had a comfortable king-sized bed and a warm gas-fired fireplace. The decor is sort of rustic Spanish Mediterranean.  Always the mark of a great hotel, they will deliver the New York Times to your room each morning.  Be sure to have a cocktail -- I recommend the Pepino Diablo -- in the Cigar Room at the end of the evening. This is easily one of our favorite hotels in the United States!
