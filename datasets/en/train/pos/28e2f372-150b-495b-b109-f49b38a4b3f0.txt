If eating 36 ounces of froyo would not be classified as gluttenous, I would have filled 3 cups all the way to the top and totally justified the calories.  (Which I feel fine about because it's like 100 calories for 4 ounces... wait why am I talking about calories?)

My friend, Jamie, told me to try Yogurtology last week while we were eating at another frozen yogurt place.  She claimed it was the BEST frozen yogurt.  Jamie, I hope you read this because YOU WERE RIGHT!

Yogurtology's yogurt is the best I have ever had.  I feel a little sad that my cup is empty and I'm left dreaming about it.
