Great Irish pub in the desert!  The owner's an Irishman who moved here from the Bronx, and NY Irish are more Irish today than Dublin Irish.  

The food, both Irish and American cuisine, are great.  I love my Irish grub, but incredible burgers are there to be had!  Just the way you like them; not 165 degree in the middle hockey pucks you get most places.

Can't get there enough to please me and in football season, Tommy's Irish comes out and it's a NY Jet Fan's hangout, where new friends are made every week and old friendships revived and rejuvenated.

Give me Tim Finn's any day of the week!!!  HOME AGAIN IS THE FEELING!
