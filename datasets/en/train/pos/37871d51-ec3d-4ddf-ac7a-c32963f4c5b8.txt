Woohoo! As good as gets!  Probably would give four and half stars but since I liked it a little more than that I'm glad yelp sticks to whole stars and not fractions of them.  Great pizza, with broccoli my favorite vegetable, is what you'll find on this menu!  And at 10 bucks for a small, which could easily feed two people your wallet certainly won't be giving you grief.  Oh, and the vodka penne pasta was so rich is was like a dessert but in pasta form, fantastic-ness-ism-astic!
