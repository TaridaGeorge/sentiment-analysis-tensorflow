Best gym I've been to in Arizona, hands down! Brand new everything, open floor plan, clean, the people are very nice and you have views from 4 stories up downtown, while working out! They provide services that you can't even get in Snottsdale, like laundry service, no need to carry your workout clothes anywhere. I got a great deal but the prices do vary depending on when you join. Never a crowd during lunchtime when I go, glad I joined.
