Really yummy sandwiches and cute modern decore! Perfect for lunch take-out as it's pretty small with only 5 tables inside. Love the Grilled Veggie and Goat Cheese sandwich as well as the Caprese sandwich. Didn't think I'd like the Blue Cheese Cole Slaw side because I don't care for mayonaise but it was delicious!
