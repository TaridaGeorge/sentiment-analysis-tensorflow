This place is incredible. The atmosphere, the wine & beer, the service, and above all else the food. It is a tad pricey but worth every penny and more. GREAT date night spot, great place to get together with a group of friends, great for appetizers, just dessert, wine, anything you can think of. I definitely plan on showcasing this place whenever friends or family come into town. 

If there is a large group make sure and call ahead for reservations because it is a small dining room and it does fill up!!
