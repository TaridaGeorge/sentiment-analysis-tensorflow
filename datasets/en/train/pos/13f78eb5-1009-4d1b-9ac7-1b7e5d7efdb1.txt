I had the 5 shrimp on the skewers and it was delicious.  I like animals and wildlife so I thought it was cute that ducks were swimming in the outside fountain and also walk around the patio in case someone wants to throw them a chip but you may want to sit inside which we did since it was a work dinner. My co-worker had the chicken fundido which she really liked too. The hostess is friendly.
