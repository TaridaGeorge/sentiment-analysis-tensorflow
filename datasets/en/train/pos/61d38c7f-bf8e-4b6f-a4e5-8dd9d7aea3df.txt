Love this place! I've searched out good BBQ in Phoenix and I have finally found a great "lunch spot." I've also had the catering a couple times and it is also great. 

Good prices, the line (every day at lunch!) moves fast... and you can eat outside almost every day. 

I always get the Brisket Sandwich "meal" but my friends tell me the Pulled Pork is better... I guess it's all good!
