I loved this place! We went for my birthday, with 25 people & the service was excellent! Our drinks never went empty & our server was great. The portions are pretty big so the prices are reasonable. I got the standard BLT & loved the bacon they put on it. The martinis are small but powerful! I would reccomend this place to everyone!!
