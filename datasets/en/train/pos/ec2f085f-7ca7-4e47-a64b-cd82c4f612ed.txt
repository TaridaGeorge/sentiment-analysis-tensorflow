We ate at Eliana's based on reviews we had read.  Since we had to be at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport anyway, and, Eliana's was not far from the airport, we decided to have lunch.  It was wonderful and we highly recommend it.  Everyone was very friendly and the food was delicious.  There were 3 of us and we each had something different.  Every dish was fresh and flavorful.  The juice drinks (I wish I could remember the names) were very good.  We will definitely go back.
