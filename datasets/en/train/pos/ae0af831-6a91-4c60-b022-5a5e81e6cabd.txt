I LOVE THIS RESORT!  They are so friendly and are always willing to help you at any chance they get!

The best thing to do here is is the spend the day ENTIRE day at their pools!  Try and get a Cabana if you can its worth it, food is included.  

Rooms are clean and neat, and the view from the lobby is wonderful!  if you are ever there on a weekend try afternoon tea. The sandwiches are to delicious!
