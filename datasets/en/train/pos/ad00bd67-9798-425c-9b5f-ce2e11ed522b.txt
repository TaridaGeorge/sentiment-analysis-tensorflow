I don't get to go often, but I consider this place one of my favorite indulgences.  I usually get the French Caramel Latte (soy); hot or iced, the balance of rich espresso with sweet caramel is perfect every time.  I just wish they would stock more of those amazing black and white cookies (from Chompie's)!
