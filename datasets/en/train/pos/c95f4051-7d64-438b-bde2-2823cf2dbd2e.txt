This type of joint is exactly what Downtown Phoenix (well, all of Phoenix) needs. The list of upcoming films is very exciting & I think I might be making a weekly stop at this place. The staff is pleasant & helpful & the owner made it a point to introduce himself to me. He seems genuinely excited about this venture & made it really easy for me to want to spend my local dollars in is establishment.
