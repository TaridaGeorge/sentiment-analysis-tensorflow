I had the privilege of dinning at Moira Sushi in central Phoenix on my birthday thanks to my friend Q. I must admit that I seldom venture outside of my norm due to distance, but this was well worth the drive. Everyone from our party really enjoyed themselves along with the Sake Bombers and the food. 

Our waitress was prompt and very friendly. The setting was fantastic I really liked the layout. Moira is definitely a place I will return to. Thanks for making that night a great one Linda & Q!

For some reason I didn't snap any pictures of the food, but the next time I promise I will.
