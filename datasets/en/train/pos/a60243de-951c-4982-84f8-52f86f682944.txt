Love this place. Personally I like modern, contemporary styles of coffee shops. If you are looking for that atmosphere, you should try this amazing coffee place. People are super-friendly here, the latte tastes awesome.
Last sunday, I tried the drip coffee, the taste of heaven. 
The most important thing! good place to read and study. 

I have been trying so much to find the coffee shop like here, this place was the best ever for myself in scottsdale/tempe/phoenix area.

I will definitively return,, maybe on coming weekend?! :D
