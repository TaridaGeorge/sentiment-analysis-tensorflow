I was SO excited when I saw the Sprouts going up near where I live. I am one of those noncommittal health conscious, meaning I really WANT to eat better, but not enough to drive 50 miles out of my way to make it happen. 

Sprouts makes it easy for me (and those like me) to shop a health food store; both in that they are now in the Gilbert/E. Chandler area, and because they have many familiar, "safe" foods choices along with the soy milk and organic collard greens. 

But the single biggest reason I love Sprouts is the bulk foods section. I can get couscous, wild rice, tabouli mix, dried fruits and nuts, and all sorts of other goodies at reasonable prices. And with a gang my size, saving money is right up there with eating right.
