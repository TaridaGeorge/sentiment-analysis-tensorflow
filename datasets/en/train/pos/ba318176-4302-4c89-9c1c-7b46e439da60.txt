Pho Avina's reputation couldn't be more hard earned! It's usually packed with customers to prove it! They deserve every bit of a 5 star rating! Their food is generous, and cooked with love. Their prices are modest and the menu is ripe with dishes all of such delicious properties as to make you come back and sample and savour every new choice. This place has come a long way, and it's nice to see it doing so well. Every time i come to visit my parents and friend on the west side, i have to consider this as a serious contender for that evenings meal. I hope to be back soon!!
