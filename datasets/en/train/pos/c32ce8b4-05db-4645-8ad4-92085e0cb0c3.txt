Great family-run Italian restaurant...a diamond in the rough. Hard to find good NON-CHAIN restaurants in the West Valley. This is a rare find. Definitely check it out. Looks like any other strip mall restaurant on the outside, but the ambiance is very nice on the inside, which is also refreshing to find in the West Valley! Have eaten here at least twice now and it's always been great.
