Ive been going to Lox for years and have never been anything but satisfied! The bagels are always extremely fresh, even close to closing time!  The variety of cream cheeses just makes my mouth water thinking about it!! But if you want to get something more unique their many different kinds of breakfast sandwiches will always fill you up!!  Not to mention all kinds of drinks from Juice, Milk, Chocolate milk, soda, coffee and more! Why would you go anywhere else!

The service has always been top knotch! The family owned restaurant are the friendliest around; area for kids to play with legos, tables you can move for larger groups and FREE WI-FI!!!!
