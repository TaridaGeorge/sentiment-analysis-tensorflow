I don't have much to say other than I love this place and their Chicken Salad is incredible.  It's a short walk from our house, but is unfortunately always closed by the time we get home from work.  We rejoice anytime we have a day off and we make every effort to make it to Hero Factory to pick up a sandwich.  

I know absolutely nothing about New York authenticity, but I can tell you that this place is damn good.  Try the chicken salad.  'Nuff said.
