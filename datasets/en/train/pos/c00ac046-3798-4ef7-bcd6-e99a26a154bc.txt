I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet! After trying another vet in the east valley (to remain unnamed), I was on a mission to find one that I (as well as my pooch) loved. In comes Dr Sherry Johns- she is amazing. She sat on the floor with me and my dog and talked us through some of the issues we had been having. She layed out the possible treatments based on being conservative (and saving some $$) or going full out and spending full $$ to diagnose and treat. She didn't push me into the more expensive option. 

The staff have all been really great as well. They seem to really love the animals that come in. I wouldn't take my pup anywhere else.
