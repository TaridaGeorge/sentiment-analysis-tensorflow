Adam M. was absolutely right: The Chinese Broccoli in Garlic Sauce and the Mixed Seafood Hot Pot (Casserole) are really, really amazing! I've also become a big fan of the Tomato Sauce Shrimp - tastes nothing like what you're thinking. 

Eat these items we recommend or be seriously disappointed trying the chinese staples you've become brainwashed into enjoying elsewhere.
