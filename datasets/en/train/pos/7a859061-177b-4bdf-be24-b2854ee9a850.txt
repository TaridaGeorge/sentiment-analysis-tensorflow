I've been here twice now for car repairs, and I couldn't be happier with the service and the prices.  This is the first and only place that I've been to for any type of car service (car washes and oil changes) where I feel like I'm not treated like an idiot by someone who's just trying to get more money out of me.
Tracy is awesome; he's treated me with respect and like a friend.  Customer service like I've never seen.  And when have you EVER gone to get car repairs with an estimated price in mind, and they charge you LESS than what you expected? Mindblowingggg.
This place is just amazing.  Thanks again, Tracy! :)
