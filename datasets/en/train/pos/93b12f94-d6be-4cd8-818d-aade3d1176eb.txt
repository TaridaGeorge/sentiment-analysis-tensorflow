A locally owned Mesa gem, well-known to folks from the neighborhood including the friends of mine who introduced me. The most delicious pies in the world, my favorite being coconut cream. Awesome breakfast entrees. Really friendly staff who actually seem to be from Iowa. And an interior that actually does magically transport you back to a small-town diner in the middle of rural Iowa. 

Eating here is simply a classic American dining experience from top to bottom.
