Have I mentioned that I love this place?  It is always clean, friendly employees, and fresh foods.  I am writing a review again because we came here the day before Thanksgiving to pick up goodies to bring to the in-laws.  I saw flowers that were a great center piece, so I got them.  Guess what?  I paid for all my goodies and left the flowers on the bagging area.  I got home unpacked, had dinner, getting ready for bed, and thought about where did I put the flowers.  I searched the car, garage, the house, and no flowers.  We went back on Thanksgiving morning to see we can get the same flowers or another bunch.  They were so nice and let us get any flowers at the same price.  Awesome!
