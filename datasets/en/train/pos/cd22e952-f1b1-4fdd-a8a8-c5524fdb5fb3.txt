SIMPLY AMAZING!  WE LOVE IT!

My hubby and I stopped in one day after deciding NOT to go to NYPD. 
They were next door, and we thought lets try something new. We have been there 3 times since. You sit, and the food comes by and you just grab what you want off the rotating bar. ITS GREAT! Especially if you can not decide what you want until seeing it. We ate like King and Queen for $20.00.

They have simple pricing, and it is affordable for a date or family.
