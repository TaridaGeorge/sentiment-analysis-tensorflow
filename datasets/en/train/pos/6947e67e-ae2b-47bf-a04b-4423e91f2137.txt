I highly recommend Massage N You.  I chose to have a massage here initially because of the great introductory price and proximity to my home; however, after meeting Lucas and having my first massage with him, I was thoroughly impressed with his skill, knowledge, caring nature, and love for what he does.   This is all very apparent during the massage, and he customizes the massage to your specific needs.  Since I lead a very active lifestyle (hiking, yoga, running), I have since returned to him several times to treat sore or pulled muscles, pinches nerves, etc and each time, I have left with significant improvement as he truly knows how to work at the source of the pain and restore mobility.  It is a relaxing, comfortable atmosphere, and the complimentary aromatherapy is an added bonus!
