If you are in arizona and in search of bagels, bialys, cream cheese spreads, danishes, lox, etc. .......this must become your go to place.

I discovered my family had been purchasing theirs at some other local establishment and it tasted awful. It tasted just as bad as frozen lenders bagels. I immediately told them we were taking a trip (aka 10 minute car ride) over to lox, stock, and bagel and actually stocking up on all the good stuff. 

I am also not usually one for small talk, but the owners and employees here and are so friendly that I can never help but to strike up a conversation with them.

You have to check this place out!
