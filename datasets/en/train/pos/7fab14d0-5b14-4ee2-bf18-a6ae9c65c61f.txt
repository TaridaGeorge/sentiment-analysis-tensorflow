This is the only place in Arizona to get genuine NYC bagels.  Their lox are also reasonably priced.

We bought 13 bagels and a half a pound of lox.  It came out under $20.  Their sandwiches looked great but I haven't tried one.  They were cheap.

Also, their Boars Head deli meat is cheaper here than the grocery store.

I will be driving out of my way to go here.  I only wish they had a better location, it's hidden and you can't see it from Tatum Blvd.
