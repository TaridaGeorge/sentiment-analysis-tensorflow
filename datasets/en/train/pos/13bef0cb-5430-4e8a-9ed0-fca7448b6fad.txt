Bath and Body Works has amazing scented body lotions, oils, massage creams, sprays, skin care items, bath products, perfume, home fragrances and much more.  Basically, this store has everything girly girls love and then some.  

You'll often find that the store is having buy 2 get 1 free sales or something along those lines and if you're lucky enough to catch their annual sale, you'll be able to stock up on all their best products for really cheap.

I'd say their most popular items are their scented lotions. You just can't beat them.  My favorites are warm vanilla sugar and cucumber melon.  They smell delicious and actually stay on for prolonged periods of time. I always get compliments when I wear them, even if I've applied it hours before.
