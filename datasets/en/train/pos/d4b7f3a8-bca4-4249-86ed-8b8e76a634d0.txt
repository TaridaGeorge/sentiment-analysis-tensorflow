I'm all over the CSA idea and I feel like this is the next best thing.  We stumbled across this place on yelp and I'm so glad we tried it for breakfast.  It's breakfast on the farm!  

I had a omelette which I always shy away from because of overcooked, dried eggs - but there weren't at all.  I had a bite of their Monte Cristo - and since I never had one before - it was scrumptious.  They use fresh ingredients, mostly from their farm.  

Luckily we went on a Friday morning, as we heard the weekends get crowded.  Who would've thunk there'd be farms in the desert!
