I don't have much differnt than the other 200 reviews. The pizza is amazing, the antipasto always changes and the wait is horrible. Here is a good tip for a fun night out. 

Go on a Wednesday, put your name on the list, then head over to the Art Museum (it is open till 9 on and FREE on Wednesdays). By the time you get back from the museum your table should be ready.
