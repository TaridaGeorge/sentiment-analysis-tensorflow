This place is always bustling, but they have never let us feel forgotten.  The chefs are very cordial and if you have a non menu request they are happy to oblige.  The food is good.  I have eaten Sushi in cities on the West East, and Mexican coasts and this is comparable.  I understand that this is the desert and how can it be fresh..... um Airplanes? 

Defiantly worth a try if you have never.  These guys are far beyond RAW and Blue Wassabi and for half the price.
