This was my first experience at a yoga studio and it was really great. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming and the classes had me sweating and feeling GREAT! I felt so alive and refreshed after each class and I noticed a positive change in my attitude. This is a great place to start your first yoga experience, I even got my best friend to join me and she loved it just as much as I did!
