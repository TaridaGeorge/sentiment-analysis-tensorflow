Went for lunch again. Impressed again with the food and the place was twice as busy as I've ever seen it and it was quite loud inside, which I'm ok with. Happy to see this but the service was unfortunately poor for the first time, but I'll give them a pass, this time since I come for the food and wasn't in a hurry. Nice girl but seemed to forget we were there. I don't think they were expecting the rush. I was with 4 others.

I had the special of the day which were the gnocchi with a bolognese ragu. Melt in your mouth MMMMMMM I also got a side of meatballs. They come in 3's. Love em.

SO FULL

I'll update again on the service next time I'm back.
