My first time here last night and I"m looking forward to getting back soon!  Great small venue, friendly bartenders.  I do think sometimes the acoustics were a little off, but we were listening to alternative/rock music and I don't think that's what the venue was built for.  But it was still a good sound, just not optimal.  
Loved the very eclectic mix of people milling around.  It was so not Scottsdale, without trying.  Very mellow, a live and let live vibe through the night.  Loved it!
