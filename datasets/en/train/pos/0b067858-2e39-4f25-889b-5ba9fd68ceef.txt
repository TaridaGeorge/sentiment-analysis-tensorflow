Found this place through yelp, looking for something new to try before a movie and OMG, what a hidden gem. Best Thai food I've ever had, great atmosphere (little family-run hole in the wall joint), excellent service, and the prices are unbelievably low. I just can't say enough positive things about this place, I was amazed, and I will keep coming back. If you're looking to try something new, DO NOT miss this.
