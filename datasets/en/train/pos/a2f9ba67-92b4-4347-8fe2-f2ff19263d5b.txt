It was pretty crowded on the Sunday night I visited and I was alone (in town on business) so I sat at the bar.  I wouldn't recommend doing that, the press of people was far too claustrophobic.  

The food was outstanding.  I am still thinking longingly of the Tricolore pizza two weeks later.  The crust was perfect, chewy and light and tasty and the toppings and seasoning was just incredible.  I can't wait to go back with my colleagues next week.  But we'll be getting a table this time!
