Vietnamese coffee = hooked for life. Starbucks who?
Served iced, as it melts the flavors meld into sweet, smooth, heavenly goodness. 
Fresh bread - Soft, warm, cheap. 
Breakfast Sandwiches - Freshly baked croissants filled with bacon, cheese, egg, etc. 
Lunch Sandwiches - Tried the pastrami mustard and loved it. Very filling.
