For the price, it's as good as you can get. The service is really friendly and the flat-sceen TV still has the protective liner on it!

Their specialty chicken dish is good and I like the walnut shrimp even though I'm sure it's the unhealthiest thing I could ever eat.

Going to the bathroom is fun because there is a curtain of beads to walk through!
