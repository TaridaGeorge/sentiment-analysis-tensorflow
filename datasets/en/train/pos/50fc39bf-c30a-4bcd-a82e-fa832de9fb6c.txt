There isn't a place in the valley where you can find quality cured meats from Europe....until now! From Guanciale to Prosciutto Crudo it's all devine. My personal favorites are the Porchetta and Speck! If your looking for DOP cheeses this is the place Peccorino, Parmigiana reggiano etc.
I didn't try the pasta or sandwiches but I will be in the future. The owner was very helpful with choosing a variety of different meats and cheeses and let me sample everything. So folks the bottom line is if you want a place for quality imported meats and cheeses for your next wine party don't go to whole foods come here!!
