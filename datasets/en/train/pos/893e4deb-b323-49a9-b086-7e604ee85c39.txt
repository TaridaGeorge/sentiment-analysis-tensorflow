I love the food network and glad I went to try Over Easy!!  My friend and I got the Waffle dog, Brioche french toast with bananas and walnuts, and Biscuits and gravy....and it was THE BEST Biscuits and gravy I've ever had!!!  The gravy had large chunks of meat, sausages and bacon in it!  It was very hearty and delicious!!  The Waffle dog was like a corndog, but better!  And it was served with a chili maple syrup... YUM!!  The brioche french toast w/ bananas and walnuts was another home run!!

The place was very clean with a great server who was very attentive and offered great suggestions!  Overall experience was excellent!!  I can't wait to take another trip to Arizona to eat their food!
