We see Dr Barcellona at that office and OMG! Words could never express what a lifesaver he is-and the whole office is amazing.  I took my son there at 8 weeks.  He was in so much pain and screamed 24/7.  His main pediatrician said he was "fussy".  Dr Barcellona quickly identified the problem and my son is now a happy 8 month old.  Amazing place, don't think twice...take your kids here!!
