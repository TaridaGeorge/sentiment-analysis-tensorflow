I love Twirl, and I'm so thankful it's far from where I live because I might become one of those people who thinks froyo is an acceptable meal replacement. In a town full of identical shops, this is the only place that I will get froyo. Anything else is just a waste of calories.

It's always a good time at Twirl. I've been there 4 times, and there has never been more than two other customers there making it a very chill experience. The midcentury modern decor really makes the ambience great.

I started off with the highly-touted caramel soft serve, but the praline and pumpkin pie flavors have really sealed my love of Twirl. Topped off with the killer hot fudge or caramel, it's a dessert worth craving. I'll be making lots of excuses to come back here.
