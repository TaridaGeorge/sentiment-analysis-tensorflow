Definitely an amazing restaurant, Sima and Chef Marcellino took great care of me and my date. The atmosphere is plush and romantic, i had the chef's tasting menu. Their hand made pasta is absolutely delicious.  Also on either Friday or Saturdays, they have live Opra at the restaurant which is an amazing treat.
