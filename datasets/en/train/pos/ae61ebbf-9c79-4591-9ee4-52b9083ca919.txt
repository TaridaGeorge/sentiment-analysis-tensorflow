With a name like Dirtwater,  they have to be good right? 

I'm not a big fan of taxidermied critters staring me down,  but it's a Wild West themed joint and they do a good job keeping up the theme. 

There's always a kickass special going on,   the kitchen knows what they're doing and the service is friendly and accurate every time we dine here.    

I love the veggie sandwich!      

So 5 stars is a lot for a little generic eatery out in AJ, right? 
 
I just really like this place.  Can't put my finger on it,  it's just always made me feel good.
