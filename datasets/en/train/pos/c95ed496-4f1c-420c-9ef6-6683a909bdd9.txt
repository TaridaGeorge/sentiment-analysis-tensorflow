This is a great place for Thai Food.  What really impressed me is their papaya salad which is delicately chopped (great knife skills is a must so the sauce will mix evenly in your mouth) seasoned with lime juice and raw lime peel which is finely done.  Their Coconut broth Chicken Soup with lemongrass is also heavenly and spiced properly even with a western pallet.  The Riverboat soup is good but the beef is a little tough but the base of the soup is excellent and well seasoned-little on the salty side.  Too bad they didn't have fresh sugarcane juice but settled for Thai coffee instead and all are great.  All for $5 each so the bill was in mid $20 and we had a great time.
