We happened upon this great place while in town. Unfortunately, we were in Phoenix due to family illness and it's proximity to St. Joseph's Hospital. There isn't much in the area to choose from but that's not why it got high marks. The staff was perfect, kind and accommodating. Service was A+. The food was really outstanding. We ate there three days in a row. Yep. Every dish was a winner. Put it on your list, they got it going on!
