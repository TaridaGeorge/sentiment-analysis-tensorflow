Heaven does come in a bowl.  Great yogurt and excellent fresh fruits.  I generally do the chocolate or skinny strawberry (which does not taste "diet-y").  Then I add as many blueberries as I think I'm willing to pay for, some mochi (varied flavors) and then one or two mini-Reeses.  My daughter usually gets about 3 different flavors and all types of the cereal.  Expensive, yes.  But at least we're getting some fruit in the deal!!
