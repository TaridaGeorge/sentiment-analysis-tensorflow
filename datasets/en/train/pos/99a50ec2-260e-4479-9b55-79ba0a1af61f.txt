Many years ago when we were remodeling one of of our homes we stayed at the Camelback Inn for two months. It was a great place then, nice room with a very private large patio and small kitchen set way back in the resort. I loved it.
They have remodeled this resort recently so we decided to go take a look. They were nice enough to take us on a tour and show us a variety of rooms/suites. It has been done very well and geared to complete sensory pleasure. I will be reserving a room here next time my sister is in town just to get a more complete feel for the property. But so far, very nice employees and fantastic grounds.
