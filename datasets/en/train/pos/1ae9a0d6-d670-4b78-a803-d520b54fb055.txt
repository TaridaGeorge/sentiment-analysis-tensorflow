I have been going to Strands since I was in high school and can't say enough great things about my favorite stylist Kandi. The whole staff is wonderful and friendly and while the salon is located in the heart of Scottsdale, you never feel judged or surrounded by snotty, holier than thou attitude. I have naturally thick and wavy hair (not easy to cut) and have been butchered many times from expensive, high end salons (TG anyone?). Anytime I stray, I always slap myself in the forehead and take my sorry mess of a mane back to Strands for Kandi to fix it. If someone is willing to drive 35 minutes for a hair cut with gas as much as it is, you know it's gotta be good!
