I've eaten here since they opened and have never had a bad meal.  The chicken katsu is always hot.  The spam musubi is good here though nothing special.

The regular size menu items are large enough for 2 sensible meals.  
I love the fact that their more popular meals are available in "mini-meal" versions that give you just the right amount of food.
