I've been going to Chompies for years and years... I miss the location at 32nd St/Greenway, however, the parking at PV mall is soooo much better!!!!  

I've NEVER had a bad meal here... for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.    The portion sizes are INCREDIBLE!!    Everything you could want for a Jewish/New York style deli/diner food.  

Plan on only eating half your plate and then dive into their fabulous dessert selection-- YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!
