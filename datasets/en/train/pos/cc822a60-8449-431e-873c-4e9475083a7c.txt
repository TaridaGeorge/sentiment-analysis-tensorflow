This place is amazing. Located off the main streets of Phoenix, its a wonderful neighborhood restaurant. The atmosphere is so welcoming. It's like stepping into a home with an incredible bar, and a kitchen that just knocks it out of the park with every meal. My husband and I visit Phoenix often, and always make sure to stop in. Just tried the mac and cheese with lobster and was amazed! great place.
