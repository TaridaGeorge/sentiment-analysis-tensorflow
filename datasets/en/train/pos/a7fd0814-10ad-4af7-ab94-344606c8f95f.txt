".....on one hand, I'll be dressed well.  On the other hand, my bank account will suffer."  These were exactly my thoughts when I realized there was a Ted Baker less than 10 minutes from my new home.

While Burberry and Paul Smith may get all the press amongst British Designers, for my long/thin body type the only clothing I've found that fits better and lasts longer than Ted Baker is Armani and considering the price difference I could buy 2-3 Ted Baker Archive Shirts for the price of one from Armani.  

While I must say I wish Ted's Mens Shoes were a little more comfortable that is a small quibble when everything else fits so well and the sales are frequently so good.  I see a lot of this store in my future.
