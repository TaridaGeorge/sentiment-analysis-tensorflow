This is one of those great little restaurants that has found a niche and mastered it.  The chicken & waffles here are simple incredible.  The fried chicken is certainly among the best I've ever had.  The sides are delicious (I recommend the red beans).  Even the "dranks" are terrific.  Great lemonade and sweet tea.  The service is friendly and the atmosphere very authentic.

This place does not pretend: it achieves soul food greatness.
