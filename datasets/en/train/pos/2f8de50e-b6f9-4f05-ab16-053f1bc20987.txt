I love it here and it just keeps getting better. Not only have they started serving wonderful Cartel Coffee from down the street, but they are finally serving beer and wine too, and while the beer selection is not huge, the choices do not disappoint. They have revamped their entire menu and bar area and have just made constant strides to get better and better at serving people. If you haven't stopped by yet or for some reason had a less than stellar experience, you have got to give it another shot.
