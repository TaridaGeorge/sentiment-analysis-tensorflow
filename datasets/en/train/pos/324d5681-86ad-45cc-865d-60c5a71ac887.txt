Found this place when I got lost in Mesa, I went in starving and the pleasant service was almost as big a relief as the amazing sandwiches. I ate one while the nice folks working there gave me directions, I was so grateful I bough sandwiches for the rest of the family and a few for experimentation later. Two of the sandwiches didn't survive the trip home because they're just THAT good. Don't hesitate to drop by if you're in the area because it's worth the trip and worth going out of your way to enjoy.
