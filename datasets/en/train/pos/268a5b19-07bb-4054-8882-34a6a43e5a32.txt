This locally owned family run store features one of a kind designs.  They have something to suit everyone, from diamonds to semi precious stones.  The store was busy the entire time I was there. 
The owner, Scott,  is terrific.  He takes his time with a client and one can tell he loves what he does.  He designs alot of the jewerly himself.  No two pieces are alike.  
I went in, took some of the things I no longer wear (old wedding ring from first marriage, ect) Scott gave me a great trade in amount for them and I left with two pairs of earring and a ring and money left on account.  
I get compliments whenever I wear jewelry from Treasures.  If you like one of a kind items or want a custom design, this is THE place to go.
