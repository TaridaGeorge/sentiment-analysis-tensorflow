I adore Copper Star. It's an excelling neighborhood business run by great people. The urban-feel of the former automotives company who occupied the building give it that cool-young feeling, and it's always packed with people on their laptops. (Hello free wifi!) 

Coffee here is good, and the freshly baked goods are always a plus. Staff here recognizes customers and gives you a personified feeling that you really belong here. Copper Star blows Starbucks away any day.
