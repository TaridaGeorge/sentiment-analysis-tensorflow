I have wanted to eat here for some time and finally did so today. It was a long but fast moving line of those with sausages ordering to eat the same. If you a young lady on the prowl this is the place for you. The all beef dog was perfect!!!! The cheese fries were yummy.  All for less than seven bucks. A great lunch. I plan on going back on Monday for a brat.
