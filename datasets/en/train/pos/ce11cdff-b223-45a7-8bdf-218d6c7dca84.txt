This place is awesome and I haven't even had the chance to go inside. My husband has picked up food and yummy sodas from here twice. He said the service was awesome and the owners are super nice. The food is yummy!!!! Best pastrami in town! My boys love the rocket sauce. The cheese curds and onion rings are the best! Best Deal in town.
