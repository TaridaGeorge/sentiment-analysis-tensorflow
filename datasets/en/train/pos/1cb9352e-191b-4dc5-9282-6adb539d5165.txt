Just wanted to add the cosmetics department is awesome!

The service, you have to admit, is impeccable.  My sister and I, sans kids, yey, was in search of new makeup.  We hit this department store first, but we wanted to shop around, so we hit Sephora next.  What a difference in service.  Came back to see Sophia at the Chanel counter and bought what we needed.  She included free samples that Sephora would have charged otherwise.  You get what you pay for.

Oh, it's hard to resist their coffee shop when shopping, too!
