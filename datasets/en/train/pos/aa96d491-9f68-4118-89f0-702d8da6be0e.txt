Molli is an absolutely caring and professional hair stylist. I visited her after having my hair destroyed at Socio Salon in Scottsdale and she took me into her salon last minute, the NIGHT before Thanksgiving. She was diligent, understanding and reasonably priced. If you are looking for a compassionate hairstylist that loves her job, you found it!
