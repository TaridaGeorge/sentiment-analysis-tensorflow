Lao Thai deserves 5 stars cause it's that good! As a Laotian I know what Lao food should taste like. As I was visiting Arizona from California I drove passed Lao Thai on my way to my resort. I yelped it to see the reviews and thought I'd give it a shot. Glad I did cause this place is BOMB! A homecooked meal away from home! I ate here 2 days in a row! :)
