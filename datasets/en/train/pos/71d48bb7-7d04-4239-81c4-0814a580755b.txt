Matt's new location is bigger, but they have preserved the ambiance that makes Matt's a breakfast destination.  It doesn't matter how big they make the diner; there will always be a line to get in there!  The simple secret is the fresh, real ingredients they use, locally-sourced whenever possible.  When you're a regular, they know your name and your order.  Big plus, in my book, is the new digs have a bike rack.  LOVE Matt's Big Breakfast!  It truly is as good as it gets.
