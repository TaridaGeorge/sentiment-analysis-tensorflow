I have not even gotten my dress back and I feel like I have to write a review! She was wonderful. I brought my dress in with the pins from another tailor still in and tears in my eyes over what a mess the bustle was looking. Valentina was so polite and skilled, my dress looks perfect and it isnt even done! I cannot wait to pick it up, she is also fast and super well priced. She even offered my bridesmaids discounts since I am getting my dress done. She is great, a little hard to get a hold of, but worth stopping by her shop since she takes walk ins. I am so happy to have found her.
