Excellent food, fast service, excellent customer service, great prices. Exactly what a mom and pop store should be. 

I had the 1/2lb (double) with standard toppings, cooked medium. It was superb! They use a thinner sized patty then what I prefer but make up for it in taste, quality, and size. I would have been slightly disappointed if I had ordered the 1/4lb one. They char grill on a huge 560,000 BTU cooking machine. Fast, hot and tasty. 

Great Job my friends, keep it up.
