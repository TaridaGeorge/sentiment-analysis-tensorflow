My daughter and I have had the pleasure of trying almost all of the smoothie varieties Mojo Bowl offers. Each one was delicious, made with fresh ingredients and they were all served with a smile. The owner/operator is a really nice guy who is passionate about healthy food and fitness. If you're thinking about visiting a food truck event and you see Mojo Bowl in attendance, I would highly recommend getting something.
