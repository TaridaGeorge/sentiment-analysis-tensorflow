So my wife and I are  HUGE fans of Cheuvront and the tastings they hold there several times a month. We've done Spanish Cheese tastings, Italian Wine tastings and everything in between and always have a great time! This past weekend was the port tasting and what a great event. I learned a TON about port that I didn't know and got to try several ports that I'd never had. The tastings are typically $15 and include a small plate (or in this case, delicious of pizza). Do yourself a favor and go check out Todd, Jeff and the gang and get on the email list for their tastings. it's always a great time!
