It's the best Chinese food in the Valley. My family and I have been coming here for years and my boyfriend and I drove out here from east mesa so he could try it for the first time and he loved it! If you're anywhere near by, or not! you have to at least give this place a try. The wait staff was a little difficult to communicate with, but other than that, I really enjoy the food here!
