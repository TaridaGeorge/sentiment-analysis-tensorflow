I've been to Fez twice, so I'm overdue for a review.

There isn't much to be said that hasn't been said already.  The cinnamon-dusted sweet potato fries are, well, sublime - and I don't even like sweet potatoes.

The burgers are just about the best ever!  I was reluctant to try the fabled Fez burger -- cinnamon pears???  WTF???  But oh, my mind was changed with the first bite.  Heavenly....

The service has always been great too.  Fez is a gem, no doubt about it!
