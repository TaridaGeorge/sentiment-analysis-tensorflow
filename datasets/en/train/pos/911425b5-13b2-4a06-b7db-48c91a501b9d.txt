One of my FAVORITE places for lunch in AZ.  I am always last to order when I go with friends because there is so much that looks good!

Don't be fooled into thinking that Liberty Market is just a ladies lunch place because they have awesome farm-fresh vegetables, salads, and a ton of healthy options.  Any man can get his grub on here with their great selection of hearty sandwiches, pizzas, and of course the ginormous burgers.

It's a little pricier than your typical lunch fare but in this place you definitely get what you pay for.  My top recommendations for lunch are the Rancher salad or the Picnic sandwich - yum!  Watch out for the specials too, as they are always coming up with something new!
