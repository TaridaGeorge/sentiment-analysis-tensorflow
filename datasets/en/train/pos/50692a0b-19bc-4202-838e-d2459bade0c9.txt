AJs is
my regular Sunday morning coffee walk
my florist
my gourmet mustard
my Karsh's buns
my Simply Bread Monkey Bread & Challah
(so sad, no more Willo bread)
my wine store
my salad stop
my pizza place (trivia - Chris Bianco used to work the oven here, maybe before it was AJs)
my deli
my dinner (usually salmon)
my fresh fruit & veggies (Utah peaches!)

Staff is happy, making it so pleasant to shop. Jason is a terrific barista!

A few cautions - some out-of-date items still on the shelves (two weeks ago it was eggs) and one barista/bakery worker who has been there for years who just can't get an order done. They also seem to be closing earlier.
