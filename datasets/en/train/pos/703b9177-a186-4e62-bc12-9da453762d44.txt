The family and I love this place. The pizza is fantastic, they load on the toppings. Definitely try the Chicken Supreme. You won't be disappointed.  

My kids really enjoy playing and eating in the kids area and devour the pizza. 

The price is very reasonable and even more so when considering all the food you get. I highly recommend Barro's Pizza.
