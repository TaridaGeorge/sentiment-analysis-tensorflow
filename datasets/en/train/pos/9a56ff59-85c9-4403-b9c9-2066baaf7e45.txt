I really love Wildflower because you can quickly get a good meal with quality ingredients at a reasonable price point.  

I specifically love this store because the service is great and the store is always immaculately clean.

Also, kudos to Wildflower's CEO, Louis Basile, for having a twitter presence and for caring about the guests' experiences.
