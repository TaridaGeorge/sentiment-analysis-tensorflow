I have been meaning to write this review for a while..
Saw some reviews about Lyndell and his window cleaning service and hired them as we just moved to a house with many dirty windows.
He did a very thorough and great job. He took his time to ensure everything was perfect. He is a young business-man and I am glad I supported his enterprise.
