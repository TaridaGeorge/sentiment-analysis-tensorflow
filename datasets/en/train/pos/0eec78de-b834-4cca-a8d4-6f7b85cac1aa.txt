I was brought to munch a few years ago by a college friend and have been a fan ever since. The prices are pretty inexpensive and the owners Gordon and Mary are some of the nicest people I have met. I havent been there for about a month and they still remembered my name and asked where I have been. I get the chicken sandwich with bacon, avocado and ask for the "magic" sauce. There is tons of ASU memorabilia on the walls, mainly softball and baseball. If your ever in Tempe for lunch, this is the place to be.
