Having to plan a funeral for a loved one is tough in any circumstance but this funeral home is one of the best in Phoenix. I recently came in from out of state to plan my brothers funeral and the Director Julia was the most compassionate person that I spoke to in regards to an affordable service. I asked for information and was given the total price with taxes and fees.No kidding! She didn't start at a base price and start adding fees for memorial cards, viewing rooms, refrigeration and transportation but gave me one solid price. They handled all of my wishes and request with grace and a smile. If only this was the standard for funeral services everywhere. Bless you all at "Best Funeral Services" you have truly lived up to your name.
