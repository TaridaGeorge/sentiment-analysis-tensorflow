Absolutely the most authentic, delicious Japanese food in the valley. Having lived in Japan and grown to love their cuisine, this is the only restaurant I have tried in the valley to duplicate the flavors and presentation I experienced while over there. The place itself isn't much to look at, as it used to be a Dunkin Donuts back in the day, but don't let that turn you off as you would be missing out. 

Unlike many "Japanese" food establishments it is actually owned and operated by a Japanese couple who make and prepare all of the food themselves right when you order it. From the mouthwatering Sukiyaki and Tanin, to my girl's favorite, the Oyako Domburi, you can't go wrong with Nagasaki Grill. I can't recommend this place enough.

If you want the real thing, there is no other place even close.
