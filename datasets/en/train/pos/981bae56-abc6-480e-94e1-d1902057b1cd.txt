La Fontanella scored huge points in my book today.  First any restaurant that has  been in business for 27 years HAS to be doing something right and they did everything right for us.  The hospitality was unmatched. The food sensational and fresh.  We had appetizers, entrees, wine and dessert.  Although I wasn't a huge fan of the bolognese on my pasta side, it was a minor part of an overall amazing meal.
