I LOVE BOOKMANS. My fiance just bought me a record player last Christmas so I like hitting up Bookman's on the weekends to find old records. Recent finds were Elton John and Whitney Houston, come on people, who doesn't like "Wanna Dance With Somebody"? 

Even though I've been buying and selling books for years at Bookman's I've never sold "stuff" until recently. On my last trip I took in some old posters, a calculator and random knick-knacks and they actually took most of my stash. This meant I had more credit for you guessed it, records. If you're curious they sell everything-puzzles, video games, magazines, gifts, DVDs and there's even a cute little coffee shop in-house. One of my fave hangouts for sure.
