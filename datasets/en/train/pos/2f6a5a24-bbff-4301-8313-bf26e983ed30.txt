I love Green.  I hate that there is not one closer to Peoria.  So it is special treat to go there.  My favorites are the buffalo wings, apricot miso bowl with mock chicken, the original g po boy (which tastes like the buffalo wings, so don't get them together).  The fries are also excellent, and I'm not even a huge french fry eater.

I want to like the crab puffs, but I'm not vegan, and I still love my real cream cheese.  Oh well.

Love the Soynamis when I'm not so stuffed that I can eat them, but that hasn't happened very much!
