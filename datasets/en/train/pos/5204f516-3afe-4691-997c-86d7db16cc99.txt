I went in to Frances looking for a simple necklace for my girlfriend and found several other gifts as well.

The 3 ladies who were working were all very friendly and sincere. They went out of their way to help me find the perfect necklace even pulling out more inventory from the back. I also appreciated the care (and design taste) they put into gift wrapping my items.

I was very impressed with everything and will definitely go back.
