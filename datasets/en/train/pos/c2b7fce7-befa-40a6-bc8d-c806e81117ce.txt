Went to see the Misfits recently and I had a small issue with my tickets that was my own fault. The staff was very helpful and went above and beyond to get me sorted out. My girlfriend and I had a great time at the show, very close and personal venue, great sound quality AND the bar areas are properly staffed so I didn't have to wait in line and miss the whole show just to get a drink like many other concerts I end up seeing.
