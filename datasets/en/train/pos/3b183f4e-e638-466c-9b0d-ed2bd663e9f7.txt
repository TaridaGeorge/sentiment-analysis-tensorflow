A first date wonderful experience. Thanks server Scott. Started with Escorgot- ( Hey while in France, right? ) I still smell like garlic butter. lol! I Loved the cheese herb rolls. for diner I ordered something I do not normally like or eat, pork. I  had the pork chop which did not taste like a pork chop. It was delish, melted in my mouth. Loved the pepper mixed salsa that came on top. The Creme Brulle is to die for. I am not the biggest fan of french food but I loved my dinner experience. We did go early so it was not busy at all. Charming restaurant, all wood like a little cabin in the french countryside. Liked the small chandeliers and minimalist decor and  art work. Nice bathrooms too. Good job PM!
