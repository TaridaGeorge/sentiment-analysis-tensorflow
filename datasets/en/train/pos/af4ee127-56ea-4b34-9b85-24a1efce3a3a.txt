Great food, busy on a sunday afternoon, but they handled the crowd well. I ordered the rancher sandwhich, with the pasta salad, red velvet cake, and a stone pale ale. Sandwich was awesome, everything was real fresh and lots of flavor. Can't wait to go back so much on the menu I want to try. Breakfast menu looks amazing.
