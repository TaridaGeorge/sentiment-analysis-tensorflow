The Arizona Biltmore has been oasis in the central valley for decades. I remember going to the Biltmore when I was younger and at that time I really didn't appreciate the architecture like I do now. 

This beautiful hotel would seem cold and dark in most environments, but it works in Phoenix. If you have the opportunity stay here in the Christmas season. The lights and cooler nights are ideal for hanging out by the fire pits and taking in Squaw Peak. 

Always great food whether you are at Wrights, Frank & Alberts or the cafe in the courtyard. Prices are higher, so know that going in. The Hotel offers breaks in the off-season so that may help offset that cost somewhat.
