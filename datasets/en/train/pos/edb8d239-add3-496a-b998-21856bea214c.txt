My fiance and I are from NY where you never struggle to find sushi, so I was skeptical of finding a great sushi place in AZ.  BUT..this place proved me wrong!  It was very authentic Japanese and the sushi was incredible.  Extremely fresh, melt in your mouth, sushi.  And great service.  The place was bustling and the sushi chefs, Hiro included, seemed to know all the regulars!  Definitely a place to try if you are visiting and a place to frequent if you live in the area.
