St. Francis is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix for the following reasons:

- It is trendy and chic with a cool indoor/outdoor bar and an upper mezzanine seating level
- It is neither in a strip mall nor is it part of a fancy, sprawling resort - very rare for Phoenix
- There are both moderately priced ($11-12) and more expensive ($20-25) entrees, so you can please everyone in your party
- Cocktails are inventive and tasty (try the almond margarita)
- I've tasted at least half of the menu, and all of the items have been good to great (personal favorites include the salmon and the meatballs)

Word to the wise: if you don't want to wait, avoid prime dinner hour on Fridays and Saturdays and brunch on Sunday - it can get pretty crowded!
