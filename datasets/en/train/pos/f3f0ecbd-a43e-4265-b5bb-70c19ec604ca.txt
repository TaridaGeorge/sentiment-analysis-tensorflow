Simply put, a grocery store for booze.

I'm from Ontario, Canada and our largest store is a 1/3 the size of this monstrosity.  The gin section had me welling up inside.  The Micro-brewery section and selection took my breath away.

A mixer section.  Snacks section.  Did I read someone rec'd bloody COUPONS to use here?!

An aisle dedicated to single malts?  At home, we have 200 listed on the web-site, but maybe 10% actually in stock.  Oh, and prices are 50-75% of those back home.

I am in awe of this place.
