Thanks to Yelpers, we took the leap and had lunch here.  I'd seen it before...  bright, shiny and  looking conspicuously like a former Five-and-Diner on Baseline.  I'll admit, the exterior was a bit off-putting but Yelpers inspired me to give it a shot and I'm glad we did.  

As mentioned in other reviews, the lunch prices can't be beat.  The hummus was fantastic - strong tahini and lemon flavors.  The falafel most certainly is not from a mix (or if it is, I'm betting it's in a language I can read nor speak).  The rice is uber simple but fantastic.  I don't know why.  Perhaps they ground up fairies?  

Fairy dust or no, we'll definitely be back.
