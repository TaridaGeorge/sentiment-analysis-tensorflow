I cannot say enough good things about The Saguaro hotel. The look is incredibly Arizona, playful and fun. I love all the colorful paint, decor, and the atmosphere just has an incredible vibe. The food at Distrito is to die for. The tacos and margaritas are probably the best in the valley. Old Town Whiskey is a personal favorite of mine. I love the old fashioneds. The head bartender is an encyclopedia of whiskeys and whiskey drinks. The pool is fun and relaxing. The atmosphere is hip, vibrant, but not flashy.  The staff are incredibly helpful and kind. If I could live in a hotel, it would be at The Saguaro.
