Love love love love love this place! We've been coming here for 8 yrs now. In fact, this was the place I sent my husband to many times during my pregnancy 7 yrs ago because it's so crave-inducing.  The girls who work there have enjoyed watching my son grow up and they know him by name :)
I suggest the garlic knots and ziti. Every time we have a pool party or slumber party we order their pizza.  My favorite is the plain cheese...it's so good it doesn't need any toppings.
This place is owned by a great NYC family who knows what they're doing!
