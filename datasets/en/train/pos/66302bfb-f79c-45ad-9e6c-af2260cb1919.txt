I shed a tear the day the co-op closed. I had been going there for over ten years, I knew the staff, I was a member, I had worked in the garden and recycled my glass long before Tempe did it for me.  They carried Doctor Bronner's, Quorn, Big Sky soda and delicious tempeh sandwiches. They were the first place I turned when I was sick, bought my first netty pot there and learned of numerous home remedies from the helpful staff. I loved that place. No Whole Foods or Trader Joe's will ever com close to the unique and truly organic home grown experience that was the Co-op.
