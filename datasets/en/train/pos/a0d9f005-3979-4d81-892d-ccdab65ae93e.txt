I have been here several times and always had a good meal and experience. Price wise I would say its a little bit more than Outback but not much and the meal will be better guaranteed. I usually get the prime rib with mashed potatoes and vegetables, I leave with a happy belly every time. I start off with a shrimp cocktail which is tasty also. I have to say this place is better than most I have tried including Shulas. The place itself is warm and inviting with a modern look inside, dress nice and enjoy.
