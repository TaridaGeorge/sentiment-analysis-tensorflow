Laura the best waitress in the valley is back at Jerry's she is there every night but Sunday and Monday. This place rocks again. The best late night place to go, great food, and with Laura back the best service around, as far as I am concerned every waitress in the world should go and watch her work you could definitely learn a few things. 
If I were to open my own restaurant this women would be running the show. To the owners and management of Jerry's you better take care of this lady.
