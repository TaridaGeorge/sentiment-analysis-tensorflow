Went to FEZ off of a quick yelp search and I couldn't have made a better decision!  Bottle of wine and an entree, they were delicious.  The service was great, made a reservation online, everything was super easy.  After dinner, headed to the bar had a couple of martini's; Bar service was good too.  Great food, great service, great company, what more could you ask for!
