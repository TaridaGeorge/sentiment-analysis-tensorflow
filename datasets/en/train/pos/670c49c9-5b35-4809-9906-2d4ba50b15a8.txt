Been here a number of times and just haven't gotten around to writing the review....

Noticed that a number of people rated this place very low.  The only negative thing I have to say is that it is expensive.  But it is in North Scottsdale, in the heart of Kierland.  What did you expect?

I love the pate, and the duck entree is fantastic.  The last time I was there my date had the fish (a special that is not on the menu) that simply melted in your mouth.  

I will be back.
