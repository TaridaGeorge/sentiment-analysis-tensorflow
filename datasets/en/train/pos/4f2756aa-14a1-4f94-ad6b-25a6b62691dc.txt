I have long liked Tempe Maretplace since it has opened.                                                 It is a good location, lots of parking all around. Since when live in the extreme heat it is a bit nice that it is outdoors.              There is a major selection or stores ,restaurants and services here.  My girlfriend likes it as well. So it is a win win set up. They are decorated really well and they have a multitude of events here. Even a Barnes and Noble,which bookstores are not that easy to come accross now days.
