I had two old Giant brand bicycles that I was debating fixing or donating to "Handlebar Helpers" (a great program run through the city of Scottsdale that teaches kids to repair bikes, then they get to take it home--for free) the staff was very helpful.  I ended up giving the bikes away after being reassured that I wasn't donating items that were total junk.
