Having been a regular at the Old Town Grimaldi's since 2006, when Erica Davis became the Manager at DC Ranch we made sure that we visited there.  I love the way the DC Ranch Grimaldi's is laid out and the view on to the Park behind. Coupled with the air there in DC Ranch, the special water and the coal fired ovens their pizza is without a doubt the very best. .  Our last visit was on the 4th of July.  I'm sure that my wife and I will visit many more times before the end of the year.  Let's see there's a birthday in August.
