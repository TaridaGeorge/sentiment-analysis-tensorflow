Didn't go for the food, went to celebrate a birthday tradition with 'da boot'!
This place was awesome! You felt like you were at a friends house letting loose while dancing to the live music from the awesome band. 
The atmosphere was low key with cool people which we really liked.
The bar was small, but they have a big section that turns into a dance floor, with some comfy cushion I might add.

We will be back next year, so bring on 'da boot'
