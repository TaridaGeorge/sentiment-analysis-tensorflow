Pool tables. Shuffleboards. College Football games galore. And of course, plentiful pours of the Malibu Rum :) a great spot for fun times!!! And did I mention Sundays they have free pool from 7pm to close?? Wow!!! Plus Duke is from Montana. Double the star rating!!!

Bonus points for their car service when you get a bit tipsy :)
