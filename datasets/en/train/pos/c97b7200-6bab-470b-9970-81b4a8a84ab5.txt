I love, love, love Lux. 

For some magical reason I get tons of work done here. It is always busy, noisy & crowded, but somehow I am more productive here than anywhere else these days. 

I started riding my bike from Miller & Thomas to Lux on Sundays since I need the exercise & I never get work done at home. It is worth the 20 mile round trip bike ride. 

I love their cappuccinos & the baked goods have all been fabulous. Please stop eating the quiche people, so there will be some left when I get there.

The people that work there & super chill & friendly too.

Wait a minute, I meant to say Lux sucks...never go there so there will always be a seat for me! ;)
