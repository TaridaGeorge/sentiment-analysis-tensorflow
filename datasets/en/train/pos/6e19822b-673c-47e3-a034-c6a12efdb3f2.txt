Very good Israeli restaurant right down the street from ASU.  It is a casual family-run place where you will find the usual suspects of Middle Eastern fare.  Excellent, cheap, and very large chicken shawarma sandwiches.  The combo plate is also noteworthy.  Really good falafel and I love their hummus.  The lentil soup is also stellar.  This is a no-brainer for lunch if you are in Tempe.  The service is fast and friendly.
