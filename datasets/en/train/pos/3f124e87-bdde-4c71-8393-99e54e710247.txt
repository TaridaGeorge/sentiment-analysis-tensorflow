Finally!  After spending four years in Texas during college I thought that I was deemed to inferior quality BBQ until I made it back.  However Texas has come to us!  The Chandler location is every bit as good as the original outside on San Antonio.  This place is now the only BBQ restaurant in AZ as far as I'm concerned.  Joe's is pretty good, but it doesn't even compare to Rudy's.
