If you want real sushi and a wide selection and want it fresh then this is your best bet.  This small sushi restaurant focuses on extremely fresh sushi and sahimi and less so on those fancy cooked rolls that you find in some of the other popular spots.  Sit at the Sushi bar and engage Mo the owner/operator Sushi chef extraordinaire.  I know you will find him charming, knowledgeable and fun to talk to.  Ask about the specials and his recommendations and be bold, try something new and different.
