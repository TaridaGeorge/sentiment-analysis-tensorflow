The decor in this restaurant is amazing as the food - just being here makes me feel like a hep chick! I love the different textures and openness of the restaurant. 

The menu here changes seasonally, based on what ingredients are the most fresh.  They even have seasonal vodkas!  Our waitress said that something like 95% of all their ingredients are bought locally and everything on their menu is made from scratch. 

They always have at least one vegetarian entr√©e (lately it has been some kind of vegetable rice bowl) and their soups are usually vegetarian, as well.  

Sometimes they show sports game on a projection screen on the patio, which can make for some classy Suns game nights!  The parking (at nighttime) is valet only.
