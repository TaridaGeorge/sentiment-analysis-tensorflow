THANK YOU!  For my paperback copy of Illusions by Richard Bach ~ 

My lovely client who generally always become friends, and I went to lunch and talked about books she loved.  After realizing I never read this small read, she insisted on hunting it down.

We checked 3 other bookstores in the Biltmore area and Bard's came through.  The book was only $3.50, great shape, and they were extra friendly!

Here's to a weekend reading thanks to Bards ~ Luana Joya Lucia
