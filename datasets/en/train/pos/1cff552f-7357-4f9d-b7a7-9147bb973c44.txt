This place was great!!!  We went for our employee Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  Our server Patrick was excellent, explained all of the specials and answered all of our questions about the menu without missing a beat.  Try whatever fresh oysters are on the menu, WOW!  As in other posts, be sure and get the crab fried rice as a side.  The truffled mac and cheese was out of this world as well.  I enjoyed the striped bass that was a special and tasted some from everyone's plates, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  Very nice feeling in this place from the moment you walk in, perfect for a special evening or if you are just looking for GREAT seafood in AZ!
