When I worked in the mall I always ate at George's.  It is a bit of a challenge to find unless you're in on the know, though.  There is a lot of variety on the menu - some of my favorites are the pastrami, Gaby's Favorite and the el Jefe Burrito.  I always get the Chai Tea but if you are into coffee or smoothies they have that too (but try the Chai Tea!).
