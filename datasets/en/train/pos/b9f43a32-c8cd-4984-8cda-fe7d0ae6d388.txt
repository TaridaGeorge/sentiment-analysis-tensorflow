Myself and my husband absolutely love this place.  
My husband does a lot of business dinners and always suggests this place for the dinners.  
We have eaten here a lot and have had excellent feedback with each visit.
You won't go wrong bringing a date, business partner, client, parent etc...
You can be dressed up or in a nice pair of jeans and fit in just right.
