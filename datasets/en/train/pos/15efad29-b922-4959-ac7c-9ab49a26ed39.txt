This dog park is by far my dog's favorite place to be.  He loves the fact that  there are usually only small dogs in the passive area.  This is key to a small dog having a great time.  The fact that there is fresh water in numerous areas is great.  The people there are ALMOST always friendly. (it is AZ after all)  Both dogs and humans alike seem to have a good time here.
