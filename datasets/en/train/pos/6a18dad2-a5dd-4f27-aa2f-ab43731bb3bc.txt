I went to Dr. Miller because I went on a new insurance plan that my previous dentist would not accept. My boyfriend is a patient of Dr. Miller and he likes him, so I decided to go. I was having tooth pain on a tooth where I had a crown. Turns out I needed a root canal, which Dr. Miller performed. It was my first root canal and I was a bit apprehensive, but Dr. Miller and his staff did an excellent job. I had very little pain after the procedure, and one Aleve took care of it. I will definitely continue seeing Dr. Miller and recommend him to all.
