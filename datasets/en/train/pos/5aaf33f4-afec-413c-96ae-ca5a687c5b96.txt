My husband and I came here in September 2010. It was a Sunday and it wasn't busy. Our waiter "BOSS" was very friendly and had a few suggestions on what to order. Boss and my husband chatted about football and he kept our drinks full without having to ask. The pizza was awesome and I wish we had one here in town. Can't wait to go back.
