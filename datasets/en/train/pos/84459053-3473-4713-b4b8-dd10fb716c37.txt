I really liked this wine bar/ restaurant!  Why?  I'll tell you & keep it simple.

The pros:
-great service.  friendly staff.  knowledgeable about their wines and food.  attentive but not overly so.

-great food.  i had the bruschetta and the egg sandwich.  everything was really great.

-great wine.  i've had a lot of really great wine in my life.  they have a pretty good menu at good prices.

-the bill.  the prices are really reasonable.  so you can go out, order some food and have some wine without breaking the bank.

The cons:
i just can't think of any.  :)
