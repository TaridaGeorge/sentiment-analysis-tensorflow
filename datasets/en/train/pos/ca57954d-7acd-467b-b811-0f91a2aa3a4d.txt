Dined this Saturday afternoon. We were the first customers of the day, and were seated in a comfy booth. 
Pros. Excellent service, quality food, great value.  We started with the larb salad...traditional and delicious. My better half ordered the chicken basil, which was flavorful...and bountiful. I ordered the snow pea dish with chicken and thaid up sauce...pleasantly surprised. Would definitely order it again.
Cons. Parking...of course, anywhere in Phoenix is not convenient parking.
