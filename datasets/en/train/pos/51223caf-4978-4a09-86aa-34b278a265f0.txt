Michael and I have been coming here for a few years now to get our teeth cleaned and 'my' cavities filled.  They always remind me what perfect teeth Michael has:).  I have also had a crown put on one of my teeth and they did a great job.  They are very professional and warm caring dentists who made me feel comfortable.  I would definitely recommend them if you are in the area and in the market for a new dentist.
