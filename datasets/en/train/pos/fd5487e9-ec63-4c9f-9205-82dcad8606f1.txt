I'll make this quick since it's my 2nd update. We tried the meatballs a couple nights ago & they were really good! Although, on their website it said there would be 6 ($2.95 I believe) & we only received 5. Their salads however weren't the greatest, we got a caesar ($4.95) & a greek ($6.95). The caesar was pretty good, but the greek was definitely lacking. Their pizza is the best though & that's why we continue to come here!
