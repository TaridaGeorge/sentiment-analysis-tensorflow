Loved this place!  Up scale pizza place.  It used to be an old hair salon with some of the memorabilia still there.  You have to try the Cauliflower Gratinata (I don't even like Cauliflower)!!  All the other food we tried was great too. The waitress was awesome.  My friend and I were there catching up and definitely outstayed our welcome but she was so nice and keep telling us to stay.
