Z Pizza is simply my favorite pizza place. Since I first ate here, the urban atmosphere, great food, and fantastic staff have kept me coming back for more. I can't really enjoy any other pizza. Although it's a tad more expensive than most chain pizza restaurants, the employees here are all very passionate about their product, and it shows.
