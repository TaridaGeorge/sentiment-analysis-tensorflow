NYPD Pizza and Nick's were my favorite pizza places when I lived in Scottsdale a few years ago. When I went back recently I ordered some for delivery (they delivered 3 miles away!) and am happy to say the pizza has remained great. Pizza this good is hard to find in other cities unless you are on the East Coast or maybe LA. It's even hard to find good NY style pizza in Chicago. I definitely have never had anything close to this in either the DC area or Kansas City.
