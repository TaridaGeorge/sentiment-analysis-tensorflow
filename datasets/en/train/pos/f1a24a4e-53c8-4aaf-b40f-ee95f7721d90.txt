A diamond in the rough!  Mesa is not exactly an ethnic restaurant hot spot.  It is really hard to find anything decent, so when I heard about Benjarong, I went with high hopes.  It is hidden in a plaza, and I like to go during lunch since they always have specials.  They serve soup and a wonton and a spring roll first.  Then, your entree quickly follows.  The portions are perfect.  I always east it all without feeling too stuffed.  The servers are always friendly.
