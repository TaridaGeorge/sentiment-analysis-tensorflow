I work right by this place and I was impressed with the number of techs they have available at a time. When I walked in it looked like everyone was busy but I still got in within a matter of minutes. Jackie was impressive. She was very detail oriented and she helped me figure out something different to do with my nails. The prices are very reasonable, also! I'll be back tomorrow on my lunch break for a pedicure.
