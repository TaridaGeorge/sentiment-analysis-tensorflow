I can only think of one word to describe her chocolates: decadent!

I had no idea I was going to be eating Julia Baker chocolate today, but you can bet I was thrilled when I found out she was coming into our office today. Smart woman that she is she brought her chocolates with her.

The first one I tried was their caramel truffle: Heaven!
The second one I had was the milk chocolate ganache:Scrumptious!

Warning: Do not eat at your desk. Eating might cause noises of delight.
