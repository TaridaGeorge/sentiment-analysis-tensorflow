I'll admit that I was stockpiling snarky comments before I was even in the front door. Cowboy Ciao? Oh. Ciao...Chow. A quick look at the menu showed that the place has a sense of humor and loves to combine ingredients that should not be combined. Bacon chocolate chip cookies? Do they go well with the special Kangaroo loin chops? I'll never know because I passed on both. Is deloining a kangaroo even legal??

All that aside, what a great place. A wonderful and reasonably priced encyclopedic wine list including great wines by the glass. I had a glass of an Italian wine that was $6 a glass and phenomenal. The food was great. Get the chopped salad for a starter to share.

Service was particularly friendly and attentive. Highly recommended.
