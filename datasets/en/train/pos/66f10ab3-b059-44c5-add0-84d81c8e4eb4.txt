I have been in a couple of times looking for nintendo 64 games for my brother. I don't know of any other place where you can buy N64 games and controllers at such great prices. Way safer than buying online! Every time I go, the staff is super friendly and helpful in helping me pick out games. The prices are great! You can test games out before you buy them too.
Another great thing is that they always answer the phone promptly and can answer any of my questions before I head in.
