This team really showed passion and dedication for my recovery. Even during one session the decision was made not to push me and give me rest. The next week my recovery improved. 

There is an awesome decompression machine that really did the job. Way to go everyone! Even though I was coming here for treatment (which meant I was in pain), it was something I would look forward to with the environment they provide. Jim Reilly
