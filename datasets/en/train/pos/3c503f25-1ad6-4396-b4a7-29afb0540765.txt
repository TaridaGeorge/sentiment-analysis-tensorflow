I am so happy to of found this place so close to my new home.
 It is a great location with lots of parking in the huge lot.
Reading the last review, I am very lucky that Charlie no longer works here. 
Instead we have the fabulous Edward. This guy is so great! 
I came in 3 times over the last week with lots of packages to mail.

Every time Edward was smiling and happy,even though they were so busy. He even thanked us for our business. He was so beyond helpful every time.
The best part everyone got their Packages as promised,2 day delivery even with the last ones going out right before that bad storm hit Middle America.
FED EX has always done really well for me. Plus the packages always get there unharmed.  For payment they take check, cash ,and credit.    Thank you!
