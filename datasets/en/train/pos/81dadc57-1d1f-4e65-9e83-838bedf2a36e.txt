not sure why they changed the name from squaw peak.  sup witdhat?

now, back to happy thoughts.  it's my 2nd favorite hike in phx.  i've seen someone seriously injured on this mountain in the past (not happy times).  the very last climb right before you reach the top scares me the most.   it feels like you can/will fall right over the side of this monster.  you have to be in some type of shape to get up this mountain but i still think it easier than camelback.  

i have no idea how people run up and down this peak but everytime i go, sure enough somebody runs right past me.

oh and camelback is my #1
