I love this place. I love the dishes and the flavors. Sure...its not China Town like in NYC (which is the best) but it is steady all the time and wonderful. Sure, you can go cheap and get their frozen dishes at Walmart...and they are good... but when you want some really good Chinese, thai food and best lettuce wraps this side of the great wall....go here.
