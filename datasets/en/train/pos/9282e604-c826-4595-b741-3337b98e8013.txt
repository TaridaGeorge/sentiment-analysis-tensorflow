I slipped into the parking lot to take a picture of Floridino's to put with my Yelp review and screeched to a halt when I saw this scrapbooking store--new since I was here last September.  What  beautiful,  well-lit, clean, appealing store!  I bought a couple of items and was glad to see that Chandler now had another scrapbooking store to make up for losing Recollections.  Now I will combine this with a trip to my favorite rubber stamp store--Stampworks!--whenever I am in town!
