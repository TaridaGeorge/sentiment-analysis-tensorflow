Have to say Joe's didn't disappoint.  Loved the fact that everything is fresh and either comes from their farm or close by.  Tried the garlic fries, burger, beet side salad, farm salad with green goddess dressing (I've had better) and the bbq burger with blue cheese and onion rings...everything was delicious!  I wish I had had more time to sit and order more food..
I highly recommend this place..
