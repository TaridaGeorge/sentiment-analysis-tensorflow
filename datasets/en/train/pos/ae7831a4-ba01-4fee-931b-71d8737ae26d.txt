This is our favorite local restaurant. We've been coming here for dinners (and a Mother's Day brunch) since mid-2009, when I found it on Yelp. It's in a nondescript shopping center, and if not for the constant traffic jam outside, you probably wouldn't even notice it.

I particularly like the lighting inside the restaurant; it's very relaxed and seems classier than it should be, given the location.

The burger is great, but the chicken sandwich is easily the best I've had. I also enjoy the PCG Pasta. And they have a lot of great beers on tap.

We live in Chandler now, but I'll make the drive to PCG any time I get an opportunity!
