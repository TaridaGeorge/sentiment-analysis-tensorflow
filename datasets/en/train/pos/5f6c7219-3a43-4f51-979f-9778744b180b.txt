This place is one of my FAVORITE places to eat in Az. Anytime out-of-town friends come by, I always take them to Joe's to show off this little gem of a restaurant. First off, the food is AMAZING. I've had pretty much everything on the menu, and still have yet to be disappointed. I love the grilled veggie pizza, as well as the BBQ bacon blue burger. Yum! I'm usually here w/ my 4 year old, and he loves the back area - PLENTY of space to run around. There's usually always a pack of kids out there! And the garden in the back is a nice place to walk off the food. All in all, this place is amazing! Worth the wait, the price, and multiple return visits :)
