This has been my favorite place to get a nice hot bowl of Pho (in case you didn't know, that's the beef broth soup with rice noodles served with a side of fresh herbs/ vegetables). My favorite is the soup with beef brisket, its so flavorful and just delicious. For appetizers you can't beat the fresh spring rolls with shrimp, like many said the food here is light and very refreshing. The service is very laid back, they service a high number of people most days that I go so it's understandable they're very busy. Oh and they have super reasonable prices on their items and drinks. Definitely a place to go if you want something that's affordable yet maintains superb food.
