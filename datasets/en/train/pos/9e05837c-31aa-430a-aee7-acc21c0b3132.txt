This is the most amazing Whole Foods I have ever been to. It is huge and I'd say...quite wonderful! What I love: 
- The produce. I love to pick up their pre-packaged fruit when I am on the go (it is pricey though). 
- The reusable bags. They are dirt cheap and cute. I have a bunch to take my lunch in, etc. 
- The homeopathic products. I found Traumeel - my miracle for tendinitis -  here. 
- The food bars/stations. There is a plethora of options for grabbing a quick and healthy bite to eat - I always pick up a Chinese rice bowl, but the options are SERIOUSLY endless.
