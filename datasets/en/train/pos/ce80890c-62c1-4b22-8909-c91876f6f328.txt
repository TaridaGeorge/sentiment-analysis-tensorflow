I have banked with B of A for over 20 years and have always been very happy with their services and customer service. From San Diego to Florida and now Arizona, I've found nothing but helpful, approachable employees who seem to enjoy what they do. This branch was very helpful when I was transferring my accounts to Arizona. Soon I will be checking them out for mortgage loans. I'll check back in at that time.
