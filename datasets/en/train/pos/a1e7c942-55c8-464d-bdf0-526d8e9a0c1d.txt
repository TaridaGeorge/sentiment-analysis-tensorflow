I wish I lived closer to this TJs because I really enjoy this one! While it might be situated right in the smack of suburbia, the minute I walk inside, I feel like I'm in an urbanized adventure. The products are always fresh and they have some of the best finds around! Garlic olive oil? Cookie Butter? Better 'n Butter? Yes, all these items can be found at Trader Joe's. I also love the Trader Joe's elves (aka the amazing sales staff) who are ready to help at the drop of a dime. In addition, they are always serving up samples of their delicious products and they have a chef on staff who cooks something different every day based on the products for sale. I could probably spend hours in a Trader Joe's and be perfectly content.
