What a treasure to have in this town!

Plenty of hands-on exhibits for kids of all ages. There are even live demonstrations involving flour sifters and blowtorches.

I defy any kid to be bored when flour sifters and blowtorches are on-hand.

The entrance fee seems a bit pricey, but it's an honest 2 hours of entertainment, at least. They validate parking which is free for the first hour.
