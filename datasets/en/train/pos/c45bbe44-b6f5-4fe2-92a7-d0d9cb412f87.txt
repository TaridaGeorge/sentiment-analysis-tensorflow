Mystic Paper is full of inspiration and great merchandise for Mixed Media/Altered Art projects. If you need cute scrapbook papers for your recent Disneyland vacation, this place would NOT be for you.

The store itself is in an older building located in downtown Mesa...the old brick walls and wood floors really add to the vintage ambience of the place. Check out the giant collage of antique photos on the wall above the register.

They have reasonable prices for being an independent shoppe.

The owners, Jennifer & Kim are SUPER FRIENDLY and quite helpful. Their Blog is so fun and informative with frequent updates of what their UPS Guy  just delivered....how fun is that?

Mystic Paper is a MUST see if you are visiting the area!
