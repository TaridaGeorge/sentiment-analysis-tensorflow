Dined @ Cask a few nights ago and really enjoyed it! Great atmosphere where you can actually enjoy a conversation with your group and not have to yell across the table. Menu wasn't huge but still had great selection. The Ahi was amazing...definitely would recommend to anyone. However, the service made our experience great. Our server Patrick was awesome...knew the menu and wine selections inside and out and was very pleasant as well. Will definitely be coming back again soon.
