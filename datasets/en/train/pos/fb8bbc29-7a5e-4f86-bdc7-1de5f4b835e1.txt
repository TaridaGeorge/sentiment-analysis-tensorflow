I wish I had the budget to decorate my apartment with more awesome things from Z Gallerie. They have a home decor style which is more urban and modern and less Martha Stewart. If nothing else I can always find inspiration from their beautiful collections, and then go copy it for a lot cheaper.

Z Gallerie has pretty much anything you need to decorate your house, but they don't carry a lot of essentials. It's more about the glamor in here. Extensive selection of drinking glasses, art, over the top bedrooms, and dinner settings. Last time I was there I found this one table that was decorated with all golden dishes and goblets with center pieces of gold crabs and lobsters. This is Scottsdale not the Hamptons! It was very amusing.

Great place just to walk around and find crazy things! Not your Grandparents place for decorating ideas.
