We just had 2 exterior doors replaced by Strong Home Improvement and we love them!!! Travis was a delight to work with - friendly, professional and a great work ethic. 
I am a very picky home owner and have been known to be a little difficult :) but Travis was able to meet all of my expectations. He came over twice to get the specifics, he explained to me exactly what he was going to do and kept me updated during the project. He was on-time and cleaned-up everything after he was done. 
We have a great new front door and the backdoor looks great too!
I have a couple more projects for Travis and I feel confident in recommending Strong Home Improvement to my friends and family.
