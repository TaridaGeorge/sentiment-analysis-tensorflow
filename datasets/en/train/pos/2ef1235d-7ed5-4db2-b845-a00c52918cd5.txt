The first time I went to Acacia Cafe I thought it was a sit-down get waited on type of place. Not really what I was looking for, but we were hungry and I'd heard they had great food. To my surprise I discovered you order at the counter, pick out a table and wait a few minutes until they bring you your delicious meal. Just what I was looking for, a casual lunch place. On top of the great food the prices very reasonable. You just can't go wrong at Acacia Cafe!

I highly recommend the Veggie Pannini.
