What a concept--a movie theatre that doesn't charge you $70 for a movie, food, and drinks for a family of 3.

Okay, you're not going to be seeing the newest releases, but for the price, this place is unbelievable.  The movies are generally $3, and the food is cheaper than Harkins.  You can also get refills on drinks and popcorn, unless you go to the late-night screening and the concession stand is closed when you get out.

Really cool ambiance at this place (look at the pictures).  For budget-conscious families wanting to go to the movies, forget about going to Tempe Marketplace and forgoing all food and drinks.  Go here, see a flick, get your junk food, and relax.
