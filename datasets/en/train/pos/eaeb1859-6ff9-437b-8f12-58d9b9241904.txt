Had a great experience here. After a lack-luster time at a nearby restaurant, we came to True Food. Bartender was  knowledgeable, friendly and quick! 
SIDENOTE - bartenders should be speedy. Not rude in how quickly they can serve, but able to handle lots of customers, order all while continuing to do their job.  I'm married to one such bartender so maybe I'm biased!

The prices are great! "It's happy hour all the time" cheapest beers I've ever seen in an above average Scottsdale restaurant. Food was very good and get this - healthy! 
Can't wait to come back!
