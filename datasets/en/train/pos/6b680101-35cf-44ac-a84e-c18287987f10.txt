"Hank The Great"!  He truly is. Although, I was not in the geographical area of where he services he was courteous enough to return my call. He informed me that I was outside of his servicing area and he would keep me in mind to refer someone locally to me.  I very much appreciated him taking the time. My point of view...He didn't have to take the time out to call me back when he doesn't provide services in my area. For that reason alone, he deserves hands down 5 stars!! Thank you Hank and fellow Yelpers for your referral to Hank. :)
