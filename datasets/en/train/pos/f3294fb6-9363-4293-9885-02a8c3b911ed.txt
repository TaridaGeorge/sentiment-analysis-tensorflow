Best restaurant I've been to in a long time. Kobe beef burgers, very delicious pizza and detailed salads leave you feeling satisfied. I don't recommend the garlic fries unless you really enjoy garlic. However everything was delicious and the atmosphere was completely wonderful. Worth the high price, and the staff was amazing. This place is at the top of my list of recommendations. If you're looking for a place for drinks this is the place to go, haven't been to a brewery restaurant like this before and it's amazing. Defiantly a long list of alcohol, and extensive menu.
