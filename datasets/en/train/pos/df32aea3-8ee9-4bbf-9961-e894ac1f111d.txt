I was recommended to Mesa Muffler by Highland Auto for a catalytic converter due to failed emissions. (I've never had a car fail before, but have wondered why some passed.)  I called Mesa Muffler for a next-day  appointment, and was "in and out" just as promised.  I love people who respect my time!  I didn't price shop - knowing a lower price elsewhere usually results in: and, and, and....  What's that saying again?  Oh yeah, "fool me once..."  A discount is offered for paying cash.
