This is a slice of France in the desert, mes amis. OK, that sounds weird, but it's true.

The owners studied cooking in Lyon, which is to French cuisine what San Francisco is to baseball (sorry, still giddy about that World Series win). Anyway, they know their stuff.

Our group ran through several crepe dishes, two different quiches, croissants and palmiers. The baked goods were terrific and the crepe-eaters were smiling too.

The place felt a little like some of the unpretentious places we've dropped anchor while in France. Might have been the French movie playing on the TV (Le Gendarme de Saint-Tropez), could have been the pastis bottles behind the bar, or maybe it was the Olympique Lyonnaise soccer banner on the wall.

If you speak any French at all, try it out on Pierre or Catherine (the owners). You know, when in Gaul...
