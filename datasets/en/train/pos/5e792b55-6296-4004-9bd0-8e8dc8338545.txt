2nd time I went to Grazie and both times it was excellent. The service is fast and attentive and the food great. The portions are huge so there is no problem to share the starter or the thin crust, wood-fired pizza ... So far I had the Dame Edna and the Roma pizza and both were very tasty. The wine collection is great and has some very interesting stuff which includes also less expensive wines. Haven't made it to the desert menu yet as both times there was no space left ...
