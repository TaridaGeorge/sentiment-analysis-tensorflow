Of course, there is cactus. But there is SO much more to the Desert Botanical Garden than Organ Pipe and Saguaro...

The gardens are well thought out and always well maintained. Watch for jackrabbits and a wide variety of birds. Now is the perfect time of year for a visit, as there will be wildflowers and cacti in bloom and the weather isn't too hot yet. But even in the summer, it's a nice city escape. Just wear a hat & sunscreen and try to go first thing in the morning. There are drinking fountains around every turn and plenty of shade. Try a guided tour if you have the time or are playing host to out-of-town guests. The guides are friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Even if you've lived in AZ all your life (like me) you are bound to learn something new.
