Really quality vintage clothing. I have so much of my wardrobe from this boutique. Great styles, good prices and you cant leave this place without wanting to buy a trunk filled with goods. Honestly, one of the top 3 vintage shops in town. Service is awesome, per usual. Traci and Jasmine are always willing to offer any help and throw the best community events for their shop. A+++
