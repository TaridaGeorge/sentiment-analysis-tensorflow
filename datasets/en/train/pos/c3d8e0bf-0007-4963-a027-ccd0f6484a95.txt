Do you enjoy sitting next to crazy people who have no problems invading your space? I sure do!  Luckily Southwest has provided me with the wonderful opportunity to enjoy my favorite past time.  The flights are always ridiculously cheap, I swear the employees are high off of something because they are always happy, and I think the pilots are speeding (my flight always arrives 15 minutes early!).  All planes are pretty much the same, and Southwest goes out of there way to make a little more enjoyable at the cheapest cost.  Unless I am going international, Southwest is my go to airline!
