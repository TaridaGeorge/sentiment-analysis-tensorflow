We were in Scottsdale for 5 days for spring break vacation and found this place on yelp and were not disappointed.  Our family of 5 loved the food!  The bread they bring to the table at the start of the meal is just wonderful.  We had salads to start that were perfect.  Two of us tried the pizza, one had steak, one had lamb and one had black pasta with seafood.  We all really enjoyed our meals.  My husband and I spent 5 months in Italy before having kids and we felt like we were back.  Our waiter also recommended a really nice wine, they have a great selection.  We were lucky to find this place.
