Hotshots is by far THE BEST carwash I have ever been to. Their attention to detail and the quality of work is far more superior to any of the chain washes or any family owned joint in the Phoenix area. I have lived in phoenix my entire life and they BY FAR blow the socks off anywhere else. 

I got the works wash ($19.99) and they wiped every little crevice from end to end (including the trunk!) They wiped all my leather down. They even worked extra hard to get in between the seats and the console. The door jams were were immaculate and my wheels and tires didn't have a single smudge or spot on them.

I will not take my car anywhere else. They do take awhile but you can't expect quality in 10 minutes or less.
