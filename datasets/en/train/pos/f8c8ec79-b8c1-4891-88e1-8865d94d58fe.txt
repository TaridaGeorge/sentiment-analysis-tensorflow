So, I found Michele on Yelp (AKA here) and THANK GOD I DID.  I bought a brand new gray dress for our honeymoon to Ireland in December, and when I put it on to show it off to my husband... the zipper caught on some of the fabric in the back.

We had to CUT me out of my dress.  Shreds of zipper lay dead at my feet.

So, I took it to Michele and told her the whole story... Not a problem she said...

And today I picked up my perfect dress with a perfect zipper... yaaaay!

If you needed to trust anyone with the life of your favorite fabric, trust Michele!
