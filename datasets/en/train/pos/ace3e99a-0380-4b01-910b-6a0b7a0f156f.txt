I absolutely adore Lush products.  I used to have them ship their stuff from Canada so I was thrilled to discover they had opened a store in Arizona. Their stuff is addictive and great for sensitive skin.  Their bath bombs are, well, they are da bomb.  If you are a product junkie like me you should really try Lush.  Their stuff is more than soap, its an experience!
