This is one of my favorite local restaurants. The Deli is family-owned and operated and on almost every visit, we've received table-side visits from the chef/owner to ask if we enjoyed our meal. 

The food here is phenomenal and their monthly special dinners are a treat. Favorites include the crab cake sandwich and the cuban sandwich. Make sure you leave room for dessert; their homemade ice creams are excellent too.
