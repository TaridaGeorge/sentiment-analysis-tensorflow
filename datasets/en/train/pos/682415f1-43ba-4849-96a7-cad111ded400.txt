Nordstrom razzle dazzle boom, your customer service sends me sailing away on a Mediterranean dream seas.  I purchased an Armani watch over a year ago.  I kept the receipt, I know, smart right?  Well to my dismay the movement died on it.  Fast fix wanted to charge $65 and so I thought I would give it a shot to return it for store credit.  The mens watch service associate without hesitation offered to send it for warranty repair service since they didn't carry the model anymore.  I was tickled beyond belief.  She explained the wait time, and best of all no charge.  Thanks Nordstrom, you did it again.
