I am not going to make this long as everyone else who has previously reviewed hits the nail on the head. This is a wonderful place to just relax with your friends. The staff is always friendly and accomadating and the food and alcohol selection is incredible. If you have not tried it yet then you are missing out. BTW though the nacho's are a GREAT deal and can be shared with 2-4 people!
