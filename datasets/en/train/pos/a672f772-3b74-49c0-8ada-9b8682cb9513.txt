Went for happy hour this time, and upped my stars to five! Happy hour is, for sure, the time to visit!

Another best friend in town, and we hit the place about 5:30 on Friday night (happy hours are 4-6). She got a Saketini which is the signature drink. I had a sip and it was very tasty!

We also got two apps: Gyoza and Edamame. Both perfect. 

For our sushi, we went with: Spicy Tuna, Avocado, a Salmon, and a Crunch Roll. All were very good. Plenty of food for the two of us to come out full!

Service once again was stellar. Water stayed full and our waitress answered my questions well about just what makes the Spicy Tuna spicy!

Total bill was just over $28 with tip. Love it!
