We visited Olive & Ivy while we were on vacation for a long weekend in Scottsdale, and it was hands down the best meal we had.  We were seated promptly when we arrived (we had a reservation) and our server was awesome- knowledgeable, informative and not overbearing.  The ambiance was great, sort of trendy/modern.  The space is large and the tables are spaced nicely, making it a nice date night spot.  The food was really great.  We had the hummus for an appetizer, which was amazing and had just the right amount of garlic.  For entrees I had the scallopes and he had the bacon wrapped pork tenderlion, both of which were supurb.  Dinner was a little pricey, but for the great quality of food and service I'd say that it was worth it.  If we visit Scottsdale again we will definitely return to Olive & Ivy.
