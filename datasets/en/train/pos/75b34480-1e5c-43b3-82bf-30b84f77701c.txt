Went here today for lunch, this place is amazing! The burgers are huge and they are absolutely the best "fast" food burger you can buy. They are a bit on the pricey side so don't be too shocked when it is over $11 for a burger, frys, and a drink. But it is worth every penny. The services is usually pretty fast and they are always busy, today there was a line literally out the door.
