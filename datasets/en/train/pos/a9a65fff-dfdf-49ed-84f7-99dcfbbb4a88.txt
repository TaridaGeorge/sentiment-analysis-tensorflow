I have eaten the great food from D'licious Dishes four times now and I find myself looking for an excuse to be in their part of town so I can go there again. Everything is fresh and well prepared. The soups are the best I've ever had. The prices are reasonable, the service is great and it makes me happy to support a locally owned business. This is as good as it gets.
