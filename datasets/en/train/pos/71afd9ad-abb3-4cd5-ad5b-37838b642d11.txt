I love this Ah-So! I've only had their sushi, not any cooked food off the menu (besides appetizers). Sushi is consistently delicious and fresh. We sit at the sushi bar, which is always fun and we get great service. Tyler makes an awesome yellowtail hand roll with avocado; all their hand rolls are so good (yellowtail, salmon, spicy tuna...) but that's my favorite. As for regular sushi rolls, I love the crazy yellowtail roll which is not on the sushi menu, but it's been on the special board for awhile now. As for appetizers, I've had the shrimp and veggie tempura as well as the shumai, both are very good. 
Later on Friday and Saturday nights they turn up the music and the bar gets crowded, fun for a late dinner and drinks.
