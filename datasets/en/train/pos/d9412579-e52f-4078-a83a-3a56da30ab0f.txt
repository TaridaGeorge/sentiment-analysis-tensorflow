Copenhagen rocks. I had the pleasure of stopping by the store about a dozen or so times over the past few weeks to redo my entryway and living room, top to bottom, and could not be more pleased. Of course I spent way too much money, but the selection and quality of furniture they have is quite impressive. I actually prefer this store to the North Scottsdale one, as I found the service and prices to be better.
