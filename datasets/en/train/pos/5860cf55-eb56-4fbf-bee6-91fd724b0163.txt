This is my favorite gyro place of all time!  I've been going here for about 4 years now whenever I need my gyro fix.  I usually get the #12 - gyro dinner.  It comes with a small greek salad (with bell pepper, red onion, greek olives, cucumber, and feta cheese with lettuce), strips of gyro meat (and plenty of it), and rice (plenty of that too).  Seriously two people could probably eat this meal together if you purchased an appetizer as well.
