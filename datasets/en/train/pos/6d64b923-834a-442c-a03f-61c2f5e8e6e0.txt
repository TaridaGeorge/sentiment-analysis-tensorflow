Saw the Arena Bowl featuring the Rattlers who lost in the last 2 seconds. Even though the event was heart breaking the venue was amazing. It was very clean, the suite we were in was well stocked, had a great view, and made for a very enjoyable time. It's the only Arena we have and it's a great one. We should be thankful that we have such amazing venues to watch our Arizona teams play at. Support Arizona sports!
