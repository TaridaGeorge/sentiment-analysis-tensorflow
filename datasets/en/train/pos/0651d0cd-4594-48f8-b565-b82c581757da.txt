This is a diamond in the rough. I like to try out the local eateries instead of the chain food places when I travel. thanks to yelp and you yelpers I found this place and well worth the the time it took to find it. Our group tried a little of everything and the staff accommodated us as we ate the food family style so we could try a bit of each others.
