Love, love, love, LOVE me some Switch!!!! They have the BEST hummus, drinks, burgers, mac and cheese, and more! 

Love this place so much I was taking my boyfriend out there to just enjoy a night out with some live theatre after wards and he PROPOSED to me there!! Not only do I have a restaurant in Phoenix that I love, but now it has even better memories there! 

The staff is always nice and helpful and cheerful! It's a place that is kept clean all the time! 

I found it a few years ago with a group of my girlfriends and fell in love with the ambiance, the food, the hummus!!!! Since then I've taken many people there and suggested it to others so I figured i should write up a review on Yelp! 

Absolute favorite.
