Happy hour at Brio is awesome.  The ambiance is amazing, and the food is extremely inexpensive, while being decent portions and absolutely scrumptious.  If you're curious, my personal favorite is the spicy shrimp and eggplant.

Aside from regular happy hour attendance, I've also hosted a special event on the covered North patio.  Everything was absolutely perfect, from the decor to the personable and knowledgeable servers.

It rained and was a bit cold, but the heaters more than made up for it.  Additionally, the rain made it so that or event was significantly under-attended relative to our predictions.  The management staff was extremely gracious.

Whether it's for an informal happy hour or an important exclusive event, Brio is a great choice!
