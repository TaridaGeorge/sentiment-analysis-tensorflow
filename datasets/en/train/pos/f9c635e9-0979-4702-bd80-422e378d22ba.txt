Dr. Riley is an excellent doctor.  He is well educated, intelligent and calm.  The fact that he doesn't over react and is  a great factor.  It is also wonderful that he understands many areas of medicine but doesn't hesitate to send you to a specialist when need be.  The staff is wonderful, caring and friendly.  He will also see kids and it is much nicer than going to a crowded pediatricians office or even a multi doctor office.  If you are looking for a new doctor or tired of long waits in an overcrowded waiting room Dr. Riley is your answer!
