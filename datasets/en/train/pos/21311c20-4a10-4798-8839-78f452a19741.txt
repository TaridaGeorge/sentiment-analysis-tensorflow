Traveling through Arizona and needed some 'me time' once we stopped at our hotel in Scottsdale. I called around, found Gel Q and headed over. 
Joe, my nail tech was so detail oriented during my entire mani-pedi. He was also very gifted at massage.
 The atmosphere was tranquil and professional and the pedicure chairs had massagers in them that were to die for!
 It was just the relaxing appointment I was hoping for. Thank you gel q!
