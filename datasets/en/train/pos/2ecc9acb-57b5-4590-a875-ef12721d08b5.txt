I grew up a tomboy. I am lost when it comes to a lot of this girly stuff. Basically, since I have moved to Arizona, my hands have gotten really dry because I am not used to the climate. I knew I needed some sort of heavy duty lotion to solve the problem, but I had no idea where to go or what to get. I walked in here and told the girl my issue and it took her ten seconds to respond with the perfect remedy. I then paid and left. I don't think I spent more than five minutes in the store, total. That's great customer service and the reason I will be back here next time I need something girly that I don't understand.
