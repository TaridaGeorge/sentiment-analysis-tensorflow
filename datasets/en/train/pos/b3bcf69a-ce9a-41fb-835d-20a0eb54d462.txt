What a fun store. Plenty to look at and touch. The yarn is mostly SWT  with a bit of hand spun (very nice). There is a lot of fun arty jewelery and south wester type art (a good thing too). It is a bit of a jumble with a lot to see. Be sure to look at the nooks and cranny's. Great help with selection and gift wrapping by the owner. Thanks for such a fun place to shop!l
