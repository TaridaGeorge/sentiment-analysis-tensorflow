I hadn't been to PCG in years, and had actually forgotten it was there with all the good restaurants in this area. So when we didn't want to wait 45 min to get into Richardson's, we crossed the street and had dinner at Phoenix City Grill. We were seated right away. Service was good. I love the ambiance and decor of this place. Great for a date night, yet still casual dining. Wine list was good. I can't say much for the food because I always order the same thing, which is awesome - PCG chicken pasta. Good stuff. Can't wait to go back and hang out in the lounge for happy hour soon. Looks like fun.
