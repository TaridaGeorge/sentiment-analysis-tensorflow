I want to live at The Gelato Spot.  I know the first step to recovering from an addiction is admitting you have a problem, so here it is: My name is Shannon and I love gelato so much, I would bathe in it. 
This place is amazing! Amazing I say! They have tons of different flavors of gelato, from Almond Snickers and Cookies and Cream to other fruity flavors that I haven't ventured over to yet.  I'm too mesmerized by the candy-filled gelato to try the fruit (don't judge me). And the best part is that the gelato is good for you. It is! I swear! It says so right on the wall. It's lower in fat than regular ice cream, so that means you can have two scoops instead of one.
