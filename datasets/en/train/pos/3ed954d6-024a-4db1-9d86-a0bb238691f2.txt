I spent a great deal of time looking for places myself and my girlfriends would enjoy for our winter escape to Phoenix from Minnesota.   

I found out about Postino and had to try it.  SO glad I did!  Enjoyed the eclectic atmosphere and the great adjectives my server used to describe the wine.  

I had the pick two  - prociutto/brie panini with a side of roasted pepper/gorganzola soup.   All to die for!   The ladies at the next table ordered the mix of baguette with different toppings.. looked amazing.  

I was there for happy hour and sat on the patio.  I love the atmosphere, very comfortable and non-pretentious.   Very good value.  My bill after eating and having two glasses of wine at happy hour was $21.  

My girlfriends arrive tomorrow.  Postino is a definite stop.   Love it!
