I have NEVER had a bad meal here! Amazing food, wine list and overall a great little gem in Cave Creek. My husband and I frequent this place for dinner (the tenderloin trio is amazing) and I would recommend this place to anyone who loves a fantastic meal. It's also very romantic in the winter, cozy with a nice fireplace!
