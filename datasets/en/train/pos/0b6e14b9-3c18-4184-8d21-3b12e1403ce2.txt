A former Colleague of mine gave me the skinny on this place 20 years ago.

Since then, I have kept it as one of my closely guarded secrets because it is just that kind of place but i guess the word has gotten out since.

I really can't add anything that hasn't already been said by fellow reviewers, so let me just say, "What happened to Chuck Hall and the Brick Wall?".

If you want to have a fun night out with people aged 21-60+ who can let their hair down, then go here.

You  WILL have fun!
