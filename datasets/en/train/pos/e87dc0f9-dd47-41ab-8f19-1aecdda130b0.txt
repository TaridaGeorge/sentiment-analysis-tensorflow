So it's not the BEST sushi in the world, but it was good, fresh and very fast.  I enjoyed the caterpillar roll, and my dinner companions had yellowtail sashimi (which I had never had but now a great fan) and Ahi tuna roll (always a favorite)....
What I was most impressed with was our server, she was funny, attentive and very sweet.  Service goes a long way with me, and we didn't feel rushed (even on a Friday night, which they were only marginally busy) to leave after we were done eating (might have helped that we ordered a second round of beers though....)

I bought this on a Groupon, and was very impressed.  We will return and happily pay full price.  Good job Groupon for a great deal, and GREAT job Yume sushi for NOT treating us like a discounted customer!
