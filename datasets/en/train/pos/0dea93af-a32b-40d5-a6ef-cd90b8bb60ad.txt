I first heard about Tammie- the cake goddess- when I was at a friend's wedding.  She had this gorgeous wedding cake that looked too good to eat.  But eat it we did and every little crumb was amazingly tasty.

I remembered Tammie Coe when I was planning a friend's shower, and she created the most beautiful flower covered cake for her.  It was a hit with everyone, including the mom-to-be.

It looks like Tammie can create a cake in the shape or design of just about anything, so all you have to do is ask.  And you can choose the flavors of your cake of course.  

These cakes might be a little pricey, but they're definitely worth it.  They make a great centerpiece because they're so intricate and pretty, and they taste amazing too!
