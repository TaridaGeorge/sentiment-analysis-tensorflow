We stayed here last month as part of our anniversary treat.    Very nice, clean, beautiful hotel.   Our room was a junior suite overlooking the golf course.  Wonderful room with an over sized balcony.   There was a bottle of very nice wine and a cheese and cracker plate waiting in our room when we arrived.  Staff was friendly all the way around.   We ate lunch at Nellie Cashmans and thought the food was great.  We did not eat at Deseo, but stopped in at the bar next to Deseo for happy hour and everything was "spot on."   They have a chocolate/dessert bar in the lobby from 5-9 pm.   All good choices.  We did not use the pools so cannot comment on that.   The hotel was very quiet.   No thin walls.  Would stay here again.
