Being German, I'm always on the lookout for a good German restaurant. I'm always skeptical of reviews because you never know if it's someone who never had German food, someone who's been to Germany once and thinks only the food they tried was authentic, or real Germans who are biased towards their regional tastes. 

My opinion is that the food here is usually great but can be hit or miss. Be sure you are prepared to spend some time at the here. It's not a place to stop in for a "quick" bite for dinner.  

Oktoberfest is a blast at this location and I try not to miss it. They've had the same band flown in from Germany the last few years and they are a riot.
