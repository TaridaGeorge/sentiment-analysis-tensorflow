Swimming pools... NOT CHEAP!  You find this out the hard way when you buy a foreclosed home!  Leslie's Pools have been great to me.  I've become "Norm" every time I go into there!

Phil (the manager) has been GREAT!  He has been EXTREMELY helpful (just short of coming out to the house and doing it for me). ;P
