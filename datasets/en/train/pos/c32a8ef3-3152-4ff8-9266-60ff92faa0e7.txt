Yes this deserves a five star review. Everytime we have gone we have been pleased. They have- get this - HOT FOOD  I am sick of getting luke warm food at restaurants. We had the tenderloin medallions and even though I like it well done they were still moist and not dried out. Give them a try. You won't be disappointed.
