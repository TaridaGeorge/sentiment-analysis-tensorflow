I'm giving this place a 5 because it's one of the best burgers I've had in Phoenix. The real score is somewhere between a 4 and a 5 though. 

I truly dig the burger. They clearly use quality meats - in fact, they advertise this. The fries here are fantastic as well. We grabbed this to-go, and the fries were still crispy and perfect. They don't have beer quite yet I don't think, but they will in a few weeks. They do have a really cool assortment of soda bottles though.

I like the concept and the execution. I'm glad this is near my house. The owner and the staff are cool, and I hope this restaurant succeeds.
