I was quite impressed with the Clearance Center! Lots of selections and a huge huge store! I bought $500 worth of dress clothes and shoes for under $100. For someone who hates to shop- this is truly something! You kind of have to know how to sort through the racks of clothes, but I was patient and it paid off. David, in the shoe department, was especially helpful.
