This place is great.  It is the best pho I've had in Phoenix and it is cheap.  You can have a meal, plus tip, for less than $10.  My favorite is the curry pho, I believe they call it Thai style.  It has some heat and some sweet from coconut milk.  I add in the jalapenos and basil and enjoy.  All their dishes are great so don't be worried about ordering something new.
