Another of many places I've forgotten to Yelp about! 15 years ago, my wife's cervical shunt failed causing severe issues...but all the "specialist" we saw at other hospitals failed to pick up on it. We walked into Barrows, a nurse walked past us and said "a bad shunt, eh?" many thanks to Dr. Rekate. Pretty much saved my wife's life after the brain surgery her performed on her. No issues since!
