i didn't have the same lame service as everyone else. my drinks were refilled frequently, we got an awesome spot on the patio and the weather couldn't have been better. 

and the food, oh man!! the strawberry pancakes were amazing! we also ordered the monkey pancakes (banana, coconut, and almonds) and they were only so-so, I wouldn't order them again.

Their bacon was perfectly crispy. the only bummer is they were out of coffee soda which I have been wanting to try. Oh well, next time.

This place was super hard to find, it's in the actual scottsdale mall where they have all of the culture fests. we parked in the parking structure by los olivos.
