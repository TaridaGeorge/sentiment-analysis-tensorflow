Shady's is my absolute favorite bar. Completely unpretentious, a great mix of people and reasonably priced drinks. If you really want to experience Shady's at it's finest be sure to go on a weekday as the weekends are always crowded.
Everyone here is friendly, including the bartenders. 
My one and only gripe about Shady's would be the ammount of people that just HAVE to play "Bela Lugosi's Dead" by Bauhaus over and over and over. Sure, it's the only Bauhaus song you've ever heard but it's the worst song to play at a bar. So please, stay away from the Bauhaus album in the jukebox, the regulars will thank you.
