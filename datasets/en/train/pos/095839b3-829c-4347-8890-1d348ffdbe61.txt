Go here for the food and go with my sister-in-law!  Boy, does she order enough to satisfy everyone in our party, making other diners in the restaurant envious of our meal!  
They weren't too busy the last time we went and the food came out faster than we could all get to the dishes.  We were surrounded by Kowlown crab (fried and covered in fried garlic and peppers) peking duck, singapore noodles, mushrooms with gai lon, pea shoots, peking pork, shaking beef, black bean clams and we ate it all!

Where we go for a Chinese food fix.  Better with groups, but good with my hubs too - we order eggplant, peking pork and fish w/ bean sauce just for the two of us!!  mmm
