this review is loooong overdue.  TIC played at our wedding back in October '11, and absolutely rocked the house.  From classic '80's to modern day hits like Lady Gaga, they will make your big day unforgettable.  my friends and family kept saying throughout the night that this was most fun they have ever had a wedding.  keep the booze flowing, the speakers turned up, and you'll go out in style!!  no one wanted to leave!  working w the band was great too.  they knew exactly how to MC the night and kept the energy high.  professional and courteous from our first meeting to the actual big day.  everyone will forget the food and flower arrangements, but a band like the instant classics will be memory soon not forgotten.
