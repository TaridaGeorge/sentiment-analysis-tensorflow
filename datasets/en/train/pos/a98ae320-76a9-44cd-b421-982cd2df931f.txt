I have 4 children and I've been shopping at Urban Kidz for years. The clothes are fun and unique and I appreciate that they offer lines you can't find at Nordstroms or some of the other boutiques.  The owner cares about her customers; both kids and parents.  I love that as a loyal customer I get previews to sales which are a don't miss opportunity!  The pj's make THE BEST gifts and they last forever.  My friends line up for hand me downs and they've been through 2 girls.  The Splendid line is great and they carry it for boys too -the fabric is like butter. Large selection of Billabong also and that is a very reasonably priced line.  I never leave without something because  it's a guarantee hit with the 
kiddos and they like looking different from their peers.  Definitely not Old Navy!
