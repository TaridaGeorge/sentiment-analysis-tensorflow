We love this hotel and stay here whenever we visit friends in AZ. We always get a good rate: this last time we also got $50/day food credit. Perfect!  The rooms are spacious and comfortable for our family of four - thank goodness. Also, no noise from surrounding rooms and fairly easy to keep a good temperature.

The main attraction at this hotel is the kid-sized water park and mini 18-hole golf course. The kids could play here for days. Also, the pools in the hotel courtyards are nice too. The hottub is always nice and hot, the way I like them.
