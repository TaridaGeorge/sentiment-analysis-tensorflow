Well, I must say that their online store is awesome. They were the only online store that had the band patch I was looking for. They use paypal for payment which made me feel secure in my purchase and shipped the product out pretty quickly. I had a problem with paypal giving them a past address that needed to be updated and had no problem getting in contact with a store rep who had the address changed to the right one. Was a great buying experience.
