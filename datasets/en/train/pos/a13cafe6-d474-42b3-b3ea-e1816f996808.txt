I have been a client of Faith's for five years now. She is a very talented stylists and super sweet. As an educator for Eufora, Faith knows the importance of using quality hair products in and out of the salon. She can help you achieve your healthiest hair and scalp, to look your knock-your-socks-off best! I recommend Faith to anyone looking for an exceptional stylist. As a licensed hair professional, that says a lot.
