Stumbled upon Hula's with my girlfriends in the winter and we fell in love.  I think we came 3 straight weeks in a row even though we were suppose to be trying new restaurants out.  We couldn't help it, we would go on Wednesday nights when happy hour was all night.  They have delicious drinks and appetizers, I love the sweet potato fries and the crispy coconut shrimp rolls.  I have tried many of their dinner items and always come back to getting a huge house salad with chicken.  The dressing is amazing!  Absolutely love Hula's and would recommend it to anyone!
