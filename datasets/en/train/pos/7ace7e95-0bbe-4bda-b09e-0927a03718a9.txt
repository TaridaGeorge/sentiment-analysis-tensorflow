Best. Pizza. In. Mesa. HA! Not saying much I know. It has been YEARS since we've eaten at Sourdough Pizza but boy was it GOOD. 
We lived in Chandler and don't remember how we heard about this place but boy am I glad we did. 
It is as far out in Mesa as you can get I am pretty sure.  Once my folks were visiting and we were taking them there for some yummy za.  My dad asked if we were going to Utah for pizza? FAR! 
We ordered the Fireman's pizza. Pepperoni with Jalapenos. Holy GOODNESS!  You can order it on a scale of 1-10. We usually ended up at about a 4 or 5 I think.  
Seriously delicious crust too. 
YAY SDP!
