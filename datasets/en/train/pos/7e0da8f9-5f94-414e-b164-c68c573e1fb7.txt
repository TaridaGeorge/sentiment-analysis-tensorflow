On our first trip to Autostrada we had a most delightul European breakfast! I had the delightfully light scrambled eggs with roasted baby artichoke and spices ($7); my husband had the tasty mushroom and cheese omlette ($7). Also, a great Latte for moi and an Italian Hot chocolate for him. The decor is chic, inspiring -  lots of natural stone, with glass and warm orange leather chairs and chrome. Outdoor seating is available. Good natural lighting completes the picture. We would definitely go back for lunch or dinner. Mostly Italian wine list with  one CA selecion but priced well. Prices were really reasonable for the quality and the setting plus we did not feel rushed or pressured to order more. A real bonus for North Scottsdale. Will soon be a neighborhood gem. B&B Scottsdale
