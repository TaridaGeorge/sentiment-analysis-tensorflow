Amazing pizza, one of the best I have ever had.  I had the Sonny Boy, which was a simple pizza with red sauce, mozz, salami, and this imported italian olives.  Super delicious, but be careful, it can be a bit salty due to the amount of thinly sliced and baked to perfection salami.  Salty and delicious.  But by far, the star of the show is the crust.  Its chewy, crunchy, baked just right in the brick oven and absolutely delicious.  The service was friendly, the location is only a short walk away from the light rail station (5-7 min) and is in a sort-of gated off little alcove surround by other bars and small restaurants, right in the back of the Phoenix Science Museum.  Definitely recommended, and would go again next time I stop by Phoenix.
