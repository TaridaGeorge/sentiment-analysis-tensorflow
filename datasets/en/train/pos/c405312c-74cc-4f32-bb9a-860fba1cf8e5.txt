These guys do indeed rock. I had a similar breakdown a few blocks away last summer and I walked to their shop and the guy on duty drove me back and jumped my car and would not take a dime from me. I went back the next week and they did a ac service and put a new battery in and the AC was cold as ice. Sold that car shortly after (Mercedes 300CE) and had the dealer do the service on it but my girlfriend's 93 Chrysler Imperial needed some work and a new battery so I took it to them and again they simply did a great job, priced below my anticipation and just plain old nice folks!
