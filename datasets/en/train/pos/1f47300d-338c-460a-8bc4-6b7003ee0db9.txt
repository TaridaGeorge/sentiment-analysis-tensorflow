I concur! This place is DEE-LISH! 

I had the beef stew and fry bread, and my friend had the vegetarian taco. Her taco was HUGE! Bigger than her head! She couldn't finish it. I think it could easily feed two people. 

The ice tea has free refills. Hells to the yes! 

Next time I will split a taco with my husband so I have room to try their desserts. mmmm....cinnamon and sugar fry bread. I'll be back!
