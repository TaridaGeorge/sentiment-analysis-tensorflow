Black Market Minerals is the only reason I go to the Arizona Mills Mall anymore.  It is the last good store standing at this ghetto gangster/ vato hotspot. It has a wide assortment of beads, African drums/masks, decorative mirrors, stones, and jewelry. 

 I could spend forever in this store just wandering around. My favorite items there include their large African Masks. I bought 3 of them for my apartment at about $14 each. They also have some awesome sun mirrors, wooden and mosaic ones.

Even if you don't have any money to buy anything (as most of the people hanging around this mall rarely do), just stop in and look around...you won't regret it.
