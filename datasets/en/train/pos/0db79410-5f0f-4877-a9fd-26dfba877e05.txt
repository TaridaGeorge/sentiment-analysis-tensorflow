This stylish resort is located at the base of Camelback Mountain and about a mile from Fashion Square and Old Town Scottsdale. The location couldn't be better. The salt water pool is a dream to layout in during the summer. The huge hot tub is a delight in the winter. They have a poolside bar, a restaurant, a gym, a sauna, a spa, racquetball courts, tennis courts. The villas can accommodate 1 to 8 people and have a kitchen and dining room. 

I've met lots of people from all over the globe here. The people at the front desk have always been friendly and chatty. They seem to get a kick out of the fact that I've been going there for 23 years.
