"Hey Dan! How's it going?" 
"It's going good! You?"
"I'm great! Good game last night."
"Thanks man!"

This is the conversation I had with Dan Majerle the last time I was there. There's NOT a better sportsbar downtown the Majerle's. Great beer selection, great food, great location, and if your luckey you can talk to Dan freaking Majerle! That guy drains 3's and half court shots like a stripper uses her pole. Majerle's is a MUST on game day. Before, after, or both.
