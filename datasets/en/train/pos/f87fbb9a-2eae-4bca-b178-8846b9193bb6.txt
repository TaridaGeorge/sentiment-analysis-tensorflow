We recently went to Elements with a group for my husband's birthday.  From start to finish, the service and experience were excellent.  I have seen mixed reviews and was hesitant to book as it was a (40th) birthday.  But, it exceeded my expectations.  Valet was easy, ambience was very cool but not pretentious ,service at the bar, friendly.  They accommodated our request for a table for the occasion, waitstaff were efficient, and the food was excellent.  Half of our table had the sea bass special and it was delicious.  It is pricey, but keeping that in mind I would highly recommend the restaurant.  I'd also go back for drinks at the bar.
