This is a very nice store. I have to say a bit more helpful than the one in Scottsdale.
This location knows what Nordstrom is known for. Great Customer Service.
This is a few days after Christmas now and there is still major mall activity.
More I think than before Christmas.
But, Nordstrom is still nice, still easy to be there and to deal with.
I had to return a pair of shoes I had gotten for Christmas. Why?
Because, I just did not like them. 
Nordstrom is great with returns as well. They took them back , credited the account and I was on my way.
Plus they are the nicest decorated store in the mall.
