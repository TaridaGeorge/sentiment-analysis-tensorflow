I really like this bar & restaurant.  I usually come here to meet up with a friend and sit at the main bar.  It is modern and clean.  There are a couple bars to sit at and they even open a big door to a bar for the outside too.  They have some good brews on tap and have flat screen tv's as well.  

I have only had a burger and fries here.  They burger was really good, the fries were really greasy and were just okay.

The staff here is friendly & speedy.  I would recommend this place for a good place for someone looking for a nice place to grab a drink and converse.
