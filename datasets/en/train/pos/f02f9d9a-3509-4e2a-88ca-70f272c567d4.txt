Umm delicious!! New Category: Best Drive Thru Burger

There will always be a throw down on who has the best burger in town. Yet, its usually the crafty artisan types that win. No complaints there because they are usually tasty and deserve a prize. But when it comes to fast food and drive thru's we are all guilty of indulging in one to many chain establishments where no credit is due. 

This is where Lucky Boy saves the day. An establishment that has been around since the golden age of fast food serving up charbroiled burgers to order, ice cream shakes, and crunchy fries that won't break the bank. 

I picked up the 1/4lb international, fries and a coke for just around 6 bucks. Delicious! Swing by and check this place out.
