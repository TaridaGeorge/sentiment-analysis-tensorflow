I lived half my life in Phoenix and when I was a kid my parents always took me regularly to feed the ducks. This last time I went (Aug 2011) while visiting family, so my dad, daughter, and I made our traditional visit to this park. I love this park and always will. Its clean, pretty, and how can you forget the DUCKS! There are so many ducks, and if you bring a loaf (or two) of bread it is so fun and easy to feed them. Some are more friendly and eat right from your hand, or lips!

If you're looking for a fun, basically free, thing to do in the area, this is a must do. A casual date, friends, family outing, it does the trick.
