Jay provides mobile dog grooming.  He also specializes in dog walking, training and physical training.   My slightly crazy, rescue terrier took to him instantly and Jay has since become the only way we would groom him.  I strongly suggest you look him up if you live in the Phoenix Metro area and prefer not to leave your dog at a groomer's for a full day (plus the quality is much better than what I've experienced in the past).
