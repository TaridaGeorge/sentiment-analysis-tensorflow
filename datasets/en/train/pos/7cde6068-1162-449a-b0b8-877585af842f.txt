How have I lived 3 miles from this place for 8 years and had never been in until a few weeks ago!?!?!

Man, I was doing it all wrong. Home made sausage, good Italian pasta, San Marzano tomatoes, everything you need to make a great meal all in one shop, with a side of personality!

I haven't tried the sandwiches yet, but looking at the big old hock of prosciutto de parma in their cooler, I'll be back for those next!
