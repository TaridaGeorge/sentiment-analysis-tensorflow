I live in Northern Virginia and whenever I visit the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, I make visiting this restaurant a priority.  The food is delicious and very reasonable priced, especially compared to Genghis Grill.  The food and the recipes at YC's are significantly better than Genghis.

I believe for $9.95 (1 big bowl), don't quote me on the price, you get the entree with rice, noodles, soup, drink, and ice cream.  Even it is a dollar more, you will not be disappointed.  Looking forward to my next trip to Phoenix!
