Now that I'm living in AZ full time, I need to hit Dilly's as often as I can. The sandwiches and wraps are still great! The Poore Bros chips are still fantastic. I'm a big fan of the BBQ Ranch flavor. I never stray from the goodness of these flavor of chips.

My favorites sandwiches are the humdinger, dilly club and then the mexi, southwest and chicken cesar wraps

You can't go wrong with any of the sandwich choices on the menu. The cookies are very tasty!

All sandwiches and wraps are $6.99 and come with your choice of a side and a pickle spear.

During the peak lunch hour, you wait in line a bit or struggle to find a table to sit.. Order usually come out within 5-10 minutes during peak time.
