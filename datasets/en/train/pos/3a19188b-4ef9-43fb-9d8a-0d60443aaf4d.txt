This place is excellent! I had the multi-grain pancakes and shared a side of corned beef hash. Man, you never see corned-beef hash these days.

It's great! The lines are long and deep with lots of S'dale peeps, but if you can stand that -- it's worth the wait. I also love that they have sugar-free syrup on the tables.
