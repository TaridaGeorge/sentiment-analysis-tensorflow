This is my Sprint store, and it's also a repair store, so how cool is that! I rarely ever have a wait, thought yesterday I had to wait 20 mins, but come on now its holiday season shopping time. Customer service has always been great, never a bad experience with Sprint and their employees. Found out that the issue with my phone was not a Sprint issue but the manufacture issue, but was offered a great deal to replace my phone even before renewal. My csr was Caesar, and he was friendly and very helpful. I just can't part with my phone, I do like it lol and will wait until I can no longer stand it.
