I finally got an opportunity to check out Go-Kat-Go's new location in the Melrose District, and I must say I'm impressed.  While it doesn't look like they have fully 'moved in' yet, the new location is bigger, and it looks like the store is expanding  it's furniture inventory, while maintaining it's great selection of great vintage and kitschy clothes and home accessories.  They are a welcome addition to the M7 strip, and will only enhance the neighborhood's draw as a great place for treasure seekers.
