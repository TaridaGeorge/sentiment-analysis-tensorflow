Went to Golden Buddha today for Dim Sum and it was awesome! I had not been in quite a while and I was very impressed with the quality of the food. I had some calamari from the cart and it was so crispy and delish, better than ever! I also tried the the special of the day, Alligator in black bean sauce, was awesome! Mixed in some shrimp dumplings, egg rolls, Chinese broccoli, and hidden rice. Service was great also, my date was very impressed and we will be coming back here again often!
