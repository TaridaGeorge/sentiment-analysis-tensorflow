A liquor where you can actually go in and talk about the liquor.  The guys know what they are selling and have a lot of cool stuff.  My uncle has been looking for Arak and Ouzo.  I know where I can find them in California but had no idea where to find it in AZ.  Stopped at every liquor store along my five mile drive and not only did these guys have know what I was talking about, they had it.  Bought both bottles and was happily on my way.  Now I have a go to spot for unique liquor in AZ.

Also, it helps a lot when the place is clean and not full of guys buying $1 cans of beer and single cigarettes.  Definitely one of the best liquors stores I've been in anywhere.  Keep up the good work guys.
