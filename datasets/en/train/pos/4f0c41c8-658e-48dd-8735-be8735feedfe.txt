I love the food here! I have had salad, soup, pasta and the sandwiches and I am yet to be disappointed. 
The pesto Cavatappi is very good. I am usually not a fan of pasta but it's that good. 
The soups are all great and my favorite panini is the chicken pomodori. 
If you have room then try a dessert. The coffee cake and whoopi pies are tasty.
