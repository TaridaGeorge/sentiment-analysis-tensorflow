The roasted corn pizza was absolutely delicious! And, the LGO chips and dips plate (guacamole, salsa, & pimento dip) as an appetizer was amazing! The grocery shop next door is very pleasant as well... Lots of cute items and yummy desserts! Aside from Phoenix, AZ apparently there are other LGO locations in Santa Monica and Pasadena... Wish there was one in NorCal! In summary, this place is fantastic!

The only con: this place is always busy... However, the wait is so worth it!
