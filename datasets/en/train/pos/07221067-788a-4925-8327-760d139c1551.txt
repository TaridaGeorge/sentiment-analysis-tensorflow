Took neighbors here for lunch and we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The small salads were big enough for all of us. They had several yummy-sounding dressings and all the ingredients were fresh. Reasonable prices. The place was empty at 11:30 but there was a line waiting by 12:15, so reservations are necessary during peak hours.
