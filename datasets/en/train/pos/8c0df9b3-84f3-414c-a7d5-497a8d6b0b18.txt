What an adorable little idea. I was afraid they would go out of business when BevMo started getting big in Arizona but I'm glad to see it's still doing well. 

It used to be a must hit stop for me when I was a teen. Now that I'm a little older my tummy and teeth can't handle all that stuff but I still have fond memories of it. Does anyone else remember when it was a TINY little nook? Their new location is much nicer.
