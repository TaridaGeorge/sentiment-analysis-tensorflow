I love this place!  I have been going here for years.  There is a reason why this is the only restaurant that survived in the Pavilions after all of the other restaurants, movie theater, and Best Buy were closed.  

You make your own mix of meat, noodles, rice, veggies, sauce, etc. and they cook it on the wok for you.  Prices have gone up since I first started going here.  I believe dinner used to be $7.50 and now it is around $10.25 (for dinner, lunch is cheaper), but it is a lot of food.  Get a to go box for $.75, which comes out to $11.  Keep in mind this includes a drink and a huge amount of food, if you get a to go box it is enough for another meal.
