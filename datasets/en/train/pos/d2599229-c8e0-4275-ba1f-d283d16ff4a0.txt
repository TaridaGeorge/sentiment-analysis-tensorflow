This is about the ONLY reason I miss my old job: it was right around the corner from "The Farm".
The first time I went, I thought it was so peaceful to be in a city!  I love the outdoor picnic tables and their potato salad is to die for!  
It reminds me of my small town back East.  Friendly, open-air, with good, homemade food.
