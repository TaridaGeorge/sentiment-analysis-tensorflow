Really everyone? Just 4 stars? Crow's Dairy get's 5. They have the best chevre I've ever tasted. Consistently excellent smooth texture. The flavor has the nice tanginess of goat cheese but it's very smooth and clean. Some goat cheeses can get a little too overwhelming. I've been buying them at a various local farmer's markets for a while. Since I'm slow on the uptake I didn't realize it was available on the shelves of the Phoenix Public Market every day of the week. Now that I know that I'll be eating it much more frequently. Yum.
