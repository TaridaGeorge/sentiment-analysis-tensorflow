It's pretty much a given that In-N-Out is amazing and if you don't like it, then there is something very wrong with you. So this rating is for the service. This is probably the busiest location, but the food comes out pretty quick considering all the people. I didn't realize how great the service was here until I went to an empty In-N-Out in North Scottsdale and my food took forever. Oh and quick tips, my favs are a neapolitan shake and animal fries, YUM!
