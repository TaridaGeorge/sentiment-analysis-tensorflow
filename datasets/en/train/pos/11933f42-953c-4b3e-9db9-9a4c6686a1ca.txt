I simply love this tea store!  Not only do they carry a great selection of different teas and tisanes, but they also have a variety of pu-erh teas which is hard to find.  The owner is very knowledgeable and willing to help you find that special tea you had in mind.  My personal favorites are: Butterfly kisses (an amazing flavored oolong that shows it's character thru 5 steepings), Scottish Caramel Pu-erh (an excellent pu-erh to get started on), Strawberry Shortcake, Pu-erh Yunnan, Lavender & Fig black tea, Fortune Cookie, A Weekend in Aspen and many more!!  I also just found that they carry a very useful pitcher for making ice tea for the summer.  I couldn't afford it at this time, but I will definitely be going back to snag one for pool season!  I highly recommend this great tea store. :)
