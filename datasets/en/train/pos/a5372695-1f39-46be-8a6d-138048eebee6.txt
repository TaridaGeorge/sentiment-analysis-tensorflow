I am a donut lover, for sure and as such, I've eaten at a LOT of donut houses in many states over the years. BoSa's donuts are as good as the best donuts I've ever had; those old school, old fashioned-tasting donuts that are not only made fresh in-house, but are made WELL (not all in-house mom-and-pop donut shops are created equal). 

I've stopped here at all hours of all days and ordered just about every donut available at one time or another and they are always fresh, always yummy... I wish I could pack up BoSa and take them with me everywhere I move because great donut houses are extremely hard to find since the Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donut franchise explosion.

Bottom Line: BoSa = delish donuts available 24/7.
