I love In n Out. And since I'm the Duke, guess I've got to write a review on it right?

The food here is by far the best you get for the price you pay. Only complaint is I wish they had Bacon for my burger, but that'd probably be not good for my health! I love their hours as well, they are open very late even on weekdays (1:30 I believe?). They are always clean with friendly service.

Whether you're getting a burger, fries, or a shake, you'll definitely be pleased!

And you can hit up the drive thru too!
