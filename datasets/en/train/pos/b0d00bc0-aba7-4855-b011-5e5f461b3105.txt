This is one of those places that doesn't get enough acknowledgement! It's been here for years. Businesses have come and gone in this particular plaza and yet, after 6 years, they are still there. With a simple idea but one they are passionate about and so it shows in what they do. I've tried many different things here and have never had anything I didn't love. The Colada Cooler is my fave. The smoothies come with 2 boosts. Like calcium, energy, immunity, ginseng, etc. They also have great Acai smoothies. They have juices and yogurts too. This place tastes better and has more selection than any of those OTHER juice smoothie places!
