This place is bomb!  I have eaten here several times and have never had a bad experience!  My co-worker suggested My Big Fat Greek, and I drove right past it to get to Med Fresh.  The portions are very generous, and most importantly the food is DE-LISH!  For the price, you get a lot of amazing food.  The chicken kebob is my favorite, and it comes with saffron rice, hummus, salad, tahini and pita bread.  The staff/owners are incredibly nice and will happily chat with you about the food if you ask them questions.  I would say it's not quite a "hole in the wall" but definitely not a chain-gang restaurant.  GIVE THEM A TRY -- You will earn your membership into the "Clean Plate Club" for sure!
