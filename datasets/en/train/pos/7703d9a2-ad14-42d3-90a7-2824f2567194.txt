This place is located at a somewhat "ghetto" area with no decoration, but overall environment is clean with friendly staff. 

The menu is authentic with unbeatable price. Their order of spring roll with egg and pork are two for $2.50. Their Egg Sandwich with two sunny side up and Asian pickles are $2.50. Most their noddle dishes are around $5. I usually get two appetizers with one entree for about $10 or so. If you feel trying something adventurous, they also have some authentic exciting items such as duck with sour bamboo soup and such. 

They are very good at accommodating your needs. My vegetarian friend got her Tofu Egg Roll and Veggie Pho was super pleased and has visited the place many times since then all the way from Tempe. 

I just want to say this place is truly un"PHO"gettable~
