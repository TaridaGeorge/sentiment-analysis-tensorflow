I went there few weeks ago, it wasn't bad at all. I like this little store, people are very friendly and helpful. They have all kinds of Russian food. I like their plemeni they're awesome. Love Russian beer too!!!
If you haven't been in the Russian store,  you have to check it. :) 

Definitely going back there.
