Another Detroit/Dearborn transplant here in search of that elusive good middle eastern food in a sea of tacos,chimi's chipolte...
I think i finally found it in Flaming Kabob..
After being disappointed by Haji Baba's food (the store is preemo) i did a standard search and came across Flaming K.
i ordered chicken kabob..the garlic sauce was soooo good..chicken was tender perfectly seasoned ..
I cant wait to go back and try everything else.
