Mastros consistently delivers exemplary food and service at all their restaurants. The sommelier was not as helpful or patient at this location as I am used to at Mastros and suggested I decant a Bordeaux  I know as being perfectly balanced right out of the bottle with no need of decanting and while it didnt ruin the wine, it took away from it. Regardless, it is a fantastic restaurant and next time I go in, I will give the sommelier another chance to impress me, maybe then I will edit my review. Also, the wine mark-up at Mastros is above the "standard", but that is made up for by their provision of a sommelier...
