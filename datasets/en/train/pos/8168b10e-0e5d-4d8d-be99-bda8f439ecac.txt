We own two commercial parcels and three residential homes. We have been through the list of A/C repair companies in the Valley. We tried April A/C because of their Yelp reviews/ratings. The tech arrived at our rental house within the hour, and since we are travelling in Montana, spoke with my husband at length on the phone before making any repairs and even sent photos of the problem. Finally! We have found an honest, affordable, reliable A/C repair company. If you need A/C service, call this company! Thank you, April Air!
