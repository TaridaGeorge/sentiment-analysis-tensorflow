I am seriously craving those little toasts with the two kinds of spreadable cheese they bring you before your meal at Flemmings right now.  DEAR GOD do you think you can get that to go?

I have had a fantastic experience every time I've been to Flemmings.  Great, sophisticated atmosphere with waiters who know their food and their wine.  Great wine selection, btw.  

I always have the filet there and its always cooked to perfection, along with the asparagus and blue cheese mashed potatos...holy crap--DELISH.  

Great upscale date place...I've also seen groups handled well here too.
