My wife and I went here yesterday for the second time in less than a week. Both times we split the Do-It-Yourself Banana Split, which was delicious. I have to tell you, this is a great ice cream parlor. It has a great comfortable feel to it. Kind of like you're going back in time to an old fashioned ice cream parlor from the fifties, but the best part was the ice cream. I'm not sure if they make their own ice cream but this stuff was delicious. For a great dessert place I highly recommend the Sugar Bowl.
