15 minute wait.  BAM.

We started off with the spiedini, which was delicious.  We did a half-and-half Rosa and Wiseguy, and let me just say, it was amazing.  New York pizza was screaming at me, bitter and betrayed, and I ignored it because I was busy having a freaking love affair with that pizza.  I'm still thinking about it right now...

Not in a creepy way.  In a foodie way.

We ended our charming meal with some really amazing cappuccinos.  And did I mention the 15 minute wait?

Oh, I did.  Twice.
