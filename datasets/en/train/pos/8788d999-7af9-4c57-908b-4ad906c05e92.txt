I love BADASS! I come here only a couple times per year when I am visting my brother since he lives up the street from here.

I always get something iced and delicious.  They always have flavors such as various candy bars, and combined chocolate syrups. The one thing they do that I adore is that they make their iced coffee with ice cubes made of coffee, no more watery iced coffee! LOVE IT.

I always will come to BADASS when I am travelling away from Boston to Surprise!
