I am obsessed with Blip.fm & Pandora. I keep a notebook with me at all times, specifically to write down new music I need to buy that I come across using these 2 magnificent musical tools. When I need to track down a new find, I will go here. I have loyalty to Eastside. I frequently visited when I lived here before, and have never gone in not finding what I was looking for. Its smaller than it used to be, but its still awesome. Staff are friendly, super helpful too.. And they have a sweet collection of vinyls, which is rad. I will probably be back here within the next week, at least once.
