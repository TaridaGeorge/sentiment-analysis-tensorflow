We've been to Tuck Shop a couple of times. We recommend a reservation for peak weekend hours since the place is tiny. We've had the same slightly snotty, disinterested waiter both times, but bar service has been a bit friendlier.

Can't say enough about the amazing food. I believe we actually fought over the waffles last time. I'd pass on the lobster mac if i went back, but most everything else was delicious. 

Definitely recommend this for a date night. It's the perfect neighborhood restaurant!
