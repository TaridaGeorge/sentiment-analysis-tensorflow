After a year in the Valley, one of my girlfriends took me to Side Bar.  I really like the atmosphere.  It was sleek yet cozy. The night we went in, it was hopping but not overly crowded.  A welcome sight considering much of my first year in the Valley was spent in crowded, pretentious Scottsdale hotspots. 

As I get older, I crave more intimate setting and SideBar fits the bill.  Also, I give five stars to any business who goes out of their way to help a good cause.  SideBar is just that kind of establishment.  If anyone is on Twitter, follow #buzzcation.  @SideBarphx has let #buzzcation folks hold a number of networking and fundraising happy hours.  It's a cool crew so come out and joing and I commend SideBar for always accomodating this crazy crew of tweeples. :)
