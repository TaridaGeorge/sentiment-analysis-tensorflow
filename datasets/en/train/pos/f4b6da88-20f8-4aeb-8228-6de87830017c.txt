I love it here. The food is good. Warm. Pretty fresh. This location is smaller than an other location i have been to. But both locations greeted me at the door ready to answer questions and make suggests. Both places were quick. Both places give you a chocolate covered strawberry for dessert.

With their pick two combos a drink doesn't come with it. But you do get nice portions for the price of just two items. And if you do get a drink they have a drink station with another  menu to make your own non alcoholic mixed drinks. Made with those flavored syrups like they put in. Your coffee.
 They have wifi here but we couldn't log on. 

I will come back someday.
