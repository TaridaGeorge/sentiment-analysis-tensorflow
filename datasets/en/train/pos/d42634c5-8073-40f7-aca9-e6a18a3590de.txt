Pino's is hands down the best pizza in town.  The ambiance is nothing to write home about and neither is the service but the food is delicious.  I love the pizza.  Its just as good as the pizza I've had in Naples.  The penne boscaiola has great flavor and let's not forget the pasta marinara.  If you're looking for a place that lacks pretention and a thirty minute wait, this is it.  Try it out.
