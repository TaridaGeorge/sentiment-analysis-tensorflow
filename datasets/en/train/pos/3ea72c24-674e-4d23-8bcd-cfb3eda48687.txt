Wednesday afternoons are free - and you MUST take advantage of this!  

There are new exhibits every few weeks, and once you have been a few times, you start to pick out special pieces that become familiar and expected, and yet always continue to intrigue and inspire! 

My favorite thing to do is listen to a meditation podcast or instrumental music (not classical - but latin, indian... something interesting) and take in the art with my own soundtrack going.  Very art-school, I know - but totally fun and indulgent :) 

Please go and enjoy! 

(*also, the staff there is friendly and helpful and do not hover or stand weirdly close to you while you look a things. this is a big plus)
