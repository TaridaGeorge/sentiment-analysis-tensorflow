This place is great!  Easy to find, with a huge selection of shades.  Although I was just coming in for a repair.  I didn't even have to drop off and pick it up.  They fixed my broken lamp switch in under 5 minutes for free.  They couldn't have possibly been nicer or more knowledgeable.  This will be my go-to lamp shop from now on!  And locally owned, to boot.
