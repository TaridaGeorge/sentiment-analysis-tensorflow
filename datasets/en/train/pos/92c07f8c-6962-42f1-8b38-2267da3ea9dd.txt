OMG, where is the 6th star for Joe's Real BBQ? :D

What can I say about Joe's? Found this place via Yelp when planning my trip to Gilbert and was expecting some good bbq as rated by fellow yelpers.  Needless to say, it did not disappoint!

I had the sampler plate: Ribs, chicken, pulled porks, brisket, + 2 sides (mac & cheese and coleslaw)  for $12.99!! and  fresh lemonade all for another $2.  The bbq sauce was delicious, and I especially liked the pulled pork (considering I'm not a big fan of pulled pork, this says a lot).  The ribs could be cooked a little longer, as I like my ribs to fall off the bones. But it was still delicious nonetheless.

For the quality and price, you can't beat this!  

+ $0.25 for coffee! 

Can it get any better?
