Undiscovered gem! This place is fantastic. The restaurant sits in a nondescript strip center on southwest corner of Indian School & 24th St. Since it was the first time we had been there I decided to try a bunch of different items and see what we liked. 

Chicken Tikka Masala was rich and spicy. Very good. 
Chicken Malai Boti was green (yea, green), grilled, and really flavorful.
Vegetable Briyani was standard rice with veggies. Still good.
Mantoo was the highlight! Little dumplings stuffed with meat. They are topped with a combination of curry and yogurt. So, so good...

You should definitely check this place out. The ambiance was overwhelm you, but the certainly will...
