I bought the ticket for $13/each person at Groupon.  A great deal for adults & kids.  My kids enjoy the slide and water wave a lot.  Safe & clean environment.  I went on Weekend in August.  Even there are lots of people going to the park, but the waiting is not so bad.  Each ride has at least 2 life guards watching.  Definitely a great place for family with young kids to adults.
