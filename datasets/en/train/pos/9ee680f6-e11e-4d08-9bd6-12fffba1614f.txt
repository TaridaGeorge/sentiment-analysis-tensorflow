Whenever I'm back in the Valley for a visit I try to make it to AZ88 with my girlfriends.  I love this bar/lounge/restaurant!!  The atmosphere is amazing and the martinis are even better.  I recommend the Tartini.... SO good!  The prices of the martinis are a little high but these martinis are bigger than  most that I get at other bars so well worth it.  The food I've had here has always been top notch.  I love the fries, the buffalo chicken salad and buffalo chicken sandwich, BLT and grilled cheese and chips and dips.  SOOOOO good.. 

LOVE THIS PLACE
