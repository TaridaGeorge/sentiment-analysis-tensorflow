I LOVE this patio.  It's lit well, warmed when it's too cold, and just has a great circular energy.  Last night we were here and a large group of obviously totally plastered men and women stumbled off this enormous camper that had just rolled up to the entrance.  That was weird.  Overall, an easy place to spot skinny jeans, or your philosophy professor at ASU.

Good burgers.  KILTLIFTER!  Don't forget to ask for the beer on special.  They give good deals on good beers!

Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  The bathroom is really really nice for a regular run of the mill bar.
