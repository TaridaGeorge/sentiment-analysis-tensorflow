From the outside, it looks like any other restaurant in a strip mall.  But walk inside, and it's long black tables with benches, molted candle wax covered wine bottles and some pretty tattoo clad, pierced, rocking, and very friendly staff members.

The menu explains the pastry and it's a interesting story.  I grew up with meat and potato's so I was expecting something like my mom's pot roast, but within a pastry shell.  What I didn't expect was that little bit of mint in mine.  I ordered the lamb and mint but didn't expect it to be savory and stand out, but it was good.

I also tried the desert pastries, be ready to wait, they take a while to bake, but it was worth it.  Shirley Temple's pudding, sticky toffee pudding, imported British treacle, and served with creme anglaise.  We enjoyed the food, and we enjoyed the service.
