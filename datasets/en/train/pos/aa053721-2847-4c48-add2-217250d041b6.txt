Best new spot to open in Cen Pho for ages.

The goat cheese app is amazing.

I ate the best (bone in!) pork chop on the planet. The polenta... perfect. The presentation, artful. My date ordered the chicken, hot and smoky. The chicken wasn't bad, either.

The bread is real bread, with a crust that one must chew and chew and chew. And chew. It was heaven.

The service and ambiance are so good, I forgot that I was still in AZ for just a few minutes.
