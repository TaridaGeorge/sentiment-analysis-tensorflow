As a health nut Bombay Spice doesn't really satisfy all of my requirements. I would like to see organic produce/meats and wild fish/shrimp utilized in the cuisine, but alas this is still a tasty healthy-ish place to eat. The shrimp curry lettuce wraps are really tasty as is the naan (which again i wish was organic). They do use olive oil, as opposed to trans-fat or something rancid like canola oil, so that is an awesome start. I would say 5 stars for taste and for being one of the healthiest Indian places I have come across. Of course if health is not at all a concern of yours the food here tastes PHENOMENAL.
