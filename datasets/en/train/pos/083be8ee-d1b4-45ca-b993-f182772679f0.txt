GREAT food! The place is small, but the price is right! I had the steak burrito combo and it was so flavorful. The rice and beans were fantastic.  The guacamole wasn't quite my thing but that's just my personal preference. I will certainly be back. Don't be fooled by the building, this place is a gem.
