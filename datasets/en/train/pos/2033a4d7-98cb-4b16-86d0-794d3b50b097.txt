I'm surprised at the previous review!  I've gone to this establishment many times and have always found it very clean, I read up on health inspections of all the local restaurants to avoid ones that have issues and I've never seen this one come up, I always see it labeled gold with no major violations.  Bugs are a little more bold this time of year since it is monsoon season, even with the exterminator we pay to come to our house every month a bug or two slips into our house.  

Anyway back to the point, I think the ice cream here is fabulous.   Much better than a chain like Coldstone.  The ice cream cakes are also awesome you can have pieces of candy or any other mix-ins put into your customized cakes.
