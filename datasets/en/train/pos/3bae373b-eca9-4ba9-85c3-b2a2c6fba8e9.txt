This is the best pizza place I've found in Phoenix so far.  Truly one of the must-trys.  I think they have a grandfathered brick oven?  Not sure if its a rumor or not...  but something makes their pizza delightful.  Very good New York style pizza!  I haven't been able to try anything else but judging from these reviews I really should..

Oh, and did I mention?  Its like 3 bucks a slice!
