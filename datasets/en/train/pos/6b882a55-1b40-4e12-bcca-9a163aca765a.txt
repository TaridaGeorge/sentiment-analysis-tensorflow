I Love this place. It is by far the best Italian deli in AZ. I have been here numerous times and never once have I had a bad experience. 
The guys who work there are always very nice and helpful.
 They have lots of food  and beverage options!

I recommend the caprese salad and any of their sandwiches. SO delicious 

The only down side is that when they are busy, the line long can also mean a long wait before you actually get your food.
