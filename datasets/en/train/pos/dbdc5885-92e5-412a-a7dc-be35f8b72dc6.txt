We really enjoy this pub, especially on Tuesdays for quiz night. The food is what you would expect and the service is excellent. Being close to our home is also a plus. The interior is well thought out and a real departure once one steps through the door from the strip mall atmosphere where the pub is located. I can't believe that someone complained about the parking unless they are unable to walk 50 yards out into the GIGANTIC parking lot that serves this pub and all the other business within close proximity. The crowd is a real mixed bag which is great. One can tell this pub is owned by actual British folk (Scottish actually - even better).
