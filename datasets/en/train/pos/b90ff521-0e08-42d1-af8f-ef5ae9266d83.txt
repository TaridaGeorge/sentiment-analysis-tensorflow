My husband took me to Roy's when we first started dating and I have to say I was blown away by the food and service. 
My husband had the Ahi and I swore I'd never take a bite of something that raw, well, it's now a favorite of mine, it melted in my mouth and was so truly amazing. I can't tell you what I had because it's no longer on the menu but it has shrimp-
Roy's is classy all the way around ....
