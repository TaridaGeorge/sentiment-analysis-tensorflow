Here's the thing about Joe's...for how good the bbq meats are (and they're really good!), the side dishes are better. The mac and cheese is killer; so are the stuffed potatoes and baked beans. The salad is incredible. This is a fun restaurant with really yummy food. Very informal and relaxed atmosphere.
