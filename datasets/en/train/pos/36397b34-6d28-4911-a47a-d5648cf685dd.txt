When my mom was high school she worked at Riazzi's in their old location. (Torn down looooooong ago.) The same people who owned it then, own it now. Growing up Riazzi's was always a constant part of my restaurant experience. (The owners remember my mom and she still talks to them when we go.)
They have great food, made from old family recipes. I have always enjoyed the chicken piccata and chicken marsala. I like the red wine, the bread and desserts. Riazzi's is a true Italian family restaurant that has been a part this community for many years, and for a good reason: They are great at what they do. 
It's local, it's real, it's my kind of place.
