My first trip to the Orange Table was less than memorable. The (greasy) breakfast just didn't sit well with me. But given the success of my second visit, I think maybe I had caught them on a bad day.

The Orange Table is locally owned, and it is somewhat hard to find. Once you make your way inside, the atmosphere is cozy and the service attentive. But it's the food that stands out here. Truly some amazing sandwiches. I ordered a chicken salad sandwhich. Sounds boring, but it was absolutely delicious. Makes me want another one right now. My friend opted for the Cortez, a tuna steak sandwich with avacado and other goodies that she couldn't stop raving about.
