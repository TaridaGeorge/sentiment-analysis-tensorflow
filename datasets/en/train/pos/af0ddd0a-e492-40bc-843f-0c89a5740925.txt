Finally a place with good papaya salad AND they serve it with wings AND you can get it Thai or Lao style! What?!! They don't serve it with sticky rice, which is a bit of a bummer, but who cares? It was delicious.

There was only one waitress and a pretty busy night, but she was holding her own and very sweet, so that was good.

My friends ordered Pad Woon Sen and Pad Thai which they thought were really good too. We were happily stuffed campers all around. One of my friends was preggers (aka hard to please), so you know they threw down on her Pad Thai or we would've had some hormonal issues all up in that place. ;)


Definitely on top of my list for Thai food in the Phoenix area! YUM!
