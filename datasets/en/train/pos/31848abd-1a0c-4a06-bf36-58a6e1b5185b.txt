Wow! I'm so glad Al's Beef is back and it is waaaaaaay better! This time the beef portion is much better for the $$ and the service was truly a great experience coming from the fast food joints! I'm definatley coming back soon and I will bring my family and friends as well! Thanks for re-opening Al's Beef!
