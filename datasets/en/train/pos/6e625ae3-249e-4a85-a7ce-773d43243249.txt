Oh Joy!
It can be found on the top of Camelback Mountain at this Resort. 
It feels like you are at some famous persons private retreat home. My spa treatment was delightful. The spa attendant was one of the most friendly women I have met. After my relaxing massage I sat poolside for a munchie. 
My only complaint is sharing it with uppity snobs who have no regard for anyone but themselves. 
Check it out on a weekday during off season!
