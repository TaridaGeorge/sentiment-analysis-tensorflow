Great lunch place to get a drink with a vendor and enjoy a great meal, but still be able to keep a conversation going.

Sometimes you just do not want to not have a waiter interrupting your conversations every 5 minutes, but you do want semi elegant food and atmosphere. I have found this actually pretty hard to come by.  Well, if Italian food and wine are on your taste buds, this is the solution.  The food is fast and taste above average along with the service being above average, but that would only get it a 4 star rating.  The location and the fact they have alcohol there in the form of wine for a great price, makes it a 5.   

Great food 
Great price
Great service for a counter order restaurant.
