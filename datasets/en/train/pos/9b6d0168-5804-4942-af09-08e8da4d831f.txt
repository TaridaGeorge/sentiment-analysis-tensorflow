This is easily some of the best pizza I have ever had.  I love the Rosa and the Wiseguy.  The wait can be the most difficult part of the experience, especially if you are starving.  I personally don't think the wait is that bad, there are tables to sit at right outside, you can spend time next door at Bar Bianco or across the way at the Rose and Crown, so at least there is something to do.  The place itself... I like the atmosphere inside, the staff is friendly and helpful, and the bathrooms are clean.  Aside from the pizza, I found the appetizers and salads to be quite enjoyable.  There isn't really much more to say at this point, but I do believe it's completely worth the wait.
