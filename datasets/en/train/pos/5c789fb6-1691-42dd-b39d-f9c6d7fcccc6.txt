This past weekend I had one goal. That goal was to find the best sushi joint in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area and thanks to a great suggestion of a co-worker I found it. Then I Yelped it and I drove about 20 minutes and had one of the best sushi meals of my life. I spent about 60$ and it was worth every single freak'n penny. The sushi chef, Masa, was one of the kindest and coolest people I've met. Also, according to Masa, all of the sushi they serve is 100% fresh. They don't use the vacuum packed and frozen fish ever. I fell in love.
