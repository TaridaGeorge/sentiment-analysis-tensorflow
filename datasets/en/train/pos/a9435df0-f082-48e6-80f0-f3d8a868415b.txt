I LOVE Swizzle Inn. I went there after a recommendation from a random drunk one Christmas season and have made a point of going back ever since. The decorations are amazing, and I'm fairly certain that they decorate for other holidays as well. I like its high tables and relaxed atmosphere. I've been going infrequently over the past few years, and it's always the same lady behind the bar. The people are incredibly nice, seems like they have some steady regulars. They don't serve food, so they don't mind if you bring in your own. And perhaps one of the nicest things, besides the wonderful decor is how nice the restrooms are; they even have lotion in the ladies' room. I believe they have an award on the wall for best restroom at a dive bar. 

Love this place. Great for relaxing with friends.
