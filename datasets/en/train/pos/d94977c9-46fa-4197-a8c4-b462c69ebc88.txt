This is my favorite hotel of all time, so far, at least of the Kimpton ilk. I experienced nearly impeccable service and a super comfy bed, organic and local products, a lovely shower, and general happy relaxation. I love that the gym and pools are open 24 hours a day. The decor, half Asian deco and half Southwestern, works works works.
