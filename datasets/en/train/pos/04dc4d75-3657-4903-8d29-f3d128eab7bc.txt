I agree with one reviewer with the fact of matter is that venues like this are a dying breed these days.  Tempe was full of small venues years ago, and it was awesome to have lots of touring and local bands weekly.

Easy to get close to stage, quick to get drinks and large enough to not feel crowded.  Who gives a %#@# if the walls are not lovely.  Go to old town scottsdale if you want glitz and glamor.  Or stop being a whussy and go enjoy the show.

Be glad that this venue still exists for now, because when it is gone...you will be sorry.
