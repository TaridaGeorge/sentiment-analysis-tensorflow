I'm an ASU student and I go here every time my parents are in town.  NEVER HAD ONE BAD THING!

The pasta is amazing, the meatball sandwich is awesome, never had a bad appetizer.  The half baked cookie is out of this world.  But the deep dish, OH MY GOD!  The best pizza I have ever had, hands down!  Cuts like piece of pie.  If you're a meat lover, get the deep dish with pepperoni, sausage and meatballs.  it's what my dad and I get and it is just amazing!

All of this added on to a funky place, friendly staff and amazing atmosphere and you have a huge winner!

Highly recommend!
