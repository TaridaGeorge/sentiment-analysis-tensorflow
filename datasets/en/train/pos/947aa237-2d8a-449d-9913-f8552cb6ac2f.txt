Best BBQ since we left Oklahoma!  Very midwest BBQ- just as advirtised!  Loved that they offered for us to taste any side we wanted.  Smoked flavor was awesome, but not overwhelming!  We got the PoBoy and the Midwest Monster!  All the meats were wonderful!  I love the sauces on the side.  We tried them all and every bite had a different flavor.  Waffel fries were crisp and full of flavor.  The baked beans tasted like my homemade 2 day cooked beans.  Prices not bad for portion size.  Very friendly staff.  We went at 5 PM on a Friday and we had no problems with parking or a table.  This is our new favorite place and plan to go once a week.
