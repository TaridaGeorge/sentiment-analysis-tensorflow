For me, Grand Avenue is really where the action is on First Friday. I think the galleries there are more exciting and interesting. Case in point, Jordre Studio. Kyle is the kind of person I like. He lives by my same motto: don't dream it, be it. He's the kind of artist I like as well: he's not formally trained, he's self taught and self made and creates art that is entirely his own. You (meaning me) can feel a sense of freedom and joy and fun in his work. The paint is so thick that you just want to touch it. I understand all art is subjective, some people may not like it and that's fine. But his studio and his work are worth checking out nonetheless.
