I just love the vanilla wafer flavored yogurt, with some fruit and cookie dough. This place had a constant flow of people the entire time we were here. I love the outdoor seating as the one closest Yogurtland to where I live does not. The employees were very friendly. The store was immaculate. The toppings were fresh. and most importantly MY MOUTH WAS IN HEAVEN ... personal best side note of my visit there was when my friend looked at the Taro and screamed, "EW IS THAT SHRIMP!"
