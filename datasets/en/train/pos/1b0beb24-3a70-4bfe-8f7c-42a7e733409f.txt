A true escape into a paradise of relaxation and pampering.  This spa is one of the best I've ever visited and I'm a spa freak.  The facilities are immaculate and luxurious.  You can relax before or after your treatment in a room filled with beds!  I hope they never get rid of those rooms because they are unparalled.  Next time I go, I will spend more time in there with my companions.  This is a must on your next trip to the Phoenix area!
