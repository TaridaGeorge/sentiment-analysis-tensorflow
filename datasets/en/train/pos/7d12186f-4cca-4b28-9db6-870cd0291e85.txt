Oh man! I have a favorite fast food restaurant in Nebraska called Runza... every time I go there, I have to eat as many as possible. Needless to say, I had my first Cornish Pasty and holy moly, it's seriously a glorified Runza! So amazingly delicious! It's kind of like a calzone only not pizza styled. I had a shepherd's pie in mine and totally worth every calorie! :D
