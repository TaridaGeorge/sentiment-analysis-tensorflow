The phrase "Change is the Only Constant" is a damn lie. 

Cowtown has been here since I started skateboarding in 2000/2001 and everyone here is as helpful recommending decks and grip as day one. Not to mention doing a clean job with grip. I always choose this place over anything in the mall because these guys are chill and don't push anything. Their sale rack is killer too. For $30 I've found Vans Classics and some Emerica cords. Same stuff would cost me $80 at Industrial, not to mention the luxury of not having 15 year olds breathing down your neck trying to up sell you on everything.
