Way better than BevMo! Total Wine has always treated me right. They have a great selection of Beer, Booze, & Wine of course! Prices are good. Sure something goes on sale at Safeway with a club card every now and again and might be cheaper by a few dollars. But this is your Total One Stop Shop! I have never been disappointed here at all.
