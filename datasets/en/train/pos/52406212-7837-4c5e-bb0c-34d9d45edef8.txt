This little local family joint has been featured on Guy Fieri's "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives." The waitresses are always extremely friendly and the food is always worth the short wait. They have a good wine selection as is standard for a good pizza/Italian restaurant.

Since I am VEGAN I always order the Marinara D.O.C. with San Marzano Tomatoes, Extra Virgin Olive Oil,
Garlic and Basil (I order extra basil). At $8 it's a bargain for an entree, but definitely not enough to share unless you order an appetizer and possibly a salad. 

The shrimp appetizer looks delicious and smells great too! The shrimp is stuffed with Crab Meat, Sauteed in Olive Oil and Garlic served over toasted Italian Bread.

Carnivores will appreciate the Italian Stallion pizza which seems to be pretty popular.
