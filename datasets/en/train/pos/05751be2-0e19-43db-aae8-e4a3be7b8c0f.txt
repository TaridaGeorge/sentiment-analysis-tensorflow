I love, love, love it. I am addicted! It is the type of place you could take anyone. I have taken my friends, family, co-workers. And Everyone loves it! There Chai Espresso is yummy! Dinner is Delicious. Also, some yummy vegetarian options, good choice of drinks! Sounds wonderful to me. Actually I think I'll go for dinner tonight.


And, I like how they are a little on the slower side. Doesnt make me wonder about the freshness of the food. And i think it makes it a much more enjoyable experience!
