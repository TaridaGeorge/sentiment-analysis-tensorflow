This is the first visit for Peg and me to this fun place. We have followed Chef Curry for years and you KNOW when you read his background and affiliations that he is one of the great ones in the Valley. This ain't your Hormel in a bun!  Peg had the Duck, Duck, Dates sausage and I had the Guest Chef Sausage (Chef Justin Beckett's BBQ pork and jalapeno..some proceeds going to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society). The Chopped Wedge Salad was great, the pretzel was stupidly good with choices of mustards (honey and whole grain were just  scrumptious). and the Belgian fries were crispy...without being asked to be made that way. This is indeed a go-back.  Dr. B
