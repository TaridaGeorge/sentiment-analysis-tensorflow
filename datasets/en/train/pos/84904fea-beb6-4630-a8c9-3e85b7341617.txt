This place has potential.  The burgers were really good, escpecially the Shroom Burger which was outstanding.  The sweet potato fries was also outstanding.  I was a little skeptical since the place was empty.  And extremely plain   I hope this place can stay afloat since the food was really good. I rated the place a 5 stars for a burger joint but I hope that they can give the place a makeover.
