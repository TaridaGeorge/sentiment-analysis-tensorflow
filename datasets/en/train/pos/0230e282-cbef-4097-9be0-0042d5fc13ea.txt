Great Place!! We had the Only 8 which has only 8 ingredients and is awesome tasting. WAY WAY Cheaper than MOJO! We had two medium sized yogurts with a couple toppings and it was only $4.07 I was shocked! 

Only downside is they don't let you get your own samples which is my favorite part at Mojo, and there cups are as generic as they get, not the cute little green spoons and decorated cups like other places, but for half the price WHO CARES!!
