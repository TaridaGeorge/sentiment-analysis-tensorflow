AMAZING!! I found the review in New Times (a local paper) and had relatively low expectations going in because with a name like Two Hippies I expected just kitsch. I was soooo wrong! 
I had a hot dog, Mushroom Burger and Fat Ass Burger (which consists of garlic aioli, swiss cheese and sauteed mushrooms) all meats were charbroiled, moist, and very well seasoned. 
The fries are shoestring and are very well salted. 
I tried the sweet potato fries which I've never had before--they were excellent!! 
The seating is limited, the owner is no frills, the food is GREAT!
Highly recommended to all who want a good solid meal.
