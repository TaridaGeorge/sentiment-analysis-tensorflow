My annoying friend who lives in Ahwatukee has convinced me to try this brand new sports bar tonight in his neck of the isolated, inconveniently-far-from-downtown woods. 

It'd better be worth the drive.

EDIT: Ok, it was worth the drive. This is, in my opinion, the perfect sports bar. Huge tables. Individual plasma tv's at every table. A cheerful waitress. I had the cajun pasta and it was good. All the fundamentals are present. The crowd is a bit thin, probably because its neighbor is the perennial neighborhood favorite, Tanked Fish (same ownership). Five stars.
