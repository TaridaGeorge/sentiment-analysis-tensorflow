This store is awesome store! No you can't carry coffee or doughnuts around touching their clothes. For those of us that know how to act in public and have manners it is a very nice boutique with trendy,handmade things that you would love to have!!! I bought a Queen Baby ring for a great price and great customer service..they have a customer forever!!!!
