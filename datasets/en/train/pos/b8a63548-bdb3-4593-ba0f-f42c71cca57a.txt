5 stars for the Bar Tenders at Fridays Happy Valley. 

I've never had a bad experience at the bar top here, quick food service and excellent drinks. Chris and Marty are my go to guys.  Treat your bar tender with respect they will respond two fold. Never leave you unattended when you need something and will even stop by just to chat you up to see how things are going. Good place to start the night or grab something to eat before calling it.

Managers come and go pretty quick in this place, says somethings about the employees that stick around.
