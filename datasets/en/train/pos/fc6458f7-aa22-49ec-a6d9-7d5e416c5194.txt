I got a livingsocial coupon for JT Aesthetics- two airbrush tans, eyebrow wax and brazillian wax. She is amazing at what she does. Both times after my tans people kept telling me how great my skin tone and complexion looked....I got a custom tan before an important Ball in Florida and it made my night! I just got another one before my graduation and now for my graduation pictures for years to come I will have an awesome tan in them! I highly recommend Jessica to anyone and everyone.
