Quick, efficient and responsive! Almost like a Lamborghini! When my accountant passed away suddenly at the end of the year, I was desperate to find someone to complete my fiscal year bookkeeping so I could prepare my tax returns. AccountingProse staff were super easy to work with and gave me multiple options to transfer and receive financial information. They finished my bookkeeping faster than quoted, having all of my information documents returned to me with monthly balance sheets and income statements in about ten days! I asked my CPA to review the bookkeeping that AccountingProse had completed for me and he was very impressed with the outcome. Other bookkeeping services are a bit cheaper, but I am more than willing to foot the extra expense for AccountingProse tried and true service, reliability and integrity!
