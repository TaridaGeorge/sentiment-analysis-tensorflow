Literally as good as it gets when i s comes to out-of-the-ordinary-baby-burgers. They are so fun! 

They have everything from buffalo, ostrich, lamb, Kobe beef, turkey, veggie, and a few other. They have several of their favorites put together, such as lamb with a mango salsa and baby greens, to buffalo with a BBQ sauce, or you can build your own slider. 

They have some killer sides as well; regular fried, sweet potato fries and tater tots! "Gimme some of your tats!" They have several aolis that you can get to go with. Last I remember they had a weekend special for their sangria for $2 after 10 p.m. Probably some of the best sangria I have had in town! 

So yummy! You have to try!
