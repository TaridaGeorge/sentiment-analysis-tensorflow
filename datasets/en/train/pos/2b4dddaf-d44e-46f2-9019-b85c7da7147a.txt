We absolutely love Modern Steak!  Very cool atmosphere!  Appetizers were great and the place had an exciting vibe.  The waiter was very attentive and gave excellent customer service.  My steak was delicious along with all of the good sides.  The sweet potato side dish is amazing, not to mention the awesome truffle fries!  Desserts were fantastic; definitely going back here soon!
