I must say that this is a 5 star combination of those things that make an establishment deserve the coveted 5th star~

Excellent, Friendly Customer Service 
Fresh, High Quality Ingredients
and Superb Quality Control

The Pastrami is DELICIOUS here!

The fresh $2.99 loaves are huge!  Crusty on the outside and soft on the inside.  

Mmm, Bread.  }^ )
