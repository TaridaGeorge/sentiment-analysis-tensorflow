Terrific place, great decor, huge flat screen tv's encouraging you to eat eat. I stood in line and decided on a soup, sandwich combo. I said I would like to try the "such and such" soup. To which the attendant promptly gave me a sample in a little cup after having asked if I have peanut allergies. The sandwich seemed a bit small but the bread made it worth all the while and heavy to prove to be just enough to satisfy my wolf-like-appetite that I can have. All in all what a great joint, can't wait for the weather to cool down so I can spend a mindless afternoon on the patio.
