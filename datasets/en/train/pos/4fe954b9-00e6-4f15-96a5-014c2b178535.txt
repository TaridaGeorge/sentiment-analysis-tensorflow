I love this place.

My husband and I decided to spend a night downtown to celebrate our first year of marital bliss. We booked a king suite poolside and the room was much more than we could ever imagine. The decor is right up my alley- modern, quirky, unique. Our room was huge and comfortable. The bed was comfy and I absolutely loved how the art work could be used as a blackout curtain. The pool makes you feel like you are caught in a trendy scene in a movie. the perfect place to chill out and forget about what lies outside the courtyard. The price was right and I can guarantee we will be back and recommend this place to all of our friends.
