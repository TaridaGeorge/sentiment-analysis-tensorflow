I've been wanting a sugar-free/calorie-free Hawaiian-shaved ice for a long time now, and I've finally found a great place that has them, and they offer a wide selection of diet flavors at that. 

For those of you that aren't a fan of sugar-free products/sugar substitutes, they have an even wider selection of regular flavors. Seriously the amount and variety of flavors that they carry amazes me. They can also drizzle your shaved ice with cream if you're craving a little novelty.

I came here with some friends and got a sugar-free red raspberry & pina colada shaved ice and it was amazing. I'm so coming here now as a better and healthier alternative to ice cream when I'm craving a frozen treat. Bahama Buck's has won my heart.
