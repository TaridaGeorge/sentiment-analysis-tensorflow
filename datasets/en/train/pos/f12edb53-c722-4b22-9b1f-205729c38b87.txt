My friend had the idea to go to Rita's Kitchen on New Year's Day. I am not a big brunch buffet fan. It's usually a woeful disappointment at best and a waste of time and money. 

Rita's Kitchen was one of the best buffets I've ever experienced. Everything I tried was very fresh and high quality even at 1:45 in the afternoon. Never thought I'd say it, but the blackberries on the fruit bar were the highlight of my meal. Also had brie, manchego, salami, lox, grilled vegetables, prime rib, crab claws, shrimp cocktail and scampi, skirt steak, salad, and lots of champagne. Service was great, view of the mountains and location on the patio was fantastic. 

This was a memorable experience. I would strongly recommend Rita's to a friend and will return myself.
