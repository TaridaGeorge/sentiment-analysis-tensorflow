Joined a friend (who lives locally) and his family here for dinner last night. Can't imagine a better experience! Gorgeous patio, casual vibe, family-friendly, great service, and AMAZING food!

The antipasto salad was compact in size, but incredibly flavorful. The pizza (we had the pesto/sausage/gorgonzola on a whole wheat thin-crust) was fantastic. We had a total of four kids between us, and they each had a different pasta dish, all cooked perfectly. The warm cookie with vanilla ice cream for dessert was the perfect finish. Our little girl was asleep before we got her buckled into the car seat!

Can't wait to go back!
