Dr. Sawyer is the type of doctor that you always hope to have.  Our first son was delivered by Dr. Sawyer over ten years ago, and now we have a blessed reason to see Dr. Sawyer again!  

His entire practice is caring, professional, and responsive.  I would highly encourage expecting mothers to see Dr. Sawyer.
