Mimi's is the place to go!! The servers were very friendly an helpful. The portions were really big and you'll be sure to eat all of it! The berry crepes dissolve in your mouth and the chipotle breakfast burrito is the best way to start of your day! Perfect for families that want a nice sit down meal but not spend too much time!
