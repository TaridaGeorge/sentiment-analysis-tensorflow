Never had frozen yogurt before. But, now I know that this god-sent delicious treat comes in several flavors at Bliss Frozen Yogurt, including POMEGRANATE!! 

This nice little shop has a very modern, comfortable decor with a front patio that faces the back of The Brickyard fountain. Like it!

Bliss allows you to choose of one of several yogurt flavors (pomegranate, mango, pina colada, and regular), with a choice to put 3 topping on. There were so many great choices I did not know what to decide. There was everything from fresh fruit (blueberries, raspberries, mango, strawberries, pomegranate, kiwi, ect.) Also there were cereals, cookies, candies, and nuts. 

I decided to get the pomegranate yogurt with raspberries, strawberries, and oreo crumbles. Yumm. 

Recommend this place, BTW ladies, did I mention FAT-FREE!!!
