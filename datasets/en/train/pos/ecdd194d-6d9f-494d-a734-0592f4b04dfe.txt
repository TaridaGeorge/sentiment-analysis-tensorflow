I was at Pat's Pizza the other day, and was amazed how good the food was.  As a New Yorker who had just about any kind of pizza from Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, etc., I'll tell you, Pat's Pizza is one of the BEST!  Of course, I found out later that the owner, Joe is actually from New York, and used to own Number One Pizza in Port Chester, which was my favorite place when I was growing up.  Small world.  
If you're living in Pheonix areas, do yourself a favor, stay away from Domino's, Papa John's, or all of these franchise places, unless you don't know any better. It's just not worth it.  Take a ride to this Mom & Pop Place and give them a try.

Well, I'll be back again on my next visit in Pheonix.....
