Yummy. Although my roommate and I were in search of frozen yogurt, and even found this place under the FROZEN YOGURT category, we were super happy that we GPS'ed ourselves to Bahama Buck's! Delicious. 

Super friendly staff! The gals were very sweet and helpful in guiding us through creating our ridiculous shaved ice concoctions. 

We will definitely be going here again!!!
