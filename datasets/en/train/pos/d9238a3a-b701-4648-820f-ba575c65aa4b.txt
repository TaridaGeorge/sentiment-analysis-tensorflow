Our experience at Yupha's was bomb dot com.  The menu is a little intimidating at first since every dish has its authentic Thai name, but the numbers next to them helped.  We asked for some dishes to be spicy while others not to be and it turned out great.  The spicy dishes gave a kick wile the mild ones still gave a full flavor.  

I suggest to order by the numbers though, since there is sometimes a little lost in translation.  All together I really suggest Yupha's, especially if you are sharing amongst a large group!
