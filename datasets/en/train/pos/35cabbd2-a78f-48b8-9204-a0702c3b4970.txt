This is, so far, my most favorite ethnic grocery store here in the area! It is clean, well organized, and doesn't smell bad. Their produce is insane, and always fresh and not old. Even the seafood department is good.....I have gotten some excellent clams here for an even better price then anywhere else! They have millions of noodles, seaweed, tofu, whatever your heart desires. I get my Indian spices here as well as my lentils, coconut milk, yuca, and baby bock choi...the list can go on and on! They even have Goya products and our favorite drinks from Puerto Rico. It's fun to try new things too (just descovered almond jelly!) Prices are always great, I always walk out with like 4 bags and having paid only around 30 bucks. I love Mekong!!
