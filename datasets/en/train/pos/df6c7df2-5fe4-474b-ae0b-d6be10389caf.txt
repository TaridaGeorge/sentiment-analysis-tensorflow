One of the best restaurants I've had the luxury of dining at in decades. I couldn't in good consciousness deny my worst enemy the opportunity to eat at such a wondrous venue.  The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth finger-licking fantastic.  The signature cocktails are so fanciful they almost command you to lift your pinky as you dainfully sip your way into alcoholic bliss. 

The oversized/giant lamps at every turn make you feel as if you are walking in a land of giants or that you have found yourself in a 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' situation.  

The cherry on top would have to be the free chocolate chip cookies upon your departure. They soothe the restless 'fat kid' inside of us all and make the terrible act of leaving Cheslea's Kitchen a bit more bareable.
