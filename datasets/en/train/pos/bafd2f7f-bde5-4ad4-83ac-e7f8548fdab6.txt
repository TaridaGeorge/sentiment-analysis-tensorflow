Home of Randi Rhodes and Mike Molloy progressive talk show hosts. When Air America screwed over Randi Rhodes because new owners didn't like Rhodes' contract under the guise of retribution for a comment she made off-air about Hilary Clinton, Nova M immediately picked her up.

I'm so grateful that both can be heard in the San Francisco Bay Area on 960 AM. Even though Green960 is primarily an Air America affiliate, they immediately picked up Rhodes and Molloy from Nova M.
