Today I had a flight out of Phoenix and did not have time to have lunch at home. I was so excited to see one of my fav restaurants now open at the airport. I was excited to find the same great food and same great service but now at the airport. My food came out quickly, and one of the managers (Charles?) thanked me for coming in. The same great service I was used to at their original location. You can tell that everyone here is on their game!!!
