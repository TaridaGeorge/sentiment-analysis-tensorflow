I'm a senior at ASU. I'm about to graduate with my degree in Finance. I think in the past 4 years, I've grown so much and gained some incredibly marketable skills. I've started applying for jobs and have multiple job opportunities. I had fun while in college, but not too much. I'm glad I chose ASU. I would suggest ASU to anyone.
