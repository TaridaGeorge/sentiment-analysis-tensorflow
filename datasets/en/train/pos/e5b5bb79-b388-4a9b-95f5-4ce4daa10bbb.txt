This place is bomb! 

I often come to this Sprouts for lunch because they have $2.99 sandwiches, that will rock your socks off! OK, I mean that metaphorically not literally, calm down. Their sandwiches are always loaded up with the good stuff and they have so many topping choices! I always get turkey on multigrain with mayo, mustard, red onion, tomato, lettuce and sprouts. YUM! They have a glorious selection of trail mixes that you pay for by the pound so you can load up for the week or just for an afternoon snack, nuts anyone? 

They have really great prices, so you can't go wrong. I would do all of my grocery shopping here if there was one closer to my house. Having said that, this review is based on my lunch break visits.
