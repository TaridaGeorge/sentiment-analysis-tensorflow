My favorite restaurant in town.  Some of my favorite dishes include the pho ga (chicken soup) (#8), spicy lemongrass chicken (#51), marinated beef in grape leaves (#62), and steamed catfish in black pepper sauce (#65).  The combo spring rolls are the best I have ever had at any Vietnamese restaurant, and I have tried them at many places.  The prices are very reasonable, and the owners are very nice people.  We regularly make a fairly long drive to have dinner at Little Saigon because it has great food at a very good price.  Highly recommended.
