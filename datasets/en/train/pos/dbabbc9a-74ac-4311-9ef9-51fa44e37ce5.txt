11 Stars out of 10

Great Food, Knowledgeable waiters, unbelievably helpful staff. 

A great place for special occasions. The bill will run you at least $40 a head, more around $60/head with alcohol but is absolutely worth it. The steaks are fantastic, the sides delicious, and the whole experience incredible.

The top floor has a retractable roof and a little pool which makes for a fun environment. 

You will have no regrets here as long as you are aware it is a pricy steakhouse. But well worth it.
