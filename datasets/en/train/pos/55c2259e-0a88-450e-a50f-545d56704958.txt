Check this out!  We had lunch there last week...I wasn't sure because it seemed like a small place and wasn't always crowed...but I sure was wrong...the place became packed 15 minutes after we got there!  We had the Bree and Chicken Crepe and it was savory and tasty also the French Favorite which had Ham and Swiss and a fried egg on top...cooked perfectly!  We shared a dessert crepe with Nutella and banana and it was a home run!!!
