Wow, what a fun night.  We happened on Cibo this past week.  My husband, daughter and I drove up to a beautifully lit yard with music and people sitting around a fire pit all happy in conversation.  We had a wait, not too long, but the music and great wine helped it pass quickly.  The owners were in and out checking on everything:) We were seated inside the house next to a table of locals who made us feel as though we were at a comfortable dinner party.  We ate wonderful food in an atmosphere that made us feel relaxed and at home. When we left we were all smiles as the owner hugged me and said goodbye and our new friends at the table next to us did the same.  Fantastic dining experience!
