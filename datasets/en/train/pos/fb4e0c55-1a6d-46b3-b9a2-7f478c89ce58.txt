i've never had a problem getting assistance here, except when it's busy, usually on a sat/sun. it's not that far from the house, maybe a mile, so i if i'm in a real bind, i come on by here to pick up some stuff. 

they've offered groupons here and with those, i've bought some power tools and hardware. ace brand is cheaper price but the quality seems to be just as good!
