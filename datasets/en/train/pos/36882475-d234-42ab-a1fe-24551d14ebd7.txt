This place is great! First of all I called on a Sunday to see if they were open. Well, they are closed on Sunday but that didn't stop the owner from picking up the phone and talking to me. He was really cool. Says he works about 5 hours on Sunday just prepping for the next week!
Anyway, we went during the week. I got an italian beef w/provolone and the wife got the chicken salad. Very tasty, homemade food. A very friendly, family owned business. What's not to love?!
I really appreciate these types of businesses in the community so I will be back frequently to support them. 
Please give them a try. You will not be disappointed.
