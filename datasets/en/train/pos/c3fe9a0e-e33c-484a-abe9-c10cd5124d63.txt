Delicious!!!  Everything we had was absolutely amazing ... best New York steak I've ever had - very juicy and flavorful.  We also ordered 3 sides - sauteed broccoli, garlic mash and mac and cheese, all of which were also excellent!  Our server suggested adding a jalapeno into the mac and cheese to give it some kick, but some people in our group don't eat spicy food, so we didn't.  But I imagine that would have made it even better.  

Service was outstanding and I also love the ambiance.  We went on a Saturday night and they had live music in the bar area.  I'd definitely save this for a special occasion though as it was quite pricey.
