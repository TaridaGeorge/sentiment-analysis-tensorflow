I stopped in for a couple workouts while in town fora conference. As soon as I walked in I was greeted by one of the members and the coach was equally as friendly. They took their time explaining the programming for each day and I was able to get a solid WOD in while traveling. I would highly recommend the gym as well as the coaches to anyone either looking to join this affiliate or just passing through.
