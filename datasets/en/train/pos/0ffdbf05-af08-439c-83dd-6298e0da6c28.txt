I recently hosted a private party here for 65 people.  I would highly recommend this venue if you need a space for a large group.  I was very impressed with the service, the staff and the food.  They did an amazing job making sure we were very well taken care of the whole evening.  They offered a menu of many items that would please even the pickiest of eaters.  The meatball sliders were to die for as well as the tiramisu...yummy!   Thanks everyone at Bar North for a splendid evening!!!
