Holy mackarel! I can't believe no one has reviewed Greekfest yet!!  Greekfest is the best restaurant. It's not that easy to find and you'll probably drive past it once or twice before you spot it tucked back a little ways off of Camelback road.  The thing I love about this place is how authentic it is. You feel like you're really in Greece when you eat there, not Arizona and the food is as authentic as it gets. 

Try the Youvetsi, Cypriot Ravioli, shrimp souvlaki, tyropites, spanakopites and the feta cheese and olives- all are delicious!  It can get a little pricey, but it will be worth every bite!
