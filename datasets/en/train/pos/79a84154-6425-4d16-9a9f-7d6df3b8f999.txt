I have been shopping at Lee Lee's for over ten years.  The store stocks Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Japanese, West Indian and other foods.  You can usually find what you are looking for here.  

The fish selection is vast, fresh and reasonably priced.  

They have the finest selection of noodles and yerba mate tea!!!

Enjoy
