I saw Dr. Linder to have six moles removed from my face and neck that had been bugging me since, well, forever.  My main concern that there would be scars left in place of the moles, but I needn't have worried.  She was absolutely wonderful - she made sure that there was no pain, carefully explained what I needed to do after the removal, and best of all the results were amazing!  It's only been a few weeks and I can barely see where they used to be.  Dr. Linder specializes in very advanced skin cancer surgery but is also a master of cosmetic procedures.  I would recommend her to anyone.
