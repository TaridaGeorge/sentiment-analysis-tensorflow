We heard mixed reviews about the place so we weren't sure what to expect when we dined there. We were very pleasantly surprised. We started out with the goat cheese app (a recommendation from our awesome server Jose). My hubby is not a huge fan of goat cheese, but with the added ingredients mixed in (pesto, tomato) it was a hit! The menu has a wide variety of foods from brick oven baked pork chops to roasted salmon (which was phenomenal!). I left it up to Jose to choose the glass of wine. He made another great suggestion of the Burgans Albari√±o. 

There were multiple items on the menu that appealed to both of us so we will definitely be back to try more!
