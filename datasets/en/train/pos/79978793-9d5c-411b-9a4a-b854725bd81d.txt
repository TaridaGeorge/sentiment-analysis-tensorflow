If you are looking for an amazing photographer at a very reasonable price then look no further...I can highly recommend Lucky Shot Photography.
Meg is such a doll, and is a pleasure to work with.  I had a great time during our mini photo session for my company (it was a last minute deal and of course everything was needed with an express turnaround time, and Meg delivered).  I can't wait to book another session to see what she comes up with next.
