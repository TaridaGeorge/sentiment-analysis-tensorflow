I have never had a bad experience here, and every single thing on their menu that I have had has been great. Salmon BLT, Spinach salad, Popper burger, Reuben, wings, nachos, artichoke dip, literally everything is so good. And lest I forget the beer. The beer is so damn good. I have tried all the beers, and I love them all. I live down the street and if I ever move from the area, not being able to walk there would make me sad.
