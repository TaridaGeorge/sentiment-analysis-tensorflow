I love this place!   It's close to my office so I probably frequent it once a week for lunch.    They have a varied menu so there are plenty of options for all palates.    While a burger is usually my staple here, I was feeling froggy today and decided to change it up.   I ordered the grilled chicken wings and they were delicious.    Plus, I love the fact that the owner walks around ensuring his customers are happy.  Haven't done a happy hour here yet but it's on the list...
