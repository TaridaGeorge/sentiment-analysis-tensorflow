Tott's reminds me of my favorite Chinese eatery in Chicago: Friendship Restaurant.

Everything tastes fresh, and the boxed presentation of to-go foods is top notch.

My favorite menu item, for only $6.25, is the sampler plate. Three spring rolls, four pot stickers and four cheese puffs with dipping sauces come in a box on a bed of lettuce. Everything is perfectly cooked, with a touch of firmness on the pot stickers, cheese puffs with crunchy tips and soft bodies and spring rolls that taste like spring.

No MSG. Pure vegetable oil. Trimmed meats to reduce fat, and an open kitchen so you can watch the cooks.

Easily my favorite fast Chinese in Arizona.
