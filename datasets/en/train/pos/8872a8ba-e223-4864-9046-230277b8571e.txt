The BEST Japanese food in Arizona... I've been coming here when it was Happy Bowl Samurai back in the 80's! These guys have been around for over 20 years...Same owners, Yoshi and Yuko... plus, they do catering for the Japanese baseball teams that come each year for sping training!!! and it's hard to find authentic, Kyushu-style food out here! My favorite is the Nagasaki chanpon and fuotmaki the owner's wife makes on the weekends! Plus, they make awesome donburi dishes that cannot be beat out here.

I was born in Japan and know quality Japanese food and this place is it!
