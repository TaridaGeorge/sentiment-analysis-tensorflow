Friends have been telling me to go for months...I finally went....  amazing concept! I got my car washed..( and it was really washed!) I went inside and ordered breakfast....AMAZING !!!  What a menu...fresh, home-cooked food...I now go there just to eat, I mean really...how many times can you have your car washed....  I thought I would grab a cafe mocha at the coffee bar there....better than Starbucks!  On top of all this....the staff there is so pleasant, so nice and helpful. In a way I don't want too many people to know about this place in fear of it becoming too crowded...on the other hand I want everyone up here in the DC Ranch area to check this place out.
