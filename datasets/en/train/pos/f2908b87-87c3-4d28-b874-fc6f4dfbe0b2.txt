Just stopped in for the first time at this location. It's right around the corner from where I live and I'm in heaven. I got a wonderful Cobb Chicken salad and I couldn't ask for more. Wonderful service and great atmosphere. The Decor of the place is great and relaxing. Great place for dinner or lunch and even breakfast for coffee etc.
