I've been coming here since 2006 to get my nails done.

I love that the prices are very reasonable and the nails and pedicures come out fantastic! I love that they don't look cheap like most places... The pedicures are at least 30 minutes and give you a little foot massage as well...

I always get the pink and white with the dark pink powder and they look super nice!

I also come here to get my eyebrows waxed and they do an amazing job!! Won't go anywhere else...
