I love this place! The pizza is so good and it never disappoints. I went to school down in Tucson and they just opened one near Arizona stadium, I screamed when I saw the sign for the one in Tucson I was so excited. Now I can have it whenever I want in Phoenix and Tucson! 

The sauce is great so is the cheese and I always get pepperoni, which is awesome as well!

I also really like the croutons in the Caesar salad!
