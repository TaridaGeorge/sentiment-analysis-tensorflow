Here's the thing I loathe about the southwest - you're too spread out.  You have no need to build up so you just build out.  This means you are constantly in your car.  For 20 minutes at a time.  This is especially a problem when you're trying to go out for drinks. Enter the light rail.

I was in town to visit the s.o. for Valentimes and we used the light rail every day.  Rode it from (almost) one end to the other.  Used it during All-Star game traffic.  Used at as the high schoolers got out of class for the day.  Used it on weekend nights and during the day on a Tuesday.  Other than getting to the station just as the train we needed was leaving, I had nothing but love and affection for all of my light rail experiences. i want one in my city ASAP.
