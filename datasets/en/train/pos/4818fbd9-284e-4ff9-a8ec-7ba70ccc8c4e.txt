I've taken all my cars here (98 Civic, 98 Prelude, and 2003 Acura CL) and have never been disappointed.  My usual routine was to go to the Honda or Acura Stealership to get warranty work done and then after they give me a $5000 suggested repair bill, I take my car to AZ Auto Care and have them do the work for 1/5th the price.  It's 1/5th because they repair one thing (not 10) at half of the dealer's price, and then explain to me why I don't need any of the other stuff done at this time, and to come back in several years when I actually do need that done.
