Went to see Mikhail a couple of years ago when this place was called Salon Etro after being called Beauty Bar.

Mikhail is a true artist. His hair cuts are phenomenal. He works with how your hair naturally is, and somehow cuts so precisely you barely need to bother to style your hair. 

I live in San Diego and whenever I go see my mother in Phoenix I make sure to have my hair cut by Mikhail. 

I told him that I was a low maintenance gal and I wasn't good at blowing out or flat ironing my own hair. He said, "No problem, when the right cut is there, you barely need to do anything."

He was absolutely right. 

And I too have paid more for haircuts that were far inferior. I wish this guy would move to San Diego!
