I get all of the Fox RC emails and yesterday received one about a limited time lunch special for $7.50 for 2 of either a side chopped salad, soup of the day or side pasta (lasagna not included) and a drink. A couple of co-workers and I decided to hit it up today and I was pleasantly surprised. Not that I had assumed it was bad or anything- I'd just never been.
 
I had the turkey and feta salad because it had the most veggies-cucumbers, tomatoes, corn and avocado's and  tender turkey squares. It was really good! So was the pasta- marinara shells with a meatball. It was a perfect amount of food for a great price.
