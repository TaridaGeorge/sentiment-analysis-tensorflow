If it is Sunday, I am at The Vig.

I love Sunday at The Vig so much that I made my family come for Easter dinner.

I can get a bottle of my favorite wine (Kung Fu Girl Riesling) for $15 and sit there drinking it all day on the patio whilst listening to covers of songs that my band also covers, except they sound so much better when 1) I'm drunk and 2) The Daelins are playing them.

My only beef is that some of the douchettes that come got my squirt guns taken away. Next time I will just dump water on your head and you will shrivel up like the Wicked Witch of the West. 

Also, The Vig is singlehandledly going to fill up my new website: www.uradoosh.com
