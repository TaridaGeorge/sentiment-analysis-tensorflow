This place is freakin' awesome

OMG.  It's like their sprinkle their fries with cocaine as a seasoning.  They're sooooooooo good.  Especially dipped in cheese.

I especially love the buffalo chicken philly sandwich.  It's chicken, hot sauce, spicy blue cheese and celery all melted together in bread.  YUM.

I would like to try everything they have on their menu.  It's awesome.
