We have been here so many times we feel like family :)  My daughter loves the Simple salad with sauteed chicken and the Toasted Marshmallow milkshake.  My favorite is the Grapes and Gorgonzola salad with grilled chicken and the Pepperoni pizza with Piquante peppers (I can't get enough!)  The service is always great and love the atmosphere.
