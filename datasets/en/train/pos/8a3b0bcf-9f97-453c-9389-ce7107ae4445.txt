For a chain restaurant, this is one of, if not the best.  Grew up going to the original in NYC, so I may be biased, but I have never not had a good meal here.  Whether you sit down at one of the hibachi tables, or head to the sushi bar in front, the food is always good.  The service is friendly and attentive, and of course you get that great little cutlery show during dinner preparation at the Hibachi bar.  Average prices, you can go casual, or get a little dressed up and not feel out of place...
