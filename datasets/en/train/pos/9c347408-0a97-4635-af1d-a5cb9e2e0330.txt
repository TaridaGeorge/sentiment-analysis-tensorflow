Now this is what I am talking about!

I have been trying a lot of pizza places around this area. I just moved in to the neighborhood and have been missing my old areas pizza places. It's kinda sad the places I've found around here. 
Then, I met Pinos....Pinos, will you marry me! 
Wonderful pizza, delicious crust, great sauce! Oh my.

I cannot wait to order again! Mwah Mwah, to you, Pinos.
