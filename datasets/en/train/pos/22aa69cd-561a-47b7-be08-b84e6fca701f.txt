I did a little Yelping on Saturday morning in search of a good, cheap breakfast and this place caught my eye. I had driven past it a number of times but never stopped in. 

Big thanks to past reviewers for dropping by and taking the time to Yelp about this place! It is uber clean and the food is fresh and tastes delicious. And the prices are amazingly affordable -- the gf and I got out of there stuffed with goodness and spent right about ten bucks between us. 

Great find!
