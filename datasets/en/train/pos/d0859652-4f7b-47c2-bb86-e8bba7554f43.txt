This is a great little store. I stopped by hoping to find a juicer before I bought a brand new one. I saved myself a lot of money and the juicer was in perfect condition. Best of all, they have a 7 day return policy which I thought was amazing. I love this store and will check back often. (I also saw two copies of one of my favorite cookbooks: The Silver Palette and they also looked brand new).
