My husband and I went to check this place a while ago. We loved everything. I am addicted now to the beef soup. Awesome. The owners are very friendly, the place is clean and cozy. We live in Tempe so it takes a while to get there, but I am telling you...it is worth every mile. I loved the basil seeds drink. We will be back.
