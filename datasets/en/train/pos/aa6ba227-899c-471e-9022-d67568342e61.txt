We enjoyed our stay in our Hilton suite very much this past weekend. Very friendly front desk staff, although they were about the only ones we saw there. It was a ghost town! The room was exceptionally clean and beautifully upgraded. The king bed was luxurious to say the least. Wonderful sheets, down comforter, down pillows. The suite was a 550 square foot, one bedroom. It had everything you could want.  We didn't eat or drink in the hotel but the restaurant and bar looked nice. One odd thing was that there was an indoor pool (very nice btw) but a little disappointing because we were looking forward to getting some sun... which we did at a nearby hotel... Check out The Clarendon. Very cool. All in all, I'd stay here again with no hesitation.
