I never been to a Fish, and Chips place because where I'm from they didn't have them. Someone told me that if I want to try them, I must come here. So I did, and I loved it! it was bomb. The fish was real good, and the fries were bomb too. They also have this special sauce. It is so addictive, you have to come and try this place out. 

Other cool thing is that this place is sorta retro, and reminds you of the 1950's. They only except cash just like the ol days too! They need to change this though for us people living in the 21st century.
