As fast food chicken goes, this is probably the best.   I have tried a lot items on their menu, my favorite is the chicken nuggets.  These nuggets are not just chicken  "parts".  These nuggets are real chicken breasts cut into bite size pieces,  with 8 or more sauces to choose from.  I like the honey mustard and buffalo sauce.  But the best nonfood item is the service.  
I usually go early in the day and I find the staff to be extremely friendly and they will go out of their way to make sure your order is correct and served in a timely manner.
