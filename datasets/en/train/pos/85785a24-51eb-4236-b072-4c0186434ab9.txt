Top-notch service.

The lady working there showed me all the current sales selections and gave me a chocolate frappacino-like drink to sample as soon as I came in. 

She asked what I was looking for, and showed me new items like the Ice Cream flavored chocolates as well. I just got a small, but nice 10 piece box of truffles for a friend and was treated like VIP! She even said "Thank you for your business!" As I left... who ever remembers to say that kind of stuff anymore?
