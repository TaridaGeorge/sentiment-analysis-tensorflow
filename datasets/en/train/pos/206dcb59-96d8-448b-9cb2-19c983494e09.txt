I have to preface that every time I've visited this location it has been after midnight and I might have been pretty intoxicated. With that said, yummy yummy drunken food! I love that they are open after the bars close. I love to get a side of hot sauce to dip my sandwich in. Nice tool to soak up the alcohol.
