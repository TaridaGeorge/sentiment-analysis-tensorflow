I always feel so good when I eat here! Fresh food, and a wonderful atmosphere, I love getting the peanut butter, chocolate chip, banana sandwich thing and sitting outside and feeding my crust to the birds. DInner and a show! The iced tea is pretty good as well. 

The only problem with this place is the line is sometimes so long because of how great it is!! :P
