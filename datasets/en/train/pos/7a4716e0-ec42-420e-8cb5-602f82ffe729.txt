Needed a pace to store our things for a year while we moved in with Mom. Units was the most affordable and practical option for us. After securing a Unit and scheduling a time, the truck showed up with a very large and very clean storage unit. Once we loaded up our things the truck came back, picked up the Unit and took it to an air conditioned warehouse. Throughout the year the family owned business took care of our little Unit and sent payment reminders via email. The customer service was great and come to find out, Units is a family owned business which is awesome because I'm all for supporting local businesses.  Friendly employees, clean units, quick service.

Long story short, Units was a fantastic option for storage and moving. Highly recommended!
