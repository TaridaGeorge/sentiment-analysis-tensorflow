We went here attracted to the grand opening banner that advertised $1 hot dogs and $2 burgers.  That sounded yummy, so we decided to check it out.  Pulling up I noticed they advertised real charcoal grilling and sure enough they cook everything to order on a charcoal grill behind the counter.   We were not asked how we wanted the items cooked, but the man cooking the food had been interacting with us, so I asked him to make my two hot dogs well done and he made the perfectly.  The toppings for the hot dogs and burgers looked fresh.  We ordered the macaroni and cheese which was also delicious.  I really wasn't expecting much other than a plain ole' hot dog, but it was really, really good.  We enjoyed the TV's that were playing, they are excellent quality and the world cup was on.
