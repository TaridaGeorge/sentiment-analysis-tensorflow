Darla has been providing massages to me for several years.  She is the sole proprietor and has flexible appt hours in a small private office with relaxing music.

She has extensive medical / health credentials as she also provides many other health and beauty services.

She is familiar with many massage techniques and is happy to explain the differences between them and provide advice and suggestions.  I started seeing her for rehab of an old back injury and kept it up for relaxation and because she is so good.  She has no problem responding to requests for additional attention in problem or tight areas, i.e. a custom massage, and she remembers these problem areas over several weeks.   This is personalized service.

She charges $39 for a one hour massage which I believe is extremely competitive and certainly worth the benefit.
