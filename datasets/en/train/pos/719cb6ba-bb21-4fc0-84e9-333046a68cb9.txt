Zero complaints!  I'm 7 months pregnant and the bartender made me a super-fancy cucumber/ginger concoction so I could feel like I was part of coctail hour - seriously one of the best cocktails I've ever had, liquor or no liquor!

I HIGHLY recommend the brown bag chicken sandwich; the addition of hazelnuts and blue cheese absoultely makes it.  The mixed grain salad definitely lives up to the hype.  And Jo's Church Potatoes (we call these funeral potatoes or Mormon potatoes in Salt Lake) were to die for (haha, get it?  to DIE for?  Funeral potatoes?  never mind).  

I can't wait to go back post-baby and try some of the fabulous boozy drinks!
