I heart Grapes!  The food is amazing, the servers are attentive, and super knowledgable....perhaps a little too knowledgable.  I got a disertation on german wines so long I think I actually lost consciousness for a few minutes, from one of the servers.  To date, I haven't met anyone else with such extensive wine knowledge.  During peak hours, they do seem to attract a more mature crowd here, not that it's bad thing, probably just more of a North Scottsdale thing.  And did I mention I always get compliments on my shoes?  That alone is worth the trip.
