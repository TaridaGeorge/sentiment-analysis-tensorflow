This is a great mom and pop type restaurant. They have good food and good service. You walk in and it feels like home. I have ate there a few times now and have had good food every time. The hot burger is unique. The green onion burger was awesome. Nothing you can get is bad. 

I am trying the chicken fried steak there next!
