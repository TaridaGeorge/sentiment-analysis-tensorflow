I took my 4runner into Inman per recommendation to make sure it was safe enough to get my girlfriend and I to Zion National Park.  Jeff took a look and the prognosis was not good, however accurate.  I was straightforward about how much $ I had to work with and in turn, Jeff worked with me.  I appreciate the fact that Inman helps take the stress off of an already stressful situation.  Opposed to the many pseudo-mechanics which flood the market and prey on the uninitiated, Inman legitimately wants to help.  I would recommend Inman to anyone.
