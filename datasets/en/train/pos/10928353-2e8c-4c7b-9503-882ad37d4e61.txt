By far my favorite place to hike. The terrain is not terribly difficult which is better for me and my dog to dominate the trails! It's quiet and beautiful here. I love the sundial at the top which points out views to key places like ASU and downtown Phoenix. This park is huge so get a map if  you are exploring new trails for the first time.
