This place was absolutely fantastic! Great ambiance and fantastic food. We got the Pork Belly Pastrami, which was like an inside out Ruben, wonderful. Chopped Salad, very good, especially with the smoked salmon. Gypsy Bacon Sandwich, the bacon was unbelievable, along with the sandwich innards made it refreshing. Lastly we got the Duck. This was probably the best. It had a great "millet" (like grits), and it went so well with the perfectly cooked duck.

The only thing I would suggest, it to NOT get the Pork Belly and Bacon Sandwich together. There was just a bit too much bacon/pork flavor, it detracted a bit from the meal. It would have been helpful if the server had mentioned that.

Overall, I would highly recommend Citizen Public House. It is a bit pricy, but just getting the sandwiches would definitely help keep the price down.
