I hesitate to post this becuase I don't want this to get too busy, but that would be hypocritical of me because I found out about it on Yelp. I did the build your own sandwich deal and it was amazing.  I will definitely be back.  I didn't get a drink and upgraded to their cottage cheese with a total tab of $8.50.  Very, very good stuff...
