Love this place, I think the food is really good, I switch from Breakfast Burrito to an omlette, eggs are always cooked perfectly. Its usually busy  but I never seem to wait too long, probably because the wait staff is always running around, they are very quick and efficent. I have never made in for lunch but I have always wanted, I just dont live or work in the area so I just come over for B-fast. Good food, great portions, good prices.
