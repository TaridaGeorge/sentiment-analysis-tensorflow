Went the other night because Oreganos had a wait. Glad we did.

Jeffery was serving us, and he did an excellent job. We ordered the Upstate Hot Wings and a 14" Brooklyn Family. The wings came 'sloppy' (bathing in hot sauce) which is always a plus for me. I hate wings that come out like they were basted with a brush with hot sauce. 

The pizza was delicious. I love the fact that the sausage is sliced and looks like pepperoni. And whatever cheese they use, MUAH! Delicious!

Jeffery probably had 6 tables at once, and he was always attentive. Ran everything perfectly!
