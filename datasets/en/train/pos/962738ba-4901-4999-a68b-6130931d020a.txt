So my electric back hair shaver (aka MANGROOMER Do-It-Yourself Electric Back Hair Shaver)  was on the fritz and boy was my back getting a little to "Robin William's" like and I couldn't stand it any longer.  I had to get it fixed!

This place can repair any type of shaving device, add new blades, or they even sell you a new one if needed.

They also sell and repair small appliances, vacuum cleaners, coffee pots, and blenders.

---Really I just come here to get the blade and foil replaced on my razor. 

The location on Northern, and the one on Central are both closed now.
