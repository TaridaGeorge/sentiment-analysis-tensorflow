The short summary? I now officially love FLW and the tour I took convinced me to get a membership the next time I go back. 

Two friends and I wandered here a few months ago to get our culture on. We took the 90 minute guided tour I believe. Everything was so gorgeous and our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable. He was able to not just preach at us with lines he'd rehearsed over and over again, but tell a story and show how this knowledge applies to life today. 

We were able to take pictures during this tour which doesn't happen in a lot of museums these days and I took everything i could until my camera died. 

I left feeling completely inspired and awaiting my next visit.
