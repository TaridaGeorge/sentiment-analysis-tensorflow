I am attending the Laura Gisbourne Conference here this weekend.  Raining cats and dogs ( thank God, the desert needs the drink! ) and I pull up seeing a majestic overhang with a handsome young valet guy awaiting my arrival!  Courtesy valet and all!

I walk into the resort and it is very pretty.  Unique!  I love the ambience.  EVERYONE was sweet, the energy was amazing.  I was directed to the conference room and it was huge, well put together and everything fell into place.

The restrooms are sparkly clean and the outside quarters are plush.

I am looking forward to returning tomorrow and Sunday for the rest of this conference.
