Happy hour at this Applebee's is like snow bird central.  There's always a line out the door, a long wait, and the dozens of grandparents who occupy it seem to be there e.v.e.r.y.d.a.y... However! We LOVE it! The specials are great (best on our side of town actually) and we get a seat at the bar almost every time regardless how crowded it is.  The 2 regular bartenders Chance and (blonde dude, can't remember his name but he's cool too) are always very nice,fast, and make awesome drinks. We come here almost every week, and it never disappoints! 5 stars! :)
