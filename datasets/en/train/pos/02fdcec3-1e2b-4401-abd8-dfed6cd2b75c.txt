The other reviewers have summed up this place well.  It's a dive, unpretentious, welcoming to all, inexpensive and hosted by the beautiful, delightful and 83 year old Lil.

Sit down at the bar, be nice and talk to her.  She has a ton of great stories.  Ask about the girl who was kicked out and returned naked.

Looking for a place to hang?  Come see Lil at the Royale Lounge.
