I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and we finally did last weekend. We will definitely be back soon!

I got eggs cooked over-medium, potatoes, bacon and toast. All was delish and their coffee was great too. My fiance got pancakes along with some other things and they tasted good too!

A great place to go when you want a diner atmosphere. The place is pretty big too, so if there's a wait, you probably won't have to wait long.

Oh and the service was spot on!
