The Rock - I love you. The bartenders and cocktail servers are so sweet and friendly and the drink prices are AMAZING ($3.50 long island iced teas? Yes please!). They treated us so wonderfully for my sister's bachelorette party - we went and saw the Barbra Seville show with Celia Putty, Diva, and more! We had the best time. I love the Rock and definitely plan on coming back - especially for the amazing drag shows!
