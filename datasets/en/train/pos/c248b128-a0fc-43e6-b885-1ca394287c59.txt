I was surprised by the depth and distinctness of the olive oil.  I was expecting oiliness with hints of flavor, but instead was pleasantly surprised by bold flavors carried on an already flavorful oil.  This place far outshines other oil stores which add flavor essence to their oil.  They infuse the flavors here, making them stronger and more authentic.

Overall, great oil and balsamic vinegar.  Try their food, such as the sandwiches.  And definitely try as many oil samples as you can.  The oil is not too expensive, ~$20 per bottle.  Well worth it if you like to use it on bread or to add some great flavor to a salad.
