Just went there and was one of the first customers in the door. They hoped to open at 1pm on New Years Eve and opened before noon. Very cool atmosphere, a roll open door and very cool place to hang. You can't go wrong with D&D coffee!!! AWESOME and glad to have them close, we have been putting up with Starbuck's and Dutch Bros, but now we got DUNKIN!!!!
