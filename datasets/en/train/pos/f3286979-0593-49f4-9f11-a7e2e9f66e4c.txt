We went tonight for the annual Military Appreciation Dinner.  The line was around the building, but they were moving people in and out pretty fast.  The servers and staff along with the JROTC that were volunteers for the evening were very organized and were able to seat people rather quickly.  The food was good, they were maintaining the buffet regularly, and everything was very good.

Thank you Golden Corral for supporting the military
