This is one of the best museums in the Phoenix area!  I love bringing my kids here, and they enjoy going.

The admission price is very reasonable, and they have free days once a month.  Whether you pay full price or get in for free, it's definitely worth your time.

The Museum is spread out enough that even if there are a lot of people there that day, you don't feel crowded and can still see all of the exhibits and take your time.

It has a plethora of AZ history, from dinos to geology to Native people to Spanish settlers to movies.

Seriously, go visit this gem tucked in the middle of Mesa.
