I called the Windmill about 2 weeks before my wedding and asked them for one of their conference rooms on a Wednesday night.  Not only did she say yes, but she knocked $200 off the price, set me up with an AMAZING chair/table decorating company, and gave me access to the room the day before my wedding.

Anything I asked for was given - and then some.  We plan to go back every year just to celebrate this place and their wonderful service.

We were given the "Presidential Suite" and for a "post-wedding" night - it was spectacular.  

Gals, if you need a reception site, this place is AWESOME.
