I should probably have reviewed this alonggggg time ago.. because honestly, this place is my Cheers. Except...not.. really haha. I usually come here every day after work, unless I am really busy with school or something. The regulars that come here are awesome, same with the servers and bartenders..basically everything about this place is amazing...oh but of course, I can't forget about their rasberry chipotle wings and their hamburgers.. SOOOO GOOD.. just thinking about it is making me drool..attractive ;)

Oh by the way, they have amazing choices for whiskey and a day just for whiskey drinks! (Thursdayyy!) Another reason why I love this place :)
