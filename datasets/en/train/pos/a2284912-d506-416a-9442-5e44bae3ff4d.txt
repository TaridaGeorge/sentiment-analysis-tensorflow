Personally I don't care how small and awkward this place is -- the fact of the matter is that they serve up the best calamari Greek salad I've ever had and their pita bread can't be beat: soft, freshly baked -- how can you leave without gobbling down every single piece?

My friend took me here in the middle of a Phoenix dust storm. Cold and wet and dirty outside, the interior of Crazy Jim's felt warm, cozy, and womblike. Fellow diners were a mixture of office workers, policemen, and working people.

Funky and rustic are words that come to mind. Come for the food. That's what this place is all about.
