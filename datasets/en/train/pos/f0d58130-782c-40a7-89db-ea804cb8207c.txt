Best seafood restaurant! I got the stuffed lobster and my boyfriend got the steak and crab. Everything was done perfectly and we both really loved what we got. Especially mine. They stuffed it with scallops, crab, and of course stuffing. I love that its underground. The decor is kinda outdated but that sorta adds to its charm. Its pretty small so if its any sort of holiday or event I would definitely recommend reservations since the place is pretty small.  As a side note our server said they had a 9 lb lobster available to order!
