After all the rain this year (and the thought of last years 3 acres worth of weeds on my 1 acre lot)  I decided to save myself the hassle of pulling a million weeds and gave these guys a call.  Much to my surprise they were reasonably priced so I set an appointment.  They were super punctual, very professional, and had more knowledge about weeds than I thought possible.  Even though they wouldn't let me romp their golf-cart around I'm still giving them 5 stars.  I would be in serious weed-hell right now if it weren't for them.  Now I can sit back and laugh at my neighbors and their giant weeds...
