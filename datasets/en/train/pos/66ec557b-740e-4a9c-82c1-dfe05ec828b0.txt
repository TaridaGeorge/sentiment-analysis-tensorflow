From the clubhouse, to the driving range, to the staff, to the course, I have not played many courses any better than Troon North.  I absolutely loved it.  I played the Pinnacle course, and every hole was amazing.  I would say that a very high handicapper would not enjoy this course as almost every hole you must drive over some portion of desert just to get to the fairway.  Many holes had unbelievable views of the valley and the course was in amazing condition, especially for the extremely hot August that the area had just experienced.  In my mind, this is a must play if you are in the area.
