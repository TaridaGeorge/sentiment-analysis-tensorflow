I had heard so much about this place and decided to try it with my husband for dinner. The food was GREAT! The Orange Roughy and the Veal was what we ordered for Entree...excellent! The Creme Brulee was to dye for! It may have looked like a mall restaurant from the outside but once you step in, it is cosy and nice. Plan on hosting a corporate dinner there! Must try in Scottsdale if you like Italian.
