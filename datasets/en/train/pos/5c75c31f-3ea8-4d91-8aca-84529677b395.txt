I agree with Gabi...100%.  He spent all day here with me one day, completely reinstalling a toilet, so I was shocked at his more-than-fair fee.  His response?  He wanted to ensure that I would continue to be his customer.  He said that many of his customers are divorced or single women who haven't the knowledge or time to compete the odd jobs around the house.

As far as I am concerned, Duane walks on water!
