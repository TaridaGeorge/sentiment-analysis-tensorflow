this place kicks mongolian ass. amazing drink specials ALL day, including 1 dollar mimosas. i felt so bad for the poor bartender though, because he only gets the little bottles of champagne, and had to open like 200 of them in 1 day. 

also, the food is good. they have tons of ingredients that most mongolian bbq's don't have, like eggs, and curry, and steak, and scallops and potatoes.

they don't have a huge noodle selection though, unfortunately. still, this place is a billion times better than yc. 

booze + mongolian = awesome.

i still think it's kind of hilarious that they named a restaurant after one of the most evil people in the history of humanity. where's adolf's pub?

and you can watch jeopardy while you're eating.
