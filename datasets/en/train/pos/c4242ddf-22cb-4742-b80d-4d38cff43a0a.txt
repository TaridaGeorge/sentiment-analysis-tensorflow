LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Great bar style food! My husband loves their beer selection and I love that they have Strongbow on tap and Crispin in bottles! At other restaurants I have to settle for a beer that I'm not crazy about....my Strongbow and Crispin I AM CRAZY ABOUT! Thank you for carrying my ciders! Food is good, bar food....lets get this straight....this isn't a luxury restaurant folks.....If you go frequently, get diner reward card. Honestly...awesome. I love supporting local businesses and I'm so glad they support their local breweries. I get intense cravings for this place frequently. Will certainly be back, again and again!
