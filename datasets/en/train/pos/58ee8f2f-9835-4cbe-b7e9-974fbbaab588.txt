My boyfriend and I tried out Teakwoods for the first time on Friday night with the Groupon I purchased a couple months ago.  I was so excited to find out that they have Four Peaks Peach beer and it was on special!  Double bonus!  I had the chicken fajitas which were really good and so much food.  There was no way I was going to finish it all.  My boyfriend had the buffalo chicken sandwich which he loved.  We will definitely be coming back to Teakwoods.  The service was awesome too!
