So nice to have a new type of environment to hang out in Scottsdale.

Decor - Its so clean and sophisticated sharp decor right when you walk in tn the door , you immediately want a drink when you see the beautiful bar in the center of the floor. OK OK I'm a little obsessed I know:) with good reason!!

Food- I have tried several things on the menu and was impressed with every hing ! LAMB BURGER!!! a must!!!

Service was friendly and professional. This place is here to stay !
