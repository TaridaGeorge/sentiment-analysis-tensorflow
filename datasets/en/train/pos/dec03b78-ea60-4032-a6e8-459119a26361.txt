What all those guys said. Seriously. It is way too delicious. There is a ton of selection on the menu and I implore you to try stuff. I had low expectations only because I am very particular about sushi. It is actually unreal how good it all was. I HIGHLY suggest tamago. I am a huge fan of tamago and order it everywhere I go for sushi, but I think other places must use frozen premade patties, but not Yasu. I don't remember what the fish was but we got sashimi with some sauce and a jalape√±o on it, and holy crap was that delicious. And the lamb chops we had were unreal also. Just go order everything!! Do it! OMG.
