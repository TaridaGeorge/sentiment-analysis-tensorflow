I ended up leaving my house last Saturday evening and noticed I had a flat tire.  Ended up putting my spare on and brought the tire by Sam's to see if they could fill it up since it showed no damage. They went above and beyond to inspect the tire for leaks then not only filled it but balanced it as well.  Very helpful service and couldn't have asked for more.  Turned my night around to say the least.  Thank you Kenny and Cameron.  Been going to this Sam's for a while now and will continue to do so.
