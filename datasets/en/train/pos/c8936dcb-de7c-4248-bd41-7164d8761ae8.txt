I'm going to have to reconsider ordering pizza from anywhere else after eating here. I must have made it at the perfect time, because there was not another soul in the place besides the staff and the friend I brought with me. 

We had the Italian Stallion and I've never eaten a more delicious, scrumcious(if this isn't a word, it should be), amazing pizza in my years on this earth. 

If it wasn't so far from home I would probably eat there every day until I started growing pizza from my ears.

I don't know what else to say besides, GRAZIE!! (According to google, this is Italian for Thank You)
