Been here 3 times, twice for drinks and once for food. Each time I've been 100% satisfied. The service is quick and friendly, the decor and seating are perfect, and the food & drinks are delicious. 

We ordered the pizza and it's great - it's not that weird flatbread stuff with sparse toppings, but it's also not a greasy mess. The perfect medium! We also were treated to the pear salad which was very good.

Oh, and they certainly don't cheat you on drinks. The prices are fair and the liquor is plentiful - if you don't see the beer you want behind the bar, the bar next door (Amsterdam) most likely has it and they'll get it for you.

I recommend it for pre-gaming a night a out, girl's nights, 3rd dates, and after party get-togethers on the way home from Mill.
