I don't eat any other burgers except In-N-Out and 5 Guys...and honestly, I don't even eat fast food except for those two places (sometimes I cheat by getting tots from Sonic...but rarely).

When it comes down to it, how can you subject your self to the frozen patties of other places and the low quality, yellow french fries that are oh-so-common.

I just won't stand for it...it is not worth it to me.  Go to In-N-Out burger or just don't eat fastfood.  It's pretty simple.

My standard order: # 3, Animal Style...pink lemonade with Sprite/7-Up.
