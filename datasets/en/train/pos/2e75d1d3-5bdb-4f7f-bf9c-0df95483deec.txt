This may have been the best Thai food we have had. The restaraunt was clean, well appointed, and the service was excellent. We tried four small plates, and an appetizer. All but one were exceptional, and one was average.  The food was spicy as we had ordred it, and the portions were generous.  We will be going back for a second try this week- something we rarely do.
