For heart attack, drop dead chicken and the best waffles I've eaten in years, Lo-Lo's rocks. LoLo's catered a breakfast for a non-profit I am involved with and they did an awesome job. However, our mission is good health and preventing work disability, so unfortunately, the others in the group have outlawed Lo-Lo's for future events. It appears we have to actually practice what we preach. Bummer.
