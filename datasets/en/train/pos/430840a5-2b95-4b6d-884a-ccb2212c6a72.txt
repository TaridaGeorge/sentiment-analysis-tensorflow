I don't come here for the food in particular but the brews are great. It's your typical divey hipster bar inside but the beer selection quite sophisticated. The refrigerated has a huge eclectic mix of other microbreweries in bottles. The bar has a full array of their own brews from ales to stouts. If you so happen to enjoy their beer so much. You can take it home in a growler after the initial 20 bucks. Growlers are half gallons of beer heaven. The next half gallon of you purchase is only 12 bucks. I recommend the coconut joe.
