Holy delicious.

My husband and I met a few friends for a relaxing afternoon on a Saturday.  I have never been here, but one of us recommended the atmosphere.  I had the Vermont, which consists of ham, cheese spread, apples, spinach, and pine nuts.  I switched the bread from whole grain to sourdough.  I inhaled it!

The outdoor patio was beautiful and the beer/wine choices were flowing.  We had a lovely, sun-filled afternoon with a solo guitarist tinkering in the background.  The staff was friendly but efficient.

The wait was a bit long for sandwiches at a deli (about 20 minutes) but the wait was super worth it.  There is a shop to buy some sauces, coffees, teas, and other "schtuff".

So good.  Cannot wait to meet up again.
