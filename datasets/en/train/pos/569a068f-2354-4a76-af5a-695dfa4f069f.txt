I never realized that Horse & Hound was even there, right across the street from my bank, er, credit union, lending institution or whatever. I thought it was part of the ClubHouse, until my neighbor told me she was a server there and I should stop in and drink with her friends :D 
So I did, duh. 
Nothing really struck me as too great, actually. Cheap drinks, sure. Pool tables, shuffleboard and OTB. It's bright, probably one of the brightest bars that I've ever went to. Oh, and I don't mean bright because of all the ASU students either. I haven't eaten there yet, but I'm sure it will happen. Lately, it's been the first bar on my crawl, then The Derby, then....
