I love Barry's Capezio! My daughter (5 years old) recently started taking dance classes. Barrys was right down the street from my home, so I stopped in for tights and a leotard. The staff was unbelievably friendly. They treat you like a long time customer. They were very helpful in finding the right ballet shoes for my daughter. The merchandise is of great quality, and they have a huge selection. 

I have gone to other dance-wear shops and none can compare. 

Barry's Capezio has been in business for over 20 years and I can see why. I will be going back tomorrow to get my daughter one of their beautiful tutus for her class recital.
