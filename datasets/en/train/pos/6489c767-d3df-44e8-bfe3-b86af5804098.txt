In the evening the view from South Mountain's lookout is an amazing, surreal scene -- Much better than that big ol' hole up north... an endless, dreamy sea of lights that completely surrounds you...

I have been taking visitors here for almost 20-years, and it never fails to awe and inspire them. I am surprised at how many people (who live here) have not yet had the pleasure.

It's well worth the drive, and it will give you yet another excuse to dine downtown.

Drive south on Central Ave and bam you're there... The park is open till 10pm.
