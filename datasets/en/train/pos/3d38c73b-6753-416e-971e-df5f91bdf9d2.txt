You can't go wrong with this grocery store. The price is right and they get so much business so the food is fresh all the time.
I like that the aisles are organized by country; Korean, Japanese, Middle Eastern.
The boss man, Ming, is very friendly and helpful all the time.

My family's favorite, for sure!
