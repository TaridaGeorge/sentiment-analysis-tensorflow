I go here quite often, and I am impressed at the selection, prices and friendly service that I have experienced here at this little resale shop.  I have sold/traded items here and I appreciate the fact that they are organized and the store doesn't look like a trash heap (see my Other Mother's review).  The trade and cash values they give are very fair, and to my surprise, they took a lot of my gently used items.  They only sell items in very good condition, but you won't pay a lot for them!  Just an FYI, they do not sell cribs or large furniture here. Mostly clothes, shoes, books, dvds, games, jewelry, accessories and toys.
