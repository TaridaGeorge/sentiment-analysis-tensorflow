This place is amazing! Though there are few tables, meaning you may wait up to an hour for a table, the food is well worth the wait. The carne asada is incredible, so simple and yet so flavorful, and the tamales are absolutely delicious.This is definitely a restaurant worth your time but make sure to go there with plenty of time to spare.
