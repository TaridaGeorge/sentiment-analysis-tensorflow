I love this place almost more than words can say.  Inexpensive, delicious, and the atmosphere is outstanding.  It is British food done in a unique manner, and it doesn't make me feel like a disgusting cow, the way that Rula Bula does for instance.  The drinks are delicious, the servers are friendly and interesting, they have a free juke box with some pretty good music on it... what else can I say?  I visited the place three times in two weeks after I first heard about it, it is that freaking awesome.
