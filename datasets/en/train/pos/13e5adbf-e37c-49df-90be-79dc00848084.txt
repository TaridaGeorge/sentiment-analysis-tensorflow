Delicious mochas! Great baristas who are all happy to serve. I ordered a small double and was given a medium triple because of a (happy) mistake, and was glad to know that it was appropriately strong. The atmosphere is fantastic, a record player with headphones, a chess table, some great decor and a plethora of books to keep one entertained. Great place to sit and do homework or chat with a friend.
