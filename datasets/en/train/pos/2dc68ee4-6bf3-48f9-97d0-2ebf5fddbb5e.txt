Came in a few times and had the breakfast burrito. YUM!  Also got a chai latte... also very yummy.

Their wifi is free and very fast.  Employees are very friendly and personable.  They all seem like they love there job which makes the atmosphere more enjoyable.

I'm new in town and have found my new trusty coffee shop :)
