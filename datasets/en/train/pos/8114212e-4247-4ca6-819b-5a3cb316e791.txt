so great!  came here with the bf for a nice night out and we both left with full tummies and an unforgetable experience.  we live super close by and we have said we were going to go and finally he surprised me with a night out at Quiessence.  we did the tasting menu, which I HIGHLY suggest.  great way to try everything on the menu and all of it was over the top amazing.  this is such a romantic place, definitely enjoy your dining experience because everything is done to personalize the experience for each guest.  the wine list is great and I cannot wait to go back!!
