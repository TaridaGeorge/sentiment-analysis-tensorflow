Show me a better hot dog in AZ!  I'm from Chicago and this is a good dog!  I can't get enough of the spicy relish. You have to try it!  The service is usually horrible, but that is something I've come to love about hot dog joints coming from Chicago.  Ted's is great and it's really inexpensive!  Oh and they finally accept debit/credit cards!
