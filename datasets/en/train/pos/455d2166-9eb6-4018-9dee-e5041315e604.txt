I've been saying for a few years now that this place has the best sushi in the valley.  (yes, better than the expensive places in Scottsdale)  I think other people are starting to notice because when I first started going here the place used to be mostly empty, this last weekend I had to wait to get a table.  It was totaly worth the short wait, the food it always awsome and I'm glad to see this place getting the attention it deserves.
