We recently moved to town and didn't know what mechanic we should go to. It's always so tough because so many mechanics are dishonest or just trying to get your money. This shop was fantastic! We are on a budget and they were very accommodating. Not only did they have great workmanship and meet their estimated time and cost, but also, their customer service skills are outstanding. We will be going back!
