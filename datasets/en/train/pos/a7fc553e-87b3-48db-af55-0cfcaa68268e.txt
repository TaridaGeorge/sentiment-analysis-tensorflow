This place was awesome, probably one of my new favorities. When you arrive to the resturant they have complimentary valet parking, which was nice. The hostess sat us immediatly and gave us our menus. When I was ordering I was choosing between the Lemon Chicken and the Forbidden Rice Bowl. I went with the rice bowl and I am so happy I did, it was amazing! The Roasted Salmon looked great as well. I think I will HAVE to go back to this place!
