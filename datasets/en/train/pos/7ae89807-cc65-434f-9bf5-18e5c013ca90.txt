I love this place! I've been here quite a few times but have only had their italilan cold cut sandwich and the philly cheese steak sandwich. Both are delish!!

If you're impatient, I recommend calling ahead and then picking up your order. Although it's worth the wait if you're in the mood to dine-in.

They have a cute little grocery area to browse while your waiting too. If you're ever in South Scottsdale, I definitely recommend this place.
