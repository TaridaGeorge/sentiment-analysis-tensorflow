I have to say, I try to go to indie-restaurants as much as possible, but I love Einstein's six-cheese bagels and the dutch apple bagels.  So, stopping there to fill my craving I had a most pleasant experience. This was a Friday morning, busy but not like the usual weekend insanity.  The staff was so friendly, clearly remembering some regulars.  The manager was hustling around, checking on customers, taking orders to tables and bringing out fresh coffee.  The service was so quick and friendly!  Good job guys!
