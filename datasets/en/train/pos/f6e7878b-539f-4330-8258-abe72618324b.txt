The Compass Grill is a great  way to start off the evening in downtown Phoenix, especially if you've never been to Phoenix (or a revolving restaurant). The panoramic, 360 degree view-in-an-hour is a unique  experience.  As a restaurant, I  felt  the menu was a bit pricey (I call it view tax) and limited so I didnt eat  here (I've been  twice). But as a bar, they had a reasonably priced  wine selection and of course the best  view in town. Great service too.  I give this spinny bar 5 stars.
