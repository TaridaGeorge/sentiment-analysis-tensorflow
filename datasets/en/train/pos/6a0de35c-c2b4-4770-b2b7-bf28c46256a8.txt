Excellent brew pub with awesome beer AND food!  Ask your server or bartender what that cask conditioned ale is and give it a try if it's in line with your tastes.  I have yet to find anything I dislike on the menu and only one beer I steer clear of (the Hefeweizen), but that's more personal taste, than anything else.
