This restaurant has become a stable for my family as we visit several times a month.  We know many of the staff members and even worked really hard to get Creme Brulee back on the menu (sorta).  I'm a big fan of the Chicken Bryan and the Lental Soup.  And if you get the chance to have the Creme Brulee, it is the best I've ever had, I highly recommend it.
