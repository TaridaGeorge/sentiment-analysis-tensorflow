Good ambience and excellent service and delicious food! We had four types of bruschetta on one order and two different pizzas to share. The drink selection includes Framboise Lambic (raspberry) and I had a Peroni. We were seated right away. And just to let y'all know... the food is very similar in style (size, ingredients) to that bullshit hype of a joint Pizzeria Bianco, but with a lot less salt. The menu also includes sandwiches and salads.
