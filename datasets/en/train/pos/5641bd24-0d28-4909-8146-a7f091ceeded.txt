I tried this place after having some serious pinkberry cravings. I didn't think any places here in town could come close but this place sure does get close. 

The original tart and blueberry tart are perfect. So much that just thinking about it is making me want to go get some right now. The strawberries are always sliced into nice sizes and are sweet and not sour. They have mochi balls which are my absolute favorite and the self serve is awesome. 

I'll pick this place over any other place here in AZ any day.
