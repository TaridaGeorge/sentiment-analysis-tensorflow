Had such an outstanding meal here last night.  Our server Candy was simply outstanding.  We were taking our time and she was great in giving us space while ensuring we had what we needed.  Plus she offered great suggestions.

I highly recommend the short rib ravioli, but T. Cook's is one of those places where everything is excellent.

Happy dining!
