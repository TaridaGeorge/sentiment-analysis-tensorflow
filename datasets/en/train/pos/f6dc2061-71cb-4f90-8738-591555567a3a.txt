I love the Paper Heart!
I've performed there as a comic, promoted all different sorts of bands there, and seen performance artists there.
The Paper Heart also has great artwork, which is always changing.
The bathrooms are super-cool!  There's a lever on the counter to turn the water off and on.
I don't drink, but there seems to be a GREAT selection of beers and wines!
