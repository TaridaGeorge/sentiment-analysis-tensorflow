This place is great! I purchased a really beautiful handkerchief dress on Ebay, but I got it and it was 5 sizes too large! I brought it by this place solely as a result of it being close to my house! The eastern European (just a guess) who helped me was VERY nice, extremely helpful and overall competent! When I returned to pick up the dress it fit perfectly...I know she had to reconstruct the dress, but it looked like it was made for me! I am not sure what something like that would cost, but she charged me $28 and I was A-OK with it as the results were perfect! I will be brining more stuff into be tailored!
