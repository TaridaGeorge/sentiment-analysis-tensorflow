If you're looking for an awesome breakfast experience in the Phoenix area, Crackers is a solid choice.

Crackers has an extensive menu of both breakfast and lunch items. I can only speak for the breakfast portion of the menu, as that's all I've ever had. 

The breakfast options at Crackers are plentiful and unique. They have awesome skillets, omelets, pancakes, and waffles. My favorite items are the Southwest Carnitas skillet, the Meat Lovers omelet, and the Belgian Waffle Sandwich.

Awesome menu, great tasting food, and plentiful portions, gives Crackers five stars.
