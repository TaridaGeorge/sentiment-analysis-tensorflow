I have been a patient at Sobel family medicine for the past 8 years.  I have always appreciated the excellent care I receive there and the number of services that are available to me.  Recently, I was involved in a car accident and suffered a neck injury.  I saw Larry Sobel, MD who referred me to Jerry Sobel, a pain management and rehabilitation doctor.  He saw me within the week and thoroughly evaluated my condition.  He explained my options to me and ensured I understood my condition.  I appreciated that he did not just offer pain medication and was more concerned about my rehabilitation.  Dr. Jerry Sobel is a caring and compassionate doctor who takes the time to know you and works with you on your recovery process.  I highly recommend Dr Jerry to anyone with spinal problems, chronic pain or chronic fatigue.
