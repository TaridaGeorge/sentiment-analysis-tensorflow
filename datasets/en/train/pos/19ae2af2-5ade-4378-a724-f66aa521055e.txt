Best coffee I have tasted, by far, in the short 20 years of my life.  Here's why (+ positive, -negative, -/+ neutral):

+ They're a hole-in-the-wall joint.  That means little to no traffic, cozy, fast.

+ Simple menu.  It really bugs me when coffee shops have a hundred-and-one different drinks up on the board.  Seattle Espresso's menu does not mess with your mind.

-/+ The baristas are average.  Most of the time I come in and they're friendly, but once I had a guy treat me like I wasn't even there.  His friend came in and they started talking... while he was making my drink and when I paid.

+++ I LOVE THEIR DRINKS.  Their espresso is smooth and blends well.  Their cup sizes are decent.  They have very unique flavors, my favorite being the white mocha.  The coffee experience here is sublime, to say the least.
