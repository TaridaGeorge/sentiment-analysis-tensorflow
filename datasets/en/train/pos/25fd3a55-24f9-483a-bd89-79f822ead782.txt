Love this place! The meatball sub is out of this world! Homemade meatballs swimming in homemade marinara sauce on a crusty baguette. Don't forget the pizza, the crust alone is so tasty, buttery and herbacious, then add all the tasty creative toppings and you've got a pizza masterpiece! I love getting fresh cannoli's for desert or a couple of Baci which mean 'kiss' and are little dark chocolate hazelnut truffles.  No matter what you choose, I'm betting it is all good!
