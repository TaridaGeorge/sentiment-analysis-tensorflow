I love Pei Wei!! They offer up some truly tummy Asian dishes! And the awesome thing about it is that no matter which location you go to, the food is consistently the same!
My favorite dish is the Kung Pao with tofu, brown rice and extra sauce on the side. Seriously, even folks who don't care for tofu will love this!
Thanks Pei Wei for being a mile from my work and easy to get to!!
