We have been wanting to get here but tonight we made it! First of all, the atmosphere while a bit loud, is made up for by the friendly and helpful the server, Craig . SO was in HEAVEN with the rum and scotch bonnet martini. Well there was some other stuff in it, but she always wants something spicy in her drink lately and she got it. My Mojito was great too. Jerk chicken was so moist and, while spicy, was not overly salty. Sweet potato pudd'n with ice cream was heavenly. Overall, I will definitely be back for more.
