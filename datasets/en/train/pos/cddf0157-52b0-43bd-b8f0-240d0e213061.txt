I absolutely love this place.  We dont have any back in cali so I only come by on roadtrips to Arizona.  To me, QT is like an AMPM/arco station... but 10x better.  Its big, clean, organized... and has energy drink slurpees! I think its called Rooster Booster.  Theres always a good variety of food and condiments available unlike at ampm where theres no hot food available at all at times.
