Chef Justin Berry is a genius. His wraps are the best. I absolutely love The Cowgirl and the Black Bean Sunflower. My husband's fav is the Nutty Rawvocado and he also enjoys the Blueberry Fields Forever. The half-size wrap is plenty big. I wouldn't get the whole unless sharing. The soup of the day is always very creative and interesting.
