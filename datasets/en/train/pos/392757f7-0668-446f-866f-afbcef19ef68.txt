I went back here last night and it was awesome! Got the drunken noodles again, but I got it at 3 stars and it was plenty spicy....my nose was running, but it was perfect. The dish had a lot of flavor (other than just spicy) and it still tasted fresh and delicious. I brought a couple friends and they both enjoyed the food very much. This is definite my new go to Thai place.
