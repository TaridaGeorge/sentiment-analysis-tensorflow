We have been to many, many dental offices over the years.,...this one is great. The front office staff have been very helpful with our insurance company's odd paperwork requests (ugh!)  Dr. McWilliams is super, super nice, and has done a fabulous job on my fillings/crowns/cleanings. The entire office is VERY kind to my young daughters when I have to bring them in during one of my own appointments! 
I was referred to this office by my friend & her husband, and now my own husband is going here too. 
Another thing we noticed: unlike many dentists....Dr Mc is very kind to her own staff!
