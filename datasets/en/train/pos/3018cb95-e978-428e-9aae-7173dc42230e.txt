Not your typical flashy Scottsdale hang out....  Sounds good to me!  I like the old school interior it is kinda comforting in some sort of historic way.  The food however is to write home about!  For being in the middle of the desert their seafood in phenominal!  King crab and the mussles are my favorite!!! Happy dining!
