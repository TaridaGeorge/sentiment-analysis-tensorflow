What a gorgeous hotel!  The entrance alone was pretty impressive with it's large circular driveway and guys dressed in white uniforms ready to help you with your bags.  In fact, the staff throughout the hotel are all very friendly and helpful.  

Our room was elegant and we had a fantastic view of downtown from the 25th floor.  The beds were dressed with crisp white linens and they're oh so comfy.  There's a flat-screen tv on the wall, plenty of lighting wherever you need it, and the bathroom has a very spa-like feel.  Their towels are big and plush.  The Bliss bath amenities are mandarin orange and mint scented, which were refreshing and yummy-smelling.

I stayed for two nights and made my first visit to Phoenix a very comfortable one.  You really get a lot for the modest nightly rate.
