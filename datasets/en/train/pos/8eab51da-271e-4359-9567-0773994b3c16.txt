This place is super cool. The only bad thing about it, is that it got TOO popular! I am very happy for the success of this place. At least they made the place bigger. There was a period of a year where i ate at this place saturday and sunday for breakfast! i was addicted. One thing i like to do if its really busy is to call your order in, so you dont have to wait in line. The only down fall is sometimes your toast gets soggy!
Parking is a pain in the butt for this place.
This is place is a big hit for people of all ages and its a great place to chat.
My fave is croque monsieur. YUM
