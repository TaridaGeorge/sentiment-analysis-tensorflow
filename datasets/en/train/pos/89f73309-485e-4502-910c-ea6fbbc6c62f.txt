Williams-Sonoma, how I love thee....  Rather than counting the ways, I can say it all in one sentence - it makes me want to cook.  If you knew me, you'd know how much that was saying....

From the pots and pans to the cook ware to the appliances to the cook books to the linens to the pre-made mixes/sauces to the freaking cookie sheets!  I love it all!  All of it!  I'm a microwave kind of girl, and walking out of here I find myself pining over the perfect cast iron pot.  I'm telling you, it does things to you.  I've bought SO much from here for Christmas gifts!  

And - they usually have great sales!  Selling dreams of the perfect kitchen/meal/home - every day....
