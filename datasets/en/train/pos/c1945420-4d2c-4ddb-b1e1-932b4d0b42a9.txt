This place has the most delicious scones I have ever tasted. And coffee but I'm no authority on that. But wow the scones. And once I got a breakfast burrito. Really tasty. 

Last summer I was an intern in Phoenix. It was a strange experience but when I needed a pick me up (scone), Cartel was worth the walk.
