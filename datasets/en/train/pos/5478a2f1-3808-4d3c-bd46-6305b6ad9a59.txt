I had my long haired cat groomed by AZ Pet Stylist, and it was wonderful!  She was on time, professional, and very caring. My cat is older and I was afraid he would freak out.  She let me come in the mobile unit and help hold him and pet him while she gave him a Lion cut.  

Tuff seemed to like it, and I would definitely use them again!
