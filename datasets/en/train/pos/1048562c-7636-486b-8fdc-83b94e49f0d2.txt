When I was trying to impress my (at the time) girlfriend, I planned a sweet date and it started with a tour of Teliesin West and had such a blast. Needless to say she became my wife :) So it worked and would recommend  it anyone. It did help that my wife was studying architecture :) This place is so beautiful and has such pretty views. I recommend going at the sunset tour, I believe it was, at the time, more expensive but worth it.
