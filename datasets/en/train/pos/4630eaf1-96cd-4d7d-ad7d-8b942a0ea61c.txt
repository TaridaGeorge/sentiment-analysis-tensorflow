Amazing BBQ

I first ate at Dave's when I lived in Nebraska.  When I found they had opened a restaurant in AZ I was there in a heartbeat.  Go with a large group, grab one of the "feasts" served on a trashcan lid (don't worry, I'm sure it has been wiped down!), and have a little bit of everything.  Brisket, Ribs, Chicken, Cornbread, Beans, you name it.
