Is this the best restaurant in Olde Town?  Maybe.

Great service, beautiful ambience.  Great place for a date.  Rotiserrie chicken with the rice is my favorite dish. It is just so damm good.  Not over expensive either.  Great deserts as well.

Guys who read this take a date their.  You wont be sorry.
