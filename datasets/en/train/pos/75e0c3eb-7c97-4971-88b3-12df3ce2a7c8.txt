This is the best pizza in town.  I have never had anything here that didn't make me want to stuff it all in mouth at once and risk suffocation.   It is true to the Chicago style thin crust... sweet sauce, gooey cheese and cut into squares.  

Do yourself a favor the next time you want pizza....head here and grab a "Get Meaty" or "Margherita".
