Went here for lunch the other day with a friend.  We shared the Baiynchaiv Crepes and the Noumpang Pate and also had the Spring Rolls.  I had the iced Jasmine tea and my friend had the French Espresso Coffee, which she was kind enough to let me try.  Everything was really fantastic!  I highly recommend this place!
