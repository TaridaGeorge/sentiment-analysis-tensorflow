Why, Oh why, did I have to get inside this store again.  I couldn't help it.  Every time I go inside the store I remember my friend Dean's words, "you need a 12 step program, let me help you and take 12 steps out the door".  Well, I guess I didn't succeed.  I ended up with two more pairs of shoes.  They are so beautiful and comfortable.  As a rule, I cannot buy another pair until I get rid of one, but lately this rule has not been working.  I cannot part with my shoes that fast. I got a pair of suede orange sandals, they are buttery soft.  I also got a tan wedge for the summer, hey they were on sale.  Now, if they only had my size in the color block blue shoe, it was so dreamy.
