My dad and I love going out to breakfast on the weekends and we've been to many restaurants over time. Out personal favorite is The Good Egg. This is the only place we will have breakfast now. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is delicious. It tastes like a nice home cooked meal. I love the Nurse's Bialy Breakfast and their french toast. The Good Egg always puts me in a great mood =).
