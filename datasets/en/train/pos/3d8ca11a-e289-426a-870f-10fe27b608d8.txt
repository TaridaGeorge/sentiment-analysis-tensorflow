I ate once at their old location and it was marvelous...and today we went to the new location.   The wait to get seating (table of 6) was about 25 minutes, but once inside, it was perfect.    It only took 15 minutes for all of us to be served and the food was amazing.   We all had to roll ourselves out the door.   Coffee was refilled very often.  The 6 of us fit cozily into a high-back booth, but it was okay.   The servers worked their butts off.    Fantastic biscuits (beware, they're BIG) and gravy, and my waffle with blueberry syrup was heavenly.   We went on a Saturday morning 11:00 ish.
