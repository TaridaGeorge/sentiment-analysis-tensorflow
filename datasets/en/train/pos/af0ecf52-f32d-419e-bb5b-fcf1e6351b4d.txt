Decided to go with a credit union over my main stream bank that kept charging me fees for stupid reasons.  Went into this location and had a great experience.  They had my accounts setup and a real usable check card exteremely fast.  My old bank took days and 3 weeks to get my check cards in the mail.  So far so good when you go in ask for Bebe she is extremely nice and helpful.
