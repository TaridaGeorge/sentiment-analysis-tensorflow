Have been here twice now, and both times my tastebuds were tickled with delight. They serve breakfast until 4pm, which is a gift from above, as I love me some breky in the afternoon.  I ordered the roasted turkey omelette, sans turkey and instead with asparagus added, with onions and peppers and oooey, gooey, delicious brie cheese! Also comes with a side of rosemary potatoes, a choice of side AND toast.  Not too shabby for 10 bucks.  The server was sweet and accommodating and the coffee mug was huge...just what the doctor ordered.  Thanks kids, I'll be heading back for my Daily Dose very soon!
