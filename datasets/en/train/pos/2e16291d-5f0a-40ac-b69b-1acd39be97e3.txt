I am really impressed with this restaurant/bar.  I got the delux burger which was very flavorful, although the bread was a little too dense.  The sweet potato fries, served in a mini shopping cart, are awesome - a must have.  They have a great selection of beer, including my favorite framboise lambic.  The beer flights might be an interesting choice for my next visit.  The decor is nice with soothing blue lighting.  Be aware of the close sitting quarters.  I wasn't sure about the communal counter in the middle of the restaurant, but it turned out to be pretty good.  I was still able to have a decent conversation with my friend without feeling like someone else is listening to us or like I am intruding on another conversation.  Overall, a great place that I will visit again.  Especially since it is open late.
