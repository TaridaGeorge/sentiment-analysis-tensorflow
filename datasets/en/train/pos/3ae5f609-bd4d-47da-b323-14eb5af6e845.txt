My family just had the Easter buffet and it was OUTSTANDING! Fresh scrambled eggs, french toast, sausages, fresh fruit, etc.  All just plane good. Wait staff was friendly and efficient as always. One waiter we haven't seen in almost a year and he remembered us. We sat outside so the kids, teenagers, could watch the planes go by.
