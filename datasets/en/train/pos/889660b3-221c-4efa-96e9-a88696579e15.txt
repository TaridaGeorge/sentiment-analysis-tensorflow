MOST UNDERRATED RESTAURANT IN ARIZONA! Eat there every week with coupon!  They always have a coupon and the best, hottest food! The orange chicken is so crispy inside and nicely tart sauce. Egg rolls that are never greasy, very crispy and so fresh. It is a casual and comfortable atmosphere where you never dress up. Eat before 4pm so cheap or even after is really cheap. Family of 4 with beer and wine for about $10 per person!
