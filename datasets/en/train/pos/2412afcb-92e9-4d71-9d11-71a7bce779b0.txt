I'm a complete dive bar junkie. Whether I'm in a big city, or small town I always seek out the local spots. I was in Tempe with work and we happened to drive into town right at last call so we searched for the closest bar which just happened to be Monkey Pants. After we got over laughing at the name and the paint job on their truck...we went in and were greeted by the waitress right away. It wasn't too busy especially for a Friday night but the place is huge! The bartender was very attentive and adorable. 

 I really wish I could've made another stop at this bar before I went back home..I saw a bunch of posters for all these theme nights and great deals. Reading previous reviews it sounds like they have parties going on like this all the time. Great bar!
