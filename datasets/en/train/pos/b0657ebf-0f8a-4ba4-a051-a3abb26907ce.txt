I live in tempe so it is a bit of a drive. Every excuse I get I go. I LOVE this place! Great atmosphere, best burgers (and im not a huge fan of burgers), the fries rock and they come in a cute mini cart, they have a Must try inhouse dipping sauce that i always buy a small container of when i leave, and their milkshakes rock(i dont drink alchol). They are even open very late :)  
Best burger joint in the valley of the sun by far!
