I have been to this restaurant exactly twice and both times I have had some of the most memorable dining (and wining) that I've ever had in the 30 years I've lived in Phoenix.  

It started off with me asking the bartender to surprise me with a Campari drink in a martini glass and he made me this incredible "Negroni" which is now my new favorite drink.

My friend and I tried and shared a variety of dishes from the foie to a delicious simple salad to this incredible asian fish dish all the way to the most gorgeous chocolate souffle.

Service is stellar, I'm telling you this food is INSPIRED..truly the best.  I love saving it for a special occasion.

Thank you Cafe Bink!  :D
