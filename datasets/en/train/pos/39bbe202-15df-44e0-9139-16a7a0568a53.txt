All that needs to be said about this place is they carry Big Red in a bottle in the fridge.  Heaven.

They have many fun flavors of bottled soda to choose from.  There is outside seating if you can't wait to make it back home and enjoy that frosty Big Red.

My brother tried the A&W root beer float soda.  The packaging is enticing, but don't fall for it, the product is tastes like you dumped half & half into your A&W.  Just get a regular root beer and stop by the grocery store and pick up some ice cream.  I promise you'll be better off.

I bought a few other soda flavors when I was there.  Apparently people like that they carry the Mexican Coke and Dr. Pepper, but I could care less.  I mean, they have Big Red in a bottle!
