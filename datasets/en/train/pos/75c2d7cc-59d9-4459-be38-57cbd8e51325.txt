My office picked up some food from the market at The Herb Box Southbridge for lunch yesterday. It was AMAZING!

Butternut squash with pomegranate, roasted veggie, black eyed pea salad, steak salad, roasted brussel sprouts and plantain chips....So delicious, words cannot even describe!

Perfect smorgasbord! 

Plus, the entire office has been on a health-kick what with New Year's weight-loss resolutions and all...all the tastiness and none of the guilt.

I'd highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a quality meal that won't break the bank or your diet! Can't wait to try the eatery side...
