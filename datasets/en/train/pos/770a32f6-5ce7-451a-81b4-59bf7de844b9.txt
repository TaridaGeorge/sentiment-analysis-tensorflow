Charlene, our server at Chompies was better than any life coach I've paid for.  

Hubby, who always struggles with what to order, asked Charlene what the differences were between his 2 choices,  

"Hon, can you get scrambled eggs and bacon anywhere?"  "Yes?" " Can you get latkes as a sandwich with eggs, cheese and bacon anywhere?" "No?"  "There's your answer!"

So while he's eating the ultimate breaksfast sandwich, and I'm eating potato pancakes with the fluffiest scrambled eggs ever, he's planning lunch tomorrow.  

Think they'll slice up some pastrami for me at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow before we leave?  

They did.
