This is our new favorite steak house. Better then Flamings and Maestros with prices that are awesome. I was concerned over the comment on noise level as I was taking my parents who are 81 and 87 years old. I called and made reservations telling them of my concern. The gave us a booth against the wall and my Dad did great. 

Don't waste your money anywhere else if you want steak.
