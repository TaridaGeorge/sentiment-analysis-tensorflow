If you haven't tried CHILL before.... PLEASE DO Southern/McClintock!!!! Favorite thing on the menu is the Chill Beri Fo Yo, topped with raspberries and strawberry sauce!!! All I can say is YUM!!!!!!! My boyfriend loves the Red Velvet Flavor Gelato as well, def in my top 5 of flavors. Due mix the peanut butter gelato with Nutella gelato. Tastes like an amazing peanut butter cup!!!! I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!!
