OMG,  I haven't reviewed Maizie's yet?

This place is delish.  It reminds me of the bistro I used to work at in college.  They have a great menu, with sandwiches, pizza, appetizers...pasta maybe?  Their wine selection is fantastic.

Their happy hour is nice...

I am just glad to have a solid restaurant in the neighborhood (light rail, anyone?) that has normal restaurant hours (i.e. they are open past 9p).  

I'd love to try brunch here sometime.

This is technically 2nd hand information, but my husband swears they have the best Italian sandwich he has ever had.  :)
