Having recently moved out to LA, this is the burger and the place I miss the most.

The burgers, whether it be the standard beef or the turkey, are exceptional. The fries are a delight. The alcohol menu is beyond compare when you factor in the quality of everything else. And who can deny the shopping carts. Kudos for serving food late night. You are a fixture on my occasional trips back home.
