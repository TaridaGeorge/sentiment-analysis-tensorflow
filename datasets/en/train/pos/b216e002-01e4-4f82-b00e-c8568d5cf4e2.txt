Market Bistro is so cute, and the food is great. Today I had a pesto chicken sandwich and my friend had a grilled tri tip sandwich. Yum! The salads look incredible and are huge, so that's what I want to try next time. They also have cute little bottles of wine. The have various ice teas for anyone like me that loves tea. I tried the passion berry and the green tea since it's free refills. Love it!
