I love going here and taking pictures.


The last time I was there, I heard this beautiful flute music off in the distance.

I followed it all thru the gardens, back and forth, thru all the winding paths, until I came upon this lil old dude sitting on a blanket with all these hand carved Native American Flutes laying about.

Stayed a while, chilled and soaked up the ambience.

A beautiful day for sure.
