This place was AWESOME! If I lived here, I'd eat here once a week. Everything is delicious. They have things like croque-monsieur sammys, soups, baked goods, pizzas, & brunch style foods.

In addition to really good food, I remember they made a really tasty key lime pie dessert and a very good lemonade.

Parking here was really difficult but definitely worth it.

p.s. I hear it is now open in Pasadena!!!!!
