The Desert Ridge location is CLOSED. The Bamboo Club in Scottsdale (Shea & 101) is still open and was always better than the other locations. The Scottsdale Bamboo is now privately owned by a local family. The menu is similar but offers cheff's specialties as well. The food is consistently awesome. Still upscale casual with the emphasis on casual. Great new energy and run by people who care.
