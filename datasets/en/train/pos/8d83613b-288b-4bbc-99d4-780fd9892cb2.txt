Bought a White White Chocolate cake from here yesterday, really delicious, really super moist and their signature frosting is the best cream cheese tasting frosting I've ever tasted.  The store closes at 6 p.m. and we were stuck in traffic so we called and told them we'd be a little late and they were super understanding, they had GREAT customer service and were super nice when we got there at 6:07 to pick up the cake.  My only gripe is that the cake didn't taste like white chocolate at all, just like white cake, but the most delicious white cake I've ever had! I've had a mini bundt chocolate chocolate chip from here before also and it was very good. Their prices are actually super reasonable too!
