In my opinion this is one of the best restaurants in the area of Baseline and Mill.  I actually drive from SE Chandler to eat here!  The staff is wonderful (not something you find much of anymore), the food is even better and the price is excellent in this struggling economy.  Don't miss this gem of a restaurant!
