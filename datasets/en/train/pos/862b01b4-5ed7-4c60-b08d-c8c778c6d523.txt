My Wife and I have been to Dickey's 4 times now, and that in less that two weeks,.  Each time it's something new.  Had a nice conversation with Andrew and learned about Dickey's and I tried the Chicken and enjoyed it.  Very tender as well as moist.  With a little of the Dickey's Original BBQ Sauce made it even better.
