I grew up in the Chicagoland area. This is by far the closet thing to Chicago style pizza I've had anywhere outside of there. Whether you have the thin crust or the stuffed, you're eating some of the best pizza in the valley. I've dined at several of their locations, and can't say enough about how good it is. 

And save room for desert. The Pizookie is fantastic. I highly recommend the peanut butter chocolate chip. 

There is one negative. 
If you decide to have something other than the pizza, be warned. The sandwich and pasta portions are huge, and make for lousy leftovers. They never seem to reheat well.
