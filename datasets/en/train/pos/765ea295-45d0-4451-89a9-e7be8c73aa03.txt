I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  From the moment you sit down, the service is warm and friendly which is always a great start.  

They also bring warm crispy on the outside, nice and doughy on the inside bread with salted butter. Yummo!!

The food is top notch quality and always fresh and great.  The prices are perfect too!

I just don't understand why there isn't one of these on every corner like their sub-par competitors?
