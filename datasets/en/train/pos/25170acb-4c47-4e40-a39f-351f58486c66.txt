I went here with friends a couple of weeks ago for drinks after dinner. I LOVED the atmosphere. The drinks were great... Blaise, the bartender created the drink menu, but also loves to mix special unique drinks for you that are not on the menu. I hear that breakfast there is fantastic, so can't wait back to come back in the morning.
