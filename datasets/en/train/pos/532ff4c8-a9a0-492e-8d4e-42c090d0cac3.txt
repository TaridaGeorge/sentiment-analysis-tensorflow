This place is great. No frills, just damn fine work. Incredibly reasonable prices and speedy turnaround. I recently brought in two dresses (one needed a waistband and the other a hem) -- I figured I would start with something small as I'd never used them before. They did an awesome job on both and I'll be back for sure. Lucky for me -- they're right around the corner.
