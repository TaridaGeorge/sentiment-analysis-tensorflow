Texas BBQ.  Pretty darn good if you ask me.  Chris T hit the nail on the head as far as I am concerned.

I've eaten here three or four times and left satisfied every time.  Even the BBQ chicken salad is pretty good - if you are crazy enough to order a salad at a BBQ joint!

Iced tea is very good.

Pretty fast-foodie decor , which tempts me to give it a four, but I'm a sucker for decent portions.
