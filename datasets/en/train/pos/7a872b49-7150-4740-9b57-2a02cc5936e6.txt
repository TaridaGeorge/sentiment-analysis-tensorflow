This is my favorite store in the entire valley. So many new things to look at everytime you enter the store, the staff is so friendly, trade in prices are fair and I love their cafe. Grab a book and a coffee or a sandwich and relax on a couch. I go there for my expanding video game collection as well and every time I go in there is so much new inventory I feel like its a whole new store to dig through. Check this place out. The classic nick nacks alone is enough reason to pop in and look around. There is absolutely something for everyone.
