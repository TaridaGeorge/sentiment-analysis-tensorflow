I couldn't be happier with what she's created for my assistant. Absolutely GORGEOUS work! I'm from CA, my assistant is in AZ, but everything worked out better than I could have imagined.
Rachel is by far my favorite florist so far. She's so easy going, personable and is definitely not pushy like some others out there. I will be a returning customer for sure.
