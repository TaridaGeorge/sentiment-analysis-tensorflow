Awesome park, and a staple of many Valley kid's childhoods, McCormick Stillman is a must visit! Rides are fun and inexpensive, and museums are interesting. Lots of food too! If you're having a birthday party you could rent out the birthday car or grab a ramada. 

Went with a friend for old time's sake this afternoon, and had a really nice time. Even in the Arizona heat there's plenty of shade. I really liked the Pullman car museum the best though. Pretty cool knowing the presidential personal touring car resides in Scottsdale, of all places. :)

I liked how almost everything was inexpensive though. And overall we had a nice day. 

P.S. Do NOT eat the frozen yogurt...unless you're looking for a laxative...
