If you're looking for an authentic yoga practice, this is your sanga - your yoga family. Every class Dave or Cheryl teach is mixed with Sanskrit, chant and yoga philosophy. It's never just about the poses. They will strike your interest in a complete yoga practice - practicing all eight limbs of yoga. I have learned so much from them - after only 2 years of yoga I am now learning the Sanskrit language, teaching yoga, chanting in Sanskrit and my practice is amazing. All thanks to them for opening the doors to what an authentic yoga practice should be.
