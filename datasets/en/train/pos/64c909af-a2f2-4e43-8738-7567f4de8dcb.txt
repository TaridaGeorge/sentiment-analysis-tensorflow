I go here 3 or 4 times a week to get my all natural healthy foods.  The staff always remembers me and treats me so well.  The biggest issue at grocery stores is when there is a line of people and the staff doesnt open another lane, drives me nuts!!!  At this store, you will never see more than 3 people in line.

Their prices are great and the quality of produce is always on point.  Go Bashas
