Urias Landscaping is awesome.  Jessie and Oswaldo are super easy to deal with, reliable and are very talented landscapers.  They do our regular maintenance but in addition, they recently replaced our entire leaking irrigation system, removed several plants/bushes and trimmed large trees.  They listened to what we wanted, we gave them the list of plant/bush suggestions made by our HOA, and helped us decide what to plant in both our front yard and back yard.  They even went so far as to meet us at the nursery so we could walk through together.  We weren't able to do that so they brought over pictures of different plant/bush/flower options and emailed some too!   I recommend them highly.  Jessie and Oswaldo really know their stuff!
