MORE HOOKAH!!!!
Just so ya'll know they have great food and a cool atmosphere too. But the real reason I go is because of the awesome hookahs. The hookah service boys (can I call them that?) keep my hookah going so I can spend an entire night smoking hookah, laughing with friends and enjoying the music. 
Grab a buddy or two and hit up Urban Cafe......but DON'T park in front of the liqour store....(the owner will be a jerk to ya' FYI)..
Peace
