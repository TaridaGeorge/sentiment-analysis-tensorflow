best place i've ever stayed at!!  the decor is upgraded and the beds are cozy.  the shower is extra  huge and so is the jet tub.  the whole bathroom is huge.  1 bdrm suite also came with it's own balcony.  living room is huge and spacious.  the price was amazing too, but we did get a great deal at hotwire.  i will be staying here again.
