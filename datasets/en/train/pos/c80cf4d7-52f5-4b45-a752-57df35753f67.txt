Looking for a casual place for all your hummus, greek salad, gyro and souvlaki needs? Chicago Gyro is it. The atmosphere is casual--think plastic trays and forks, napkins at your table, counter service and lots of styrofoam takeout. But what ya get what ya pay for at this joint. The pita is fresh and plentiful, the hummus creamy with just a dollop of oil and some kalamata olives. The gyro salad is the perfect balance between naughty nice and the staff is friendly.
