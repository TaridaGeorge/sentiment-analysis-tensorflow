Simply put, Cartel Coffee Lab is the vanguard of coffee shops.  This is a scaled down, bare-bones shop that has a limited drink menu, for which I am thankful.  If you are looking for a frappuccino, or some kind of blended fruit concoction, this is not the place for you; the Cartel owners are true to the coffee bean, and they are not interested in manipulating or mutilating it.

Things I love about the Cartel: The chill atmosphere, the super-friendly staff, the premium coffee (obviously), and the independent feel of the place.  

Side note: This is not a coffee shop built around the whims of commuters who are in a rush to get to work.  They take great care at Cartel to make a great cup of coffee, which means that it might take a few minutes to get your order.
