Love this place!  My husband and I have been looking for a place where the food is good and has a great atmosphere, and we definitely found it here!  We were headed for Tomaso's, but one of the Tommy V's regulars saw us checking out the menu and insisted that we check it out instead...We are so glad we did!  Everyone there (the "regulars" and staff) are SO nice.  Since they are part of Tomaso's, you are able to order off of their menu as well...plus they will work with you if there's something you'd like that isn't on the menu (so I've been told).  We've only been there twice, but everything we've had has been wonderful!  They have a great happy hour too.  I'm looking forward to our next dinner there!  Great food and great company...nothing beats it!
