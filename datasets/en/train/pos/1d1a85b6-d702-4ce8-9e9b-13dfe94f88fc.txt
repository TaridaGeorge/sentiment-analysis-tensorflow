In terms of Starbucks, this one is definitely my favorite! The service is always friendly and prompt, the drinks and food are just as good as I expect every time I come in, and the store has nice, comfy chairs in addition to tables--perfect for hanging out with a friend, reading a book or typing a paper. I love coming in for a green iced tea (no Classic) and being cheerfully greeted by name! It's the little things in life--like a perfectly made grande iced White Mocha (no whip) handed over with a "Have a nice day!" and a smile--that can totally make your day :]
