I received a call from my regular groomer today telling me that my 9 1/2 year old Shih tzu-poo had a really bad ear infection.  As I've recently moved to the Ahwatukee area, I had no local vet so I checked Yelp for the nearest to my house.  

I called Family Vetcare and they were able to see us right away.  They were very kind and professional both on the phone and in person.

The exam was through and I was explained everything in detail.

I am glad that I found such a good vet so close to home.
