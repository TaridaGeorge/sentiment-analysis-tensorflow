This place just opened in the same plaza as Pita Jungle. They have a good selection of gelato, including dairy-free fruit. They also have frozen yogurt. There are two kinds right now, plain vanilla and lactose-free soy. The yogurt is the richest frozen yogurt I have ever eaten in my life... it's pretty tasy! You can mix various dry toppings for the yogurt, including little chunks of mochi! 

I'd like to see more yogurt flavors in the future, if possible, cause the vanilla was scrumptious but I am definitely more of a chocolate kind of girl. I had chocolate raspberry gelato mixed with cookies & cream, it was very good.

-edit-
I recently went back and had chocolate gelato mixed with the vanilla frozen yogurt. OMG, heavenly freaking awesomeness, the alternative taste between creamy sweet chocolate and creamy tart yogurt was soooo good.
