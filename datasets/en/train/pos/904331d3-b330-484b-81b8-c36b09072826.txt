I've gotta start by saying that this place is not fancy. It's a simple down home restraunt. The food is your everyday breakfast food done right. Just like mom would cook. The prices are very fair and the portions are enough to fill anyone. The pancakes are just what a pancake should be. Fluffy and tasty. If you come here make sure to get biscuts and gravy. The rolls and biscuts are huge. Come hungrey and don't expect white table cloths and French waiters. They close at three so get down there soon! Chase out
