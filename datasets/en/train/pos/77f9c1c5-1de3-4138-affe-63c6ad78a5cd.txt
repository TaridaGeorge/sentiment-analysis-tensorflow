My family loves this place. 

Probably not your sort of "classic bbq" place. Some will dislike it for being a chain.

We love it because the beef ribs are incredible for dogs. We would give the rib bones to our dogs, who would chow down on the ribs!

I personally thought the food was great. It is the only restaurant I know that serves apple butter, which was delicious.
