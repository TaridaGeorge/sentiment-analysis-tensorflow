Excellent happy hour and yummy dinner. The caperinhas were great, and at $3.5 for happy hour, totally worth it. Wine is also $3 per glass during happy hour as well. The lobster and seafood crepes were super tasty, though a little small for the price. I added a side salade which brought this up to a tasty fully meal. Recommended.
