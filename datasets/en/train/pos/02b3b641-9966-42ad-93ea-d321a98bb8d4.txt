I recently attended a private party at this restaurant.  Not only was the food extraordinary, the chef is outstanding.  He lovingly prepared dish after dish after dish of culinary delights!!  The ambiance is small, intimate and comfortable.  The price (well, it was free but still) as I understand it, was very reasonalbe.  This place is a gem!!!!
