1 word: Delicious! Seriously...healthy and cute. I'll be honest...I've only tried the breakfast buzz (most delicious protein shake ever). I promise you that if i'm ever in south Scottsdale for lunch or dinner d'lish will be my first preference. I've looked over the menu and everything looks wonderful. I live in east Mesa and work in north Scottsdale...I go out of my way to get a buzz and will continue to do so. Highly recommended!
