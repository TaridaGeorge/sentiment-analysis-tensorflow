Four Peaks has been the setting for a good amount of cheery drunken debauchery.

My brother's patronize this spot so frequently you could swear the Prohibition was coming again.

Awesome beer is served at a bar setup that is conducive to good flow and meeting new people.

I'm a big fan of the Peach Ale- it's the girliest of the beers. 8th Street Ale is also good. As is the Sunbru.

For lunch, try one of the beer breads. The bread itself is awesome... similar to a flatbread or pita. Great texture, great flavor. Trust me, it'll fill you up for $9.

Meet somebody at Four Peaks and grab a beer. You'll be so glad that you did.
