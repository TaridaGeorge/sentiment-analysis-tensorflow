What a great spot.  Just moved downtown a month ago and have been exploring new places to eat.  Just finished a brunch at Coronado cafe...  I had the southwestern omelette, and my fianc√© had the crab cakes.  First of all the $3 bloody Mary's and mimosas are a steal, but that became an after note to the food!  The crab cakes are out of this world, huge chunks of meat and before I could ask for a second bite it was gone.  Luckily I had my own omelette that did not disappoint.  Cheesy, hatch chilies and really tasty potatoes on the side.  The service was good, and the owner was available and really matches the curbside appeal.  Great ambiance in a cool historic house.  Definitely worth trying.
