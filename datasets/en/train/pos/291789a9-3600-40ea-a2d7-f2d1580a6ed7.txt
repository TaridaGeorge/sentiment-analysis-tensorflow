I loved this place for breakfast and just had take out dinner tonight.  We had the shrimp and soba noodles and a steak with potatoes.  The steak was perfectly medium and the pasta dish was very good.  Can't beat the quality for the price.  We of course had dessert too, a lavender pastry and a chocolate peanut butter mousse.  The mousse tasted like a reeses candy in a cup.  I will definitely be back for more.
