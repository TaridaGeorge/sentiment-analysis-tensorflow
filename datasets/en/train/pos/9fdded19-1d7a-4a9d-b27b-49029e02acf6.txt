Just moved out from LA, and looking for a fun shop with a tradtional influence.....One of the cleanest Shops I've been to in a while, great comfortable setting, I ended up getting a sweet fortune telling Liger from Joe and it came out great... Tony's work precedes him and speaks for itself as easily one of the top portrait artists in the country.....Looking forward tog etting lots more work here.
