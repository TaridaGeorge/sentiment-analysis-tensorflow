I've enjoyed brunch there most times then I care to admit.  The mimosa and bloody mary specials are awesome! The service is always good.  The owner usually makes a visit to the table and asks how everything is, which is always appreciated.  Although, I have not had a bad meal at Maizie's I strongly suggest you order the Rojo Chili de la casa.  It is not a joke.  Its everything that is good in life especially on a Sunday morning.  With that aside I must also say that I almost licked the plate when my friend and I ordered the wingless buffalo dip appetizer...yum!
