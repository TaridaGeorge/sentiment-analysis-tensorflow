Tott's is one of my favorite lunchtime destinations and offers a medley of Asian flavors. The dishes are large so they're perfect to split if you come with a group and I recommend that you do just that. 

The service is fast. The food is delicious and the owner is extremely sweet. We've been coming there for years so on occasion, he'll bring us an extra dish to sample like the amazing Walnut Shrimp.

Some of my favorites are the Kung Pao and Orange Chicken. I also recently had the Bourbon Chicken, which is out of sight. If you haven't been here, check it out. Support this mom-and-pop establishment opposed to a chain like Pei Wei.
