I went to D'lish for the first time just an hour ago, and here I am reviewing it already!

To begin with, I rolled up to the drive thru with my dog in my lap, making a fuss, and the woman at the window could not have been any nicer! She gave Danny (my Pom/Schipperke mix) a treat, which he happily gobbled up.

Next, I ordered the Breakfast Buzz. Took 2 minutes for the drink, and the gentleman who gave me my drink was very friendly!

Finally, my drink- OMG it is SO GOOD! I'm hooked. Chocolate, peanut butter and bananas, what is not to like? I can't wait to try their food! 

Friendly service and good food make this place a must!
