Being new to Arizona, I learned quickly that Four Peaks was the go-to brew in Phoenix. I only had a couple of cask-aged Hop Knots and a Southwestern chicken egg roll appetizer-thing, but the combination of flavors and skill with which it was prepared were enough to tell me to come back soon and often.

The crowd can be daunting on the weekends, and the street parking can incur a little bit of a walk, but it's just a testament to in such high regard Four Peaks is held in the area.
