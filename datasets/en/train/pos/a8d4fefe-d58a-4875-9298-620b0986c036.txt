Going out to breakfast is something I love to do because I love eggs and corn beef hash. I basically order the same thing at every breakfast restaurant I go to (it makes it really easy to form an opinion). I'm pretty sure my small cholesterol issue can be blamed completely on my obsession on over medium eggs! If you like corn beef hash order it here, it will not disappoint! 

The service is fast, friendly enough, the food is cheap, and tastes great if you are looking for a traditional diner breakfast. 

Many people before me mentioned again love it
