When it comes to rock gyms, there is no place like home. For me, an avid plastic climber, Phoenix Rock Gym is like a second home. Friendly atmosphere, free of work hassles, and hundreds of routes to climb make it my place to be. 

Beginners and elite are all welcome, and all chalenged on the walls. I love being here, and I am certain that you will too. See you on the walls.
