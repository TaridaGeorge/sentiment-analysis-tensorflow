I don't know why, but the Mesa location is better than the Tempe one, and not just in that it actually seats more than fifteen people. The food is just better there (although Tempe is still tasty). The subs are killer, the selection of chips is excellent, and their goddamn Rice Krispie treats made with Fruity Pebbles are like crack cocaine (fuck the weed!). You just can't go there when you're in a hurry, as the employees don't exactly move with purpose... but are you surprised, really?
