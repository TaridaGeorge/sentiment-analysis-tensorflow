Had our first visit to cibo last night. It is in a charming house in down town phoenix. Fabulous atmosphere! Warm, inviting, very unrestaurant like. Our waiter made some excellent wine reccomendations. We started with the Burrata. This was amazing....so simple yet so delicious. Two giant scoops of this mild, creamy cheese drizzled with balsamic, served with toasted bread and proscutto. Creamy, crunchy, salty....so perfect. We ordered two pizzas and a calzone. The names of the pizzas escape me, but one had sausage and potato, the other red sauce and walnuts and the calzone was filles with meats. Everything was simply divine. I love food that is simple, made with quality stuff. That is exactly wht we got. The crust is thin, chewy and has the char spots expected with woodfired pizza. I can not wait to come back to try something else!
