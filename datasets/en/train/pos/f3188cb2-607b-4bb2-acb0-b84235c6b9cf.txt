Friendly atmosphere...great prices...great food ( rib night on wed-- $8.95 for a 1/2 rack dinner!) and the gyros are huge and authentic! ( ru kidiin' me?!? the owners are greeks from chicago!)
plenty of tv's....nice patio for the smoker's music once a month with chuck e. baby and the all stars acoustic jam (2nd wed of the month). poker on wed, too. 
dj on the weekend.nothing fancy about this place, but not a dive like some of the other sports bars in chandler :
(like nate's 3rd base-- that place sucks!).
the hob-nob is a great place for lunch , dinner, or just to hang out. be careful on bears game day! the place is packed!
