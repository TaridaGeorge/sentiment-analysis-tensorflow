took little lucy here and she did great.  :) she just gets the brush and bath but leaves so clean a her coat is so soft  afterwards.  their pricing is spot on, in my opinion, and I actually asked to have her teeth cleaned in stead of having her nails trimmed and it wasn't a problem at all and no extra charge.  thought she might not like it since it was her first grooming experience but she left happy as a clam!!!  we'll see you guys soon and I'll be sure to spread the word on how great you guys are :)
