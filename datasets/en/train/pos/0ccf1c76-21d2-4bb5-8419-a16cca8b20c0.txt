Jam packed well after lunch hours. Full of mostly locals - Hawaiian locals that is. (That right there should tell you something.) I have not had island food this good since I left the islands.  I am serious - there is a place in Orem Utah called Matiki's and it was #1 on my list until this place.  SOOOOO freaking glad I found this place.  it will be the ONLY Hawaiian joint I hit up from now on!
