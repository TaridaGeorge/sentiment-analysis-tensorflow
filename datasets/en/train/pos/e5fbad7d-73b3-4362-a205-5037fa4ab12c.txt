Can't say enough great things about this place! We were visiting family in the area and wanted to take our 18 month old out for some fun- so thrilled we found this museum! Super friendly staff, great pricing & CLEAN facilities. A wee bit crowded but that is to be expected as we went during holiday break. We will be returning again and again!
