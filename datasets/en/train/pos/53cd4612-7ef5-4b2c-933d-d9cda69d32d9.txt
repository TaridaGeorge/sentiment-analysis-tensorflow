I'm guessing you either love Trader's, or, you don't. I. DO. They have a variety of quality productss to chose from... I have a few dietary restrictions, so, I actually get most of my food here. They have many gluten-free products, and I love their selection of goat cheeses. 

Here are a few life changing products: Aioli Garlic Mustard Sauce, Goat Cheese log with blueberries and vanilla, goat brie, Chariot Red Wine, bruschetta topping, and their gluten free muilti seed rice bread.

Oh, and my cat LOVES the double wide scratcher I got there for 7 bucks. 

Thank you Trader's, I will always be a fan!
