A+!!!
This place rocks on every level. Cool location next to the new light rail. Super friendly waitstaff. The food tastes fresh and the flavors are vibrant. 

I had the cinnamon soup and the shrimp kisra. We ended up chatting with the ladies at the table next to us and shared our food. 

The sweet potato fries are sweet and delicious!! 

Best part is that the food isn't over-pried.
