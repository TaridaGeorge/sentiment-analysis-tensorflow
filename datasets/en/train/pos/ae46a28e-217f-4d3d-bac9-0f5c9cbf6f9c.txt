Best thing to happen to Phoenix in a long time.  One of the few places I know that serve Japanese food that doesn't just consist of Sushi or teriyaki chicken bowls.  You must eat:

Katsu curry
Ramen
Gyu don
Niku Soba
Tenzaru Soba

I wish they still had hamachi kama :(

If you haven't eaten here and say you enjoy Japanese food, then I would begin to question whether you even like it at all to begin with (or you just tell your friends you do just so you can come off as cultured and "with it").  And if you HAVE eaten here and aren't digging it *coughteriyakichickenwtfcough*, there's a splendid Neo Tokyo up the road that may be more suited to your "tastes" (or lack thereof).
