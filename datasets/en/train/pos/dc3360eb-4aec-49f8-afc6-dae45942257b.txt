I admit I'm part of the mindless cupcake/froyo/food of the moment craze and Sprinkles are awesome. Obviously it's insane to pay $3.75 for a cupcake, but they are a fun treat and SUPER rich. You can split one with a friend and feel satisfied. 

The location is a little strange and out of the way, but inside its very hip and clean. 

The only flavor I haven't liked so far out of about six of them is the vanilla. Strawberry is my favorite.
