Found this place on Yelp and glad I did. We ordered the rib appetizer, which was good but not great. The sauces made the dish, however. For dinner, I ordered the Peppercorn Shrimp and Calamari. It was incredible. I highly recommend it. I couldn't stop eating it, and the portions were so huge, I had waddle out of there! The waiter was very nice and attentive. All in all a great experience. Go to Malee's. You'll love it.
