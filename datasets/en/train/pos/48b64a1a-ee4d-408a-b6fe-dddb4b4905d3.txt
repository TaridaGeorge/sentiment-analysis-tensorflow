I have been there at least 3 times and gotten facials each time.  The atmosphere is great and so similar to a spa minus the bathroom/powder rooms they have at spas.  It is $30 for a facial that lasts about an hour.
I am going to start a clinic study series where for $225 they do 8 treatments ranging from facials to peels.  I am very excited and think its a great deal.
