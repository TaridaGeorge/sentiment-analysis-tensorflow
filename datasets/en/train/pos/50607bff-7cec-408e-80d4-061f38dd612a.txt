Went in for "Rowdy Days" sale today (and yesterday- oops!!)  I got a pair of jeans and two tops for $150.  You can't beat that!!  This boutique gets better and better.  They had tons of 50% off clearance items, all of their jeans were 40%, and their Rowdy Day-40% off any 1favorite item in the store really is amazing.  I'm so glad they aren't in Scottsdale.  The owners are two local fashion-forward divas and they are so down to earth.  They seem to make it their mission to bring fashion-sense to us central-Phoenicians.  Thanks Ladies!
