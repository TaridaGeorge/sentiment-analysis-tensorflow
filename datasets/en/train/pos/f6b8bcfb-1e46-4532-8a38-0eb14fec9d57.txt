I only ordered one item for takeout today....it was the crunchy eel roll, and it was amazing. Came with 6 Rolls and a side of eel sauce..just over 8 dollars....not a great price...but the flavors were well worth it!

When I walked in, I was greeted with overwhelming hellos and friendly faces! This place has a great atmosphere and I will definitely be going back, many many times!
