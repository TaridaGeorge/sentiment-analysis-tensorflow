I love to go to lunch at off times when  they are not so busy. This was the case on Friday.  I had a fantastic coupon and the waiter that rang me up said he would even make me a fresh pot of coffee. I did not even have to ask.  The salad was wonderful! I really liked how fresh every thing was. Soup a bit so so,but they even had tacos and they were really good. It was very nice and clean inside. My waiter brought me lots of fresh coffee, i was very happy.
