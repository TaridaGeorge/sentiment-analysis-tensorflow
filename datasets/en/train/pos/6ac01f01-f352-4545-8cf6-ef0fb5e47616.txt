So, after reviewing some of my other reviews....I have to go back and give San Tan 5 stars. They've earned it! They are the best Brewery in the state and I cant have them with 4 stars while other, lesser breweries are hanging out with 4 stars...it just doesnt make sense.

They've also begun canning Hop Shock! Anyone wanna shotgun a beer?

LOVE that place!
