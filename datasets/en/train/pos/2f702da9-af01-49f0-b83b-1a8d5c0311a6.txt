The DH loves Tommy Bahama clothing, so when deciding on a location for a Saturday lunch, we settled on Tommy Bahama's @ Kierland Commons. 

Our friends meet up with us and we enjoyed a leisurely lunch chatting over delicious eats and scrumptous cocktails. Each of us enjoyed something different but there was not one complaint for any of us. The food really is fresh and delicious. 

If you haven't been DO check it out...then head downstairs for a little shopping! It was a perfect end to a really great day spent with dear friends!
