As many other people have said in other reviews, Betito's is similar to Filibertos.  However, I thought Betitos tasted a little better.  The food was less greasy than Filibertos.  My family had Carne asada burrito, carnitas burrito, a chicken chimichanga, and the super nachos.  They all tasted excellent.  My favorite was the carnitas burrito.  Now, Betitos offers one dollar tacos on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays.  I haven't tried their tacos yet, but I intend to try them in the future.
