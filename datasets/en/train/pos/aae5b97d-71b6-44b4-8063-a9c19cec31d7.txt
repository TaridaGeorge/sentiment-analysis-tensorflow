Love, Love Dr. Z!  She is great!  Interested in taking care of the patient and is good in answering questions.

Other Dr's are good, but you have to experience each for yourself to see who will work best for you and your child.  Ask tons of questions, and get answers!  Also, the website is helpful in answering many of the questions I have :)
