I just want to shout out to Kristen M. at the corporate office, who contacted me after this review. She not only apologized but gave me another opportunity to try this location. I went on a week night and just ordered dessert. The pizooki was amazing and I was SO happy to have indulged in such heaven! THANK YOU Oregano's for your amazing customer service...much appreciated. Will be back for sure!!
