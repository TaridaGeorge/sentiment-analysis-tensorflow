I have been here more times than I can count.  My menu favorites are the Italo Kisra, Rosemary Chicken Sandwich, Chicken Phyllo Packets, Sweet Potato Fries, and the Turkey Burger. Love the pomegranate margarita as well.  The service is always amazing. I've been for lunch, dinner, happy hour, weekdays and weekends, and have had only good experiences. The knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive waitstaff are what elevate Fez to 5 stars for me.
