Here is my review in a nutshell:  We live in Chandler and will drive here to pick up a pizza and take it home to eat.  It is THAT good and worth the trip.

We always get a margherita pizza with sausage and garlic.  We have eaten it in the restaurant, but most of the time we bring it home.  My husband turns on our oven to 450 degrees and puts the whole pizza on a pizza stone for about 3 minutes.  The pizza is perfect and delicious.  We devour it and always wish there was one more piece.  As we are reaching for the last pieces I always notice the look on his face (and I know I have the same look) of longing....wishing there was more.

I'm drooling now just thinking about it.
