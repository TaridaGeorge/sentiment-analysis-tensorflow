I usually stop by here once a month after trading books and magazines at Bookman's. 
Whenever I feel overwhelmed, I  get some rescue remedy at this store because the prices are generally less expensive than Whole Foods. 
This is where I get some of my Aromatherapy Essential Oils and Bach Flower Essences. Aura Cacia brands are usually on sale here. I love the Aromatherapy  essences because they are very grounding, calming and uplifting. It's one of my favorite indulgences. 
I use them to enhance my yoga experience and it can definitely shift your mood. It's so rejuvenating and relaxing.
The grocery is also an awesome place to pick up inexpensive produce and  raw vegan items. One of a few places where you can find various Guayaki Yerba Matte and flavored stevias.
