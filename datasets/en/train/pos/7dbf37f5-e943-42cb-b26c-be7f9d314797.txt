I freaking LOVE mojo yogurt. Seriously. I go there with my daughter about once a week. She doesn't even ask for ice cream anymore, she just asks if we can go to Mojo Yogurt, and who am I to deny anyone of love in a cup.

Plus its always surprise to go and find out what flavors they will have each week. I know you can look them up online, but I like to be surprised. I've been extremely partial to the fruity flavors lately, like the passion fruit, the coconut and the apple..omg the apple was SO good!

Service is always very friendly and you should DEFINITELY follow them on twitter @mojoyogurt. Trust me you should.

So yeah, if you haven't tried out Mojo, you really should. Right now. Go.
