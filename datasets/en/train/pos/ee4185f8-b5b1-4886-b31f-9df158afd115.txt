This place is great. A nice restaurant in the Biltmore area where everything is under 500 calories - but doesn't taste like it? What's not to like?

I've only been here two times, but each experience has been great! I ate at the bar about a year ago and had delicious salmon during a dinner date. I went back last week with a girlfriend for a lunch and had the blackened fish tacos - amazing!

Considering I live and work down the street from here, I need to come here more often! Great place for business lunches and dinner dates.
