It's unfortunately been a couple years since I've been here but I just adore the place! I grew up in Scottsdale so while there visiting, my friend wanted to take my husband and I out. She asked what kind of place we liked and we said, "Quiet, cozy, with good wines and a relaxed atmosphere." And by God, Kaz is all those things and more! Just like others have said, the wine list is out of this world... both in length and in quality. I also love the decor, full of cozy couches and chairs. We went on a decently busy night and yet it wasn't hectic, overcrowded feeling or loud. Simply perfect. I can't wait to go back.
