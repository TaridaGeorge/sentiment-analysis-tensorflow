Found this through restaurant.com, and boy was I glad! The food was delish! Not to mention it was happy hour so appetizers were only $4 and drinks were $3. The atmosphere was very nice; we sat outside among the Christmas-lit palm trees.

For appetizers we had the Bruschetta, Hummus Trio, and Calamari. They all tasted great, especially the creamy, flavorful hummus. 

Grecian Delight Pizza was pretty good as well.

Baklava cheesecake was good but doesn't compare to Cheesecake Factory of course. However, the Flambe Baklava was A-MA-ZING! Crispy ice cream atop baklava, dressed with whipped cream and chocolate sauce, and then set on fire with Bacardi 151. As my friend said, "Diabetes served cold." Yummy!

We'll definitely be back :)
