The cheesesteaks are to die for. Every Friday is tradition to have Cassela's cheesesteaks, taste just like the ones in Philly. Get it with sauce and grilled onions :) the bread rolls are the secret I think. They get them specially made from a bakery and stop selling once they run out for the day. It feels like family when you walk in and everything on the menu is amazing. Remember that it's cash only!   A great part of going to Saguaro High School is hearing about Cassela's and then once graduating seeing the picture of your graduating class added to the wall.   There's nothing like Cassela's :)
