What a great place to turn your happy hour into dinner! Small plates make a great meal at prices under $7. One of the best places in Old Town where you can split a bottle of wine for $17.50, grab a few apps and be on your way for under $30! The service is always fantastic, the atmosphere is poppin!  Don't be afraid to bring your kids either - the menus is full of great choices and they'll keep busy with Rylan's puzzles.  Love this place!
