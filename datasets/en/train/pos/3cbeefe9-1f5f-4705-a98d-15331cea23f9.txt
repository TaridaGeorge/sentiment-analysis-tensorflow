Probably the best 2nd hand store in the valley aside from My Sisters Closet. Regardless if you are looking for a Halloween costume accessory or just a cheap winter jacket that you surely won't want to pay full price for, this is a great place.  I bought my sons $140 wardrobe for Christmas here. (he picked it out if course).  It was all very clean and even some things were new.
