Ted's in Tempe has been a favorite of mine since the early 90's.  Though currently residing in Queen Creek, it's worth the trip now and then for a delicious, charbroiled jumbo all beef dog.  So many places come and go, but it's great that Ted's has been at the same location for years. Hope they remain for a long, long time.
Update: Found myself at Ted's again today, 11/8/09 [along with a few other times since posting this review].  Same great dogs, and this time got the fries and onion rings--yum. Same good staff and quick service too--their cash only policy really keeps the line moving. So glad to see their business is booming during these less-than-great economic times. Long Live Ted's !!!
