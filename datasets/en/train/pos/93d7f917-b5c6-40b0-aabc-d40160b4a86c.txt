I found this facility 2 years ago when I was pregnant with my 3rd child.  I was impressed with the cozy but educationally stimulating environment.  My kids and I have been treated like family by the staff and I feel they are in safe and nurturing hands.  I have experienced all levels of their program from infants to school age and have been pleased.
