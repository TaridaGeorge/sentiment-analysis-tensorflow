Wow - so good.  Very, very good!

My wife and I began our evening with reservations (recommended on weekends) and felt that we truly received VIP treatment from start to finish.  The food, a variety of Brazilian style cooked meats, was served tableside and each bite tasted better than the last.  The wine list was vast and creative.

The service was terrific.  Polite, informative, but not too invasive.

A wonderful evening, an interesting experience, and we can't wait to return!
