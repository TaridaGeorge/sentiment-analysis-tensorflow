Like Kris H., my family has also been coming here for many many years. The food is great, the service is very warm and welcoming. my family would take the whole back section that was closed off to the rest of the dining room and we'd put the tables together and fit as many as we could. some of my earliest memories were there, my mother's as well. Will be in my future children's memories for sure.
