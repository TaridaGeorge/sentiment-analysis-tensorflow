JJ and his team are true professionals. I needed a service and was having some trouble with fluid leaks under my truck. He determined it was a broken seal, called a dealership and arranged for me to get it fixed under the powertrain warranty. He saved me a lot of money and was very thorough in evaluating my vehicle. They also gave me a ride home and picked me up which was really nice. I am happy to have found a shop I can trust! Seems rare these days.
