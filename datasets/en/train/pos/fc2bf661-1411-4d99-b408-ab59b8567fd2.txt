Quite possibly my favorite place in central phoenix. Brunch, lunch, or dinner, this place is AWESOME for a date, an out of town guest, or just for a leisurely night with friends. 

Vibe is loud and modern here. Flat TVs are here, but typically not on sports. 

Staff is always knowlegable ..

check this place out!!!!!!!!!!!!
