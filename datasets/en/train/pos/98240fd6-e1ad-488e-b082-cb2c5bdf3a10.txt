I've been to BJ's twice now.  The last time I ordered a Jalapeno burger with fries ($9.95) with a stout beer called Tatanka ($5.00). My daughter had a cheeseburger and fries. She ordered her burger well done and I medium. Both burgers were perfectly cooked, juicy and as good as a hamburger could be. What made it most wonderful for us was the waitress was expedient, never letting us sit there with an empty glass ( within 30 seconds of our glass being empty she was there to see if we wanted more). The beers are phenomenal the decor is easy on the eyes. Bathrooms are clean and well kept. Our waitress made us feel as comfortable as if we were at home.
