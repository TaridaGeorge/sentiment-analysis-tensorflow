So Im not the only one...... What a nice family, soooooo sad to see them go. FREE wi-fi, nice outdoors spot, great coffee and pastry. I'll take all the little quirky things that make a great family owned local business what it is over the corporate trash.... Never had a bad experience here. Good luck to you all, sorry to see you go....
