This place is amazing!  It is by far the hippest and best food in all of downtown Gilbert.  I would pick it over BBQ any day of the week.

Their bread pudding is to die for.  All their pizza and sandwiches are good.  Their pancakes rock!  I could eat here every day and never tire of their menu.

LOVE this place.  We just moved from NYC and have had a HARD time finding good food in the area.  This place beats them all :)
