Great new spot!!! Was greeted at the door and quickly seated by the fireplace nice touch by the way. This is an actual old auto garage turned gastro/bistro. The tunes are spot on and they have 4 TV's for all the games. Service staff is very friendly. The food is contemporary punched with lots of love. The wings are amazing an offered in a chile, sweet soy, or truffle glaze. They have shrimp cocktail, deviled eggs, cheese board just to name a few apps. The basic salads and burgers and dogs. (brats and franks!).

The Lamb Chops are awesome dont miss those
