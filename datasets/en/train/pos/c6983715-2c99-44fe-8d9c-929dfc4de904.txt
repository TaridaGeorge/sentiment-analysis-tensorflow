Saw Mike Birbiglia last night and visited the Mesa Arts Center for the first time.  As others have mentioned, what a beautiful complex!  The Ikeda Theater is roomy and I don't think there is a bad seat in the house.  The ushers were very friendly and helpful, although someone should have bonked that idiot who kept putting his feet on the stage in the head.  What an amazing display of douchebaggery.  Would you put your feet on the table where a Master Chef is working?  I think not.  

It was also lovely walking out after the show under the lights and the canopies.  I look forward to returning.
