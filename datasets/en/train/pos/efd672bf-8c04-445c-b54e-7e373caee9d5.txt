On my once at least monthly trip to Loehmanns today I was devastated to see the big blue sign stating the space is available?!?! I feel like they didn't even warn loyal gold and diamond member shoppers before they just left us. I will probably not buy another item of clothing in this state again for a while. The only reason I am even able to compose myself enough to write a review is that I work in San Diego every month and my office is a mile from th fashion valley Loehmanns... which is bigger and better than this one is anyway. So... if any Phoenicians need a fix, just drive 5-6 hours west :) thank God that one is in a much better location so gets more traffic. Hopefully it will stay open forever!!
