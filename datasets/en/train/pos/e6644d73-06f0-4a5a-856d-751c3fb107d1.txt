Five star service.  Any time we called with a request (e.g. extra towels), we'd get a call from the hotel a bit later making sure our request was fulfilled.  Room was nice, bathroom was spacious.  Spent a day at the Willow Stream Spa there which was much worth it.  Grounds are very nice.  Ate at the La Hacienda and it was delicious.  We got a great deal via Hotwire so that made the stay even better!
