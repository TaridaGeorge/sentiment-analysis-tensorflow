I love this place. I've had breakfast and lunch here, coffee, desserts, and all of it is great. Special shout out for the flaky delicious amazing chocolate croissants, and the delectable, moist, dimensional caramel macarons as well as all the great vegetarian specials every Tuesday. Local, fresh, organic stuff made with love. It is a must try. Word to the wise, they close at 3 and they usually run out of their specials by 2 pm, so go early.
