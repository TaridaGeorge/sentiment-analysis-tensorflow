Oh yeah, i'm a fan. The bistro is definitely off the beaten path, we almost couldn't find it. I'm so glad we did. The chili relleno was very much to my liking. The sauce that covered my entree was spicy and so yummy. It really was a beautiful dish. The black beans and rice were full of flavor too. I was so stuffed from the entree, that I got a slice of key lime to go. I tasted my sister's and was blown away. The food was so good, i'm not even going to remove a star for the flavorless lime mojito. This place is a hidden gem.
