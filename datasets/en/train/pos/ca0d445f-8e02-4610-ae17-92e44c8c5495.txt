I go here every Friday night after work. The seasonals and high strength beers are the best in Phoenix (only four peaks pumpkin ale and Sonoran white chocolate are as good as the cherry bomb, triple ipa, and barley wine found at sun up). Food has started to improve after a bit of a downturn when sun up first took over. Recommend the green chili pork or pulled pork sandwich. Kettle chips with chipotle ketchup is still my fave. That never left the menu. Love the servers. Feel welcome there each week.
