The best crepe in town!!!

Even though the sign on the DOOR does not make sense but I still gave 5 stars.

The sign told us to get to the DOOR to get the table. We were in front of the door and noone help us. Until we figured out that we had to actually go through the DOOR to get inside to get the table.
