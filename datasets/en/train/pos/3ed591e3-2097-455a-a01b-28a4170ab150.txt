Once again I stumbled (well, actually a friend introduced me) onto a delightful establishment. My taste-buds are still quivering from the gastronomic pleasure of this weekend lunch. 

Not only was the food incredible, but the service was superb! And we got a little inside info - they shall be serving beer and wine soon - how soon? Maybe already.

I plan on making this a stop on every trip I make into central Phoenix. It was unbelievably satisfying. 

P.S. Share the flour-less chocolate cake with your dining companions. It was a perfect ending to an absolutely perfect meal!
