There are so many things on this menu that I love - the pizza is delicious, the salads are fantastic... and now they have beer!!!   I remember when they had room for two tables when they first opened, and now - wow - after the expansion, it's just a great relaxed place to hang out.    Wall-to-wall people over the lunch hour, no surprise!   YUM.
