This place definitely lives up to the hype! Bomb street tacos.  Keep in mind these are more authentic and are small, not oversized American portions. Don't feel guilty buying multiple, that's normal.  The carne asada torta was also divine. I would recommend buying things al la carte rather than a combo. The combos tack on a couple dollars and you just get small portions of rice and beans. Instead, just buy more off the al la carte, it will be tastier and more value.
