We rode the Harley last weekend to Casa Grande to have a look around.  There is not a lot of selection for breakfast so we ended up at Dennys.  What a surprise we were in for!  The place was clean, the service was truly amazing!, the food was very good.  If you read my reviews you know that I am picky when it comes to eating out.  

They did a great job and we will be back!
