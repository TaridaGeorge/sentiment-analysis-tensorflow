I always turn to yelp when exploring a new place I've never been. It was my first time visiting Tempe, AZ. I thought to myself, "Where is everybody?" Driving around on the road in the middle of the day, it was 90 degrees out and there weren't that many people out. Then I went into Harlow's for brunch due to yelp recommendations and realized everyone was here. LOL But really, I think everyone is indoors when it's hot out. The food here was phenomenal, I had the eggs benedict. Perfect taste and perfect portion. This is how all eggs benedict should be. My boyfriend enjoyed his meal as well (biscuits and gravy)  and the service was great.
