This nursery is incredible! I've only been in AZ a short time but have searched out several places to landscape my backyard and by chance came across this nursery today. And it is the best I have seen! Family owned and very friendly and educated in desert gardening and landscaping. And their selection is tops on my list plus their quality of plants is 2nd to none...did I mention the prices ?  Wow!  I picked up 4 nice size palms and some large cactus for the price that some of these nurseries want for just a couple plants. They take time to inform you how to plant and care for each plant and offer full service planting at very reasonable prices if you need help planting.
I will be a customer here for life!
