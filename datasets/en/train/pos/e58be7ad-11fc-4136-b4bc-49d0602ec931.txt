I stayed here with husband for a stay cation. I purchased a groupon for a one night stay.
Check in was fast friendly and professional. Room was a little dated but  clean quite and bed was very comfortable. Shower had plenty of hot water. We didn't order room service or eat at the restaurant. But all in all we would stay here again or recommend to others
