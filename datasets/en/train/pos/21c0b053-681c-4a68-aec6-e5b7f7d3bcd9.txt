Best liquor store I have ever been to. Every time I am in Tempe I make it a point to visit this place. They have a huge selection of all kinds of liquor. I come here for the beer. Which has an incredible selection of brews. I could spend hours here looking through their very huge selection of beers. I love that you can buy single 12oz. bottles instead of having to commit to a whole six pack.
