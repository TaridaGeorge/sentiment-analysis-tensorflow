It was empty on a Sunday night and almost did not go in because of that.     EVERYTHING was fantastic.   The Pasta trio was rich but so tasty, the Carbonara was full of flavor not just cream. Husband had the eggplant and butternut squash dish, it's so nice to have 2 different flavors on your dish rather than JUST the butternut squash, that would have been too rich.  The cheese used in the caprese salad was melt in your mouth and he Tiramassu was one of he best I've had.
