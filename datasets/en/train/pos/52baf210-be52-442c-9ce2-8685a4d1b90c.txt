I LOVE the YH! I miss the one back home.  However, this is great too. You must check them out for their HH specials. I LOVE their Georgia Peach Martini's and any of the raw tuna HH specials. However, get the sauce on the side. I thought it was overly salty and inedible, but on the side it was fine.  Their creme brulee is always great too, but not on the HH price. Awesome music, clientele and environment. I am very much liking the "Westgate" area. Excellent customer service from both Jamie/Waitress and one of the Managers/Mike. Happy New Years! :)
