Beautiful ambiance, wonderful service, decent wine list, and flavorful dishes.  The salmon and mashed potatoes are to die for!  There sangria is also very good... this is one of the few places I have found that doesn't over-sugar or water down the drink. Solid choice for a romantic date or to catch up with friends.

 Our favorite waiter remembers to bring out separate dishes for the pesto dip (delish!).  It really is the little things that make a place stand out!  Only downside is the drink orders can take +10 minutes.  If you are in a hurry don't eat here.  Live a little, relax, and enjoy the meal.  It is worth the wait!
