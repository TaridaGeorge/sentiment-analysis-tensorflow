I support local business, recycle everything, eat clean, and consume as much used product as I possibly can. If you're anything like me, Changing Hands Bookstore is the place to spend your hard earned money. Everyone in there makes you feel welcome, from the cashiers to the stockers and your fellow shoppers. I also actively participate in many of the events held by Changing Hands. (Book signings, language classes, discussion groups, workshops, ect.) Oh and if they don't have what you're looking for in stock, they will gladly order it.

Get involved.
