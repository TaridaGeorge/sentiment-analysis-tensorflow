Sometimes it's just the simpler things in life which stand out, and when I can enjoy a delicious lunch for under $5, I'm a happy girl :)  I LOVE this hamburger, and I generally don't eat red meat 99% of the time.  For I&O Burger, I am forced to make an exception with zero regret.  I recently read that some of the countries top chefs were polled as to their favorite fast food pick.  I&O Burger won hands down.

A single burger without cheese, grilled onions, substitute mustard for special sauce.....pure heaven!  And, this location has a nicely landscaped drive-thru...not sure why I noticed, but it was a pleasant wait for a perfectly prepared burger and fabulous fries.
