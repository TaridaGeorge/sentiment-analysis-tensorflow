I see why this place has such good reviews.  I met a friend of mine that lives in Phoenix while driving through at this place.  Definitely a hipster gathering here, which is NOT my thing.  But the atmosphere was pretty cool, and the coffee was fantastic.  I'm not enough of a coffee fanatic to really understand the "organic San Fran derived chocolate syrup" or the "organic South Columbian Nicaruaguan Honduran etc coffee beans" lingo, but this place makes Starbucks look like McDonalds (which, in essence, it really is).  The music did kinda suck though - it was too eclectic and strange.
