This place is divine. I love the food, vibe, everything about it. I think it's even better than Pizzeria Bianco because I'm more of a sandwich person and only having a 10 minute wait doesn't hurt either. My idea of a perfect lunch is coming here on a nice day, getting a caprese sandwich, eating outside on the picnic benches, and finishing with a caramel that comes with the sandwich. 

The bread is charred and smoky. Mozzarella is perfect. Basil and tomato,so fresh, it pops. Every flavor is just intensified because of the quality of the ingredients. Simple, but perfect. I have also tried the tuna. Good, but now wow. And the soppressata is too salty for my tastes. 

This is truly gourmet in a unassuming environment. Must try for anybody in the Phoenix area.
