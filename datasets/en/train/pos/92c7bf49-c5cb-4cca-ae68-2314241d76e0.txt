Came by for a group dinner and was pleasantly surprised by the view from the patio facing the fountain!

House Salad 
- Fresh greens w/ a light dressing that wasn't too overwhelming!

28 Day Aged Beef Tenderloin - ~$22
- Tenderloin was moist and tender
- Mashed potatoes were perfectly cooked
- Vegetable was bitter...needed some sugar

Creme Brulee
- came out slightly cold
- ...not too sweet! :)
- very tasty!

Despite having a relatively large group, service was decent and the wait staff kept on coming by to refill water.

....I do know that my colleague was not so lucky and had a relatively undercooked piece of tenderloin!
