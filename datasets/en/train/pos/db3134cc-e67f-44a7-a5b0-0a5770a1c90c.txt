The message I received was drip is toast. I don't drink coffee... a terrible character fault, I know... but Gina and her partner are wonderful hosts and have made a cozy little space to serve delicious food and drinks (I get the chai tea with soy milk.) I like that computers are no where to be seen, only happy people eating and drinking and enjoying conversation. This is a lovely little place, a gem. I enjoy every visit. It is especially nice to bring new people in that haven't been before (so invite a friend to brunch because it is a nice surprise.) The service is great, the food is made fresh, and everything I've tried is delicious, even my five year old loved her nutella on toast. Good things come in small packages and toast illustrates this perfectly.
