If your day is lacking a good decision, this place will change the course of your life - at least for an hour.

I have only ever ordered the Oggie (I'm a one pasty kind of guy), but most of my friends have had their way with the rest of the menu and it doesn't disappoint.

Easily one of my favorite spots in Tempe.  It's also a much larger version of its former self so you no longer have to gladly wait an hour for a table.
