This place has me hooked! I will take their yogurt over Mojo and the pinkberry knockoffs any day. Cute decor, nice service, and AMAZING flavors. The red velvet is a must. The peanut butter is also fantastic. This place has already become a big hangout in Ahwatukee. They are open late too! Love zoyo!
