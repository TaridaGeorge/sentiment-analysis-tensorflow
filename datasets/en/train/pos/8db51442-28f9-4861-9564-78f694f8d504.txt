Bopped in here for the the 'Monday Night Special': flatbread and a bottle of wine for $19! Yay deal!

We enjoyed the pancetta and asparagus flatbread, with caramelized onions added. Scrumptious! We also ordered the tamarind drumettes with sweet chili sauce. The place was hopping and our seats at the bar provided a cozy perch to people watch and enjoy our munchies. 

You know when you first meet someone and it may be too early to tell, but you think it could really be something special? That's how I'm feeling about Timo. I hope it's love.
