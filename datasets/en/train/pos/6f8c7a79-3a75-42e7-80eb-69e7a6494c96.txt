This is the best barber shop in AZ! Very clean shop with flat screen TV's at every station. Rafail has been cutting my hair for over 10 years and is the best in the business. These professionals remember their clients and cut your hair the same way every time. Great haircut, straight blade neck shave, hot towel and massage all for around $20! You have to check this place out!!
