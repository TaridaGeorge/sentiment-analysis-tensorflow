Best Italian food in Arizona is an understatement!. I grew up in New York around Little Italy and have to say the food at Rigatony's is authentic....delicious beyond words! I tried linquine with marinara and shrimp - the sauce was perfect. My husband had the creamy clam sauce with spaghetti and said it was the best dish he 'ever' had!! The bread and antipasto salad is to die for. You can buy a loaf of bread to bake at home! another plus! The ambiance is wonderful, the service is amazing! If you want to be treated like family and enjoy a delicious 'real italian' meal then this is the place for you.  I never said these words before but its 'better than my Moms and Grandma's food)!  I hope the sky doesent open up and swallow me now!!!
