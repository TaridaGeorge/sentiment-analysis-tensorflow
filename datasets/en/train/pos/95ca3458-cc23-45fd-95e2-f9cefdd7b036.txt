I took a trip out of urban Phoenix from the wave of restaurants and automobile exhaust to "saborea estos ricos Tacos de Huevos."

Three soft- corn tacos filled with potato, egg, shredded cheddar and bacon, with salsa verde, sour cream. And side of farm beans. Here you find in the back yard lots of grass, picnic tables, children laughing, playing, mature trees, just a wonderful place to dine. 

Eating is seldom this absorbing, this bracing on the urban farm. The plots closest to the restaurant are for field crops.The production is utilized by Joe's Farm Grill.

Can a farm morph into a most alluring and impressive restaurant worthy of the highest accolade a critic can award? You know it hombre.
