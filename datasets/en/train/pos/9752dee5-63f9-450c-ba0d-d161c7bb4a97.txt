I just ordered the 'hamburger' then added my favorite toppings.

Another excellent burger, I have to say! Plenty of meat, freshly made - and hot off the grill!

Top notch fries as well, overflowing from the cup they put it in.  It takes about 5 - 10 minutes to get a great, fresh burger like this - but is very much worth the wait!
