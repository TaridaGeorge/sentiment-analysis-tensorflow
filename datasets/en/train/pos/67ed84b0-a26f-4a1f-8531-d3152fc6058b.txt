Drive all the way from Buckeye to Matt's at least once every other week. It's so worth the drive...and the wait Beware...you will have at least a 15 min. wait. But it is soooo worth it! Best Waffles I have EVER had. Bacon is as it should be, thick, crispy and MEATY! I haven't even started on the homefries...YUM! They use all fresh ingredients bought locally, even the coffe is bought from a local place, Cave Creek Coffee. They have me hooked...

Do yourself a favor, come down here, order ANYTHING and enjoy! You will NOT be disappointed.
