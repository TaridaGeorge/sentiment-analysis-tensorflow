First time to this restaurant.  I think the "steak house" thing was over done, but I'm happy I went here.   I actually split the 8oz petite filet (mignon), it was probably one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The sides come family style, and we shared the sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and spinach, all were very good (and I'm sure loaded with butter!).   Great place, be prepared to valet.
