You really can't go wrong with Trader Joe's.  The staff is always there to help and go the extra mile which makes it a pleasure to shop here... which I do... often.  I happen to have a little addiction to their seaweed snacks (yes its weird, but I love them), and one time I opened them up and there was nothing in the package.  I happened to find it more funny than irritating and mentioned it to them the next time I was in and they just told me to go pick out another package and that was that! 

If you're ever looking for new, easy recipe ideas the little sample kitchen is a great place to check out.  They are always cooking up something creative and delicious!
