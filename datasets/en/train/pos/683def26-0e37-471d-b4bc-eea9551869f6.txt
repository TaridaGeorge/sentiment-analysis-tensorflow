I love this place!  Their bread is sooooo good, which in turn means their sandwiches are amazing!  All of the sandwiches I've tried are good but, I usually get a half a turkey sub with a side of hot peppers and coleslaw.  I could literally eat tubs of their slaw.  It's the best slaw I've ever had in my life!  The broasted chicken is also delicious.  It was juicy, full of flavor, and not greasy.  The fries were amazing as well.  Their salads are delicious too.  They're full of meat cheese and veggies and their dressing is delicious.  Their desserts are also very good.  I've tried the cannoli and cheesecake, both were delicious!
