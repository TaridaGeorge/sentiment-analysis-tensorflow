Total Wine definitely gives Bevmo a run for its money! I love coming to Total Wine to stock up on wine and beer. This place is so huge I could spend HOURS searching for the perfect red wine. The prices are great and they usually have a coupon available in the Sunday newspaper. They also have wine gift bags, everything cork (screws, boards, weird stuff) and glassware for sale.
