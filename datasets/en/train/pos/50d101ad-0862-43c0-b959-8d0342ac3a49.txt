food is awesome luv it and amazing servers & cooks--been coming for two yrs BUT.....not sure about the  newest manager though  he does not help out his employees when needed , and i was in when smelled smoke as in burning wires , saw smoke coming from under bar area, solo server was too busy and frazzled so  when he finally came out of back office --which is where he ALWAYS is, checking facebook-- it was all almost gone and he could have cared less as he was intent on leaving early to go halloweening...????   very disappointing....
