You'll give this place 5 stars also if you go in with the right expectations. 

Is the food the best Chinese I've ever had? Probably not, but it's definitely better than average. Here's how I put it to a friend: Their food is somewhere between Panda Express and a higher end Chinese joint,  BUT a better value by far then either of those. 

The food is clean, the service is fast and best of all, you won't find many better "bangs for your buck". We recently fed a family of 6 for 43 dollars and I was eating leftovers for lunch for three days. Love it! Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed.
