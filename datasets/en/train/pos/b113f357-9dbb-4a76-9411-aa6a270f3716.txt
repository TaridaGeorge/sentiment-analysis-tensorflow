Like everyone says, this is a great hotel especially next to the airport. I booked this hotel with a discount coupon from US Airway. The staff was very friendly and the lobby was spacious and beautifully decorated. Room was very clean and nice. Bathroom looks like it has been recently renovated because the floor, toilet, and tubs were sparkling clean. They even have soap, shampoo and conditioner dispensers! Free Wi-Fi as well! This rivals many of the 4 stars hotels I've stayed in. If you're adventurous, you can check out some of the strip clubs down the block.
