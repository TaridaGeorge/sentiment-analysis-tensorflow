Definitely the best chicken salad sandwich I've ever had! I'd driven by this place a hundred times and finally stopped in. I got the soup and sandwich combo everything was delicious chicken was fresh and not overloaded with mayo, broccoli cheese soup was perfect. The place probably been around forever and no nothing has been updated. The patio was pleasant and I actually liked the funky mint green color of the building of the place and patio area it made me think of being back home in Cali but, yeah the inside does look a little like a cafeteria.
