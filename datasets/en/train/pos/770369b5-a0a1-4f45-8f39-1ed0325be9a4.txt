This has been a staple since I moved to Phoenix and has never disappointed. From the service, which is always informative, patient (and kind, as my dining companion is always ponderous over the menu) and thorough. No detail is left out. 

The food is consistent, flavorful and diverse. Best black bean soup in town! I recently revisited after a brief hiatus and discovered, to my delight, their Wedge salad that I donned with beef tenderloin. It easily disappeared in record time. I only stopped to take sips of my filthy vodka martini.

I am always reminded that this place can fit any occasion, from a romantic dinner to a night out with friends. They are always eager to accommodate! Brunch is nice and mellow as well. 

If you're ever looking for a neighborhood staple, this should be in your rotation.
