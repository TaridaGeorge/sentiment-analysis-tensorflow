I don't know when exactly it started, but it feels like self-serve frozen yogurt shops have popped up all over the valley like an infestation. And in a world filled with this fad, it's a shame that there aren't more place like Golden Spoon. Not only is the quality of Golden Spoon better than the self service places, but you get so much more for your money (both yogurt and toppings). 

This place was clean, the service was fast and friendly. Prices are very cheap, and there's a big range in sizes. Stick to the smaller ones, believe me, they still give you a lot. Another tip, make some creative decisions. My girlfriend had them mix pumpkin pie with graham cracker. It really tasted like real pumpkin pie.

And if you've never been to a Golden Spoon before...
Yes, the plastic spoons are gold.
