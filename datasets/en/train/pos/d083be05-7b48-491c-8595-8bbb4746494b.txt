I have been going to "college" for 11 years now... yet I have no degree. I bet you are wondering how that is even possible.

Maybe, like Van Wilder, I just like being in school (I don't, I hate it). 

Maybe I'm dumb.

Maybe I'm desperately trying to prevent my youth from slipping away. 

Anyway, back to PVCC. Beautiful campus. Well maintained. Variety of classes at convenient times. Nice professors. Amazing cafe (get the cheesecrisp!!). Overall my fav community college in the valley (and I have been to all of them).

GO PUMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
