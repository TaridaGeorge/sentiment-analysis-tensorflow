I am so glad this place is nearby.  It is a great place for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  A casual, diner-type atmosphere, with food orders submitted at a front window and orders collected at another.  This place is a draw, and consequently the line at the order window can get to be a little long.  We think up to a 20-minute wait is worth it.

The coffee shop in the same parking lot is a great place to hang out, and it too has a great menu for a small coffee shop.
