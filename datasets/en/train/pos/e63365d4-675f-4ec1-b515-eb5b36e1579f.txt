We searched for a nail salon online and called this one after the previous one we called was busy. I am SO gad we did! My daughter and I had Tammy and Ashley and both were tremendous, professional, and extremely helpful in questions I had on eyelash extensions!    I will definitely come back here when I am in the Phoenix area, and since my daughter lives here she will definitely go back!  We really appreciated that they all spoke English, and always talked to you as opposed to each other!
