What can I say? This is just an awesome place. It's pretty rare to find a good coffee shop in Scottsdale, but Cartel goes above and beyond. Extremely knowledgable baristas, high quality coffee, excellent atmosphere, great location... the list goes on.

I used to head to the Tempe location whenever I wanted a serious cappuccino, but now I can get that at the Scottsdale location without wading through a sea of argyle-sweatered, wayfarer-ladened, vegan hipsters.

Thanks Nate, Skyler, James, Kris and Sparky for making this an awesome office-away-from-office for me.

P.S. - Nursing student w/ the earplugs who enjoys a nice cab with her Saturday night study sessions.... where did you go?
