Update:  Finally got my friend to try this cuz I'd been going on and on about it.  He LOVED it, and he also loved the eye candy in there ;o)

But yeah, the gelato here is better than any other I've had in the valley.  My family and I go whenever we can cuz we're gelato addicts.  Today I had raspberry and chocolate... YUM!!!  So yeah, Angel Sweet is the shit, try it!
