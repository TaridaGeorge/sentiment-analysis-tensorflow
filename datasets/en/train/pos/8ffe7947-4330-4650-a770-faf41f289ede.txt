I love me some good sandwiches, and this place has em. Small, family owned joint - it's easy to become a regular here - just go a few times and they'll treat you like one. Super friendly and nice here. 

The food is fantastic. They use quality ingredients and cut the meat to order. Most places don't do this. The prices are low, and the food is good. The ambiance isn't fancy, but it's clean and quaint. 

The Original Hoagie Shop has been here for awhile now I think, and it's a great alternative to the chain across the street. You're missing out if you haven't made this your go-to when you want a sub. 

I'm definitely going back.
