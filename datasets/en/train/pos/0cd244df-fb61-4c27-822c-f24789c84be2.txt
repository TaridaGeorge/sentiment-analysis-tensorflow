Great food!  Best Italian food out here.  Veal Marsala is better than any place in New York.  Their chicken stuffed with three cheeses is also delish.  The bread and salads are simple and classic.  This restaurant is a staple of mine, and I've been going here for countless years.  Yes, besides the unique tree growing over the entrance, the decor is bland (1980's Italian style).  I think it makes it feel a little more like if you were eating at Ma's house, and she was stuck in the 80's.  Love this places food!
