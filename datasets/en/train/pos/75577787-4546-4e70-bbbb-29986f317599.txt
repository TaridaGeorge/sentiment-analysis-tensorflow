Located on the SW corner of 16th St. and Bethany Home Rd. in a strip mall.  Great casual dining in a soft desert toned ambiance; ample portions of really good home cooking served with flair (presentation is everything) at moderate prices.  What more could you ask for? Oh, wine you say?  Well here you go - a comfortable little bar area (yes, cocktails too) in which to chill out at day's end and catch the ball game of the day or vent about work.  Or alternately makes a great place to do business or dare I say - meet a date?
