Almost just like the Hilton Garden Inn we stayed in the night before in Flagstaff, except much much newer (4.5 months old is what I thought I heard).

* Free bottled water voucher
* Free continental breakfast voucher for me, and free FULL breakfast voucher for my coworker... wtf!
* Free internet
* Nice, huge, glass shower
* Super awesome shuttle driver who took us to dinner and drove us around ASU and Mills Ave for a quick tour

We paid $77 per person because it was partially comped by US Air, who made us miss the last flight to Atlanta. If not for the discounted price, I would give this place 4 stars...mostly because I'm still pissed that they gave me a "lesser" breakfast voucher for being a Silver rather than Gold HHonors.
