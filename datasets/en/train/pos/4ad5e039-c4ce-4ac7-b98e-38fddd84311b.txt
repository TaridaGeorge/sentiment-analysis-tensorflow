I come here on Saturdays for Doom Disco ("darker side of the 80s, 90s and modern alternative music") This place looks small from the outside, but dont let it fool you. This dimly lit club features nice Gothic Decor and erotic artwork with a great array of light shows to accompany the decent sized dance floor. Bartenders are very nice and generous and have a decent sized selection to make a wide variety of mixed drinks. One thing that may confuse people is the unisex restroom, but dont let it get to you, it provides the privacy you need to avoid any awkwardness you might be afraid of. When not dancing there is little bit brighter lit lounge area with comfortable leather couches and tables, or there is the bleacher style seats watching over the dance floor.
