I love skunk creeks bike/ running path, no cars, lots of other supportive acitve people, what's more to love? Even the possiblity of water fountains and washrooms and with over 4 hours put into finishing the trail, I think it's pretty safe to say it's the best for even the most extreme active persons wanting a flat (or hilly optioned) ride.
