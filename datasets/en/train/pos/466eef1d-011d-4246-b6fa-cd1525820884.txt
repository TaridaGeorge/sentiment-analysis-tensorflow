Visiting from the east, I was excitied to get my marathon over with so my cuz n I could introduce each other to our respective burger joints.  Thankfully, I proclaim I AM NO TRADER. And the winner, yo 5 guys.  In n out burger was cliche, cheaper, less clean, crowed, crappy fries. I declare 5 guys burger joint is the best.
