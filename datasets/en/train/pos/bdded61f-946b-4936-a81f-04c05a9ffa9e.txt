The best live music venue in the area.  I LOVE live music while having some beers, and I really love live metal.  The stage is large enough for most 4 to 6 piece bands, and there is plenty of room for a crowd up front.  They don't allow moshing, but you can bounce all night long.  The sound is excellent for the size of the venue and you can see the band from pretty much anywhere inside.  There's also a patio to get away from the noise if needed, and you might even find a taco stand to satisfy your midnight munchies.  Excellent drink selection, and awesome crowds.  I'll be back here to get my live metal fix over and over.
