I have to say, this is probably one of the nicest Safeway stores I have ever been to. One of it's shining features is their deli department. It's a great place to stop for lunch. On the spot, they can make you salad, pizza and sandwiches or you can get one of their well made deli items.  Plus, the staff is always really nice here and the store always seem really clean.
