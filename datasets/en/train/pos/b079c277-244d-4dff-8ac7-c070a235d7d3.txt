This Y is just great. Friendly, young staff, who are mostly volunteers, great mix of people, AWESOME machines, and just labyrinthian in design, which makes for great fun and added fitness (and totally Escher-esque at times... did I just go down the up-stairs?). Another kind of strange but cool thing about it is that I always have pleasantries with other gym goers, like, hello, goodbye, please, thank you, have a great day. It sounds average, but it's like the people that go there are on the same respectful, polite page. It's gym utopia. 

The only downsides are the small, 4 lane pool (but at least it HAS a pool) and the pain in the ass it is to get there because of light rail construction. Both of these are so marginal, though, so I give it a very solid 5 stars.
