Qcumber is a lot like when a relative dies and you have to sort through all of their stuff for what you would like to keep only without the grief of the death.

They are full, full, full of great dusty old things. There are amazing finds to be had here. 

I have a thing for old cameras and have bought a couple here, I have a few retro chairs that I have bought. They always have amazing olf furniture of every style.

My favorite part about Qcumber is the old window panes, doors and iron pieces. This is the kind of place that you see people on the DIY network visiting and wonder why you don't have one near.  Good News! You do!

Look past the dust and appreciate the treasures to be found.
