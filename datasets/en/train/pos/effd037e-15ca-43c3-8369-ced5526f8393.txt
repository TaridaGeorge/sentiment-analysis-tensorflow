Im usually here on Tuesdays or Thursdays, and some weeks, both! 1/2 price sushi, appetizers, and drinks on those days. Their sushi is delicious, and they have a wide variety. My fav rolls are the Philly and the Las Vegas, both found on the 1/2 price menu. They also have a lot of no sushi food for you haters :-) The atmosphere is very cool, I love the fishing rod looking chandelier in the middle of the place. The waiters and waitresses are fun and friendly as well.
