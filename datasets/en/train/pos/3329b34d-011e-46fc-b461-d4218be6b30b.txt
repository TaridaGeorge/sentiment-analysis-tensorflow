As I always say, us New Yorkers are pizza snobs. This place rocks. Pizza is great. Wings were passable as well. Their dough, sauce (ask for extra) and cheese were just like home. I recommend the thin crust. And they deliver, quickly. Great place, let's keep them around. Oh, and their antipasto also reminds me of home. Not a pile of iceberg with a slice of pepperoni like places here seem to serve.
