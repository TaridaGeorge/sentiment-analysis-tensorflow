Quick, good, greasy, cheap, and deep fried deliciousness. Don't expect healthy here, but do expect to save some money! Their messy fish sandwich is the bomb, but so is everything else! They have a special sauce that Is so dang good I wish they sold it in stores.
This place is old school, Been around since 1947. They don't take credit/debit cards so bring cash, you know, it's that green paper we used to use to buy stuff!
