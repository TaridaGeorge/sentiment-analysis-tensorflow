Met a bunch of friends for lunch today at Pasta-N-More.  It was our first time there.  We live in Casa Grande, and it was well worth the trip!!  The Food was awesome.  We tried the Cheese Raviolis, and the Spinach Raviolis... AWESOME.  The only thing I wish, was that the portions had a few more raviolis on the plate.  And DONT get me started on the cannolis!!  WOW
