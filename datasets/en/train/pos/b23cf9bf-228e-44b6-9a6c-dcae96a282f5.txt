I am giving them five stars because the quality is extremely high here and everything is very yummy.  The red roasted peppers and goat cheese salad is phenomenal.  I have it with chicken on top and it is delicious.  They are also very reasonably priced especially when you consider the quality and freshness. This is a great little place in an unassuming strip that is a gem here in phoenix and a must try.
