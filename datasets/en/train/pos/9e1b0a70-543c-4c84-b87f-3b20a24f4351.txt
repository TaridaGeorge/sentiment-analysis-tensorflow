I love everything about The Roosevelt.

It's located in a historic house in downtown Phoenix, which makes for a nice relaxing setting.

The Roosevelt is a bar, but also has some unique and tasty appetizer type items. Do yourself a favor and try the deviled eggs. 

The Roosevelt has a good wine list and also has a plentiful selection of beers. 

Cool setting, unique menu, and great selection of beer and wine gives The Roosevelt five stars.
