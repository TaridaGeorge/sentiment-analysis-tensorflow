You have holes in the wall, holes in the ground, dumps, fine dining, casual dining, fast food, and something called the Benihana.  If you have been searching your whole life for a box that serves chuck, the name doesn't lie, look no further.  In close proximity to Arizona State University, the Chuck Box fills that niche for a homesick student looking for some of daddy's buggers made on the grill.  No need to wait for the weekend, the onion rings are also great and the condiment bar is free range just like at home.  You can order you burger by the size or by non-free topping or you can get chicken.  There is also outdoor seating if you don't mind sitting on a stump.
