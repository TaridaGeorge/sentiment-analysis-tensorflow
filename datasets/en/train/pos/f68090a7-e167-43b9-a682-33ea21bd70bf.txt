*Drools* I get ridiculous cravings for Malee's almost weekly. I go in between the panang, burma gai, and ginger chicken. All three are so delicious, but I crave the panang the most. The sauce is rich and you can definitely taste the coconut milk. When I order the panang for lunch, it is the perfect size. I can finish the whole serving and be filled with the warm deliciousness of panang. Also, their peanut sauce served on the salad that comes with the lunch special is the greatest in town. Just give me a bucket of their panang and peanut sauce and I'll be set...for a week! For appetizers, the Siamese kisses and tempura veggies are great. Cute decor and atmosphere, too! Wait staff is beyond friendly!
