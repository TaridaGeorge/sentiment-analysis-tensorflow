deliciouso....great crispy, slightly burnt edges. they weren't frugal with the toppings and were more than willing to add or take away any sauce or topping as we wanted. very friendly staff and quick. cool artwork on the walls, and extremely reasonable for the middle class foodie. 

several valley locations so check one out in a neighborhood near you. then head next door for a tasty ice cream treat.
