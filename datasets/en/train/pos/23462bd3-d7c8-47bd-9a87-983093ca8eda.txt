Steve's, one of Downtown's oldest diners, hosted the after-hours breakfast during Saturday's Downtown Pub Crawl and bravo to the management and staff for recognizing the tremendous opportunity the event presented. 

That night Steve's was transformed from a quaint lunch spot into an open-air discotheque. Amazing.

The patio was packed with Crawlers enjoying their breakfast and dancing to crowd-pleasers like Cupid's "Shuffle" and LMFAO's "Shots," with a beer in one hand and yummy bacon in the other. There were moments when I actually forgot where I was and I was sober as a judge!

The $5.95 breakfast was perfect and the staff was super friendly considering the mass of drunken humanity it was dealing with until 3 a.m.

Great job, Steve's!
