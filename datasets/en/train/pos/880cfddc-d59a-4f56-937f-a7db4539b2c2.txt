I have had too many issues in the past with Discount Tire installing my tires and wheels incorrectly and then not standing behind their work.  A friend recommended this place -- WOW, what a difference and their prices are pretty much the same as Discount Tire - but with professional employees and work.  I have recommended them to a number of friends and they are all happy.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.
