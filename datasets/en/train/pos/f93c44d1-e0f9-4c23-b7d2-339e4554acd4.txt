Finally a Nike store in the Valley!!!

Sure, it's not a NikeTown so you don't have four floors of stuff the way you do in San Francisco or LA, but its got more than almost any other place and when you think about how much Nike gear is available through other outlets like department stores, sporting goods stores, and even Nike outlets, it's hard to complain.

The store personnel were very nice and the store has an excellent selection of running gear, workout attire, casual wear, golf clothing, and even the new Nike NFL line.

Sure, it's full price, but that's what you get for buying directly from the company.

Just Do It!
