Great chicken fry! I like the thick cut hash browns and gigantic biscuit too. I could only eat 1/3 of my meal, but still enjoyed it. Atmosphere was cabin-like with bear stuff everywhere which was fun. I read about bad service from previous reviews, but our service was just fine and very attentive. Would go back if I was in this area.
