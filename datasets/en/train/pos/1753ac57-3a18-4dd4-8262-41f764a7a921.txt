Bread-eaters.  EAT HERE.

This bread is so fresh and tasty.

Try ANY of their soups in a bread bowl.  All of the soups are hearty and flavorful.
The veggie chili is one of my faves.

The salads are pretty big and come with 2 huge chunks of bread.  Everything comes with bread!

Also give them a try for breakfast.

I usually get this egg, brie and apple frittata thing that is sooooo yummy.  And the coffee bar is pretty good too.
