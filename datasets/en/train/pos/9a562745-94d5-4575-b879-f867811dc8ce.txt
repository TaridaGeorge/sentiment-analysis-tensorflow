I stop in regularly for a cup of coffee before I head to work. Honestly, this little place is just what I've been waiting for since we moved up here 8 years ago. Good coffee, delicious bagels and pastries plus a few other menu items. I'm always greeted with a smile and the staff is so helpful. The place is clean and photography adorns the walls. You can either sit inside or outside on the patio tables. Either way, it's always good.
