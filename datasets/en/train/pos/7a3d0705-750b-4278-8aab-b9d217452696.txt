I have been to Ling and louie's numerous times over the past few months.  I think their food is way better than PF Changs.  however, their customer service is why I continue to come back.  Dave Manahl, the manager, is absolutely great.  Not only did he fix my friend's order immediately after it came out too spicy, but he also gave us a discount for the inconvenience.   That shows this place actually cares about the value of customer retention.  
Thanks Dave.  Great Food, Great Atmosphere, and reasonable prices.
