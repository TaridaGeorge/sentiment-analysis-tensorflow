Since Marie Callender's across the street closed- I've been sad. But Village Inn is still here! I LOVE their strawberry crepes! Today that's what I had for brunch- along with coffee, orange juice, bacon, poached eggs and a tiny bowl of fruit. They offer free pie on Wednesdays- but I was so full today I had to decline. Village Inn also makes GREAT French toast- with REAL French bread! Yummy! Sorry Norm- I forgot to take a pic of my meal- I was so hungry I just ate!!
