Fantastic! So fantastic that if I lived within walking/driving distance of this place I would probably be here for my morning coffee...mid-day tea...and whatever wildcard drink at night! Phew! The drinks (really any) are yummy, fresh and you can literally taste the care that was taken in choosing the tea leaves and coffee beans. I LOVE that there are UNLIMITED refills on their ice tea and they include some simple syrup at the bar so that you can sweeten it as you like! The service was outstanding-warm and with a sincere smile!
