Love, love, love this place!!! 

Food is fantastic. I usually get the "Pick Two" and get a turkey sandwich with all the veggies (cucumbers, sprouts, onions, tomatoes, lettuce) on the 9-grain bread and a garden salad. The salad is fantastic! Spring mix lettuce, carrots, peppers, mushrooms. Not your ordinary side salad! And the honey mustard dressing is fantastic. 

I have also eaten The East Coast Panini (pastrami, sauerkraut on rye), The Scottsdale (roast beef, red peppers on sourdough) and several other sandwiches. All top notch. Their red potato salad is also fantastic. 

The service is stellar as well. The counter people are always really friendly and quick. Your food comes fast and I've never had a mistake in my order. One of my favorite AZ places!!
