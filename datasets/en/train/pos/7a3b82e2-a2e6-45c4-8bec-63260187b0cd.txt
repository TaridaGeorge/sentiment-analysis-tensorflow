Iced coffee on a nice day out on the patio, or iced tea on a hot day in the cool AC.  So much better than going to a chain! Thanks Chad!

This place is always so welcoming when you walk in the door.  There are cool clusters of furniture and tables, a record player, and tons of books and games to peruse.  

The cafe is connected to Alter Ego Salon, so it's the perfect way to spend an afternoon getting pampered and sipping yummy coffee drinks.  And you can also go splurge on Mexican food next door!
