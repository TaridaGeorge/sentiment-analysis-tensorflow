Surprised so many are quick to discount a place that you can get a full meal for $6. Yes your chicken wasn't handed to you by a hipster in a barn that was upgraded with modern lighting and a DJ playing, but for what you pay for, Canes is awesome. If you want fried chicken fingers these have to be some of the best. 

To clarify for some of the others, a burger king used to be here and they welcomingly bulldozed down that atrocity to burgers to the ground. And they do have modern lighting, and a disco ball for some reason, if that is what you're into.
