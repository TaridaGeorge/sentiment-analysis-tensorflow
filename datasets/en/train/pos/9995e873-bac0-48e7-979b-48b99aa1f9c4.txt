We love this place for the fab food and the great staff. Everything I've had is excellent, and it has become our favorite after church breakfast spot...and our Saturday morning with nothing to do breakfast spot... and lately my favorite got to get some studying done. 

The side of couscous is amazing fresh, and the Sunday special waffle is my all time fave. And you can't beat the price for great quality food.
