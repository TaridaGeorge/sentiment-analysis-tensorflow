Love this spot. Parking never seems to be a problem in this part of Old Town. Walking in, we were greeted warmly by the hostess.  My girlfriend and I chose to sit in the lovely outdoor patio to enjoy the perfect weather that night. Our server was very helpful and recommended some pretty fabulous red wine. My girlfriend who brought me here used to work there so she recommended the bruschetta as an appetizer followed by the  amazing 5th and Wine burger and ending with the cheesecake. Umm... Yes total foodgasm! I need a cigarette. But seriously, I loved my burger, the fries, the salad - everything we had was delicious. Best believe I'll be back very soon!

Tip- $5 glasses of wine during HH
