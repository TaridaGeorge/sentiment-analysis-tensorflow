I really like this place and was surprised to find such good Italian food in Glendale, AZ...or in Arrowhead to be more specific. I've been here several times now and the food is always delicious, the wine selection is very good, and the service is always terrific. It's a little bit pricey but worth the money. It's also good for date night or bring the kids if you have to........I mean want to.

I've tried the lasagna, the cioppino, the spaghetti, and various specials and they were all tasty. The best thing I had there was this amazing lobster -bisque pasta but it was a special so it's not always available. The shimp pasta dishes are also excellent.

I hear they have great happy hour deals so I plan to check that out soon.
