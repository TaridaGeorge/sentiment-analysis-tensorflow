I've been coming to Solo on and off for the last 4 years. It's a great place to sit and work, hang out and chat or just pick up a quick drink. The coffee and tea are high quality and there's an assortment of locally made pastries available to snack on.

What I really like about this place is the consistent quality of product and service. The owner is an awesome guy that works the floor and sincerely cares about his business and his customers.
