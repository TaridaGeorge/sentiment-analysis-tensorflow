When the Gelato is actually made and served by a real Italian, it just tastes better.  This stuff is the real deal. I would say that when I go there I feel that I'm transported to Venice and that I'm eating the Gelato in the home country, but that would be an exaggeration.  It's still darn good even though I'm stuck in Scottsdale.  Ciao.
