When we are in Phoenix  for business we tend to eat breakfast here. The food is yummy, the place is small and Matt tends to be around to say hey and help serve up the grub. I like the oatmeal of all things...my husband really likes the scrambles. I love that it's small and homey the food is good and it's not too pricey. Also, I love to give my business to ma and pa places as opposed to, say...IHOP or Denny's. (YUCK)
