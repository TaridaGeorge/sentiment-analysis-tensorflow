Yes, folks.  This place pretty much rocks.   The best way to describe it is that it's like a really hip study lounge (from the Clue board game) without the books or the geeks, but with a bar, pool table and jukebox instead.  

It attracts a Central & East Phoenix 20-30 something crowd who want a cool low-key place to go, but without the Scottsdale scene.  The layout of the place is little odd - but not too big, not too small.  Decent servers, generous mixed drinks, Stella on tap, movies in the background (Weird Science when I went last), killer jukebox and fun crowd really make this place.  Don't all run now, don't want it to get too crowded now...
