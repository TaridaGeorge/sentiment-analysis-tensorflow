I've lived in the area 4 months now, and today I saw a different side of Scottsdale. I hadn't realized what a family friendly area it is. I came to the park to walk my pup and found this park full of families, bbqs, bday parties, teenagers playing volleyball, parents playing with their youngsters on the playground, a group of smiling children riding a train, a carousel, just enjoying the beautiful day with their loved ones. 
It's almost enough to make a girl want to run out and start a family of her own! 
Seriously though, like the other Yelpers stated, this is a very nice and inexpensive  way to spend the day with your loved ones. Really reminded me of my own childhood- before we were all glued to our electrical devices and actually had human interaction.
