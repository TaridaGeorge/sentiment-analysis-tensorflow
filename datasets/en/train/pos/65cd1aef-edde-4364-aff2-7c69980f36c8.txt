Shared the gingerbread fro-yo with my 2-year-old. I LOVED that it was all self-serve! I didn't feel rushed to make up my mind or freak out over getting the "wrong" flavor or toppings. It also allows you to choose just how much you want, rather than be forced to a pick a size. (Even a small is sometimes tough for me to finish at other fro-yo places). I also liked that the flavors and toppings were somewhat unique. It was also very CLEAN. Will definitely be back!
