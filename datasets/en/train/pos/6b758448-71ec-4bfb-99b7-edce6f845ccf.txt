As a flight attendant, I can honestly say that this is the best place to get your onboard meals before getting on the aircraft. The store is in a shopping center which has ample parking. It's also close to LA Fitness where I used to work out at. 
But whichever location you go, Trader Joe's is quite affordable.  I love their organic produce, their boxed lunches and fresh fruits. 
It's really fun browsing the aisle and tasting some of the free samples! I can spend an entire hour just browsing the whole store and  justify it as daily exercise. 

The staff here is really nice, but the store get pretty crowded. It's small and cozy.

Recently I discovered the TJ's Green Tea Mints while I was in Philly and now I'm seriously hooked! Another good reason to keep coming back. 

Two thumbs up and inflight approved!   :)
