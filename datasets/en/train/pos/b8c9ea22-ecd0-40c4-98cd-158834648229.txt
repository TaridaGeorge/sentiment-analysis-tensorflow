I'm giving 5 stars.  First off, there is no other non luxury department store anywhere even close to me unless I drive out to Scottsdale Fashion Square or PV Mall and when I am having a clothing meltdown (this happens more often than it needs to) the only place I can turn to is Biltomore Macy's.  Thank God, SOMETHING is there to help me find that emergency outfit.  I can always find something to buy here and they just had the most amazing shoe sale-- 50% off already sale marked shoes.  I spent $104 on 4 pairs of shoes.  One pair was originally $100.

I'm a Macy's fan, I'm glad they haven't been kicked out, errrr, I mean left the Biltmore.
