I got the Breastfast Burrito sans eggs and tofu because of allergies.. It was amazing!! Their fruit bowl is versatile and fun. Noisy-ish if you're dining in, mostly because of the juicer (yes they juice your drinks right there..) but think of it like a cafe.
Fun and original! Great varieties and options for vegans and people with allergies!
