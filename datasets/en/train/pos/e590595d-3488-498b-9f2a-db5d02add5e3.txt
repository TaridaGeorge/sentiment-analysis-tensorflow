Our experience at Hotel Indigo was superb. 

The check-in process was personalized and efficient. The room itself was great! 

By far the highlight was the bartender. He was everything you want in a good bartender. My buddies were all in town for a little college reunion, and the bar saw a lot of our faces. He remembered us everyday, and what we drank. He knew how to make a good cocktail, and provided plenty of witty bartender banter. HIGHLY recommend it.
