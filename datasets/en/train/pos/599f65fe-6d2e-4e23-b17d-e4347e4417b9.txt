This place is fantastic. Artsy, collegiate, chill feel. Nobody bothers you if you want to hole up in the church pew bench against the wall and work, or you can chat about music or philosophy on the couch amongst the hundreds of eclectic books on the shelf. 

The owners and employees are friendly without being intrusive, the coffee is impresive in quality and preparation. They use local people to roast their coffee...big plus in my book. 

The place is green using real dishes instead of defaulting to paper products, they use organic ingredients whenever they can, and there is free wifi. 

All in all a solid, local, genuine shop. Go there. The green monster won't miss you, and you can feel better about yourself for not being a sheep (if even just for a day)
