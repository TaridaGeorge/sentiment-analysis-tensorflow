I was also rung up by the same girl Nathan M. mentioned below. I really wish I could remember her name because she is SO extremely nice. I go out of my way to get in her line. She always greets everyone with the biggest smile and chats with you about your plans, etc.. She is friendly and fast. I hope her boss somehow sees these reviews.

I love that this Target has the full grocery now. I always have great service here. Mark who works in the produce area is very helpful and friendly.

The pharmacy people here rock too, I've asked the blonde pharmacist many questions and she is always so happy to help me. I really love my neighborhood Target.
