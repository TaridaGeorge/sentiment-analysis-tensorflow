I was so happy with this place when I went with friends for lunch last week.  The service was outstanding.  The price for the lunch specials is amazing.  The baked rigatony with broccolli was so delicious.  Was excited by the pick a pasta early bird dinner specials also.  And kids eat free on Monday.  Combine those two deals and it would be cheaper than eating at home.

Can't wait to go back!!
