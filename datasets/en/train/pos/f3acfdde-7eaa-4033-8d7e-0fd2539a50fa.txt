If I could give this place a higher rating than 5 stars I would. Great place with wonderful clothes, jewelry, records, etc. ....and at a very fair price...best of all the woman working there was amazing! VERY VERY VERY nice...helpful...friendly. Helped me more than I could ever ask for and didn't try to sell me a thing. Fabulous place and I will be back for sure!!!
