Just remember this

HIT OR MISS

This place can be really really great and full of awesome bargains
Or you can go on a bad week where you find nothing but stained/ripped crap

However, I've found some of the most awesome world-shaking bargains at this place.

$20 G Star jeans
$40 True Religion capris
$38 Coach shoes
$30 Kate Spade purse

The lines can be long for the cashier, but they move pretty quick.

The dressing room is mostly community style, so wear undies.

The bargain hunter in me LOVES this place.
The claustrophobe part of me hates this place.
Luckily the bargain hunter part of me is stronger :)
