I have just completed my volunteering here since I need to get a second job. SUCKS. I had the special opportunity to work in the barn with the horses, llama, goats and sheep. I loved coming there after work and enjoying the quiet of the campus and the views of the mountains while being outdoors with the animals.

They are currently looking for more volunteers, including my replacement for Wed evenings, and I would encourage anyone that loves animals to check it out! You can also foster, which for people who are home often, is a great option.

Wonderful people, cause and place! Please look for your next companion here before the pet stores or breeders.
