Yum! I like bulk, unwrapped candy. I don't care if it seems 'unclean'. Obviously if a bunch of candy is stuck together I will change my mind, but all the candy I got here was neither sticky, or in any child's mouth (from what I observed). The prices are high, but it's a novelty shop, not Circle K. I like that I can mix and match my own variety of candy. Also, the unwrapped bulk candy I purchased was absolutely fresh, and tasty. The man working at the cash register was super friendly. I love candy, and I will be back!
