This museum is beautiful and on par with museums you would see in big cities such as San Francisco or New York. Being a musician myself, this was truly a delight. The instruments they have on display are very interesting and have changed the music world around us.

The tour around the world through music is very fun, but my favorite part of the museum had to be the bottom floor, consisting of exhibits about famous musicians. They have the actual piano that John Lennon wrote Imagine on.

The experience room is loads of fun as well. They allow you to play many instruments that are out of the ordinary. Play the theremin!
