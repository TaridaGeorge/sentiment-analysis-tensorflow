Consistent is a great word to describe this place. The food is consistently great; the service is consistently great; the regulars are consistently there. (they're great too). It has a comfortable smoking/drinking patio and great prices during happy hour. The staff and owner is always (consistently) accommodating and friendly. You feel like you are part of the family here. 

Food I'd recommend: Any fish served Greek style, the Prime Rib, the burgers and definitely the fillet medallions with the gorgonzola wine sauce. All the food is good though and you gotta love the salad bar!
