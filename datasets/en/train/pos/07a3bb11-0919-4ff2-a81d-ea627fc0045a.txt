I've stayed here numerous times and always enjoyed it. Very nice guest rooms and the restaurant/nightclub at the top not only has one of the best views in the southwest but the restaurant is top notch and the club is one of the finest I've ever been in anywhere! I highly recommend the entire facility to anyone!
