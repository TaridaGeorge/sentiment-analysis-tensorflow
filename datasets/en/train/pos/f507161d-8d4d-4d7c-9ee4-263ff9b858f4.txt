Wow - the garlic fries alone were worth the trip!  Definitely a 5/5.  I had the BBQ chicken pizza, which was pretty good.  It wasn't bad, but wasn't in the same league as others that I've had.  Maybe I just like a different style.  I'd give that a 3.5/5.  My wife had the ahi tuna burger and rated it a 4/5.  She also had a milkshake and sweet potato fries and said they were both a 5/5.
