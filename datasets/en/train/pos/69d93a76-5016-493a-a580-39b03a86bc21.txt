This is the place that I go to de-stress, to do homework, to celebrate a happy occasion.  I will take any excuse to go here.  I love that when I walk in I am always greeted with a smile and that there is never attitude.  The baked goods are irresistible but the coffee is what keeps me coming back.  There isn't a better soy latte in the entire valley.  It is deep but mellow and never, ever bitter.  I love CSC!!
