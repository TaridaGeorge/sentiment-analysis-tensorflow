Lovely little space--the cafe is an old repurposed Phoenix home with plenty of patio space.  Very quaint.

The service was super friendly, and the seating areas were comfortable with enough privacy to have conversation. 

I enjoyed their weekend brunch with Mimosa's. Food was solid breakfast fare with medium sized portions.  Most of the dishes had a slight Mexican flare (chorizo with the eggs Benedict, corn tortillas on the side, etc). My boys got the "Miga" eggs and their exact review was: I like these eggs, they are delicious. So there you go - positive reviews from a picky 5 year old.  The adults enjoyed their meals too. I do wish their mimosa glasses were a bit larger - but that is probably just the boozer in me talking. The prices were more than fair. Overall enjoyable experience!
