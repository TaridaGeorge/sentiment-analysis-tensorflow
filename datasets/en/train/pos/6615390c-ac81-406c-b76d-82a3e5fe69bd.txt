Inza is a great little coffee shop hidden in an ugly strip mall.  Owned by a family from Inza, Columbia, they import all their own coffee straight from their hometown.  They also make homemade empanadas and sandwiches, that taste delicious with a hot cappucino. If you are in the mood for something sweeter, Inza's chai tea latte is one of the best that I have ever had.  Also, a few of my friends that work there tell me that Inza will soon be a wine bar as well as coffee shop.  Go to Inza, drink the coffee, embarass yourself by trying to speak spanish to your barista, and kick the coroporate starbucks habit.
