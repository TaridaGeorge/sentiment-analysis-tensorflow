One of those great, unheard of small businesses where they take care of you, the customer and stand by their work, Vic started with one of my cars, and I ended up so impressed with his work, flexibility and standards, that I had all 4 of my vehicles done there, even trusting him with my brand new 2012 Grand Cherokee which he did a great job on.  Only had one little window problem where the film wanted to peel back and he immediately got it in and took care of the problem with no questions asked and no charge.

Great prices (and I did shop around)  but most importantly, great service and attitude.  Behind the Tire Place on Bell, easy to miss it but they are back there and you will be happy with their work.
