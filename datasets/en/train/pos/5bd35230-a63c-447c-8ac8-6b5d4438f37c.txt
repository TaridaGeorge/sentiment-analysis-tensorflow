Took our teenage boys after a round of golf. The hostess was very accommodating as we has no reservation.  Had parmesan crusted sole. Chilean sea bass, red snapper with lump crab and lemon sauce, and seared tuna.  All fish was fresh and cooked perfectly. We had the beet with walnut side dish, heirloom tomatoe salad and truffle fries. 

They have a great happy hour with apps and drink specials available only at the bar and would go back just for that .

Great atmosphere with lots of outdoor seating.
