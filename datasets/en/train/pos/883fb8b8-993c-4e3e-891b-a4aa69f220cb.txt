Yay! I'm so happy to see my neighborhood staple get the love it deserves! The food here is amazing! As an upscale deli counter, they have everything from deserts, to a cheese stand, to prepared foods to go. 

D'licious Dishes has partnered with several local companies to sell their brands : Berto's for ice cream; and their cold refrigerated section offers fresh and frozen dishes to keep for later (Truffle Macaroni and Cheese anyone?). Do try their soups (Gumbo is amazing); and check out their charchuterie (Locally made pepperoni - Wild Boar). 

Located at Missouri and Bethany Home, its definitely more of a neighborhood spot.

Also, its closed on Sundays- so stock up on Sat. for your Sunday dinner.
