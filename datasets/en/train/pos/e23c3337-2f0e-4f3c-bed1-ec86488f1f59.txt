In this world of scams, you can really trust Amanda Melby and her instructors when it comes to acting. Most other private acting schools operating in the state of Arizona, are about making money. Some of them won't even tell you they're a school. They promote themselves as, "middlemen" between the actor and the agent. Additionally, they target their marketing toward parents with hopeful children. Why? Because they are about making money. Verve Studio is definitely the antithesis. The courses of study offered here, are for the serious performer.
