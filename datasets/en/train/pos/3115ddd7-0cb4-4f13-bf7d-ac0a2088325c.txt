This has always been a great mall, is shows its age very well. This has to be an expensive location since stores are always closing or moving to a different location in the mall. 

This has always had a great selection of different stores inside and around the mall along with lots of places to eat. Has a decent play area for the kids, and a snack shop right by the play area where they dont charge any taxes, why I have no idea. 

Double decker merry go round is always hit with the kids 2 rides for $5 and adults ride free with kids. 

Great place to escape the Summer heat but just remember when you go back to your car its going to be 200 degrees inside of it.
