We've gone here a lot the past couple months, and I have to say that they have really stepped it up! The Argentine Po'boy is a favorite of a lot of people here (including me!) but if there's a special I have to try it, and it's usually amazing. The Citrus Chicken sandwich was sooo good. I can't wait until they have it again! Also, my boss NEVER eats fries but she has to get the thyme fries every time we go here because they are awesome and perfect even for takeout. I'm really happy! It's a favorite of ours now!
