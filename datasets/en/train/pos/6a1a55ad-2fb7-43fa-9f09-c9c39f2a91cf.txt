Go Angels! I love Angelos Italian Ice and the Cajun Fries were sooooo good! I haven't been here in 6 years and some stuff has changed such as when the players come out of the practice fields and begin to walk to the stadium, they have double barricades instead of the one. So it's harder to get an autograph.
