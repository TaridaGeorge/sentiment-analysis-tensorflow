Love this market!  Every weekend it seems to grow bigger and better.  Great location, parking, variety of vendors and fun for the kids too.  For them, there is an intimate and very fun petting zoo (only the first and last Saturdays of the month - $2 for kids and free for the supervising parents - bring your camera!).  My daughter delighted in holding 4-day-old goat recently, along with small pigs, exotic chickens, young kittens, and a dwarf rabbit.  Also on the grounds there are well-behaved greyhounds to pet for free, fantastically skilled face painters, healthy food and snacks, and fresh air.  An ideal Saturday morning family adventure!
