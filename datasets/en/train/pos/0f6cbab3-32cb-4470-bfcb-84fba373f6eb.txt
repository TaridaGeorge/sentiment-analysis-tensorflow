Zoo LIghts gets better each year. This year they added more to the dancing lights that move to music. The ball in the middle of the pond and the trees surrounding the pond on each side dance now. This is a great event for families and dates. A nice cup of hot chocolate and a stroll to see all the lights is a great way to get into the holiday spirit. They have a talking giraffe as well for the kiddos. I do recommend going during the week if possible to avoid the crowds but they are open even on Christmas and New Years eve. It ends on January 6th so you still have time to get over there and extend your holidays!
