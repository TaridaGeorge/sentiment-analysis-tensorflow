Melrose Pharmacy is one of those really cute diamonds in the cenpho area. i stopped in here on the last melrose block party with some friends, one needed to get a percription filled and we saw this place and said "yup lets try it" it was soooo cool. lots of little wind up toys and books and other typical pharmacy type items stocked on what looked like 5ft book shelves. the pharmacist was really nice, chatty, and helpful to my friends needs. filled her script in 10 minutes while we milled around the store. they even accept a wide selection of insurances and everything was nothing more then a pleasant experience...i almost wish something was wrong with me so i could have a perscription to fill too. oh well. when i do i will be taking it here for sure. 5 stars for just awesomeness.
