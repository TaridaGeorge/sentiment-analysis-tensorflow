Alan is a great guy, who makes great food. The best white meat chicken, cooked in canola oil, can't get much better than that. The special sauce is pretty great, I have yet to try anything else, its really that good. Al is always down to shoot the shit and makes sure his customers are taken care of, can't say enough good things about this place. 
As always, you get what you pay for.
