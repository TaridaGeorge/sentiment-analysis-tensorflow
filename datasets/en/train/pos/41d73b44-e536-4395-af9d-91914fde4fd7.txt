4.5 stars rounded up to 5.  Excellent restaurant.  Had a great meal at Tarbell's.  Ambiance and service were very nice. 

Food was truly wonderful. 

We had the famous spaghetti (trust me-its a main course) and the special ravioli. Both were very tasty, cooked to perfection and the ingredients and spices just exploded on the palate. Also, prior to that had the beefsteak/'tomato salad, and the house salad.  All greens, fresh, crispy and tasty. 

Nice wine list.  

Split the bourbon chocolate bread pudding to finish the evening. 

Highly recommended for fine dining in Phoenix.
