Back in April I had major issues with my A/C Compressor and Serpentine belt.  They fixed these issues at a fair market rate, according to a few references and reviews I'd read online.  Now on Oct 19th I had the exact same problem, I dropped of on my way to work, and worried about the bil.  I got my warranty through them the first time, making the trip absolutely FREE!!
Car runs great again, ice cold A/C, and the power steering is smoother than it has ever been.

Thanks Guys!!
