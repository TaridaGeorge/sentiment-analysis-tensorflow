MY FAVORITE DIVE BAR OF ALL TIME!!

The place is super laid back and relaxed! Every day they have a different event going on such as poker or karaoke.

The food is so yummy! My fav are the wings..grilled and resauced and come out perfect each time! My boo loves the grilled cheese!

The bartenders are SOOOOOO nice! I love me some "Tabby"! One thing for sure, they don't take ish from anyone so if you're comin in their with some kinda attitude...I'd recheck myself. lol 

I love the fact that its a mixed crowd. All kinds of different people go there from bikers to hipsters! 

All in all, I love this place...it keeps me coming back ;]
