Greg is da man for BMW. I watched him pull the heads off his car in the paddock at the track to fix a problem, then take the car out and win 2nd place in the GTS-3 National Championship against a very tough field of Porsche GTs. Greg is definitely one of the top BMW mechanics in the country. He also gets points in my book because he doesn't just repair BMW's for a living, he lives, drives, races, and wins NASA GTS National Championships with BMWs!
