I stayed at this hotel last night, and we had a great stay. We were celebrating my friend's birthday, and didn't want to drink and drive. So we booked this hotel on Expedia for under $100/night (2 bed suite) because of it's price and location to the clubs in Scottsdale. The room was remodeled and looked fabulous, the check in process was extremely easy, and the staff were very helpful. We walked to all of the nearby clubs (literally in the parking lot of this hotel). Will stay here again for sure! But next time, I'll make sure to get up early and eat at the awesome continental breakfast. Wow, looked like a really nice eat in kitchen!!
