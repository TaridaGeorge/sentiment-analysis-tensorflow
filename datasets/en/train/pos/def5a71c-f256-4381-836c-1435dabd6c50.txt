I loved everything about my visit to Joe's Farm Grill! I ordered the Fontina Burger. It was lovely and fresh. The food is made with quality ingredients in a casual atmosphere. We sat at the picnic tables under the trees with fragrant orange blossoms. The weather was gorgeous and it felt so relaxing and calming. I loved the change of pace and scenery. We did not want to leave.
