This place is awesome.  I rarely venture outside of my hood in Scottsdale but I decided to give this a whirl.  I've driven by it for years and never checked it out.  It looks a bit sketchy from the outside but a laid back, sorta eclectic atmosphere inside with cool music and really healthy, fresh food.  I don't know what this "vegan" thing is but I think I like it.  This is one of my new favorites.
