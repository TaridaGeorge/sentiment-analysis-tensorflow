So everyone says Pizzeria Bianco has the best pizza in AZ right? Well not exactly. La Bocca does by a longshot. If you like a variety of toppings that you can pick (unlike Pizzeria Bianco), this is your place. AND perfect crust. The antipasti plate ROCKS as well. This is a must, especially on a nice day so you can sit on the patio and people watch. I hope this place stays around for a long time! :)
