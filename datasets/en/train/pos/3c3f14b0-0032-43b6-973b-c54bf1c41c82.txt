Only 8 Reviews (none filtered) and the Fitness Cafe has been around for like ever. Come on Tony, where's the love.  Here it is.... I love the Crosstrainer salad. It garnishes 5 stars for sure. A huge portion or chicken, veggies, corn, etc.  A great meal.  I love the "Ferrigno"... a great chicken sandwich with vodka sauce... nice touch.  I love the low carb salad. I dig all the hot pictures on the walls and the customers are always the fittest group in Scottsdale. Great smoothies and tasty ice teas.  Dining alone? No problem... Tony provides tons of reading material (magazines, current news papers, etc) for you to pass the time.  Only downfall is the prices are just a bit high for counter-service-strip-mall-dining. But what's a buck or two extra when you're eating healthy.
