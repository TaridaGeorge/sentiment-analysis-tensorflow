I'm sorry, Total Wine & More, but you will forever live in my heart as Liquor World, the name that you were born with.  Like so many of us, you grew bigger and older and wanted to sound more sophisticated, so you changed your name and moved across the country.

Those of us who can say we "knew you when" (their first store was near my hometown) maintain that you are still the best damn place on earth to recreate that scene from "Leaving Las Vegas" where Nicholas Cage fills a grocery cart  with booze.

Or to pick out the perfect bottle of wine to accompany a dinner...

Or to find that crazy flavored vodka that no one else carries...

Or to buy a sampler of single beers from all over the world.

Total Wine & More, you are the total package, my old friend.
