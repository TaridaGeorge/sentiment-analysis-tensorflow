This place had some seriously amazing Louisiana style sea food dishes.  Too bad i showed up off-season for craw fish, but other than that, it was total class.  
They seated me and my friend in the corner but we end up having a great view of the place, and seemed a bit more intimate that way. This also gave us a great view of the outside seating area to people watch as well.
The food itself was very rich and delicious.  I don't remember the name of the dish but it featured baked oysters.  Every bite was delicious.
I am definitely coming back there if I am looking for a nice seat down in the West Valley.
