This is one of my all time favorite places to go! I have been to several Roy's here and in Las Vegas. I have never been disappointed in the service, atmosphere or the food. 

This particular visit we had reservations for 8:30 and part of our group did not even arrive at our house until 9:00. The staff was very accommodating with the shift of our arrival time. 

The food is to die for. I have enjoyed everything I have ordered. My favorites are the lobster pot stickers, calamari, and the chocolate souffle. 

Roy's has their own cookbook and I would highly recommend purchasing it. Most of the recipes are relatively easy to make. 

This is a great place to go for special events. We have been with small groups and large. The service is always spectacular!!!!!!
