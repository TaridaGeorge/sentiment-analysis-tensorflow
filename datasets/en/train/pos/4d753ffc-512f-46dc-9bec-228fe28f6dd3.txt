Yup, still love this place.  I've been to four other fro-yo places since then, and they pale in comparison.  Mojo's is great because they have good customer service, fresh and plentiful toppings, and quality frozen yogurt.  I got the new flavor of pomegranate, root beer, and  passion fruit today with  kiwi and fruity pebbles.  It was the best $5 that I spent!  I just love that everything is fresh and you always see the staff cutting up fresh fruit.  I think that this location is nicer than the City North spot in regards to staff and selection.
