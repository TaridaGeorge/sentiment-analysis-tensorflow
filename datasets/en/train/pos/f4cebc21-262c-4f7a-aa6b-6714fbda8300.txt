Work keeps me on the road, and it took experiencing a lot of Starbuckses to appreciate just how awesome my local one is. This location has great staff, plenty of tables, and just the right vibe. Like Calie mentioned in her review, even the other patrons are great.

I can get a consistent cup of coffee at any location, but if I'm not running out the door with my joe, this is the Starbucks I want to be at.
