Went to Roaring Fork for happy hour with three of my gal pals.  Darrell was our server.  Very professional and competent and friendly.  Had a few of the happy hour menu items.  All were good.  I had previously taken clients there for dinner.  Fabulous dinner and service so definitely wanted to try the HH.   Definitely a place I'd go back, and I'm sure my friends felt the same.
