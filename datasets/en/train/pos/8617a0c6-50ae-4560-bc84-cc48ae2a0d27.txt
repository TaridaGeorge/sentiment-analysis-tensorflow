Yum!  Despite enduring the inevitable pasty v. pastee conversations (with my own party as well as the one that sat next to us), I have nothing but kind words for Cornish Pasty Co.  

My Pepper Steak Pasty was delicious with Stilton blue cheese, zucchini, leeks, and big chunks of steak.  All of my favorite flavors in a nice, cute little package!  Boddington's on tap! 

Please, tell me, when are you coming to San Francisco?
