LOL I must have been in a food euphoria when I wrote this as I referred to my "husband" whom I was already separated from and divorcing ... weird.

In any event, I've been back several times since and am addicted to their amazing baked spaghetti with meat sauce.  Always take 1/2 home but it is soooooo fantastic especially with their garlic "bread" which is basically pizza crust.  I love this place!
