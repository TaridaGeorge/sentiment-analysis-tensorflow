WOWOWOWOWOW!!! We sat on the patio at 9pm for just desserts. Sweeping views of the city and surrounds. A perfectly romantic getaway and the grounds are so breathtaking. The only thing I'd say is that it's overpriced, but then again what isn't these days?(and now I sound like my grandma)....this is what yelp has done to me.
