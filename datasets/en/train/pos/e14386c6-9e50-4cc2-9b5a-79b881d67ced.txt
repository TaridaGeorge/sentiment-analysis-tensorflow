Yes, this place deserves all the starts. Quality service, quality food and quality atmosphere. When I can walk into a restaurant, sit down and not have to wait long for my food, then I'm impressed.

The night I was there it was quite busy but everything ran like a well oiled machine. And it was friendly service to boot.

I know Japanese so I was talking to the sushi chefs about the restaurant, etc. As I was eating, they kept pulling out new Yellowtail, since they kept moving through orders. Amazingly fresh!!!

They have ALL the important Japanese standards: Ramen, Soba, Donburi as well as tons of fresh fish and amazing roll creations.

Wonderful example of a true Japanese-owned business. Great Job!!
