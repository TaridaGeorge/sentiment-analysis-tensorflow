If you are from the east coast and miss getting real bread here in the desert, then this place is for you!  Their sandwiches are the very best, all wonderful ingredients.  Fresh, delicious.  And they have awesome pastas, salads and soups to die for too.  The Roast Beef and Gorgonzola sandwich is a favorite.  Get the homemade potato chip mix with your sandwich...yum!  Very busy at lunch - be warned, and a little pricey, but worth it!
