We eat here often and love it every time.  The food is delicious, affordable and healthy, however, the menu is extensive enough to please anyone.  The service is welcoming, friendly and very accommodating.  Any special request is met with a smile and an eagerness to please.  If you ask for Bai, (Bailey), you are sure to have a totally delightful experience.
