Oh Charles David, how I love thee.  Let me count the ways.

I love thee for shoes that feel like butter on my feet.
I love thee for classic styles that you always have in stock.
I love thee for trendy styles that are still tasteful.
I love thee for being able to fulfill all my shoe needs.

I'm elated that I finally live near a CD store...my husband, not so much.  There are really three sections to the store- one side has evening shoes and classic styles, one side has current trend shoes, and the back has clearance.
