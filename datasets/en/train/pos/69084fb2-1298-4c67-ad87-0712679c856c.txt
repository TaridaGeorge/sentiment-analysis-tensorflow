I survived the floods in So Cal by going on vacation to sunny Phoenix. Weather was pleasant 65 to 70 degrees. 

I booked the stay a couple of months ago at the Marriott Canyon Villas for seven nights but we took complete advantage of the JW Marriott Hotel amenities. 

The hotel offers a great spa with it's own fitness center and pool, played the Faldo Golf course which was top notch, ate at Meritage Steakhouse, Vista Lounge sushi, Ristorante Tuscany and Roy's. 

The lobby was beautifully decorated for the holidays and they had a huge Willie Wonka chocolate - ginger bread house constructed by the 2009 national pastry champions. 

I'll definitely be back here again in the future!
