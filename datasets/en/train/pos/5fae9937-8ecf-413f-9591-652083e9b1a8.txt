I have used Ray's Feed for our regular feed deliveries for a few years now.  Not only are they fast and friendly, but they are so EASY to work with.  I just make one call and that's all.  The truck (with handsome young delivery men ;) show up same day making my horses and my daughter, very happy.  I LOVE everyone at Ray's Feed.
