Holler out to the Eisenbergs who insisted that I try this place.  The baked chicken wings are splendid as are the chips with three dips.  It 's hard to not be shaken by the shaken lemonade. Equally hard is to know that Sangria was ever made with anything other than white wine but this one is fantasticaly representing the fact that the place is built in the middle of an orange grove.  Try the avocado pizza with the prosciutto, the Rocket Man, the Fallen Agnel, and the Gladiator! You'll not go wrong.
