I wanted to be conservative on giving 5-Star reviews out and wanted to save them for extravagant restaurants and experiences, but Pink Spot just strikes the right chord for a friendly and creative neighborhood Ice Cream shop. It has that real "local" feel that so many of us love so much as well as some amazing ice cream from a local creamery. So the ice cream isn't that same stuff you have had over and over. Even the classic flavors have a new little dance to them. oh...and they had LOBSTER ice cream this week!!! If I wasn't allergic, I would have been all over it! 
What I did have was their version of Mint Chocolate Chip and Cheesecake ice creams and a delightful little relaxation session on their comfy couch! Great little place.
