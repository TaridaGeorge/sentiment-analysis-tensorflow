First visit tonight with a favorite dining companion, and we had great fun. It's in a chic, comfortable space made more so by a relaxed, adult vibe with a play list to match. The second we arrived, we started making lists of people we wanted to bring. 

Even though we were only able to try three items between us -- there's lots more to investigate -- what we had was excellent and, since it's tapas, nicely timed. In the end, there was green tea cheesecake. 

As at his previous establishments, Mr. Chu is a perfect host and the service is the best kind of casual.
