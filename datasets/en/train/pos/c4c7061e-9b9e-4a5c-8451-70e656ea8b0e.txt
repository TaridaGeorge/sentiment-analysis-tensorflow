What an exciting time.  I am writing my first YELP review about the wonderful MOJO Yogurt  I visited yesterday afternoon.   There were so many wonderful flavors to choose from and the people there were nice enough to pass out tiny little sample cups.  It was a challenge narrowing down my selections to a few flavors but I somehow managed.  I ended up with Birthday Cake (that's right, there is Birthday Cake flavored yogurt, life IS good), Cafe Latte, and the divine Original Tart.  After throwing on a few gummy bears I was a happy girl.  I see in other reviews that some complained about pricing but I am willing to pay a little extra for quality and happiness.
