I have ordered catering from here several times for my firm's weekly luncheons and Bertha's is always a hit!! 

- Their food is always fresh and delish.
- I like that their menu is "different" (in a good way) from other plain ol' sandwich places like Subway or Pugzies or Paradise - they have some unique choices!
- They have really good prices for catering - you get great quality food without breaking the bank. 
- The pasta salad is the best I have ever had.
