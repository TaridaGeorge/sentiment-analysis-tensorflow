went to delux for a date today and had the best time, the environment was great, the service quick and helpful, and as always the food was the best in town,

we ordered a burger and sweet potato fries with a flight of beers and it was the perfect meal to hold me over until dinner. Perfect place for an intimate date or a lunch meeting (seats both accommodations perfectly)
