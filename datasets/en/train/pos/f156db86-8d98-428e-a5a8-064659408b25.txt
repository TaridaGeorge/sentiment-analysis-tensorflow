I love second hand places like this.  Its hard to find a good local shop that carries a great variety of furniture.  Im always on the hunt for stuff, weather its a lamp or something else good for the apartment.

I really liked the variety that they had here.  Lamps, couches, bedroom furniture, paintings, and a bunch of other stuff.  Great variety. I actually got to meet the owners, who helped me look around when I got in.  They are super nice people, and run a great store.  I really recommend stopping in and checking this place out!
