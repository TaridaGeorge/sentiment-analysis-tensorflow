I love this place! I have tried Boba Tea House and while it's ok I think the Street is better. Their smoothies and milk teas are... smoother and creamier? haha. 

Anyway, I consider myself a regular here. I LOVE the taro milk tea smoothie. I recently discovered I'm lactose intolerant and ordering the taro milk tea with soy milk is just as delicious! promise. Other yummy flavors: avocado (I SWEAR), coconut, almond. Their lychee tea is bomb. Also the fruit smoothies are absolutely amazing and I usually get blueberry, strawberry, pineapple since you can combine up to three flavors.
