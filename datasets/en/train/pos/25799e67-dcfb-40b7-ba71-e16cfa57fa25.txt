This place is absolutely heaven in my mouth.  Everything I've tried is delicious!  The chicken is some of the best marinated chicken I've ever had; I never liked tzatziki before I had it here (their's is the best!); their fries are deliciously seasoned...mmmm, just talking about it makes my mouth water.  The staff is always friendly and the food is always fresh.  My husband and I eat here on a regular basis and have never been disappointed.  Way to go, Chicago Gyros!  I love your food.
