Tammie Coe... Will you marry my chocolate addiction??? WOW is all I can say about the "Milk chocolate and hazelnut cake" it is truly a chocolate lovers paradise on a chocolate island full of love. 

From the first bite, to the last, I was just wanting more.

 I'm not into frivolous girlie looking things. This cake is VERY decorated. When I first saw it, I thought to my self, oh sweet baby, what has my family gotten me into here, and where is MY dessert??? UNTIL I saw it being cut, and some chocolatey goodness came out with the cake, I thought to myself, lets wait and see what this thing is all about. Well... IT WAS AMAZING! I WANT MOREEEEEEEE. 

LOVED IT!!
