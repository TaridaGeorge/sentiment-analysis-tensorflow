First trip out to AZ! Got a groupon deal for 3 nights! Really nice place in Scottsdale, didn't know it was a timeshare at first! Staff super nice, concierge really helpful! I had a really fun time exploring scottsdale and phoenix! Would love to stay here again! We stayed in the one bedroom suite complete with a kitchen! Pool was undergoing renovations but we went to wet n wild anyway!
