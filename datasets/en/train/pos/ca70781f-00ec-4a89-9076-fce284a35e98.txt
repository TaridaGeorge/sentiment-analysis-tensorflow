John Normandin was awesome! All of my friends bailed on me, so I had no choice but to hire a mover the night before our move. John was so flexible and prompt. He even gave us a wake-up call in the morning so we'd be ready. There was an issue with my fridge and the water source, but John handled the situation perfectly and everything got moved faster than I expected. He even moved my piano! Every other mover charges extra for that! I would definitely recommend John and Rent-A-Friend Labor Services AND I will hire them the next time I move. Don't waste your time waiting for your friends to show up, just Rent-A-Friend!
