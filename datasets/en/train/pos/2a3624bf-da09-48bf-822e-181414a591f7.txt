Wow! The absolute best place in town to take your wife. Excellent food and incredible service. I have never been to a restaurant with such great ambiance. The property that this restaurant sits on is absolutely incredible. We had an amazing 5 course dinner by candlelight in their old farmhouse restaurant. From the suited host to the delectable dessert, everything was absolutely, positively first class. We felt like royalty.
