Oh. My. Gawd. I am so fortunate to live just up the hill from this place...YUM! We heard rave reviews about Los Reyes and couldn't wait to try it. It far exceeded all of our expectations! Everything was spot on...friendly staff, good fast service, huge portions of delicious food, and very reasonable prices. I had the shrimp taco plate and my friends had the Norteno Pollo and Mexicana tortas. Wow, it was nearly orgasmic! The aguas frescas are delicious as well! Good job guys, I wish you much success you certainly deserve it!

pt. 2...5th visit and took my son this time. he got the carne asada torta & i had the chicken tacos. yummmmmo! couldn't even finish our plates it was so much food - ate the rest for dinner lol. drop whatever you're doing and go eat here NOW!
