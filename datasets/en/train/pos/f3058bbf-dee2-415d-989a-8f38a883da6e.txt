Last night, my wife and I were exhausted and hungry and needed a good break.  The Yardhouse offered that.  The customer service was superb, but not clingy and the food was spectacular.  The LARGE tap beer selection is, in a word, phenomenal.  If you want a quiet night of dining, or a sports bar environment, you can get both in this place, and not feel detrracted from either desire.  5 stars for service, quality of food, and atmosphere.  Definitely recommend to anyone.  We'll be going back whenever we're in Phoenix/Glendale again.
