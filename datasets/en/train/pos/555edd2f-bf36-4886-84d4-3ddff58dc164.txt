Amazing food, amazing service, amazing atmosphere.  Had the squab and foie gras for an appetizer and the braised lamb shank for my entree.  My significant other had the scallops over risotto. The wine selection is great and all of the food was to die for.  Our server was friendly, prompt, and was great at making recommendations.  I would absolutely come back here again.
