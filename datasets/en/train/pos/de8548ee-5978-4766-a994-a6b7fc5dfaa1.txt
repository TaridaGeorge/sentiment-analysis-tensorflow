Stopped in this week with my son for dinner and used the Yelp 10% discount offer.  Prices were reasonable even without the discount, but it did give me incentive to drive a little further than I usually would for dinner.   OH WHO AM I KIDDING, I was going to try this place anyways.  I love BBQ, and Bobby Q's does it right!

My son found the sausage to be too spicy, but they did warn us when he ordered, so he ended up eating my meal and I took his.  Really good stuff all around...BBQ beans were good, the cornbread was awesome and didn't fally to pieces like it did at Thee Pitts Again, and service was spot on.  

Definitely worth a return trip!
