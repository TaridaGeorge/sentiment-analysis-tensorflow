I've lived in Tokyo for 4 years and go back regularly for work and always enjoy the food, especially sushi.  I find it very hard to find comparable style food Stateside, but will say that Shinbay is just that.  The chef is from Japan and the food is absolutely phenomenal.  We had the chef recommendations and everything was fabulous (keep in mind that I have a taste for Asian foods).  Great sake menu to boot.  Highly recommended if you have the wallet for it.
