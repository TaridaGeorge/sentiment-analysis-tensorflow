What a marvelous concept! Waffles and hot dogs coming together as one! We tried the waffle dog and the sausage in a waffle and really enjoyed them both. The sausage one was particularly good covered in syrup - like having a little bit of breakfast in the afternoon. Next time I plan to try the smores waffle.
