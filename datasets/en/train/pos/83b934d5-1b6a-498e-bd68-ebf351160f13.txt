This is one of my favorite lunch places.  I keep having my favorites over and over again, need to branch out a bit more.  I love love love their sweet potatoe salad, but I do find that sometimes it's better than other times.  Last time I had it it was a bit on the salty side...still I ate every last bit.  My favorites are the italian pressed sandwich and their caprese sandwich.  Their bread is amazing.   Never had breakfast there.  I admit I am a bit addicted to this place...
