We laughed, we cried , we screamed and cheered! Yes we were at the Phoenix Mercury Game and they are simply amazing.  thanks to our" fairy godfather"??  We got some nifty tickets. Loved to see fast plays , fabulous baskets throws, and the antics of the arena. Put on some fun music , throw out some tshirts and we are rocking! Now here is the icing on the cake ..my daughter loved it as well..she was totally caught up in the suspense of the game and the turnovers. She decided she had favorites and she took tons of pictures to document new  new favorite team!  We can't  wait to go back !!  Way to inspire  ..go Mercury ..
