I give it 5 out of 5 just because its a oriental/chinese restruant and the cooks are chinese!!!! YES!!! lol not like panda express.

Anyways Got the Miso Ramen and I ordered taro boba for desert. Miso ramen was what I ordered. Wish there was more veggies kind of like when you get Pho. Noodles were good thought, broth needs a little more flavor but I can somewhat understand why most places go on the bland side. Helps people who like the low sodium stuffs thats why there's soy sauce and salt.

Comparing Miso Ramen from here and Republic Ramen: Noodles and broth are similar maybe more flavor at Repuplic. And more veggies and meat size at republic. + For Ikitchen for fish cake and eggs where repulic didn't have.
