Their Happy Hour and Sunday prices are great.  I've had a few items off their menu and have really enjoyed everything I've tried.  They pour a great Guiness and that's one of the key components of a good pub (in my opinion).  If you like pubs and work in North Scottsdale then try it for HH sometime.
