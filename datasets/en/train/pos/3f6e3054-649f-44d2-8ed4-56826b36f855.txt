Great place to grab a quick lunch! Mama Mia's prepares good old fashion thin crust style pizza and the slices are huge!  They have a wide variety of toppings and you can have different toppings on each slice.  My favorite combo is 1 ham and pineapple, 1 pepperoni.  They also offer salads, subs and calzones (expect an extra wait).  There is also the original Mama Mia's at 40th St and Indian School. Special: 2 slices (cheese) and a can of soda- $4 even, (Add. toppings 25 cents). Their subs are also excellent!
