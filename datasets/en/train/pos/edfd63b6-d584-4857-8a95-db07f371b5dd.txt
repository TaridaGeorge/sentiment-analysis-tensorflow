Previously wrote a review on Healthy Outlook but wanted to acknowledge Dr. Cohen and her ability to ensure that every visit would be taking in with care and provided the highest service. Her knowledge, patience and ability to make us feel comfortable far surpasses any family doctor I have seen in the Phoenix area. Just spend 15 minutes with her and you'll never want to see another doctor again!
