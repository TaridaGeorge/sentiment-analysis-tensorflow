My first venture into the new fro yo generation.  Love the many flavors & my allergic-to-everything toddler gets dairy free plus fruit. The chain with organic fruit will get my loyalty.  Mojo a little pricier than others, if closer to home.  BUT on Tuesdays, sign up on FB for the secret word and get 50% off!

UPDATE to 5 STARS. I miss Mojo so bad. And they had good prices! I am paying 2- damn- fifty for a freakin' soft serve cone from a truck, and 5 bucks for a froyo cone in NY. Go to Mojo. And be grateful.
