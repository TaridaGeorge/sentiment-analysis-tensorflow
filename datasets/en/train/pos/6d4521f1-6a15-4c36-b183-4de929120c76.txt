Awesome Sandwiches!! When we lived in Vegas we used to eat here  2- 3x a week. Then we moved to Salt Lake City, Utah and they don't have one here which stinks.  We have been visiting Phoenix often and we were so excited to see that Capriottis is just 10 minutes away. We eat here at least once a week when we visit.
