I fell in love with Indian food after going to this place.  I go there on all my "special occasions".  Birthdays, holidays, & last year I even went for valentines day.  The food there is so unique & good.  I end up getting 3 different meals just so I can keep trying new dishes.  The tandoori chicken is my favorite dish.  They also have this mango drink that is amazing! I have to have one every time I go.  Such a yummy place to eat!  Gosh even writing this review makes me want to go again. It doesn't get much better if you're looking for good food.
