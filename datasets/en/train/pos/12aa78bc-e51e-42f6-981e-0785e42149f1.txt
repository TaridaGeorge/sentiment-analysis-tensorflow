i'm starving, so i'm going to write a review for the place i'd like to go to lunch to today.

they have the most delicious bagel sandwiches anywhere! i think it has something to do with my new obsession with mustard - here you have three choices, which they apply liberally .

There never seems to be anyone in line (except in the morning hours) so i can order and sit down or be back at the office in no time. they have booths, tables and outside patio tables.

 $7 for sandwich, chips and a drink, and it kicks subway or sub factory's ass. 

damn i'm hungry.
