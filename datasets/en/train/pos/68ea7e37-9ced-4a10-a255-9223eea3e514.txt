I've been seeing Dr. Brodkin for 4 years.  She is friendly, professional and very kind.  She always takes the time to answer all my questions.  She even calls me herself with lab results and never acts rushed.   I had a miscarriage and had difficulty conceiving again, so she referred me to fertility doctor.  She was very caring through this difficult time in my life.  I was never able to conceive again, and when all was done, I went back in to see her, she didn't shy away from telling me how sorry she was for my situation.  She was very compassionate.  I will always love her for that. She is the best!
