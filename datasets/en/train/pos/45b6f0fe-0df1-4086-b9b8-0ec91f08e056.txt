I've been going to Bella Luna for 5 years and the place just keeps getting better!. The food has always been consistantly good and the service is top notch. I love having a mom and pop restaurant  that can out do the chains and overpriced Scottsdale joints right here in Goodyear. No matter what state, city or even country I travel to, I'm always disappointed when I try another Italian ristorante. Bella Luna has set the bar too high!
