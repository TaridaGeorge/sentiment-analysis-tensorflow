I love that the menu is small and limited; it's not hard to choose. I had the lamb sandwich and it was the best lamb I have ever tasted! I loved everything about it... the cheese complimented the meat to perfection. And what can I say about the wine list... excellent. Meat and wine... the keys to my heart.

I will definitely be back... again and again.
