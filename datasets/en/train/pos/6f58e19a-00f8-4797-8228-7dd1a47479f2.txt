My favorite sushi place in town.  We always get the spicy tuna and the crunchy california.  

I've never had a bad roll at this place.  The wait staff has never left us waiting for attention - they are all sweethearts.  Everything is priced nicely and they have specials up on the board.  

Hiro, the owner, is from Japan and is typically working on the bar - they seem to be having a good time back there, rolling up a storm.

I'd recommend reservations for groups of 4 or more.  The place is small and often frequented by Japanese, which has to be a good sign.  

Big beers, wine and saki are there to wash it all down.  The green iced tea is recommended as well.
