I made reservations for a group of 21 based on the Yelp reviews.  The service and follow up was great, we changed the time and the number of people a few times but Kelly always handled it very well.  We ordered off the full menu, had many appetizers to start, full dinners, desserts and drinks.  The service was great and so was the food - everyone seemed very pleased with the selection (some vegetarians) and timing of the meals - sometimes in a large group the food doesn't come out together but this wasn't an issue.  It is always hard to plan a dinner in a city you are not familiar with, but I would recommend The Keg to anyone in the area or anyone planning to visit Tempe.
