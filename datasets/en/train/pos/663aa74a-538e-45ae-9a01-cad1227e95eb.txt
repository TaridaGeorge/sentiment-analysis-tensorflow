I grew up in AZ and still have family there so every trip home going to Pappadeaux's is a MUST!  They have the greatest food and a huge selection even for those who don't like seafood.  They have great Oysters and Jose the oyster shucker is the best!  The staff there is always warm and inviting and even when you have to wait on weekends they have a great live band out on the patio.  It's always packed so I would recommend reservations.  I usually get the steamed muscles and the cedar block salmon which is sooo yummy it's served with asparagus that is the best I have ever had in a restaurant.  If you are going to Phoenix or live there, this place is a MUST!
