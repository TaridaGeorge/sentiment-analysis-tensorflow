I won't go anywhere else for breakfast when I'm in Tempe.  Decent prices, and some of the best service you can ask for.  I'm no regular and this place is filled with them, but the servers take time to make you feel like you come there everyday.  

I tend to judge breakfast joints by there their eggs benedict and Harlows has the second best I have ever had.  The hollandaise sauce is thick and lemony and eggs done as perfect as can be.  Had to have a side of bacon to wash it down.    

This place fills up quick from the time they open their doors so go early for parking.
