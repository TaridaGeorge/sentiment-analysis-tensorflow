THE MUSIC IS LOUD!! Which is freaking awesome. The only time I have ever been here was for the Armin Van Buuren concert. And when you go to see one of the best DJs in the world playing Trance music, you want the music loud!

It was small, dark, and with 300+ people inside the place was packed so you could barely move. Appropriate for the concert and type of music playing. I can't comment on the place for an average night, but given the right event, you could have an awesome time here.

It's worth checking out and seeing if its your type of place in the Scottsdale Nightlife circuit.
