A group of students walked over here after class and we split 3 pizzas, spending less than $5 each for about 3 slices each I think.

I just needed to update that I am not a fan of most veggie pizzas, but the veggie pizza here was so great & filling, I actually didn't miss the meat!  The mushrooms & tomatoes were great...actually, now that I think about it, the lack of green veggies but the variety of others was what made this pizza so awesome.

As always, the staff rocks.
