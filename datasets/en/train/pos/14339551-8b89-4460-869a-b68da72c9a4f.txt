I really like this museum a lot.

It's very accessible, both physically (light rail just yards away) and artistically,
is spacious and enjoyably laid out - though I wish they'd built more UP instead of wasting so much land,
have a really nice courtyard,
a great event space,
friendly staff, and
fascinating & fun events.

Summary:
I'm very glad to be a member here and will be renewing it next year :)
