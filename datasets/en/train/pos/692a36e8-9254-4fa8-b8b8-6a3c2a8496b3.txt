I don't shop at AJ's for weekly groceries (too pricey), but I love coming to AJ's. It is so cozy and fresh. I head here with my family (I don't drink, they do) to pick up a bottle of wine, stop in to grab unique flowers for the house or pick up a specialty item. Also, I've become an obsessed regular to AJ's grill. It is outside and you can grab a quick bite while enjoying the neighborhood feel. I just love to stop in - it gives me a happy feeling.
