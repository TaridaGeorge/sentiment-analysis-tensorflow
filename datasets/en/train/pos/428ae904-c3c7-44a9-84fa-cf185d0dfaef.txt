This place reminds me of my black Southern heritage...all the down-home cooking, the friendly owner and cooks...it all makes me remember my grandmother's cooking(of course, I can remember that whenever I go to visit her, but Restaurant 28 is a bit closer to home than the 40 minute drive to downtown Phoenix haha!)...

anyway, I've discovered my perfect meal from their menu: George's catfish(blackened and seasoned to perfection and so tender and greasy!) with hush puppies or crispy-moist fried okra and the INCREDIBLE sausage casserole...it all comes with a dinner roll and I always order a slice of the pecan pie for dessert...

this place will leave you full and HAPPY!
