TRICK OR TREAT. Get drunk and go to the museum. They won't kick you out if you get in before the doors lock. I have to agree wif everyone else that the tours are spectacular.The place is great to bring out of town visitors for a real dry taste of the desert. The operators of the museum are smarty pants sometimes, though. etc.
