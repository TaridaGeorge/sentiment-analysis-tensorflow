It's not much to look at from the outside. Which is why I think I passed by this place many times on my lunch break and opted for the subway next door instead. But after repeated recommendations from a friend, I decided to try it and have been back at least once a week ever since. The inside is really nice and the owners and staff are realy cool.

The veggie spring rolls are yumtown!
The mango chicken is amazing.
My coworker who I drag along with me is obsessed with the pho.
Everything I've had so far is amazing.
