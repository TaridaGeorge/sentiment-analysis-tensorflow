I love Gordon Biersch.  Biersch Biersch, Biersch, down into my belly.

I enjoy their beer.  I enjoy their food, and I enjoy their atmosphere.  I have been going to this Biersch location for about 2.5 years and I love it.  Awesome happy hour prices and amazing staff that is always helpful and fun.

People who complain about the prices need to utilize the happy hour prices which are available daily.  Even not on happy hour, their beers are only $4.  I've had more expensive beers elsewhere.
