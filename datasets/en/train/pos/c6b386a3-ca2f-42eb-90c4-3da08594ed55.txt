This is the best burger shop in the central Phoenix area. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu, and an equal quality burger is unknown anywhere near this place. It's pretty small, and easy to miss if you've never been there, but the ambiance of the laid back atmosphere add to the intoxicating effects of this perfect, inexpensive burger. Kudos to management for the proper business plan for a successful burger joint.
