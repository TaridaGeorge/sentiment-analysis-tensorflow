Yes!  I love neighborhood bars!

A very "you're like family when you come here" kind of place.  I'm here at least once a week.

Between the cheap drinks, great food, christmas lights strung all around the whole outside patio area, the nice and extremely generous bartenders, the very friendly Casey Moore's cats who just walk around and people watch, or just the awesome memories I've had there...this place has all of the ingredients for a good time!
