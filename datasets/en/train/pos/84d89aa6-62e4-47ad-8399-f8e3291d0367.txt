I'm a guy. A guy who likes good sandwiches. These are great sandwiches.  So, if you're a guy (or gal) who like sandwiches then you need to check this place out. Soft bread, quality meats piled high, a garlicky "house dressing" which really brings it all together = the perfect lunch. Top that with friendly people working and you have a hit. You may be tempted to order more sub than just the "shorty" 6 incher but let me assure you that this will put you in the satiation zone and then some. 

Now to spread the word, and my own selfish agenda, to keep places like this growing.
