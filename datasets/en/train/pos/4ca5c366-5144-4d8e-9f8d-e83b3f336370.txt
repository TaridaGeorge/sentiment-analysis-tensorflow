We LOVE pappadeaux and go every time we are close to one.  Never have been disappointed. We started at the bar with a couple happy hour grey goose lemon drops. Coconut shrimp app followed by cedar plank salmon and stuffed shrimp (unbelievably delish!). We also added some king crab legs and a beer and blood orange mojito. Got out for $112 including $20 tip. Service was top notch food was phenomenal, if I had to knock something the crab legs were a little soggy. Server immediately tried to replace them or comp them but I can't waste crab legs so I ate every scrap of them!  Can't wait to go back.
