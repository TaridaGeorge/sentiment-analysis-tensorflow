I bought some filet there tonight and I have to say it was the best I've had in a long time.  It was more expensive that Safeway or Fry's but the quality was the finest.  It was tender and juicy and cut like butter.  The flavor was amazing.  So if you want to splurge and get restaurant quality meet in your home...go to the AJ's butcher...you will be pleased!
