A brownie texture is supposed to be not exactly cake like but a mix of a cake and a soft cookie. This is where fairytale hits the spot, today in the office we had a box of the sample sprites and ........ shamelessly i ate 9 of them. O_O i know fml. The ones that did stand out were walnut, mint chocolate which i didnt like, berry, and CARAMEL.. yummm.

I highly recommend this as a gift to sweettooth lovers... now i must counteract the fat and eat some spinach. FML
