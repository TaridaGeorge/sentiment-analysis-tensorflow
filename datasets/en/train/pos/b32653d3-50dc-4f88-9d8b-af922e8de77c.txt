Fantastic food and even better service. One Friday night, I watched one server handle the entire dining solo. Through it all, he was fast, attentive and pleasant. Can't recommend this place enough.

Also, the TVs usually are tuned to NFL Network or NBA TV, so I get to watch sports (cool!) with my awesome food.
