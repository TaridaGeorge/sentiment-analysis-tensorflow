About as good as it gets for Chinese buffet: Fresh food, dishes that don't make you go "ewwww . . . what the hell is that doing here???", real sushi made fresh, mongolian BBQ, a nice full bar, decor that's modern, sleek and clean combined with friendly and efficient service-- All for less than $10 at lunch. I'm in CentPho but still think it's worth the drive.
