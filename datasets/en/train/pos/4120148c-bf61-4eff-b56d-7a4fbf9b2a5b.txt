LOVE LOVE LOVE ~~~

That's how I feel about this place.

First visit tonight, won't be my last.  What can I say about the Polish plate?  Two halupki and four pierogi all cooked to perfection, enough for two meals although the taste alone makes me want to eat it all now.  My waistline won out this time and the other half is safely tucked away in my fridge awaiting breakfast tomorrow morning.  Reminiscent of my youth growing up in PA, ah I feel homesick  now.
