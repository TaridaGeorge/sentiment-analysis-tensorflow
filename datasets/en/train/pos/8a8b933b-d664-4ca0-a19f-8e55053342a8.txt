When I moved here, I always say this place but didnt know what the heck it was until I said I have to see whats in here, and when I walked in it was like a beam of light from heaven hovering this place.  This place is so bad ass, any type of alcohol from beer to wine they have it all and becoming a member is great to rack up points, so I am always hitting this place up friday after work!
