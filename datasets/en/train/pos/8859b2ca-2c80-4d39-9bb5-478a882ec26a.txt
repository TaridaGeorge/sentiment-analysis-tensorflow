Frances is the type of boutique that you are lucky to find. Those who frequent the shop likely think of it as a haven of amazing gifts, one of a kind jewelry, eccentric home and cooking gear, and everything in between. Truth be told in the year or so that has passed since I discovered Frances I have been 50+ times and have NEVER left without purchasing something. 

If you go on the right day you will find a local artist who has set up shop inside, making their jewelry and selling it on-site. The opportunity to meet the crafter making that necklace you are coveting makes the purchase all the more special. 

From the frequent art fairs and craft markets to the most diverse selection of gifts you can find in the metro area...Frances is and will continue to be my happy place.
