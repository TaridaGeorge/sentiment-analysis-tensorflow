Bring more Pappas restaurants here! Being displaced Houstonians (where Pappa's corporate office is based), we were so happy to see that our new home had a Pappadeaux within driving distance. The food is not as good as it is back home, but much better than anything else Phoenix has to offer. I love it all. The flavored teas/lemonades, sourdough bread, soft butter, seafood, etc.
