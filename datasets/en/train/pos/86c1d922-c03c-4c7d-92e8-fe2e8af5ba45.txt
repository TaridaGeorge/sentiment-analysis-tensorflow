We started to see evidence of termites and found House Doctor here on Yelp.  I contacted them via email and received a call back within 30 minutes.  Dave the owner came by as promised on time and did a very thorough exam.  He explained what was going on, what House Doctor would do and what I could expect.  All was spot on. The guys that did our treatment were on time and very professional.  The price was very fair as well.

I would not hesitate to recommend House Doctor to family or friends.  Really impressed!
