I love Eegees! I wish they had one in Gilbert or nearby. I love all of the flavors of Eegee slushes. Chunks of fresh fruit and very smooth. Their grinders are the best and their fries with bacon and their own ranch is addicting. I crave Eegees and stop there every time I am in Tucson or Casa Grande. Not often enough! By the way....did I say I love Eegees?
