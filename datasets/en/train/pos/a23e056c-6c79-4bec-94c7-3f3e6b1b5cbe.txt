I really enjoyed a happy hour at this joint last week. The bellini was delicious and refreshing. I loved the fish tacos (available in grilled or fried)- I had the grilled and was definitely satisfied. The happy hour lasts until 8pm!
I noticed a few vegetarian options, or other menu options that could be modified. The veggie pot pie is something I will probably try next time, but I'll probably make sure I'm not the DD so I can have another bellini!
The atmosphere is laid back and pleasant- we sat outside. The service was good, the food was good, the price was good. I'll be back soon.
