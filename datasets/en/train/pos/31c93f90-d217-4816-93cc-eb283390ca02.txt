Oooohhhh baby I loooove your way...everyday...yeeeaaaahhh.

I wanna be with you night and day....

Went back to the swizzle last night and fell in love again.

With pool.
With dives.
With football.
With beer.
With diversity.
With the random atrium.
With the jukebox.
With life.

How can you beat pool and beer, combined with an awesome location, a diverse crowd, and a room full of people screaming at the TV because football is on? Then top that with the weird quirkiness that makes me warm and fuzzy on the inside...the atrium, a lovely bathroom and random bumper stickers at the bar. 

The End.
