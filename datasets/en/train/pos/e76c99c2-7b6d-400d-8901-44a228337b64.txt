My husband and I enjoy going there on the weekends for breakfast.  We also take guests when they come to town because it's close to our house and you can get a homestyle breakfast for a decent price!  They have a wide variety of classic breakfast dishes; something for everyone.  This place is by no means fancy or upscale, it's just a mom and pop restaurant with great breakfast.  The servers are always friendly and the owners do a good job with seating people on the weekend when it's busy.
