Looking for a place to dine with friends from California that was not overly expensive but good food was easy. The reviews of this place were great and when we did arrive a couple at another table were cleaning their plates to the last drop. We asked them what they had and they raved about the ravioli and gnocchi.  So that's what we ordered and we were not disappointed! Service was exceptional and food was wonderful. Unfortunately, we did not have dessert since the portions were more than satisfying. Can't wait to try the one on Greenway closer to our home.
