Sunday Brunch woot woot!  Can I get an Amen!  I can't imagine waking up early for Sundays, but pour some sugar on me and let me rock!  I love Mimosas, wonderful company, and good food.  I didn't even know this place existed, but the restaurant gods have parted the seas and as I walked into the valley of PHX - boy what a surprise!  Patio seating is a must - with the large revolving windows and the beaming light shining through; gosh am I in heaven?  Service is A+ since they opened the doors early for us to enter, also thanks for the wonderful service :).  Try the Hangover solution here; fairly priced and I'm sure it works :) - Enjoy!
