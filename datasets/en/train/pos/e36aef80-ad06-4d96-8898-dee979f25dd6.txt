WOW.  That's all that I can say.  I've never been here before despite living reasonably close, and when a friend suggested it I jumped at the chance to try it after the reviews on here.  

I'll be honest and say that I'm not a huge coffee person....well, I am huge (tall), but I stick to energy drinks for the most part (less scarring of my tongue from boiling hot temperatures).

I had a black and white latte here and it was ridiculously delicious.

I'll definitely be back!
