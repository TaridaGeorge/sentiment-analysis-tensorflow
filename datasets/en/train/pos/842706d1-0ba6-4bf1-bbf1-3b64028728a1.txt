We've been to a lot of sushi places in Phoenix and this is now the only one we eat at. The atmosphere is lovely, the service is always excellent and the variety and quality of the sushi is as good as anything we've had. My favorite roll is the Palm Springs Roll, which is made awesome by the large chunks of tuna atop the roll. It's a meal in itself. Plus, if you bring a non-sushi eating friend, you can trick them into eating the very delicious Beef Teriyaki Roll, also a meal in itself.

The happy hour menu includes their crispy tuna, which is a lovely little dish.
