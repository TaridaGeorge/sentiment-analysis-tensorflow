Frank & Albert's is probobly one of my favorite restaurants in town. The menu is creative and the ingredients are very fresh - its just good, unpretentious comfort food made and served in the best way possible. The home-made ketchup and mustard are excellent additions to the delicious onion rings and duck fat fries. The drinks are also innovative.
