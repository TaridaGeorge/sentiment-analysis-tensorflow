I had high expectations going to a Seahawks bar for a Monday Night Football. And it met my expectations. The flatbreads were very good, I had the Tomato Basil and my wife had the Bacon Jalapeno. As a vegetarian I usually find it difficult to find decent bar food. But they did have an above average black bean burger that could be substituted on any burger. 
In addition if you are a Seahawks fan it's the best place to watch the game in the valley.
