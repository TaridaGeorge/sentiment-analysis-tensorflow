This locally-owned coffee/chocolate/pastry/sandwich/soup shop is a wonderful little jewel tucked away with several businesses on the East side of 51st Avenue just north of Thunderbird. I was so lucky to run across it a month ago! I rushed over to welcome them, and found to my delight that not only was everything scrumptious, but the owners are kind, down-to-earth folks (who happen to be a killer chef and a chocolate wizardess) who are committed to sourcing their ingredients locally. My family and co-workers are slowly working our way through their offerings and absolutely everything is outstanding.
I hope you get a chance to try Rayner's soon - you won't be sorry!
BTW ASU students - they offer a Student Discount - sweet!
