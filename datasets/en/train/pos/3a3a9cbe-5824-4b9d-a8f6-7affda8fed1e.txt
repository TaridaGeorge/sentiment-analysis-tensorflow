This is the best record store I have ever been to. The staff knows so much about so many different types of music and they are always willing to help you find what you need. If you tell the staff what style of music you are looking for they will help you find tons of options,and then other options that you would probably want after you listened to whatever you buy.  I am not a DIY music consumer so i depend on this place for ideas on how to grow my library. These people care about music and it always really shows.
