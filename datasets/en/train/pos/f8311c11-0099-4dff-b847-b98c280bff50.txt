The least painful part of my wedding was the visit to Janet.  I bought my wedding dress on final clearance, only problem was it was 2 sizes too small.  Not a big deal since I wanted a corset back added anyway, I was mostly stressed about the cost of redoing it.  Janet made it not only a painless experience she was wonderful and kind and I actually enjoyed my fittings.  I ended up with the dress I dreamed of for about $700 (cost of dress and alterations) not bad for a semi custom dressed or for even just the original dress which held an original retail price of north of $2000! 

I have and will continue to send everyone I know to Janet Kirkman.  She is amazing!
