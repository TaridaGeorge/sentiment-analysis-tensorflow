I loved my visit to Logan's Roadhouse. I go there once every 5 weeks or so. At first, I tried the steaks and chicken tenders but I have settled on a regular order of the Fried Chicken Salad. Their servers are friendly and I often end up having little chats with them because they are so approachable and accommodating. The desserts are very cute as well (I love the little buckets) and the birthday "YEE-HAW"'s are fun to witness. I will definitely continue my visits.
