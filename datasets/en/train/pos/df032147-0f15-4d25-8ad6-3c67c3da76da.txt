Met with a few friends here and had a couple of beers here, but the ambiance was so great for a Sunday afternoon.  I think  I would call it an urbanscape.  Where trees meet sky at twilight and there is a an outdoor fire crackling behind sterile glass in the center of this shady outdoor lounge.  Clienele look like a Ralph Lauren commercial...which isn't the restaurants fault, but we all like beaultiful things....  

I can tell it get busier at night, but I can tell I prefer this place on a mellow Sunday afternoon.  

Great concept!
