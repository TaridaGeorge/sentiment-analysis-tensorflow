As most people have said, the wait is long. If you have the time and you're not too hungry, it's worth it. I think that breakfast joints on the weekends tend to be busy, anyway, so I, as impatient as I am, expect a line. Oh, and having the $ is good, too, since their breakfast is slightly more expensive than most. 

The omelets are huge (what is that, like 6 eggs?!), and it's nice that they have a huge selection of ingredients to make your own combo. But the Eggs Benedict selection--that's where it's at. Seriously, folks...they have Eggs Benedict with filet mignon. Drool.
