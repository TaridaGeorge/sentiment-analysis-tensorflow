The place is small, great for a quick lunch and feels like you're in the city (decoration/mood). 
I've had the Oggie and the Royale. It has enough vegetarian choices, too. I like the Veggie Greek. My favorite is the Greek salad!! That dressing! I want the recipe. 

The service is always good and the drinks as well.

The Mesa location, just wasn't the same. But it has a patio and it's bigger.
