I came across this restaurant via Yelp.  It's a good restaurant with great food, if you like interesting, sometimes spicy, different food well made.

Here's the warning, though:  it's not the place for that special, romantic date.  The ambience is low rent, but that should not stop you from visiting.

The menu is varied, and the variety goes from Afghan food to Indian / Pakistani food, to good old American grub.  We tried some of the first 2 and were very pleased.

Some have said that the service is slow.  To protect ourselves (and we did not make it up) we told the waiter that we had to make a plane, and our service was prompt.

We're sure to return next time we're in Phoenix.
