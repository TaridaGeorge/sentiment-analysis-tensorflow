Love this place for the food and the price. It is good for beginners to experience sushi for the first time. I go during the hours that the huge crowds don't gather but sometimes I have to wait longer for the good sushi to come onto the conveyor belt. Coming in as a single person I usually get seated within 10mins with a crowd. The selection is pretty good and when your done there is a good stack of dished in front of you without the high price. I am not scared to keep grabbing more plates.
