Hands down...the BEST 99 cent store I have ever been to.

They sell Plantains! What??? Where they do that at? LOL...Right there in snotty Scottsdale! I love it.

This 99cent spot has everything...literally...clothing too.

I would come back again and again.

They even have organic food! I love it!!!
