This is such a great thing to have in surprise. My wife and I had never really played any racquet sports before moving to surprise. We immediately picked up racquetball as it's really one of the only good sports to do in the summer due to the heat. We are just starting to pick up tennis, but I can say with certainty that there is no way we would have gotten as involved if this place wasn't so close to our home. I'd give it 6 stars if I could.
