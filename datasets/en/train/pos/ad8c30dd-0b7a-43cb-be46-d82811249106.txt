I love this pizza! I don't know what "Jerry Q" has been eating or who he has been talking to, but this place is the best around! The owner is always friendly and the food is excellent. I have had the privilege of dining on Manhattan pizza several times and this is as close as it gets out here! This is definitely a paralell to the other pizza place I reviewed in Goodyear. Yum!!
