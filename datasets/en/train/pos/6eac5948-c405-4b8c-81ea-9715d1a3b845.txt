I first learned of Ganem Jewelers in the mid eighties and was amazed at the quality of personal service and professionalism.  While they do get busy at certain hours, the staff is always friendly and courteous.  They actually take the time to deal with petty issues that most jewelry stores will not deal with and they do it with a smile.  It is the only jewelry store that I do business with because of a long history of trustworthy service.
