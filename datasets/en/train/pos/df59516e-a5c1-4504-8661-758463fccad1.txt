This was my first vegan/vegetarian restaurant experience. I had the Pad Thai noodles with tofu. I am not a fan of tofu, the texture never seems to be firm enough. However, I found myself uttering the most amazing sentence, "I'm so full but I MUST eat this last piece of tofu."  Yep, it was that good. Unless you must have meat, you should give this place a try.  Oh, and the Jasmine tea (iced or hot) was good as well.
