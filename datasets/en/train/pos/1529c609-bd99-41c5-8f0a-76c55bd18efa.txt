Went back again and surprisingly they recognized us, how awesome is that!?. We ordered the Howie Burger with fries and let me tell you...any Midwesterner will reminisce of a BBQ flavored Jay's potato chip when they eat the fries which when dipped in ketchup becomes this Cajun spiced goodness that took me by surprise. We also ordered the Rib eye taco platter, the kale salad had a medley of flavors and was very good and the meals once again were surprisingly great.
