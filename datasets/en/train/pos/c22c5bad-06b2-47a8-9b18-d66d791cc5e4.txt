We are from California and therefore have high standards for food.  This is by far our all-time favorite dinner place in the Phoenix Valley.  Everything we eat here is always excellent.  Our only complaint is that the music in the downstairs indoor seating by the sliding doors can be way too loud.  We came here with our out-of-town guest once and had trouble carrying out a conversation.  If you want to talk next time you come eat here, see if you can ask for upstairs seating or at a quieter table.
