The dim sum here is not the greatest I've ever had, but it is the very best Phoenix has to offer. We have tried every listing on Yelp, Best of, and Urban Spoon. We've tried every place recommended by friends and co-workers. This is as good as it gets.

What gets this restaurant it's 5 star rating is the atmosphere, servers, and the Peking Duck. The duck is not prepared the traditional way (the way we do it at home), but it is still very tasty. Even my parents (who are purists) have to admit that the flavors and the textures work very well together. Plus, the way they prepare it at Golden Buddah is much faster so we don't end up waiting forever for the food.
