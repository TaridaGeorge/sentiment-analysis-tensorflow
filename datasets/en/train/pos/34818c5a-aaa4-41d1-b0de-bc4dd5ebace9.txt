Love this place!  The staff always seems to be polite and considerate.  Food is awesome!  I saw that someone posted "The Ugly - Closed Sunday."  I always respected CFA for not being opened on Sundays.  It's a well sought-after day off in hospitality and gives their employees a chance to relax on a special day of the week with their friends and family.  Maybe that's why the customer service is so good?  Just saying...
