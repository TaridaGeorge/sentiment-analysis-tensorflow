I have a new love in my life.  Was looking for some good vegetarian food in the area and Wy-Knot popped up, so I say wy-knot give it a shot.  Jackie the owner is darling.  She really love her food, cafe, and people.  My inner fat kid wanted to eat EVERYTHING on the menu, but I only fed him a BIG salad.  The mix green salad and kale was topped with black bean, sweet potato, sun flower seeds, and the list goes on and on.  It even came with a toasty warm focaccia bread.  OMG! My fat kid is loving it.  Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu.  Thank you Jackie for loving your food.
