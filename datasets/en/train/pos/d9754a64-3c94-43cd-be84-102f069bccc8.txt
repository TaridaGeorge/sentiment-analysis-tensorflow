Just went again last night with friend's from out of town.  Here's what we ordered:  Heirloom tomato flatbread, duck confit/humboldt fog salad, beet and burrata salad, leek soup garnished with truffle oil, mac and cheese, hanger steak, side of veg, vegetable risotto.  Christopher sent out some smoked salmon spoons and a dessert plate that was to die for.  My friends all agree that this is the place to be for special occasions.  Had a delicious white burgandy and champagne to boot!
