Hubby and I ate lunch here on Jan. 26 and it was wonderful! We had the light and very tasty spring rolls which were perfectly put together. We also had Banh Tam Bi- Rice Vermicelli with Coconut Milk Concoction, a very yummy dish with a lovely taste and a bit of crunch. We topped these appetizers off with the chicken soup (#21), which was unbelievably delicious and came with a large plate of fresh basil and bean sprouts that were so gorgeous they looked like they had just been picked from a garden. The soup servings were only $6.00, and so big that we had enough to take home for another meal today. A great experience for our first visit and we look forward to taking friends back with us!
