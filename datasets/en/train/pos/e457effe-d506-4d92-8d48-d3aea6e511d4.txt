Two thumbs up. We tried many items on the menu and were very pleased with quality, presentation, and taste. Owners did a great job of retaining the mid-century modern architecture and incorporating the previous building uses into the design. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Gabe, our server, was great. Highly recommended.
