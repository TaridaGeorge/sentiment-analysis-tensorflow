TASTY!!  Great food, nice friendly people, pleasant atmosphere.  The owner greets you coming in and checks on you during your meal.  They make you feel welcome and you can tell that lots of people return frequently.  Fresh fish and creative combinations that are served in eye pleasing arrangements.  Cherry Blossom Roll was beautiful and tasty! I grew up in Japan and love sushi so this place will always have a fond memory in my belly and taste buds.  Not big but comfortable surroundings.  Prices also are good and actually cheap compared to other sushi places I've been to.
