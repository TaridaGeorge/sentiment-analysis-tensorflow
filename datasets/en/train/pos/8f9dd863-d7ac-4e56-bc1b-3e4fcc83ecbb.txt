Located in the Super Target shopping Center.

HUGE portions!!!!!

Love the Bento Box Lunch, which is like $8.25 and is a lot of food too. It includes: the selected entree, plus white rice, 3pc. Gyoza, California Rolls, Miso Soup, and Salad. It's really good too.

Good food, friendly & attentive service, clean restrooms, and good location.

Like someone else mentioned, I was not too crazy about the LOUD heavy metal music playing. I would had expected some softer Japanese music or soothing soundscapes, like you hear playing at spas. I felt like I was at a Night Club...oh well.

I would eat here again for sure! I LOVE this place!
