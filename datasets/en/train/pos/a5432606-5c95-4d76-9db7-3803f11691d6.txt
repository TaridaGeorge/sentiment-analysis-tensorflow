Amy and Byron were so friendly and flexible from day 1.  I was visiting from Seattle and had such a short time to book my photo shoot and get my pictures by my anniversary date.  They went above and beyond the call of duty to get my photo book completed in plenty of time for the special day. 
On top of the quick turnaround, the photo shoot was so much fun and they were extremely professional, helpful and made me feel so comfortable.  I am so pleased with the pictures and final book I purchased.  
I would absolutely recommend Boudoir Bliss to anyone who is looking to have this type of photo shoot.   
I know I will be back in another year!  Thanks so much for all your hard work!
