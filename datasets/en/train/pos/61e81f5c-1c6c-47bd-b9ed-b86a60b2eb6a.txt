This place is the definition of awesome. Phoenix has a severe lack of quality diners, and Harlows fills the void for miles around. Be it the Cisco (Eggs, Sausage/ Bacon, and French toast) or Turkey day on Thursdays (fresh carved turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, and cranberry sauce), the food here is great. Come hungry, because the portions are very large. 

While the food is great, the waitresses are just as awesome. They are beautiful and super friendly. 

My only complaint is that they are only open until 2pm. This place is in walking distance to ASU... people at ASU don't even get up until 2PM. I would imagine if they would just stay open until 3:30 or 4, they would see a whole new customer base.
