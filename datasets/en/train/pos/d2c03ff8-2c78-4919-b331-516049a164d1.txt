This place is awesome! Yes we are a little young to play bingo all the time, and yes there are a lot of older senior citizens here. But this facility is great. Outside it looks like a run down steam boat, it's kind of cute. But inside it's really has a nice set up. More than enough room to be comfortable, a snack shop that has decent food. Volunteers roaming the room to make sure you are taken care of. Best thing about this, they do this for charity. In Cali we always went to churches for bingo, but this is a new breath of fresh air.
