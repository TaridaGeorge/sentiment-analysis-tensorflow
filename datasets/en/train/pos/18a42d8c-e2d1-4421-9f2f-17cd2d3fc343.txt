Amazing food and service.  

Had the scotch beef, which was extremely tender and flavorful, but next time I'll ask for more gravy.

The scallops are a must-have.

The beet salad is a great value & super full of beets - very tasty.

The flash-fried white bean appetizer is fun, different, and good.

They'll make anything on the menu as a half-order, which is super convenient.

The mini apple dessert which he used on Iron Chef weren't as amazing as hoped.  The bread pudding w/whiskey sauce was excellent.

Will definitely be back.
