Took my mom here for dinner. She had the Thai Chicken Salad, and loved it. The ginger dressing was amazing. I had the Jambalaya, came with garlic bread. Very good, not too spicy and tons of shrimp and sausage. We shared a creme brulee for dessert, AMAZING! it was sooo good. The service was quick, friendly, and everything was great. I love the atmosphere at this restaurant. never had a bad meal or bad service here.
