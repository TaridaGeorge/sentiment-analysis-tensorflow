We just tried this out this afternoon following lunch at Pita Jungle next door.   It's a self-service yogurt shop where you pay by the ounce once you've finished your creation.  

The offerings included the standard vanilla and chocolate, but also less traditional offerings like Irish Mint and Red Velvet were also available.  They offer a taste of any of the products, and you can mix multiple types of yogurts in your container.  They also offer a variety of standard yogurt shop toppings for your creation.

I had a combination of the Irish Mint and Latte yogurts, with a couple of toppings.  The yogurt itself was smooth, creamy and well flavored.

We'll likely be dropping by here in the future.
