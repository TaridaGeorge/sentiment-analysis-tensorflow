I've never eaten in but we've ordered takeout many many times from here - but the place is very small so if you're going to eat here there's usually a wait. I think it would be worth it though! This is the BEST breakfast place. Their menu is very small and they do have some "lunch" items but I will never stray from their awesome omelets! The home fries and hash browns are both delicious, and they always have a special that's super yummy.
