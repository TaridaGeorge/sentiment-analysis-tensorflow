We ate dinner here, ordered a salad and chicken, the chicken came out slightly undercooked, we told Jonathan, our waiter, and he took it back. Then he and the manager came out to apologize.
They gave us a free meatball side dish while we waited, and then comped our meal! They went over and above what was expected. 
Great service, nice atmosphere, and good food. 
Give them a try.
