I could get lost in a book store. Especially this one. Great, even amazing,  prices for the frugal book worm's eye. You can spend hours upon hours scouring the shelves for knowledge in print. There is nothing more comforting than having a page to turn when you are heart deep into a novel or cuddling with your tiny over a joke book or a comic. You will find what you are looking for and then some at this place.
