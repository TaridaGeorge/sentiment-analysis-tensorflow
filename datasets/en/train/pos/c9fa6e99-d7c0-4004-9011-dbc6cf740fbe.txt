It's taken me a while to find an authentic, tasty Thai food place in Arizona and now I have!!

Swaddee in Chandler is the real deal, using traditional flavor combinations that take me back to the beaches of Phuket every time. I've come to learn that a Thai place that has duck on the menu is usually worth the price, and Swaddee does not disappoint! Their curry duck is rich and succulent. Likewise, their Garlic Eggplant w/ tofo is a family standard for us. Additionally, the staff is fun and friendly, even during high volume times!

TIP: If you plan to go for the usual M-F lunch, there is a hefty wait. Deal with it or go elsewhere. There's a reason for it! 

ALSO: Swaddee offers a 10% discount if you pay CASH!

 Swaddee!
