All I have experienced here is the pool.  The pool and staff is awesome.  I love this place, it is very relaxing.   The view of camelback mountain is awesome from the bottom pool, additionally, the water slide is a lot of fun.  
I wish I could live at this place.  Food is a bit pricey but that is to be expected.  Grounds are beautiful.  If you are looking for  a great place to stay and enjoy in Scottsdale, this is it.
