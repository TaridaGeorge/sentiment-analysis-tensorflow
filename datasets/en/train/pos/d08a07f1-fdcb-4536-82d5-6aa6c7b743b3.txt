Market Bistro has a great selection of fresh, tasty food! Very family-friendly, with "kids eat free" on Saturday and a lot of specials offered to VIP List (email sign-up on their website). I eat here 2 or 3 times each week and always leave happy! For take-out, the pick-up window is really convenient for grabbing lunch or when you have kids in the car and don't want to drag everyone inside. 

The #2 pizza, Market pizza and Sausage pizzas are all delicious! Be sure to save room for the chocolate chip & walnut cookie, it is heavenly!
