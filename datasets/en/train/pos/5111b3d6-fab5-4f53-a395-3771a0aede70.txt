I hate to give this place a great review...It's already hard enough to get a table! But it is flawless. Honestly, I cannot think of one thing that I would change about the atmosphere, service or the food. The sandwiches at lunch are absolutely incredible, they actually bake the bread for each order, then assemble your sandwich (name one other restaurant that does that). I really try to give good feedback on Yelp, but this place is flawless.

That being said, don't go into it expecting it to be flawless- you're always disappointed when you do that (like an over-hyped movie). Expect it to be a solid "8," and it will blow your mind. That's good advice that you can use in life ;-)
