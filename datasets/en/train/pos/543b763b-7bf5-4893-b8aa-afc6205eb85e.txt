I love LOVE Black Bear Diner!  When my boyfriend used to live on the West side, this was a regular breakfast spot for us.  Amazing food and good service.  Portions are more than enough, the quality is always high, and ingredients always taste fresh.  Highly recommend the pancakes or the chicken fried steak!  Heck - just order the Big Bear plate!  Might seem a little divey, but don't let the outside deceive you.  Perfect little breakfast joint and not a huge chain (which I will always try to avoid).  I'm happy to support Black Bear Diner any day of the week!
