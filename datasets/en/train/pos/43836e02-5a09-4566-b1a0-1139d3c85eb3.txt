Amazing quality of ice cream. Rotating flavors can be a bit odd sometimes so be sure to sample anything like "sweet potato, bacon, ale, mustard, etc." type flavors because it will probably have the label's real ingredient within and taste like it.  This place is amazing though! I like getting a triple play and enjoying every bite! Best ice cream shop that I have visited in AZ! A+++++
