Seriously, I have never enjoyed the pure, unadulterated taste of true coffee as I have at Cartel. My cappuccino was enjoyed sans sugar, flavoring, artificial sweetener.... everything. And it was so, so delightful. But it did not last nearly long enough :(

The place is so quaint and has a mom-and-pop, college atmosphere Starbucks or any other chain lacks. There are only a  few choices of drinks to choose from but.... it proves they are purists. And they do it RIGHT. All of it. 

Baked goods are out of this world (hello butterscotch cookie with white chocolate).
