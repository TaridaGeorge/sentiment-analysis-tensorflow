Hands down my favorite brunch spot in Scottsdale.  The cute cottage interior coupled with the umbrella-garden patio make the perfect ambiance for brunch with the girls (it's in fact our weekly ritual).  Not exactly a man's great escape - every time I go (which is more than often) there is undoubtedly a bridal or baby shower in process. But if you men only try the food, I'm sure you won't mind the gaggle of women.  

I recommend the goat cheese appetizer to start, and the chicken and leak crepes - to die for.  Though just about everything I've tried has been outstanding, I don't think you can go wrong. They also offer a mimosa special: a bottle of champagne and orange juice for $20, but you have to ask for it. 

Bon-a-petit!
