This is a smaller, older, happier Aj's. A go-to spot for produce if you can't get to the CenPho downtown market or the Guadeloupe Farmer's Market. Very helpful and unpretentious service for wine and liquor. Good for pizza-by-the-slice (I like the veggie).

Hot tip: Flowers are half-off from 4:00 to 6:00 on Friday. They have some really cool single-stems, so you could do something snazzy on the cheap.

Fun fact: Chris Bianco used to make pizzas here in the late '80s, when the store was called Euromarket. Talk about nostalgia -- you could grab a Bianco pizza and eat outside with only a ten minute wait!
