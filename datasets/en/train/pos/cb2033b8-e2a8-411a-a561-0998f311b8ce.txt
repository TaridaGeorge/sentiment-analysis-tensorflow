Be warned: Their sweet potato fries will haunt your dreams. They're so delicious and perfect and will call your name whenever you smell a french fry. 

Actually... I think it's safe to say that everything on their menu will haunt you in your dreams. I've never had anything not delicious and craveable. Throw a dart at the menu and I will guarantee that it is delicious. Don't even think about splitting something with a friend because you will destroy your friendship. 

The service is always on point, their bartenders are hilarious, and the ambiance is amazingly energetic.

I LOVE THIS PLACE. Please move it to the Bay area. But until then, I will have to fly to Phoenix just to get my fix.
