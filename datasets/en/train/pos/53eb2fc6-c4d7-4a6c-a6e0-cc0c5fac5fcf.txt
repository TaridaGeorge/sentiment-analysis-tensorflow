I have lived in AZ for five years now and can not believe I have never heard of this place! It must be because it is on the opposite side of town! Anyway it is absolutely to die for. I tasted several of the petite pastries and got to learn all about their business. Their wedding cakes are unbelievable and they only use the freshest ingredients. I will buy all of my special occation cakes for Honeymoon sweets from now on. Sooooooooo good!
