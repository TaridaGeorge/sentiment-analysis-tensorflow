Love Beckett's Table!  

It's California Food / Ambience with a neighborhood upstanding flair.  The menu is unique; The roasted red pepper soup is amazing with the grilled cheese sammy dipped!    In the spring, he did  grilled shrimp over grits, which created a craving, but it was a special.  Mussels were just okay, but apparently they have a crowd following (not for me).   

Down to earth, Beckett's table only enhances our neighborhood!  So happy to have you here!
