I've been a fan of Simply Bread for awhile, (Drip Coffee Lounge serves their bread). I had yet to stop in to the bread bar because they carry the same hours I do (9-5 M-F). 
I can tell you it was well worth it. Very friendly and happy to give samples. 
I bought a loaf of "The Don" and the chocolate chip cookies, perfect!
