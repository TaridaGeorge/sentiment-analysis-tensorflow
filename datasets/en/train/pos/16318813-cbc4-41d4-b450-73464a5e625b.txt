Wow.  I haven't actually ever been serviced here, but I will be.  Our Benz stopped working and was diagnosed elsewhere (where it was towed) as needing a new supercharger.  Desperately hoping for another (read: different) opinion, I called asking for diagnosis over phone.  He was so nice, while he told me what I didn't want to hear (it did need to be replaced), told me he was sorry for such a bummer problem, told me to remember the car has otherwise been good to me.  It was exactly how you'd want to be treated when you have a bummer, unexpected, unavoidable car expense.  I will certainly be their next regular (hopefully not that regular).
