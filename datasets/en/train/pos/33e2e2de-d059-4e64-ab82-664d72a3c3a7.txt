Wonderful! I stopped in before it officially opened and all the managers were excited, friendly and gave me coupons and free samples. The equipment is brand new and the place is meticulously clean inside. They gave me a custom bag with my name on it for future drop offs. There is something about getting my clothes cleaned with brand new machinery that makes me feel good. I have nothing but positive things to say about the employees, managers and guest service. Not sure what Kathy M is talking about! I have been multiple times and they are consistently excellent! Perhaps she owns another dry cleaning business! 

Easy to drop off clothes on your way to Starbucks in the morning.There is a 24 hour drop off too if you come after business hours. Give them a try!
