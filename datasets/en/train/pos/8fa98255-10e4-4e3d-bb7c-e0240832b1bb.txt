If you're looking for a great place to grab a drink and indulge in conversation then Casey Moore's is the place for  you. There's a great vibe and the music is equally as good. There's a wide range of types of people that go to Casey Moore's, and miraculously everyone gets along. The drinks are inexpensive and the food is of the best of bar food. The patio is great for some fresh air and if you grab a seat at the bar inside you'll be able to watch all the great sports games that may be going on. It's also the best place to start your night off if you plan to do some bar hoping. Overall it's my number one choice for mingling around the Mill Ave. area.
