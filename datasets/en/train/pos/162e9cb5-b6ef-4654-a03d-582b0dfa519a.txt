Love, love, love!!! Breakfast is the best I have ever had at a restaurant and eating dinner here makes me feel like I am back in France....I have not been for lunch (YET!) I can't wait to take my family and friends here! We happened to stumble in one morning looking for the restaurant that used to be there and what a surprise.  I had the crab cake omelet with their version of breakfast potatoes (which I couldn't stop eating) and a croissant with Nutella.   Any restaurant that serves Nutella is an A+ in my book :) We then went for dinner on NYE and had escargot, endive salad, roasted chicken and champaign.  AMAZING!
