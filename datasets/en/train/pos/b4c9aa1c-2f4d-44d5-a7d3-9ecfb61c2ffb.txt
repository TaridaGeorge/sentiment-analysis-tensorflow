Wow.  Amazing.  Simply amazing.  When you see a live band, normally there might be one or two weak links... perhaps the drummer is just average, or maybe the guitar player is a bit mushy... not so this band.  The drummer, Nick can play the skins; the keyboardist, Johnathan, is masterful; the Bass player, Todd, is one of the best I've seen; and there are simply not enough superlatives to describe the lead guitar, Brian.  Which leaves the two front "men", Caleb and Christine.  

This group covers every genre, from Lady Gaga to Neil Diamond, AC/DC to Prince, and they do it flawlessly.  My wife and I sat there and were simply amazed at their quality.  Easily the best live band we've ever seen at a club.  I highly recommend them.
