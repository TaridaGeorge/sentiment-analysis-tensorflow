I love Oregano's and probably one of the better things that I can say is that one location is as good as the next.  I've probably been to Oregano's upwards of thirty times and I've not had a bad experience yet.  The lines outside of any of their restaurants should be a solid indicator of their quality.  Good pizza is hard to find out here in Phoenix, I've tried many and other than Rosati's I've really not been very impressed.
Maybe when my tax check comes I'll take four hours and visit Pizzeria Bianco :)
