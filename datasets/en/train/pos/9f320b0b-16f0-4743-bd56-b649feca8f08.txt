Hands down the best facial I have ever had. I could have laid on the table and let Tifanny's magic fingers caress my face all day. She really takes the time to get to know your skin and creates a custom facial based on your needs. 

Her product line is phenomenal and the facial left my skin glowing for weeks.  She also does peels and microdermabrasion and I am eager to go back and try both. 

What really sets her apart from most estheticians is her attention to detail. Her studio is gorgeous and the environment she has created exudes comfort and relaxation. I have never felt so at ease and calm while someone cleaned out my dirty pores. 

If you are in the mood for pampering treat yourself and go see Tiffany. You will be so happy you did~
