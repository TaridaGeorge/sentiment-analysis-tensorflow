I love this little hidden gem. I love everything about it. I love the dirty floors and the slightly disorganized shelves, the bottle opener at check out so you don't have to wait a second longer to drink your bottle of soda and the little penny candies available to purchase. 

No it's not a 5 star establishment but it is a 5 star experience! Pops brings such a sense of nostalgia. I kept finding sodas that I used to drink growing up in small town Idaho. 

Pop's has every soda you could possibly desire. The variety is intense and the flavors unique. Everything comes in a glass bottle and for some reason soda taste better in glass. 

Pop's can do no wrong in my eyes, I am in l-o-v-e.
