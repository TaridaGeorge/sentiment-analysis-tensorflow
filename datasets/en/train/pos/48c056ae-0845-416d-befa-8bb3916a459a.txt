Dragon Palace is the place I am most likely to go in the Valley for Chinese food.  It is close to my house, has a good atmosphere, friendly staff and good food.  The restaurant is standard Chinese American fare.  My personal favorite is the Mongolian Beef which is always made perfect with scallions and white rice.  Egg rolls are tasty as is the egg drop soup.  The meals always come with the traditional hot tea and end with a fortune cookie.

The atmosphere is old school with booths around the walls and tables within the room.   

If you are looking for a decent Chinese restaurant with good food and no surprises, you have come to the right place.
