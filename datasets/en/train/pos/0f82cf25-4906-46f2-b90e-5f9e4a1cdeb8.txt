I'm giving Cabela's 5 stars on the basis of their attractions alone.  They have several dioramas to see taxidermied animals from near and far (Africa and Arctic regions) as well as some huge aquariums.  I almost felt like I had free admission to a zoo!

On top of this, the store is gigantic!  If you need something for the great outdoors, chances are you'll find it here: Camping gear, fishing stuff, guns, bow and arrows, clothing, etc.  The store is clean, very well-stocked, and there are sales associates everywhere.  There is also an eatery upstairs with sandwiches (they even offer elk and boar meat) and a fudge shop.

In all, Cabela's is definitely filling their niche well!
