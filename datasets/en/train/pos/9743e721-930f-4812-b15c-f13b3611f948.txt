I have been getting breakfast and lunch here for a few weeks now and will continue to go back.  Everything is made fresh and the bread is amazing.  I am not typically a pasta salad person but the pasta salad here has been changing my mind about that. I would like to see more sandwich menu options but otherwise I have zero complaints!
