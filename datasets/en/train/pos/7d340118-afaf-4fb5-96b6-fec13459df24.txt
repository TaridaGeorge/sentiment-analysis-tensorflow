Loved it!  Loved it so much on my first visit that I went back again only 4 days later to try it again!

Great happy hour.  Both times I had two margaritas - watermelon, citrus and I can't remember the other two.  Mmmm...

Ordered the black bean burger both times.  Love the bread and the layer of goat cheese.  Just delicious.  Both times was to full to even taste the salad that it comes with.

I look forward to going back a third time.
