Great atmosphere.  Not pretencious.  Clean, homey and hip. Best of all- DELICIOUS.  This place is run by some major girl power.  I loved the watermelon, feta, cucumber salad.  Wow who knew that all went together.  I had the chicken they have this summer and it was just so flavorful.  The dessert is good, but not over the top (but some times I LOVE over the top).  Such a lovely dinner.  I will say I don't think it's for kids.
