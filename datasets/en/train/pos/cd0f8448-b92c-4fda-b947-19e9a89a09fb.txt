I Love this Place !!! one of my FAVS for Sushi !  they have great Bento Boxes for lunch that are resonable priced, my Favorite is the Shrimp Tempura ! Good prices on Cocktails, and Japanese Beer !  if you get on their e-mail list, they will send you coupons, that are $10.00, and $20.00 off, and great to Celebrate birthday's !  Good Service, also !
