This place is good.  Really good.  I give it the 3 C's: casual, cute and relatively cheap.  Its a great place to go if everyone your eating with can't decide on what to eat... Pasta?  Check.  Soup noodles?  Check.  Sushi?  Check.  The chicken parm and salmon pastas were delicious!  Can't wait to go back!
