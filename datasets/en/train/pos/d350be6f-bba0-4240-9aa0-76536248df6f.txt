Best place to buy beer in Phoenix, bar none.  The basement bar is very cool- great stuff on draft.

Personally, my favorite thing to do is just to grab a six pack holder and go pick out a bunch of new stuff to try.  No matter how many times I go I always find something that looks cool.  I'm especially impressed by their little Iron Curtain area- great selection of Eastern European and Russian beers!
