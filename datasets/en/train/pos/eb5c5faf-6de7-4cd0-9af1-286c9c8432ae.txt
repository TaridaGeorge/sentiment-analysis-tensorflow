This is one of the best museums I've ever been to. We only had a couple hours to look around, which is DEFINITELY NOT ENOUGH time.  I say, allow yourself a whole day to explore. It may not take quite that long, but seriously, this place is HUGE! Very impressive exhibits, too. It's pricey for admission, but if you make a day of it, it's quite worth it. Everyone MUST visit this museum at least once. SO excited to have this in the Phoenix area!
