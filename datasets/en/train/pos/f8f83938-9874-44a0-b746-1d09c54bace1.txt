Yesterday I had a pump go out in a small pond I have in my back yard.  The owner of the house I lease replaced it about 6 months ago and on a whim I took it in to see if it was still under warranty.  The people were friendly and very helpful and gladly swapped it out without the usual guilt from other hardware stores.  I have always been a Home Depot guy but this experience has made me change my mind.
