I am a complete idiot for going to Mill Ave for 2 years off and on driving up from bum town Sierra Vista to party at mill. first time going to this place and wow i was hooked the first 5 minutes of being there. the musicians they have performing there are AWESOME!!! pick a song out of your head and 98% of the time they will know it and if its something you really wanna play them slap down a few extra bucks. multiple bars and tubs with beer in it so almost no problem getting a drink. 

all in all 5 stars. by far my favorite place on mill ave
