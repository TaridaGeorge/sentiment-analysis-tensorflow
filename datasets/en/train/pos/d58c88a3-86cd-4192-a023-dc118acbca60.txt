Visited the hair salon at Willow Stream. It's pricey, but well worth it. Casi Rathbun gave my long hair a trim and a full head of highlights just the way I like it. No obvious stripes/strips of color, just natural-looking blonde hair! She chose a great color that looks incredible with my skin, too. And, get this, she was so gentle when combing my hair - she didn't yank my head once! 
She is also so sweet and nice to be around. The salon is on the smaller side, so it's nice and quiet - I like that. 
It's so hard to find the right stylist for your cut/color -- I will definitely be returning to Casi!
