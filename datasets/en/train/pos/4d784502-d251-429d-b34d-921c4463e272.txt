My husband and I love this place! The pain killer is my favorite drink.  Pretty much every meal we have had here has been very good. Cool patio, cool crowd, cool place!  Food can be a lil pricey if you are on a budget but tastes pretty damn good.  They have tiki time happy hour m-f with $5 apps! We met the owner and his wife last week while we were sitting at the bar. They seem to always be there working - which to me shows they care about their buisness.
