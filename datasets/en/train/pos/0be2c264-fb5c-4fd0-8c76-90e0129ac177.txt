I LOVE Zupas! I have been a fan since they first opened in Utah and only had soups and salads on the menu.  They have expanded the menu to include sandwiches and desserts (the chocolate cake is DELICIOUS!!!). My favorite soups are the Wisconsin Cauliflower, Mushroom Bisque, and Clam Chowder. My favorite salad is the Red Raspberry Spinach while my daughter craves the Nuts About Berries. I have never been disappointed no matter what I ordered. Great service, great food. Fingers crossed they build one in the Chandler/Gilbert area!!
