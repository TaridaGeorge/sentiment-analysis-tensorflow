I travel a lot on business, and this is my must go to restaurant in downtown Phoenix. Terrific service in every way. Problem is I never get to try other items on the menu because one dish demands I order it every time. The Halibut Athenia is simply put the best fish preparation I've ever had. Huge portion of fresh halibut oven roasted with tomatoes, feta cheese and herbs. Words do not do it justice. Not on the regular menu but often a special. Just ask for it. It's unbelievable.
