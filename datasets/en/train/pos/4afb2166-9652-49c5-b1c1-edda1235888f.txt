I LOVE the food here. Really amazing asian cuisine but veganized. But my meat loving fiance also really enjoys it. The atmosphere is really clean and the service is phenomenal, almost every time we go we get complimentary soup before the meal. But the food doesn't just taste good its really pretty too. They put flowers in their special drinks, it was super cool. Also their "cheesecake" is mouthwateringly good, I have to get it every time.
