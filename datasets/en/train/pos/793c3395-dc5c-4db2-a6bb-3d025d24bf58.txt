Classic Car spa is a great addition to the area. The people who work there are friendly and they go the extra mile.

I have yet to do any detail services, but have liked all of my car washes. I was in a while back and mentioned I was somewhat in a hurry becuase it was my birthday - after that it seemed like everyone who worked there was wishing me a happy birthday... Very nice and welcoming.

My only warning - If you have light colored carpets, do not get the fragrance "chips" they put under the mats. They stained the carpet in my old car. I go with no fragrance now.
