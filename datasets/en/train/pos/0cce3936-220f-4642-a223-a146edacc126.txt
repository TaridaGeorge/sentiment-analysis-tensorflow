This is my shop for routine service for my truck. I always get the feeling they are being up front and honest, and they have never tried to push unnecessary service on me. Prices are fair for an independent shop.

They do have a waiting area, but you may need to wait to have service done if they have other cars ahead of you. I live close enough that I can just walk home, but they do offer a shuttle if you need it. If you're in a hurry (say need the oil changed, but only have 30 minutes to get it done), best call ahead.
