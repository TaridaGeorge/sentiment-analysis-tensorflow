The first time that I visited Scottsdale, I stayed here only because they were hosting the convention I was attending.  They have two large swimming pools, the rooms are nice, and they have free WiFi, which lately seems to be rare in more expensive hotels.  Why can I get free WiFi at the Super 8 Motel in Ogallala, Nebraska, but not the Logan Airport Hilton in Boston?  But I digress...

A good, hot breakfast is served each morning with options like made-to-order breakfast burritos and more traditional fare.  The staff is also helpful in recommending local restaurants and attractions.
