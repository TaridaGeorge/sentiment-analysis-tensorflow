WooHoo! As good as it gets!  That's an understatement!

This place is a triple threat.  The decor is warm and relaxing, the service was great, and the food was spectacular!

We enjoyed the bruschetta for our appetizer.  The various flavors were great and the balsamic vinegar glaze couldn't be more flavorful.  

For dinner, I had the gorgonzola crusted lamb cutlets.  AMAZING!!

You cant have that good of a meal and not indulge in a little dessert.  The creme brule  and terramassu were awesome.  

It takes a lot to wow me but this place came through!
