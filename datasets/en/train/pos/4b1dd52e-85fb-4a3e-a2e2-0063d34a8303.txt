Amazing HH. Blacken Miso Cod is to die for!!  Bar is FUN ...clever bartenders perform death defying drink pours! HH all day everyday in the summer. (gotta beat those triple digit temps somehow) its insanely PACKED on Fridays starting around 5.  They also have valet so don't fret about the full parking lot.
