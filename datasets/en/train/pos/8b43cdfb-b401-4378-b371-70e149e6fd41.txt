OK, So I was gonna give them a 4 but I thought about it and made it a 5. The food is very good and plenty of options. The staff is definitely friendly (I work in retail and preach this sort of thing so I have to acknowledge it). 

I was going to give them a 4 only because I thought they were on the pricey side compared to other places for the amount of food you get. I decided to go with a 5 because the service is really good and you do feel like you are getting a homemade sandwich when you sit down to eat. 

Definitely give them a try.
