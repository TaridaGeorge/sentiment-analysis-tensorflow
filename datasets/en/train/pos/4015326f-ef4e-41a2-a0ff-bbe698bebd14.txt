It's my first time here and this place already rules. So hard. I'm like on a first date and writing a seemingly premature five star review while I'm still on it. This place is a real dreamboat though, you don't even understand. Cheap and plentiful. Totally packing. Seriously, sometimes you just know when it's absolutely right. Damn, he's back from the bathroom. Sigh. Bye.
