After reading all the great reviews I decided to take my significant other to lunch here.  Maaaaaaaan was it worth it!  I just became a FRESH WASABI fan!  I had such a great experience!  They have very friendly/helpful staff that are very quick.  The beer is cold, the chefs are nice and good at what they do.  I have zero complaints about this place.  The price is just right for great sushi.  The location throws you off a bit because it is in a Fry's plaza.. but once you get inside it is a totally different atmosphere.  I can't wait to go back!
