We had a fantastic evening at Del Frisco's, and can't understand why the place wasn't packed.  The seared tuna salad is among the top food items I've ever had, and while the buerre blanc was a bit on the subtle side, the sole (quality of the fish) was spectacular.  The service was great, the manager was walking around and was quite attentive.  The VIP martini is excellent - pineapple infused vodka.  We WILL be back when back in town.
