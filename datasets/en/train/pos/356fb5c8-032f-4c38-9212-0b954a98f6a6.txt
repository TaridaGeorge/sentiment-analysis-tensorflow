I came to Ticoz with the bf after buying a coupon on Groupon.  We had a wonderful experience! Our waiter was Jorge and he is probably one of the nicest people I have ever met! He had great drink suggestions and was super pleasant to have as a waiter.  For food we had the trio of dipping sauces and the sliders.  Both were great, and I will be back soon.  Great food and great service.
