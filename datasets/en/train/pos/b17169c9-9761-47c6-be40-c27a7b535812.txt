I love AJ's and have never encountered attitude from the people who work there...the patrons, yes.  Having just moved here from Los Angeles I have to laugh at Scottsdale attitude...but I digress.  

My favorite purchase at AJ's is a box of chocolate truffles.  A close second is their version of a devil dog...holy cow, this is a great place for foodies.  AJ's is also a nice place to go for breakfast pastries...can you see where I spend too much time.  

Another thing, this is a great place to go if you are having a dinner party on any night and didn't have time to cook.  And you can pick up an exotic bunch of flowers for your table.
