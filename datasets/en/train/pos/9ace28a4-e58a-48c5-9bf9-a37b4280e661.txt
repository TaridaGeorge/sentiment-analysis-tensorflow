Thank you to Yelper reviews and your high ratings for M. Giambrone. Mike is very passionate and took the time to thoroughly go through the services that Legal Shield offers. One of my R.N. employees works as a Rep and had great feedback. I wanted to contact someone who was in my area. I choose the basic membership and so far will be utilizing their services for a couple of things. Rental and legal action with mechanic services that was not done and was found by a reputable company. I will update my review once I have used Legal Shield for these two things. Mike has been a tremendous help with referring me to other companies/contacts for needs for my place. Mike's a really good guy that you want on your side!  : )
