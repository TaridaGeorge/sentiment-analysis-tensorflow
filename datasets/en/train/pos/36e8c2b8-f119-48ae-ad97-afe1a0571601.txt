I searched Phoenix far and wide for a killer BBQ place and it took my a while to work up the courage to enter this tiny purple establishment.  And boy did it pay off.  I have been back at least 5 different times.

The pulled pork is excellent.  The rib tips are excellent.  The french fries are crunchy. The deep-fried corn on the cob is a must try.  The mac and cheese, obviously, is stellar.  I have yet to try their pies, but all look incredible.

It's no fancy digs, but when it comes to meat, you can't go wrong here.
