Delicious!! I was so excited to see such a chic (but unpretentious) place in downtown Chandler. It really brings a great vibe to the downtown area. The food is amazing, as fresh as it gets, and the drinks are strong and yummy! They have a huge wine list and the owners really know what they re talking about and don't mind helping you choose. this is the perfect place for a dinner party.
