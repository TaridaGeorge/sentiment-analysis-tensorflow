Oregano's is always a great place to eat!  I bring everyone here that comes from out of town who hasn't eaten here.  They have fabulous pastas and pizza's, salads etc.  We always look forward to eating their pizza cookies... big cookie with vanilla ice cream on top.  Couldn't ask for anything better.  They have seating outside and inside and you also have the option of eating at the bar which is quicker.  We always ,have great service although some of their pizzas etc take a little longer to cook.  Sometimes when you are with a preschooler it's hard to wait.  We come here every now and then because it's very hard to get seated right away because they are always so packed and don't take reservations.  We live closer to the Tempe location, but sometimes go to the Mesa one because it's a shorter wait.
