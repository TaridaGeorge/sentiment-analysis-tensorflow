Let's keep this review simple.

This place is amazing! It is not life altering, as everybody expects it to be, but it is the best pizza I have ever tasted.

Yes, I do think it's ridiculous having to wait 2 hours for a table, but that doesn't deter my opinion of the pizza here. 

Everything is prepared and mixed so well. My favorites are the Margherita (I get it w/ sausage) & Sonny Boy.

Love the atmosphere of the small brick building.
