Love this place!!! I've been to the original in Brooklyn quite a few times and Grimaldi's is a favorite of mine. I happened to be in Arizona over the weekend and went to this version of Grimaldi's and it was just as good as the original in Brooklyn... for quality pizza you'll definitely have to check this place out, its awesome!!!
