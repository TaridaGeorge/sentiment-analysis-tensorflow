Heavenly! Pure heaven!!

After living in Poland I sometimes get a hankering for some good Polish eats and this place does the trick! Best part is, I can say the few polish phrases that I know AND they understand me. 

I got the  chicken schnitzel cordon bleu, it was FANTASTIC. Highly recommended. 

I also got the mandarin dessert -- OH MY GOSH. This was GREAT. GET IT, GET IT, GET IT!!!!!

YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM!!!!!
