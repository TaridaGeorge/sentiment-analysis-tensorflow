I loved it. Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday and was impressed just by walking in. The ambiance was great, the little fountains and the patio area was very cool as well. 
       This is a steakhouse, the better the meal the more it's worth, so you will pay accordingly.  I had a filet and I loved every second of it, not only was is a pretty good size it was done beautifully.  The tortilla soup was even fantastic as well.   Drinks are also high quality. I had an awesome mojito.
 
      I thought the employees were on point, it was a thursday night so I wasn't expecting the A team but they were awesome. Although the place seems kinda snooty the staff was friendly and proficient. 
 
           I've been to expensive steakhouses before, not always do I get one that delivers on all fronts.
