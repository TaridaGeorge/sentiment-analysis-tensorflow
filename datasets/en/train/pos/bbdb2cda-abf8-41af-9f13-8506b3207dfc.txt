Great experience - very steamlined from paperwork to the clinical aspect.  Everything is electronic and very modern.  The office doesn't even look like a dental office - very modern and chic.  

Melissa, my dental hygentist, was great - explained what she was doing and no other chit chat - very efficient.  Dr. Berschler very friendly and happy to see you.

Robin, the office manager, even offered me change for the meter when I had difficulty locating the parking garage.  After the appt, I received a "welcome letter" via e-mail from the practice - now that is a first!

Highly recommend!
