Best table prep I have seen since that place in the Biltmore....love their sushi as well.  This is a downtown Scottsdale attraction and rightly so!  A must see and eat place.

We have gone there every year for my wife's birthday since we have been married, and that's now 9 years.  Always great service, and good food.
