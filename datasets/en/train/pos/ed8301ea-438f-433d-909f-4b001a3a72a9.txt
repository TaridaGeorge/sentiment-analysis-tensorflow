It has been twenty plus years since I have had one of Casella's famous sub sandwiches. It was just as good as I remember.  The coleslaw is out of this world. I guarantee it will not be another twenty years. Next Friday I will be visiting them again.  Sorry I have stayed away so long.  Please remember this is cash only business.  Don't worry, it is very light on the wallet.  :)
