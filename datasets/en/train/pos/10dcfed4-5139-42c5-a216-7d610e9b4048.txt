Discovered my tire was FLAT.  Got enough air in it to drive it to Discount Tire on 44th and Bell.  I was LATE for work!  They were BUSY and their computers were down!  They said it would take about an hour.  

About an hour later, they were all done!   They checked ALL my tires, discovered they were all loose, and they fixed the one (it had a nail in it) and I was on my way!   

The technicians were extremely nice and were even singing as they worked.  AND they didn't even charge me ANYTHING for the great service!   Discount Tire...2 thumbs up!
