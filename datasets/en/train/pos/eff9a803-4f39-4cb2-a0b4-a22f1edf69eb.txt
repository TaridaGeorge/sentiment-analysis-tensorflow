This place has everything good about the Tempe location, without the horrible decor and sort of grungy vibe that brings the Tempe Green down a notch.  
Green Phoenix is clean and contemporary, with a changing rotation of pretty decent art on the walls and the service here is really friendly and on the ball. 
Caveat: just because it's vegan - doesn't mean it is healthy - it is pretty much vegan junk food, but it is delicious vegan junk food.  
The lemonade and iced tea are delicious.  The buffalo "chicken" po boy is a stand out.  I love the tofu appetizer with the peanut sauce and the jerk tofu salad was also really tasty and the prices are very reasonable.  
I love Green, and it is definitely on my list of frequent re-visits.
