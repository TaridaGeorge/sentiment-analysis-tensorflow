We went to Daily Dose on a Saturday June 23 about 10am  when we got there the line seemed endless but the hostess told us it would be a 15 minute wait and she was right on. We sat at the bar which was great service. Food is amazing I had the chorizo eggs Benedict while my husband had the meat omelet with smoked Gouda both were amazingly tasty!,  have a mimosa make it a double and it's a perfect breakfast.   Hostess also took the time to come talk and see how we were doing. Really enjoyed it. We will definitely be back to try lunch or dinner next time.
