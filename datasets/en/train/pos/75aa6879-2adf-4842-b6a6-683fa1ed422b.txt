My husband decided to finally try this place on a rare kid-free night... we were not disappointed!

We were seated right away and our server was great! He had lots of great recommendations for us such at Milano italian beer (one of my new faves) and the bruschetta. 

The pizza.. oh my! I LOVED it and didn't want to quit eating.. Luckily for my waist we decided to only grab one pizza although the waiter warned us that we may still want another. We went with the fan favorit e Italian Stallion and was pleased. the Italian meats on it were so good and the crust was by far the best I've ever had. Can't wait to go back!
