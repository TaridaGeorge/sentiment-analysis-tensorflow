I am a huge fan of Desert Schools. They are really nice and great to bank with. I worked for them years ago and I can attest the employees go through great training and really do a great job at helping their customers. I recommended everyone switch to a credit union especially this one! The lines are never super long, even on Friday afternoon. I have never had a major problem like I experienced at other banks. The other major bonus is they have branches inside Wallmarts open all day Saturdays.
