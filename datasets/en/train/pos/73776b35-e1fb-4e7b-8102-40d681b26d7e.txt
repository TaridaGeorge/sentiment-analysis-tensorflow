Gracie's is the absolute best kind of thrift store. A little run down and a little cluttered, but full of lots of hidden treasure. I've found numerous vintage items, particularly dishware, worth 5-10 times their sticker price. You just have to know what you're looking for. And you have to be willing to do a bit of work yourself (eg, cleaning your finds once you get home). I've also scored lots of brand new, or close to brand new, small kitchen appliances at great deals. The thing about Gracie's is they just sort of throw everything on the shelves - but that's the fun, right? Getting to root through everything to find a treasure? It's also part of the reason their prices are so low. I make sure to swing by Gracie's once a month to see what new stuff they've got on the shelves.
