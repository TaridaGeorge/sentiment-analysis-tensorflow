Yummy galore!  I go here to share the skillet platter..we get beef and chicken and it's so savory.  The meat is delicious because it just tastes fresh and not all greasy.  Most places rely on grease or lard to make their food taste good (gross) but here it's good as is!

Great pricing too!  The tortillas are yum. The rice is even good!  Just try it.  You'll enjoy the flavor!

Also- the employees are super nice!
