If you want great atmosphere, friendly people, and delicious FRESH food. GO HERE. Seriously. Everything I've tried is delicious. One of my favorites is the chicken-arugula wrap with cherries in it. The crowd ranges from young mothers with their babies to older couples who live in the area. Definitely a great choice when in the DC Ranch area, and if you're further south by Scottsdale and Shea, the other location is just as good, but smaller.
