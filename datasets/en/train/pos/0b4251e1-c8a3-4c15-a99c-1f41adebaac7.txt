For big box building stores, it is as good as it gets. The whole vibe is head and shoulders above Home Depot. They have very helpful employees to help you find what you are looking for, albeit I do not have to ask as much for some reason while at Lowes. I guess they don't have their head up their asses when shelving items. 

The paint department is very helpful and really try to educate you on the products for your specific use. They do seem to be a little bit higher in price, but the shopping experience is worth it.
