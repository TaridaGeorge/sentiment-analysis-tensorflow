Outstanding dining experience!!!

Annual meal, that I look forward to each year.  I go with a group which is hosted by a generous friend, who literally insists on getting one of everything.    All of it is good!!!

However, the item which stands out most in the experience was something only available at the bar......a Slider

Slider.....doesn't sound exotic compared to everything else on the menu, but damn!  It was good and it seems to me to be the best value on the menu too.  2 or 3 and you are full.

A little pricey, but great ambiance and music and service!
