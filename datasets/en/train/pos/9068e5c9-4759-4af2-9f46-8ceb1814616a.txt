The Arizona Capitol building is small and older. It's not the prettiest capital that I've ever seen but it's nice. The Senate and House have buildings adjacent to the main capital building which is too small to hold anything substantial. That's ok because it makes a nice museum.

I was impressed by the interior. There is a nice gift store inside. One room is dedicated to the USS Arizona that was destroyed in the attack on Pearl Harbor. Another room has artifacts from the Merci Train. In another room is a model of the Oasis in the Desert, the capital designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.

Overall, I thought the building and artifacts inside were great.
