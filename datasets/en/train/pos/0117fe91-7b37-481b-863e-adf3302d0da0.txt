I don't write yelp reviews often, but when I do it's usually because I am either very pleased or very disatisfied with an establishment.  In this case I'm writing because I had such and excpetional experience yesterday I felt compelled to "Yelp".  

I was helped by Shane and I have to say his customer service was extraordinary on every level.  He had encylopediac knowledge, passion, personality and most importantly was ENGAGED in helping me get the right plant and pots. Why are "Shanes" of the world seemingly so few and far between?  

This guy hustled and I mean that in a good sense.  He had a sense of purpose and worked his tail off with very clever solutions to getting my awesome money tree and pot together.  Summer Winds has a good egg there, because of him, I know I will be back often to support this store.
