Covet rocks! Ever since Salon Jo El relocated here I've been hooked. At Covet you can get your hair cut, colored and styled and shop at the same time, which is what I always do. Not only looking fabulous, I leave with the trendiest clothes and shoes every month. Hard to find fashions abound here; Randy is so friendly. If you're going for your hair, please request Cassie! She rocks!
