Holy shit. The White Widow is amazing. yeah the girls are right Quiznos or Subway has nothing on ChebaHut. The hut's clam baked atmosphere is perfect for those late after noon lunchies right after work. Big fan of the laid back beach murals and great logo.

 Ive had the Panama Red and im super picky about italian stuff and it just didnt cut it, but everything else i've had has been great. 

Keep on *legally* rolling those blunts and passing the pinners Cheba Hut. Phoenix salutes you.
