The pork green chilli burrito was excellent, very lean.  I customized my burrito with egg, ham and cheese, pork green chilli on the side. 

We sat at the bar because the wait was about 20mins on a weekday morning around 9.45am. Hannah, who was the very busy bartender, took very good care of us and was the one who recommended the pork green chilli, which I will definetly be ordering again. 

I also enjoyed the unfiltered apple juice which was a nice surprise to see on the menu.
