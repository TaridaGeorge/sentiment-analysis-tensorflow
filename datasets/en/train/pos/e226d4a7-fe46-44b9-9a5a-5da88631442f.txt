I was in town for the US Field Hockey Festival and my workout routine was put on hold for a few. I was flying out later that day so I signed up online for a class and ba-dum! I was in.

I've done Lotte Berk before so I wasn't shocked- but my body was after having taking a two week hiatus from my daily yoga practice.

I'm pretty sore today- in the workout world, this is a good thing!

Don't forget your socks ;-) AND BRING YOUR KIDS!! They have child care- sweet, eh?
