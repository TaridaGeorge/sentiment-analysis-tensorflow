I had the good fortune of being able to relax a few mornings away here recently.   Definitely a little piece of New York in Arcadia - it has the feel of the many gourmet micro-grocery stores there.  I don't go here as much as I should, so I reluctantly recommend it to the rest... 

* loud and busy in the morning and lunch times
* a very cool incognito back-door entrance
* very brunchy menu selections (incl. a great croque madame, sandwiches, omelettes, muffins and tarts)
* jazz, Gipsy Kings, and Al Green classics wafting over the loud speakers
* grocery stocked with knick knacks, cookbooks, imported pasta, fine wine, freshly made sushi, and of course, The New York Times

And, yes, the Spanish latte is every bit as incredibly and sweetly decadent as described.
