let me just say that i generally despise the raping of the letter "x," especially to infer that something is "extreme!"
BUT i started going here because it was a place to chill while my tires where getting fixed at the discount tire nearby and kind of fell in love with it.
it's an old bank, and they've kept the huge safe, complete with door, in the building (i suupose it would have been more of a pain to try and get rid of it). anyway, now it's a mini library and reading/study room.
they also serve bagels, sandwiches, smoothies, and varioius snacks. 
they have a drive thru, which is also nice.
