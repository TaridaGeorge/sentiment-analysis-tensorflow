Pretty spendy, but the steak was certainly well worth the price.  I had the Kansas City cut -- the very best steak I can recall having.  For side dishes we had green beans, Brussels sprouts, and lobster mashed potatoes.  The lobster mash was completely unnecessary and over the top --way too much food for even four hungry guys.  (It tasted ok, but could have, should have, been a meal all by itself.)  We also ordered two bisques and two salads
