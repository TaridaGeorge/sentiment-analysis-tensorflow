Ray's has been a staple in my diet since my father discovered it in the late 90's. I will and do drive 23 miles from my house for the best pizza in AZ. When I order a pie, I'll order it with extra sauce, light on the cheese with a crispy bottom, but then again, I am from NY. When I go to get a slice, it is tasy, although a little bit heavy on the cheese for me, but a Zoni's dream.
I love the spinach and tomato slice.
Warning for vegetarians... they have chnages their pasta sauce to incllude sausage. Not my cup of tea in the slightest. I'll stick with the pizza.
