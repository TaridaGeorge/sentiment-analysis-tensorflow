I've never tried the Sushi here, but the Katsu Don (Pork Cutlet Bowl) and Sansai Udon are exquisite!  I was born and raised in Japan, and this is so far the only Japanese restaurant that I've been to which serves essentially the same dishes as in Japan.  

I've seen some complaints in price hikes such as the Unagi (fresh water eel), but the market price has gone up in the last several years by 60-70%, so it's not their fault.

Service is usually pretty good, but it can get pretty busy on some evenings.  Luckily, they have some complimentary bread rolls and mini-cinnamon toasts.  It's not enough to spoil your appetite, but it's something to nibble on until your food arrives.

Basically, it's the only Japanese restaurant that I go to, because I know I can get good, satisfying food for a good price.
