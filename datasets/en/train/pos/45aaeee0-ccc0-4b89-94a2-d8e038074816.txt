Great frozen yogurt in a warm, relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. A really nice change from the cold, plastic, brightly colored yogurt shops you see popping up everywhere. Nice selection of toppings and the yogurt flavors are intriguing (I had the caramel which was silky and nicely sweet).  It's also locally owned which is important to me.  I will be back!
