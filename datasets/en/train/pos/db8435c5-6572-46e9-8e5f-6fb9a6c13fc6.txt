bruschetta = YUM!!! the mixed plate of bruschetta is the best you'll get in town. it is just a palette full of so much flavor. just this plate alone can fill you up for lunch, but if not....their raspberry chicken salad will. it is the best salad i've had in my life! seriously....it's to DIE for. mmm...

i've only frequented during lunch hour, but this place is just classy dining in a really casual atmosphere. the architecture and design of the space is sparse and industrial, yet it's not cold. the parking is shared with la grande so it can be pretty daunting to find a spot, but just save yourself the hassle and valet.
