This was our first time visiting and I have absolutely no complaints about this place. The service was outstanding. I had the smart chicken and the husband, the pork belly. Both meals had spot on flavors and just the right portions. Being a big bread pudding fan, we had to order the pig in the orchard bread pudding. While the combination of ingredients looks different, the flavors are amazing. This is definitely not a meat and potatoes type of place. You must be open to new flavors or you could be disappointed.
