I LOVE this grocery store.  I love that it is conveniently located.  I love that I know where everything is.  I love that the staff is so incredibly helpful and nice, I love the produce section, I love the beer section, I love that it is clean and organized, and I especially love the prices.  

I've shopped around and found Safeway to be way to expensive and while Fry's occasionally has lower prices I hate battling the crowds to shop there.
