The 11 oz. medium-well fillet was by far the best I have had, hands down.  The green beans were meh, but the garlic mashed potatoes were delicious.  A few Crown and Cokes and viola, $$$$, lol.  Expensive but worth it.  Will definitely be back.  Wonderful atmosphere, service, and most importantly, food.
