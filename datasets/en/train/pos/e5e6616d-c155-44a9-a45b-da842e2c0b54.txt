This candy store is adorable and awesome. Even though it's small, there's so much to see. It's really unique and colorful. There is really something for kids of all ages. They have a great selection of novelty items and older brands of candy. The employees are friendly and helpful...they'll even recommend a new candy bar to try. Super fun! A great place to take friends and family for an outing.
