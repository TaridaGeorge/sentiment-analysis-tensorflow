Oh Papadeaux, you are one of my most f-a-v-o-r-i-t-e places to go enjoy a lovely, fresh and deliciously flavorful creole or Cajun seafood meal. I love the ambiance of this place as it truly feels like I'm back again in NOLA. I don't even mind waiting 30 or so minutes to be seated while live blues music serenades me in preparation for those addictive flavors to come. The sights, the smells, the sounds, the service and most importantly the flavors, Papadeaux consistently delivers the entire package. I most certainly will return again and again!
