Holy slices of heaven on earth!!!!  This pizza is incredible.  

After a long day at work my boyfriend and I decided to order in. I turned to Yelp, found Rosati's, and 45 minutes later we had a glorious pizza delivered to my door.  

We had the double-dough pizza with cheese and pepperoni. They hand-roll (braid?) the crust under itself, creating the ideal crunch and chew factor. 

There is something special about the cheese...or maybe it's the herb blend on top...or both. Whatever it is, I found myself eating a third (and fourth) slice. 

When you want to do pizza, don't waste your time or money on other chains--Rosati's is the place to go!!!
