Amazing...absolutely amazing. Just had a regular ol' pepperoni pizza, but sometimes restaurants can mess up the simplest of pizza's, and I wasn't feeling too adventurous since this was my first time at the Parlor, however, judging by how good that pizza was, I can only imagine the others are just as amazing.

I even came back to my office and I think I told about 10 people about how amazing it was - I hope they take my advice and stop by soon!
