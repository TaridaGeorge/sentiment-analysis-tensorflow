The food is absolutely fabulous in every way! What I appreciate most, especially as a chef myself, is the consistency. Good food shouldn't depend on the chefs mood and here, it doesn't! I ALWAYS take guests there and they are pleased every time. Switch is one of the few places where, when you look at the menu, EVERYTHING looks amazing. That's key. I also frequent their weekend brunches which are a hit every time. Drinks are only $1.99 for brunches! Overall, just a fantastic dining experience.
