The burgers are the best I have ever had.  My husband and I split the Peppercorn burger and by the first couple bites I wish I had gotten my own! They are juicy, smokey, and cooked to perfection. Yumm yum yum! We did not get a side because we were looking forward to the donuts for dessert! They have warm doughnuts with a side of salted butterscotch... to die for! 

Also on tap they have Senoran Root Beer... if you haven't tried it yet you need to, it is the best root beer around & I LOVE that it is on draft here, so cool!

I have been to The Grind a couple times now and everything has always been outstanding!
