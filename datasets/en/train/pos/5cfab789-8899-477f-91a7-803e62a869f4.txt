Truly as good as it gets.  Cute mash up of market, bakery, and pizzeria.  Best bakery in town.  As an out-of-towner, every year I make sure to stop in for a "Commuter" on croissant with a  vanilla latte.  The market includes local artist and unique gift shop items.

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED. (Unless they run out of croissants before you get one ;)
