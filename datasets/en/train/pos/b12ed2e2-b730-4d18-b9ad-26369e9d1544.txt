I am a regular of this establishment. I have tried all the main yogurt places in the area (Yogurtini, Yogurtland, and Mojo) and this is by far the best overall. Although they do not consistently have my favorite flavor, peanut butter, my boyfriend says their tart/original yogurt is the best. 

Topping selection is great, and they even have peanut butter sauce. I just wish they had more flavor choices.
