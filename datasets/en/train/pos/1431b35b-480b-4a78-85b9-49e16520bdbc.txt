Was out on my day off and happened to drive by this wonderful new brewery in Phoenix and sure lucky I did!!! The Brew master was super cool and gave me a tour of the brewery and a ton of information that was great for a small home brewer like myself. Then got to sample some of their exceptional brew. I really liked there IPA! If you are ever in the neighborhood I highly recommend stopping in!!!
