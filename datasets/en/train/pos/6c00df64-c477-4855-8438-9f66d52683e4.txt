Can you tell I do enjoy nice restaurants?  I think this is my favorite restaurant, EVER.  Very cozy atmosphere and very relaxing dining experience.  The white truffle macarooni and cheese is melt in your mouth good, and anyone who goes there should try that as a side dish.  The outdoor patio is amazing and I would have loved to eat there but it was December and cccold outside.  I had the salmon w/ baby cabbage.  OUT OF THIS WORLD!  Our server was excellent and very attentive.  And the dessert was scrumdilicious.  Also the presentation of the meals is like art work and yet tasty.  The building used to be the home of a man named Lon, a cowboy who happened to be an artist.  The area where this restaurant is located is just beautiful.  I highly recommend this place.  I can't wait to return.  Hopefully soon.
