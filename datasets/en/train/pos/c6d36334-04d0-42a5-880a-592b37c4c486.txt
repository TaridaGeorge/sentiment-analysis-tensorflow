We hired Ray the DJ for our wedding and were so happy we did. We worked with Brenda, in the main office, who was consistently professional. Our DJ, Randall, was responsive to our requests, answered all our questions, and was a great MC/host for the evening. Everyone loved the music and had a great time. We would hire them again and highly recommend them. Fantastic job!
