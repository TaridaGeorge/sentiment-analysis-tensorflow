Great taste, wide range of choice at very affordable prices. Special recommendation -- the cold noddle. Wow! it's the breez for the summer in the Sun Valley. Both my son and daughter love it. My wife and I like its set lunch, so many different choices and we just came and every time we ended up getting something great. So, just come and try it out yourselves. ;-)
