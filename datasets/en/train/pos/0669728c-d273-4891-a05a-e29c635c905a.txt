This is such a beautiful stadium to go to and relax at, everything is so close that it only take 10-15 mins to get where you want to be, and on top of that, there is westgate shopping center that is right there with all the bars and night clubs to go to after the games. I recommend UOPX Stadium over any other in the valley because its clean and any seat in the house is a great one.!!!!Plus the weather is always great!!
