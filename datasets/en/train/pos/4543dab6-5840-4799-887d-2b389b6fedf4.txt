I love hanging out at gangplank. I know my way around technology but that's about it. I've gotten so much advice and great tips from the regular faces that I try to visit at least once a week. It's a great place to sit and work for hours on end. It's an open workspace and collaborative environment. I highly suggest it for anyone looking to escape a cube or even their home office.
