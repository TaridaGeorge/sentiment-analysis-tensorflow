My husband and I recently enjoyed lunch at "The Deli".  We started off with the caprese salad, which the homemade mozzarella was Divine
My husband enjoyed the hot Italian sandwich, and I was very pleased with the roasted chicken sandwich. The portions were large.
The staff was friendly and the service they provided was top notch
Upon leaving, the owner took the time to show us their next door dining area that opens at 4pm. An absolutely perfect place to enjoy a glass of wine with good company. We look forward to doing just that soon.
