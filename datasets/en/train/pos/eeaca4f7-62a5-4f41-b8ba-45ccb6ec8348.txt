Happy hour or not, I love 5th and Wine. They have a great selection of wine ($5 on HH,) the service is always great and the food is tasty. There are few better ways to spend a Friday afternoon than sipping on a glass of red and nibbling on apple/fig bruschetta. Delish. Did I mention $5 glasses of wine?! They have a nice patio and it's a great way to enjoy Old Town Scottsdale. 5th and Wine, you hold my heart and taste buds in the palm of your hand.
