If you need to get pampered in Cave Creek this is definitely the place to do it. We visited by chance recently during a festival held in the shopping complex. The facility itself is a design marvel (designed by the owners and custom built - they own the building) . The owners and really hands on and passionate. They offer haircuts, manicures, pedicures, facials, massages, and a dozen other spa services. Treat yourself to Salon Mila!
