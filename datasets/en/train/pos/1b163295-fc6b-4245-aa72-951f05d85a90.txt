If you are one of those people that says, "I could eat breakfast for every meal", then you cannot miss this place in Scottsdale... coffee, eggs, french toast, and their bacon.. all amazing... so get their early and try to remember why in the world you would do the things you did last night... if you dont remember, order another coffee... its good.
