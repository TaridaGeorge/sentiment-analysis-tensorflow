Don't even hesitate about going here. Stop reading reviews and go! Great beers, REALLY good food. Try their wings if you like them - I always loved the Spicy Thai. I moved away from AZ unfortunately, but this is one of those places that I miss and will have to stop in every single time I come back. Go and have one of their beers for me :) Hop Knot or the Hefeweizen were my favorites.
