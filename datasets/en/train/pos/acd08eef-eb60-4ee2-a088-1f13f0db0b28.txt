I have ate at the mesa, Tempe, Gilbert & Scottsdale locations. The mood is definitely better in the Tempe and Scottsdale locations. All have very upbeat and exceptionally friendly staff. You can't eat here without trying the pizookie ... The best by far!! No matter what location, be prepared to wait at least 30 mins and longer during popular dinner hours. Well worth your time!
