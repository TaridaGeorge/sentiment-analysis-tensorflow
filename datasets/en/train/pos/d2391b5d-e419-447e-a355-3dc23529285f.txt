Favorite little restaurant in Scottsdale ;) Delicious French cuisine, very cool decor and environment and reasonably priced for the quality of food. Been there many times and will continue to go whenever I'm trying to impress an out of towner... the only bad experience I had was when one of the hostesses said she couldn't seat me and my date w/o a reservation for an hour at like 6pm on a weeknight when the place was basically empty... After badgering her a little she accommodated, but made me feel like I was in Curb Your Enthusiasm or something.

I suggest the Escargot and the Steak Frites, c'est fantastique!

Cheers!
