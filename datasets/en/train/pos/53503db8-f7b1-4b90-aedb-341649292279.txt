Hmmm. Macademia Nut Chicken I will push on people till i am hoarse. It's fantastic and if you like mashed potatoes with lumps.. you'll be extra happy..Its the perfect dish! Beware though it's heavy so i don't suggest it for lunch. Their HH is excellent.. LOVE their scampi pizza. Salmon Wasabi sashimi & jalapeno Yellowtail sashimi ain't too shabby either.
