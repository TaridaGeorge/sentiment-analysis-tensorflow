Next Aesthetics is a jewel of a discovery! Maureen,  the owner and  provider, has done filler and botox on me now for a couple of years. She has also helped  treat my melasma by doing a few Skin Medica vitalize chemical peels at a great price. The results were fantastic! I also purchase my Latisse from Maureen and, trust me ladies, this product really really works. Maureen works with integrity, is highly professional and personable. Maureen takes the time to listen to a Women's Wants!  Her experience and knowlege are top notch. I later learned that Maureen  is an Asthetic R.N who trains doctors and nurses how to administer injectables. I knew I was in the right place! I am a business owner and dental hygienist. I highly recommend Next Asthetics to all my friends, family, patients and clients!
