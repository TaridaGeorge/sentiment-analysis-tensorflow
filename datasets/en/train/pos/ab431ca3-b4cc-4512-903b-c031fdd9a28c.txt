Wow this place is really special! We tried a nice variety of breakfast food, all was 5 stars. 

chorizo and eggs: we are chorizo and eggs enthusiast but like it mexican style. Asked the waitress if that is how they are served here and she said yes. And they were amazing! Even better than other real Mexican restaurants

french toast: looks like when you get it is gonna be nasty too thin. But the dip they use on it of "french" or whatever you wanna call it has a tasty cinnamon / vanilla flavor. Really good, and the maple syrup they give you is tasty.

biscuits and gravy: wonderful, perfect biscuits and delicious sauce. Not greasy at all.

cookies: tried the chocolate chip and chocolate cookies. Both were nice and fresh and not too cooked and not under cooked either.
