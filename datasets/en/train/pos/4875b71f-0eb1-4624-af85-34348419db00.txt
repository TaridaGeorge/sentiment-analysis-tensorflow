If you're looking for an awesome breakfast place in the east valley, look no further. The eggs Benedict, breakfast burritos, and platters are to die for. The service is second-to-none, and the atmosphere is clean and cozy. There can be quite a line for lunch, but the service is quick, so don't.be intimidated. The entrance is easy to miss, and the menu is on the small side, but you simply can't go wrong with anything on it. It's pretty quiet in the morning, so it's a great spot to enjoy breakfast and read a bit of news before heading into the office.
