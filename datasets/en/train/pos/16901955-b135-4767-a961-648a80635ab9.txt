Ok, so I found my Doctor totally by freak accident.  Last year, I was in need of some medical attention, and did not have a regular Doctor out here.  I checked with my health insurance company, and found this place.

There are a few main reasons I like it here.  First, they have several different doctors that practice here.  Their a team of sorts.  They also have 2 nurse practitoners that work here as well, that seem to be very qualified.  But, my selling point?  Saturday morning hours!!!  I now find that he convienience of going in to the Drs on a Saturday is wonderful!!

This office is so clean, and so modern!  When I last met with the Nurse practioner, she was willing to electronically send my script to the Pharmacy of my choice!  NICE!

I love this place! I found my new doctors office.
