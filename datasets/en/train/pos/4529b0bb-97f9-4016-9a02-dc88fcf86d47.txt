WOW! Where has this gem been hiding? I tried a cheeseburger for lunch (my first visit). It was awesome. The place is really clean for a burger joint. I normally balk at paying more than $3 for a cheeseburger, but this thing is huge. I couldn't have eaten any fries even if I wanted to (too full).
The food was ready quick and I was thrilled that they were open at 10am (I have to get up at 4am every day and waiting until 11am to eat is too much for my rumbling tummy). I will try the Italian Beef sandwich on my next visit.
