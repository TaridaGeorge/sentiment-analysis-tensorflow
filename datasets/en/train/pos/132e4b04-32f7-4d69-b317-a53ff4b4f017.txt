The ultimate food for a broken heart/spirit. I was so wowed by tonight's service and cuisine, I would have to claim it an almost near religious experience. 

They totally catered to our off the menu request of an Alfredo, Spinach and creamy penne combo. Gave all the best bread, both garlic coated and plain, with olive oil and balsamic a girl or girls could ever ask for. I was going to add on wine to my dining experience, but figured I need to cut back on the alcohol, obviously its starting to do something to my psyche... 

Not impossible to find, despite my iPhone's horribly given directions. Quiet and quaint, and def worth every penny, I will be back to Sal's in the near future. Just on happier terms I hope!
