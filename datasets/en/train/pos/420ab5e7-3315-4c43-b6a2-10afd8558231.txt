Diamonds sports bar
This bar is the SHIT!  They have GREAT FOOD and awesome staff!  The atmosphere is nice and clean as well as the bar being surrounded with a ton of windows for plenty of natural sunlight to shine in!  It's a Chicago based bar with tons of big flatscreens all around.  They also provide a free shuttle service during spring training for all you Cub fans!   Prices are very reasonable along with the food!  I give this bar 5 stars and HIGHLY recommend it!!  

p.s. It's no longer Sluggo's, the bar in which I'm referring and what is the previous Sluggo's is DIAMONDS Sports Bar and Grill.
