I have been coming here for at least 20 years (since I was a little girl!) and even though I now live an hour away, I still drive there for breakfast! Their French toast is the best in the valley (and trust me I have tried at least 20 other breakfast joints). I also love their huevos con chorizo and their eggs Benedict! It really doesn't get any better then this place! As for the wait, yea there always is one BUT, they take reservations over the phone so the wait is nothing if you call ahead.
