Best pizza I've had in Tempe, brick oven and thin, most authentic pizza I've had in the valley, Incredibly tasty, more 'date night' then 'order out' because of the high price, about $16 for a 12" (only size available), all the pizza is cooked by this one awesome Bosnian dude who makes all of the pizza, if you have ever tried the pizza over in Europe you will love this place
