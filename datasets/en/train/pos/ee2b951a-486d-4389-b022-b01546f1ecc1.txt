I have read the previous reviews and was not sure if we should try it but what a great place.  Great food and service.  Look folks, this is not your typical chain place and is a little more expensive but it's in a beautiful center and the place is really cool.  I had the Jerk Salmon and it was the best salmon I have had in Phoenix.  My server was great, she joked around with my kids and made it a great experience.
