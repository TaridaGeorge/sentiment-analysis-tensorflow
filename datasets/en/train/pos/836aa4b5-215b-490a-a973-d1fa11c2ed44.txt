Found this place on Yelp last Sunday after searching for anything that was open downtown after 9pm. So glad this amazing place was close by and we chose to have dinner here! It wasn't busy when we got there, but a few more tables filled up as the night went on. I had the apple bellini to drink and it was delicious and so cute with an apple slice right in it. Started off with the beef tacos and were blown away. It was the perfect mix of sweet, spicy, creamy, and crunchy! I literally could have eaten a platter of them. For my entree I chose the Apricot BBQ Chicken sandwich and it was sooo good! I definitely recommend this place to anyone in the downtown Phoenix area and I plan on going back very soon! Amazing food, drink, and a beautiful atmosphere!!
