Wow!  Christopher's is a great restaurant.  I am still new to the area and it was a little hard to locate, but worth the search.  The BEST calamari I have had.  The salmon was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sauce to season.  The Lobster pot pie was excellent.  And the service......Fantastic!  The Bartender for happy hour, the host, support staff and the server were amazing.  I was there on business and they knew when to approach and when to stay back.  Water was always filled but never intrusive.  This may be the best restaurant in Arizona.
