I called Cloud 9 on a Wednesday morning last month and the owner was at my door before noon for a price quote.  Jim provided an accurate estimate to lay irrigation, sod, rocks, and extend my patio. By Sunday morning all of the work was complete and far exceeded all my expectations. 

After about a week I called Cloud 9 to check my irrigation timing after the temperature dropped. Jim answered the phone again and was at my house within 24 hours. I highly recommend this company.
