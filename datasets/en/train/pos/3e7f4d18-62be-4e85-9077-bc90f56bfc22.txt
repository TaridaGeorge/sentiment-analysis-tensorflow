This is not the one I was looking for. The one we ate at was the one in Apache junction arizona. However it doesnt matter since all of them are great. The burgers are made with fresh meat and the french fries are cut right there and fried in good oil. The price is unbeatable and the line moves really fast. We have eaten in at least 10 different in and outs and they are all fantastic and the price is right. Try them.
