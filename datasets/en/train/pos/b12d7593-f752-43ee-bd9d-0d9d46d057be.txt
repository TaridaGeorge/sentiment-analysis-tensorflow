If you get a chance, check out Friday Night Open Mic! Incredible local Talent!
This was our first time, but it won't be our last! My son and his friend performed, (they were awesome)! Jacob and Caleb on Guitar...
Great place, super cozy, the staff "ROCKS"! 
Best Coffee, sandwiches, pastries, cool people, what more do you want?
Anyway...LOVE the place!
