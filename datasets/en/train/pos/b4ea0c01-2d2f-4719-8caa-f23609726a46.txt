This place has a nice twist on Italian.  The atmosphere is great its wide open.  You can see everything in the kitchen from meats being cut to things being cooked, there should be an Food Network focus show done here!  The lighting is wonderful, I even picked up some interior design ideas.  The food was extremely tasty, a little on the salty side,  but it probably was the pruiscuitto.   The wait staff is extremely friendly and there is complementary valet.  North, I've made a new friend, I'm excited to get to know you and your menu in the future and develop a tasty culinary relationship.  FYI-this is a great date place.  It will delight your date as its not trite.
