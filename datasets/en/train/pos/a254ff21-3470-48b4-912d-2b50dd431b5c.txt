GREAT little cafe.  AWESOME baked goodies.  I had the Thai chicken wrap and was very pleased with the freshness of it.  The veggies added a great crunch.  The chicken was thick cut - sort of like if you made it at home.  

All their sandwiches/wraps come with a mini cookie.  I also got a pecan bar to take home for later and was really pleased with that when I got around to it the next day.
