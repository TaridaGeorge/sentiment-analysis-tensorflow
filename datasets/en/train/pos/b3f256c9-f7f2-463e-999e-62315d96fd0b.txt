On a Saturday night, grab 6-8 of your closest friends, roll up early and park yourself in the bar for the evening.  Park yourself because the martinis are endless and well maybe that's why everything is so fun at City Hall!   They literally come with a shaker.  Great Lemondrop Martinis (they make the lemon flavored vodka themselves) and one of the best petite filets I've had around town.  There is always a Michael Bublee/Sinatra guy singing the night away and plenty of seats for your beau or date for the evening to watch the game while the girls people watch.  The service can be iffy if you get too into cocktails and neglect to order much food, but generally such a great spot. So put on your favorite dress and sip martinis at city hall this Saturday night!
