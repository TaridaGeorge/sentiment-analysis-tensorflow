The nesting phase.  A period of time in which you become more interested in the thread count of sheets than the lastest denim brand to hit the market.  Yes.  I am there.  And I have found my ultimate home store.  Haus has opened a new big airy store in Scottsdale and I absolutely love everything in it.  Dwell and Area linens.  Angela Adams rugs.  Mid-century modern decor.  Ultra hip (and comfortable) furniture.  I don't know enough about home decor to drop many names.  Just take my word for it.  If you like modern design, this is the store for you.
