You know what I love about this place? Everything. If you are from Chicago, you will really love it. Great hotdogs exactly like you remember them, Italian beefs that could possibly rival places in Chicago. That's hard to do.  I tried some Jay's potato chips instead of fries on my last visit since I have never seen them before outside of Chicago- delicious! 

They always have a Classic Rock Chicago radio station playing and when I'm here, I could swear that I am back in the windy city.   The booths are very nice and comfortable and each one has its own Chicago street named after it which is a very nice touch. Even the place mat has dozens of Chicago trivia on it: did you know that Chicago has 29 miles of lake front and 15 miles of public beach?
