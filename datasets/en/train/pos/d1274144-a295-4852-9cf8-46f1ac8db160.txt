Been going here for years, when I was 19 I lived in Miami. Just a mere 20 min drive was a J's location in Plantation. By 21 moved to MI, there was a J's in Novi. What I religiously ordered was the J's Salad with Honey Mustard & the main entree, the amazing Lime Chicken. No Lime Chicken, wtf! So I opted for the Rotisserie Chicken with their amazing smashed potatoes. Chicken was so juicy & the skin was something to write home about. Place is still a 5 star in my book. The ambiance is perfect, nice and dim. J's is worth the 6 hour drive to Phoenix.
