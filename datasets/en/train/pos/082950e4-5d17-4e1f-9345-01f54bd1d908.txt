Searching for Gluten Free. Found Great Harvest Bread Co.
Love that they have fresh baked Gluten Free Breads every Tuesday.
Very friendly and helpful. The regular GF bread is great, as well as the GF Cinnamon. Can't wait to try the Banana and the Pumpkin Breads.
It's nice to have a local bakery making GF breads that taste great.
