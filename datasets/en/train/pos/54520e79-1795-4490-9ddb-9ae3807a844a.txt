Let's play a little word association. I'm going to mention two words to you and you gage your reaction.

Chicken and waffles.

Was your reaction "ew?" If so, go ahead and skip this review and go wait for a table at Chili's because Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is not for you.

If your reaction was "Oh HELLLL Yeah!" then head on over the South Phoenix for some of the best soul food Phoenix has to offer. 

Definitely not health conscious food, but if you are gonna cheat on your diet, Lo-Lo's would be the place to do it. The fried chicken is crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. The sides are tasty and plentiful. The waffles are out of this world. By far the best waffles I've ever had. The red velvet cake is dense and moist.
