Best grocery store I've ever patronized, because the staff is so helpful and friendly. They take all my coupons, even if slightly expired, and always have resolved questions to my satisfaction. Good selection, and when they do run out of something, there is never a problem getting a raimcheck. I even forgot to get a raincheck once on a Tuesday, and customer service gave me one on the following day after the ad change. I have ordered ectra cases of a product, which came in a couple of days later, honored the sale price, and let me use coupons on each one.
