This course a dream for a real, I mean real golfer.  It's little ways out from central Scottsdale, but it's worth the drive.  The course is surrounded with native Arizona desert with no homes nearby.  I have played Troon North, Boulder, TPC, Kierland, Gray Hawk, and others, but my favorite is We-Po-Pa.
