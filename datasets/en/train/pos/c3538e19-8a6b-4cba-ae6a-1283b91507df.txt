this was my favorite bar in all of Arizona (i only went to a few bars though so maybe my opinion isn't valid). in didn't have that college bar vibe of pretentious abercrombie and fitch wearing frat boys, and tan and blond girls gone wild type of girls. it more or less is a dive bar, but it isn't seedy at all. it has a great staff, and they have good appetizers. during happy hour, i got a HUGE vegetable plate for under 4 bucks. there is a pool table here, darts, and a big TV. my favorite drink here is was the hurricane the cute bartender made for me. i miss this place.
