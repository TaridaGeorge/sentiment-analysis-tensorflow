My favorite pizza, alas, since moving to the east coast in '01 it's a rare treat afforded only on trips home.  Seriously, though, Barro's has the best chewy flavorful crust and sauce.  They are generous with the cheese and veg (my preferred toppings) and the veg are fresh and tasty.

This Greek style pizza they have out east just can't compare to a little taste of home.
