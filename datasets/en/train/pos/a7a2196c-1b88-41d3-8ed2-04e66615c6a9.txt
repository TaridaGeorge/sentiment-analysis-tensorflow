can i give 6 stars?

reheated leftovers last night and they were delicious. not at all weird like leftovers can get.  AND i was full when we left the restaurant with our leftovers, i didn't think i brought that much home...i was full again last night. i am so happy with this place!

i will probably want to go here again this saturday night!
