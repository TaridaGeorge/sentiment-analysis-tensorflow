My new fav!! :) We have to go down town about once a week, and we always end up eating bad food, but I wanted something healthy, and I noticed That's A Wrap. I ordered the Price of Thai or something like that on Monday and it was great. Both the Hubby and I were down town on Wednesday and we were starving, so we went back and he got the buffalo 66 and I got the Who's the Turkey, ooohhhh my gosh they were AWESOME! the buffalo 66 could cure my hardcore wing cravings and I have not stopped wanting another Who's the Turkey! I am going to go down the line and try every wrap every time I get to go!
