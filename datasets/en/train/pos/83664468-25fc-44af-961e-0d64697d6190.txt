This place takes all 5 stars for me.  Keep in mind, this is a cafe at an airport.  Their breakfast is good old fashion diner food, and they do it well.  However, what really makes this place for me is the service and view.  My family loves coming to watch the planes and eat a leisurely Sunday breakfast.  They are very kid friendly and my daughter always asks to go visit "the nice ladies with food at the airport."  I will remain a frequent flier.  (I know, it was lame!)
