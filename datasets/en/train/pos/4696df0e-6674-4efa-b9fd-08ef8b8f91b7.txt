I have had this spot on my list to hit for over a year. My friend came into town from the Bay and I snagged her as my LoLo's date. 

We hit the place for a late breakfast on a Sunday. When we entered, we were greeted like family. The service was personal and quick. I ate every bit of my two piece and waffle. My sweet tea was served in a big mason jar and it was perfect. When we left, I felt like family. Many thank yous and good byes from the owner and crew. 

I am offically addicted! I am hoping now that my out of town date is gone, I can find someone else to soak up this amazing place.
