Delicious food, awesome music, great beer selection, and awesome overall setting and staff.  You can't go wrong here!  Happy hour, dinner, lunch, anytime and anything on the menu is sooo good!  Very original music on the jukebox you won't hear anywhere else.  I love this place!  The cajun chicken pasty and the pasta salad (among many others) are favs!  Vegetarian options are plentiful :)
