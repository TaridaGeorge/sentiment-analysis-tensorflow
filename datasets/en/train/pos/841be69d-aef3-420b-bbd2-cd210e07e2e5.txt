Was there during a business trip to Phoenix.  Of course, I usually hit the casinos and  a co-worker recommended this Casino instead of the other one I usually go to (Wild Horse Pass).

Well I was hungry and the other choices didn't seem too appealing so I chose this steakhouse.  And it was a GREAT choice!  *pat on the back*

The steak was amazing and the service was impeccable.  They were friendly without being snobby like in some places.  The bread was good as well.

This will be a regular stop for me every time I go to Phoenix from now on.  HIGHLY recommended.  So good that my mouth is watering right now as I write this.
