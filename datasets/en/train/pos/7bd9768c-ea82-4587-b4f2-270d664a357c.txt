This is one of my favorite places in the city.  1/2 price bottle of wine from 3 pm to close, great bar drinks (pricey yes) and simple but good food.  Piano player is unbelievable!   Has a feeling that just maybe and I mean maybe - Phoenix has a little bit of culture.  I have continued to go to My Florist Cafe for over 6 years and being from Seattle where culture will jump out and grab you My Florist always delivers a little "Seattle" - thank you and keep it up guys!
