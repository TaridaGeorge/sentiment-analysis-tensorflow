I had my first visit to Fate Brewing Company yesterday and was really pleased with the experience. First, the atmosphere is bright, clean, and inviting.  It is relatively small, but I like the intimate feel. The beers were very good and the happy hour prices are fantastic. I also had one of their wood-fired pizzas and thought it was excellent...maybe not Grimaldi's level, but very good.  Last but not least, the wait staff was very attentive and accomodating and you got the sense that they enjoy working at Fate. It had a close knit feel that I really liked.
