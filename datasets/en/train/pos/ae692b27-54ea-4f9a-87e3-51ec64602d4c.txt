Best Gnocchi and meat sauce i've ever had.   A friend of mine, who's  a friend of Sima and Marcellino brought me here.  I'm always apprehensive about trying something new when it comes to Italian food.. but so glad I did.  They make everyone feel welcome and well taken cared of.  The servers posses an almost encyclopedic knowledge of their food offerings.  The ambiance is very nice, who knew it was in a strip mall?  My experiences are from 2006, so I'm a little late to the review table, but I had to throw my 2 cents in.  Once you get over the slight sticker shock, you will definitely contemplate how soon your return will be.  Only bummer is I believe they close during the summer months.
