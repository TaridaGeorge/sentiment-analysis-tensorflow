I can't help but laugh at reviewers who spent 5 days in Italy and think this qualifies them to know more about gelato than someone who spent most of his life there(Arlechhino's owner). And additionally spent over a year learning from a (Italian) master gelato maker (in Italy) for no pay.

Really, ignore those fools. 

Arlecchino still makes the best effing gelato I've ever had. Anywhere.

And anyone who tells you it tastes just like any other gelato has a broken brain.  Or tongue. Or both. Or is possibly high on crack. Or maybe employed by Gelato Spot. Take your pick.

P.S.  the owners and staff are awesome.
