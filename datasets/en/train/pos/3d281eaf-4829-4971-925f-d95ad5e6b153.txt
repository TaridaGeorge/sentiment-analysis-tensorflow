i have eten at Sierra Bonita several times.  The food is ALWAYS consistent, and some of the best eating in Phoenix.  The atmosphere is amazing and service is always top notch.  SB has figured out how to be a great neighborhood restaurant with world class food.  The style is southwestern with Mexico City influences - truly amazing.
