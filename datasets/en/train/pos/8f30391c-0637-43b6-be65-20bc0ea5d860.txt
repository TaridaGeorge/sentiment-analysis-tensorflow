A favorite spot of mine in Phoenix.  Always friendly, even to a party of one businessman. Service is extremely attentive an the atmosphere top of the line. I usually order the filet, and have never been disappointed. Also excellent choice of domestic wines. Good crowd. Sometimes I sit at a table near the bar which makes the view more interesting. Some classy ladies eat here.
