Right next door to where we just moved in to and even while we were moving we could smell the pit. :) When I saw the building I already knew it had potential. 

I was told this location was the oldest and had better BBQ than others so with a Groupon Now I figured "why not". We were not disappointed whatsoever. This coming from a person who only eats his own BBQ and my family from Mississippi!

Had the 3 meat sampler to give all a whirl. Best were the ribs. Second, the beef. Third place tie goes to the pork and chicken but the sauce was great. Actually used it on my own slow cooked pulled pork for Super Bowl Sunday. 

Overall. I loved it.
