Good prices and relatively quick turnaround. I like that it is run by a few ladies and it's like walking into your mom's sewing room. Lastly, I was extremely happy with the results of shortening the hem on 2 skirts, replacing a zipper on a pair of jeans and patching jeans as well. AND she stitched up a tear I had in a pair of dress pants when I picked up my stuff at no charge.
