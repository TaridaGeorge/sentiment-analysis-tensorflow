One of the best unique boutiques I have stayed in...in a LONG TIME. The service was fantastic, and rooms are very artsy and warm. Not to mention the restaurant, Gallo Blanco Cafe, is a great place to go mix with locals and have a glass of wine by the pool.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CLARENDON AND LOOK FORWARD TO STAYING THEIR ON MY NEXT TRIP TO PHOENIX
