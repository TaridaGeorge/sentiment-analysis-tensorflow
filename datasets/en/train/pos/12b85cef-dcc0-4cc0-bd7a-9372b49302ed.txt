Took advantage of their easy online ordering this week. Just breezed in on Saturday morning and picked up my order. The larger cake, decorated with flower and princess hat. Red Velvet Chip cake was moist and delicious, frosting perfect. Don't complain about the frosting people. You can ask for a drizzle which is less, the regular petals or additional frosting petals. Seriously the amount of frosting is a stupid thing to complain about when you can state your preference at the time your order so you get what you want. Duh.
