When I was pregnant with my daughter, this place had the only food I could hold down.  Love their steak and garlic mashed potatoes!  They have the best house salad I've ever had, and the croissant is fantastic.  They have great service.  Can be pricey, but totally worth it.  I'd pick it over Texas Roadhouse everytime (which is how we ended up there in the first place!)
