I can't say enough about this coffee shop!  Their selection of different coffees is outstanding, and our entire office is hooked on their Papau New Guinea bean.  The customer service is phenomenal, they always offer to give extra filters or scoops or anything else you need with your purchase.  There's not a better coffee shop around!
