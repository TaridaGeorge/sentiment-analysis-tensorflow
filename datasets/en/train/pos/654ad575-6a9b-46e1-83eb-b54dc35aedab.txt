This is just my opinion, but they have some of the best burgers ever! I'm from Los Angeles, so I was very happy to hear that we had an In-N-Out in avondale! It's not for everyone though. The burgers here do taste different, and so do the fries. I feel that it's because the fries are never frozen and are made on the spot. ( Some people are used to the fake greasy McD fries ) I think I saw something about the burger never being frozen too? I could be wrong though. 

TASTE GREAT! You should at least try it.
