Back to the roots is what I say.  NOTHING will beat moms cooking but this place is definately a soul soothing gem hidden in the Mekong plaza.  Charming food and friendly places but its definately something for the adventurous palate if you'd not accustomed to the cuisine of the Phillippines.  Try the Bangus (marinated fish dish) served ith rice and Eggplant.  Exotic, tasty and stays in the box.  If you're looking for more americanized anything in the BBQ region but if you'd like to get a taste of real Filipino food the Sinagang with the fish sauce is AMAZING!
