Wonderful! We just moved into the neighborhood and decided to try Roma Garden based on the reviews here on Yelp. Needless to say, we were not disappointed. It is a family owned restaurant, and the service was extremely friendly, and treat you like family. Try the pork chops! The bread and salads were also delicious. Can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu!
