I've been here a handful of times, but most recently found myself here for dinner and drinks on a random Wednesday evening.  We found some seats at the bar, and enjoyed several of the different brews they had on tap.  I finally tried out the grilled cheese and tomato soup- delicious as described below by several.  

I love The Roosevelt, it fits in well with Central Phoenix's ability to turn historic homes into quaint businesses.  Check it.
