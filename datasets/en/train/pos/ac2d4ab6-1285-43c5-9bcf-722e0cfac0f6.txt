We have been coming to Hana since it has opened. This place has replaced our need to go to zen 32 for sushi because the service and the food us 10 times better. If you want fresh fish and great staff thus is the place to be. 

Lori the owner is always there when we come and she always makes sure to say hi even when she has a house full. 

We love the sushi especially the volcano roll and the spicy tuna. We also order the hamachi Kama (sp?) which is a cooked underbelly of tuna. Amazing! 

Try this place if you want great sushi!
