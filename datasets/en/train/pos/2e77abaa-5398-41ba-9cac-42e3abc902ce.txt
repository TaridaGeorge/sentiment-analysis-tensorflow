If you are looking for dive bar welcome to the deep end! Jupes is a step into the Minnesota/North Dakota backroads less the gunracks and mudboggin. 

Jupe's is a great place for a cold beer or a stiff drink. Tap is limited to Bud, Bud light, and Miller light. The mini fridge has a good selection of jelloshots and the bar is otherwise well stocked.

Come on down and get you drink on.
