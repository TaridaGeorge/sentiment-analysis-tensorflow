I visit both the Tempe and Phx locations on the regular. 
Best americanos in town. Period. 
The vibe is great in both, a sort of industrial bohemian one.

The little details of this place is what really makes  it for me:
I just loooove that they use clover organic milk (my personal fav in the world of milk) on top of roasting their own beans. Oh, and they have free water out in the lobby with REUSABLE cups! So great! They really aren't snooty about their coffee, even though they ought to be... Ah, I am in love with this place. 
The prices are really good for what you are getting too!
