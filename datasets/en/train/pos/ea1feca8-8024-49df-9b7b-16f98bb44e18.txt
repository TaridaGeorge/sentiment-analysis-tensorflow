Love MWC!!! 
Went for an after dinner drink for my sisters birthday. We were greeted by the owner with a friendly smile. Katie was our server. She was very knowledgeable. I told her I wanted a Cab, and she brought me a lil piece of heaven. My sisters and I shared the cheese platter and it was more than enough for the 3 of us. The entire staff was super friendly. I will be returning to MWC for sure, whether it's for date nite or girls nite I can't wait to go back!! Thanks again Katie you were amazing!!!
