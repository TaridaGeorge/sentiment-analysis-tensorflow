Good place for a cheap lunch that hits the spot, you can buy by the slice, or get 2 slices and a drink, a slice/salad/drink and so on.  They have a daily specialty pizza that you can get as well for a few cents extra.  I always seem to forget which slice goes with each day, but the buffalo chicken pizza rocks!
