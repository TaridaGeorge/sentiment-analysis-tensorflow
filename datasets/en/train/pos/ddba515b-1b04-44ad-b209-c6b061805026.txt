5 stars for the excellent service and delicious food! Everything we had was great but the one thing that stood out for me was the Green Chile Mac 'N Cheese!! Thanks to all previous yelpers for this recommendation! : ) Neither the green chile nor the cheese was overpowering but with each bite, there was definitely a "kick" to it!  YUMMY!!!!  I am now on a mission to get that recipe!!! : )
