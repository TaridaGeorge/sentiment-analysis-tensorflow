I love, love, love, loved this place. We stopped on a Sunday afternoon, shortly after I stepped off the plane at Sky Harbor and was, of course, starving! I got a good eggs and bacon breakfast, my husband got a burger, perfect! We had the nutella crepes for dessert and, OH MY! they were so yummy. The service was very good, and they were very accommodating to our motorcycle helmets and my backpack from traveling. I will be going back!
