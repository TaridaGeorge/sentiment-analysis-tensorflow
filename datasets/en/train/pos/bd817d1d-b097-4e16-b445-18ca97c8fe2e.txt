I love this place.  The Southwest egg rolls are to die for!  I always get the same meal (chicken romano) because it is SO good.  Maybe some day I will try another menu item, but we don't get to come here often so when we do, I get what I know is good.  The seasonal pumpkin cheesecake is SO good.  We have always had great service too!  Its pricey, but worth it.
