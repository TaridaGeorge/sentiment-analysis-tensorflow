really like this place.  if you work or live near the downtown area it's a breath of fresh air and don't get me wrong, I love Starbucks, just get tired of it from time to time.  Giant's coffee is every bit as good as Sbux, but be prepared to spend some $ there.  A yogurt and 12 oz. coffee is nearly $10!  Very good food, coffee and service and delightful when the weather is nice and the front doors to the street are open!
