Best Indian food in the valley. I've gone to quite a few places and none of them are as good as this. The place is never too busy so it is a quiet experience, but the staff are always wonderful, and recognize you when you come back. I recommend the chicken curry, vegetable pakoras, and aloo matar. 5 STARS!
