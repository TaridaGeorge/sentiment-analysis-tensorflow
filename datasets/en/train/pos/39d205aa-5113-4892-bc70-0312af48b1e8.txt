You can't help but love The Bad Donkey. The food is fresh and tasty, the crew is friendly. I always feel welcome when I walk in. I usually get the pizza , the Grass on a Roll veggie sandwich is excellent too -- and recommended by my wife.

Now that they've expanded the dining area and added the Dinky Donkey ice cream shop, you can spend all afternoon there.

Haven't tried the weekend breakfast burritos yet, but will do so soon.
