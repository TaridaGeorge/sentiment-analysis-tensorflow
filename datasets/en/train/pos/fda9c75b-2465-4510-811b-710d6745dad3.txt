Kinda torn between a 4 and a 5 here.  Been here three times now and it's hard to have any complaints about the Vig.  I love the service, I love the ambience, and I am never disappointed with the food.  Here's the breakdown:
- Seasonal Veggie Plate: 4.5 Stars, so good!!
- Tandoori Flatbread: 5 Stars, loved it
- Chips, Salsa & Guac: 3 Stars, not bad, nothing special
- Hummus Plate: 4 Stars, very good hummus
- Vigan Sandwich: 3 Stars, fine but probably wouldn't order it again

The Vig has slowly worked its way into my list of default places to go, especially late night.  It doesn't hurt that they have lots of vegan and veg options!
