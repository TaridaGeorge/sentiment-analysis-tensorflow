If you want to have the time of  your life, you need to hit up this alley. The lanes are magic, we throw strikes out the yin-yang like there's no tomorrow...the seats around your lane make it so great as your friends are close for back-slapping, high fiving and and laughing in their FACE when you throw it down baby! There's a ton of room in the front for that moon walk you do when your pins go a flying...and they WILL. As far as bowling alleys go...THIS PLACE ROCKS! Oh, and they serve Bass on tap...and out of site onion rings---puh-leeze..there aint no cooler alley than this here alley my friend.
