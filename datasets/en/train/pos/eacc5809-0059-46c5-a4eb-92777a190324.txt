I spend too much money at Changing Hands.  I love the tea pots, the Annie Taintor garb, and most of all the books.  Shopping here makes me feel good about myself and the "You're supporting a local business.  Go you!"-esque signs add to my smug sense of satisfaction.

Beyond that, this place is just cool.  Between book readings, story time, and book clubs, there's always something wonderful going on.  The stamp cards are helpful for those of us addicted and the selection never fails to impress.

High-five, Changing Hands.
