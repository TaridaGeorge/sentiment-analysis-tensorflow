In between traveling to Denver, San Diego, Dallas and Seattle for work, picking up dress shirts for my husband, buying Christmas presents, cleaning my house, and all that other last minute holiday fun I found myself on more than one occassion with minimal food in my house, and a desire to not eat something loaded with fat, calories, cholesterol, and general nastiness.

Tossed to the rescue.

I love the concept. Salads made to your specifications and a selection of wraps. I opted to make my own salad and it was delicious. The veggies were crisp and the chicken I opted to add was tasty. Not the least bit dry and gristly. It was the perfect size and had the right amount of everything. Considering my other stop in the Promenade shops is usually In N' Out, this is a much better choice.
