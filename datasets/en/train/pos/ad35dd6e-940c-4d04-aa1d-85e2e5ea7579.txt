Paul is awesome!  He quickly diagnosed and fixed our system and also explained how everything works and how to do our own troubleshooting.  He not only changed out the damaged filter but also trimmed and re-set all the plastic tubing, drained and reset the tank and checked out all the manifold connections.  Totally professional and courteous. Very reasonable price!!! AAA+++ rating!!!
