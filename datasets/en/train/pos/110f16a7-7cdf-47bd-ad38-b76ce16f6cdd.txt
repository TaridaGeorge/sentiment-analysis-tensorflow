So here's the deal. Da Vang is a 5-star restaurant. Now, maybe not a AAA Destinations Monthly or Arizona Highways Magazine 5-star restaurant -- but a 5-star if you're a normal person who understands a pho restaurant in the Avenues is going to have some semblance of a pho restaurant in the Avenues. 

Now, we visited Da Vang on a day we had a pho hankering and Pho Tan was closed. Here is the scoop -- both places are good; Da Vang is better. Especially for sit down because their staff provides much better service. It's as simple as that.

Else, about $20 for two orders of pho, two rolls, two drinks. Can not be beat.
