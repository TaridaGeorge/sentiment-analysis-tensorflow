This place rocks!  I have been traveling to Tempe for work for the last 4 weeks and this place has killed every meal I have had (4 so far).  

First, best chicken wings EVER!!!  Crispy, spicy, and all drummettes.  Lips are still on fire and cannot wait to go back for more.

Second, for those on a diet---Beefarito salad is sooooooo good. Filling, wonderful flavor, huge pieces of spinach and low fat dressing.  MMMMMmmmmm.

Third, the smell of pizza is overwhelming.  I caved the first time and got a stuffed Chicago pizza that was out of this world.  Now I get the above-mentioned salad and I feel beyond satiated.  I would love it if they did pizza by the slice...hint....hint....

Finally, the NICEST waitresses/waiters!!!  Helpful, friendly, cute and attentive.

Legalize Marinara!!!!!!
