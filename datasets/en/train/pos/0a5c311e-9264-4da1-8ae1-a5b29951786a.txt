Loved this place! I am vegan, so got the grilled vegetable panini minus the cheese, and it was delicious. The fries on the side were some of the best fries i've ever had too. Gorgeous tranquil outdoor seating. A nice little secluded getaway for a bite to eat. Will return! Waitstaff was fantastic too.
