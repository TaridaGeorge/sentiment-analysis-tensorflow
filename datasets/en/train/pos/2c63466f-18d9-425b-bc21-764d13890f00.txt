So cool! Great space! Super stylish! Guy who slings the brew really seems passionate about his craft. I'm serious about my Iced Americanos, and Lo-Fi did *not* disappoint!  My only gripe is that they do not have decaf, however the owner did have a good reason.. he just can't seem to find decaf worth serving.. I'm really glad to have something this cool and stylin' in Downtown Mesa... worth a trip just to check it out! :3
