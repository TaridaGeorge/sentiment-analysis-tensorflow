One word: AWESOME. Only wish they were closer to my house in Buckeye. :) Have eaten here once...I got a chicken dish. It was the best faux chicken I think I've ever had. This place is such a refreshing change to all the other predictable meat-and-potatoes chain restaurants in the area. Two thumbs up!
