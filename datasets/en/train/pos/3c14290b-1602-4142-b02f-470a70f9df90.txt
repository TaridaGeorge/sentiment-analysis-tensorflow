So I was starting to feel like I was the last person on the planet to try Pita Jungle and the waalaaa! One pops up conveniently in Glendale. Since the opening I have been there twice and impressed both times. 

The first time I had the shwarma wrap- HUGE! I couldn't even eat half that sucker and I'm a big girl. The next time I went I had the chicken Philly pita and it was divine. The portions are huge and the hummus is delicious. We had no problems with service, everyone seemed to be on their toes.

We will definitely be going back...in fact Pita Jungle has moved into the "craving" category.
