What a special place this is! Lani, the owner, is just wonderful. And the place couldn't be cuter. It's always fun to pop in and see what's new. In October, there were these great little velvet pumpkins that my friends and I couldn't resist.

 Hmmm....I just realized that I'm due for a looky loo, so I'm heading there today!
