108 F one August evening, I scoured the streets of Phoenix looking for this tucked away little place.  When I arrived there was nobody in the outer courtyard, even with the misting vents going full blast, but the tiny interior was hopping.  I sat at the bar and had a mango mojito and the special, a delicious seafood enchilada with scallops and crab. 

Food aside, this place has a 5-star vibe.  There were young groups, older groups, couples on dates, businessmen, the whole range in this place.  It felt like eating at a your friendly neighborhood eatery but with hipper decor and enthusiastic, attentive staff.
