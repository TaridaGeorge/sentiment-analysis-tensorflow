I had dinner here with my wife for our anniversary and it was an amazing experience.  The service is classy & top notch.  The foods are amazing.  The Foie Gras is sublime and the Grilled Tenderloin of Buffalo is so tender, you don't really need to chew.  

I highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a unique experience.
