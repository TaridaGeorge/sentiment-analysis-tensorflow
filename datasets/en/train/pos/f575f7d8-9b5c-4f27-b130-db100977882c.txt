I've belonged to Costco since it was called Price Club. This branch is my favorite store in the valley. I couldn't live without the cheese bagels. I buy gas from here exclusively because it's cheaper than anywhere else.  The membership pays for itself, and I have a free American Express card. They recently put the slides of my childhood on DVD and did a beautiful job. I love to walk the aisles and see what's on display: cookware, dishes, jewelry, auto accessories, baked goods, wine, fruit, books, clothes. The holiday treats are better here than at any store in the valley.  My favorites are  the chocolates of the world and the chocolate macadamia nuts.  What makes this store so great are the people who work here. I've been to several different stores, but this one has the friendliest staff.
