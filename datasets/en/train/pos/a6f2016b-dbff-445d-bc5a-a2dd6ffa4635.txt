We cook a lot at home and have trouble finding a good restaurant that we really enjoy. In my opinion most of the restaurants in Phoenix are, well, unmemorable to say the least. We had lunch at Gallo Blanco recently for the first time and were pleasantly surprised. Our server recommended that we order the tacos and mix and match them. The tacos are little and each one is around $2. They were excellent. Even the salsa and guacamole were great. We will certainly be back again soon.
