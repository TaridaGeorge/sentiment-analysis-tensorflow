Bud (the owner and head mechanic) is the reason I keep buying Mercedes. Every time I look at another brand I wonder who will take care of it (and me and my wallet) when it breaks. MB Motors only works on Mercedes Benz (get it? M.B.?), but they handle everything from basic annual services to complex engine issues. The shop is family run and customers are treated as family and as friends. They are consistently fair and reasonable with pricing and honest about what repairs truly need to be made. Fair, reasonable, honest, mechanic - not much else I could possibly add to that.
