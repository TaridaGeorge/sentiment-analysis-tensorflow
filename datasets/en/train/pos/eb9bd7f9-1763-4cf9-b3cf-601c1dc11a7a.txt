Since my husband was out of town, I had let the yard get out of control! I had no idea who to call so went to Yelp for reviews and found Palms Away. Marcy and her crew are fabulous!  Marcy was prompt to return my calls and to service our lawn. They call you by name and explain everything they are going to do. They worked so hard on such a hot day in our front and back yard. They cut oleanders, replaced a tree, installed sod, planted flowers, trimmed everything,  etc. She picked out the most beautiful flowers and ficus tree for our yard. They did a meticulous job with a smile!  We will never use any other lawn service!
