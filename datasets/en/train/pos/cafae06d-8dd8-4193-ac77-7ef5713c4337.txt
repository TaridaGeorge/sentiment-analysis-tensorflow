Great for date nights, and special celebrations.  Gorgeous atmosphere, friendly staff, upscale (but healthy) and DELICIOUS food. A++ LOVE that the portions are normal sized instead of fattening super sized like most restaurants. You come in, eat a normal sized, healthy, delicious meal and go home feeling satisfied and content. If you like fine wines they have an huge selection of choices for you that are hard to find elsewhere. And if you do want to splurge on calories I highly recommend the saganaki (it's a yummy splurge and my kids LOVE that they set it on fire with a flourish and an "Ompah!").  

(Also have lots of gluten free choices - do you know how hard it is to find an upscale restaurant that's mostly gluten free?)  Love it!
