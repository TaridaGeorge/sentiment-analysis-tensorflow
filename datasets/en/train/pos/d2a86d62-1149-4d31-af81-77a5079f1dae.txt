My favorite breakfast joynt by far in North Pheonix.  I love the chorizo and eggs, but the meatlovers omlet, and pancakes are also some of the best I've had at any restaurant.  Ask for a side of the ancho chili sauce and pair it with the potatos or your omlet.  You won't be disappointed.  They have lunch and just recently added dinner so I'm stoked to try those soon.
