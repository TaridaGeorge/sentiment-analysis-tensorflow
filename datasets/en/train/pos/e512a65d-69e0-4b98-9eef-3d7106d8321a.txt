We stopped at the Chick Fil A in Casa Grande in late January on our way to California and then in early February on our way back.  I was so impressed with this Chick Fil A....as the earlier poster said, it is spotless and that includes the bathroom as well.  The staff is very friendly and the food is good.  Obviously I liked it if we came back on our return trip.
