I come here for lunch and dinner a few times a month (well maybe a little more frequently than that now)! The menu is simple, but the sandwiches are prepared perfectly and they have the best bloody marys in all of phoenix! Service is usually fast and friendly (unless you go on first Friday, then it's a nuthouse).
