Fantastic! You get the idea from all the reviews, here's the compacted version:

1) Amazing architecture - inside YES, even from the outside alone (footbridge, garden area on East side, fountain, etc)
2) To see a performance - amazing acoustics, the wooden walls/ceiling create a fantastic venue!
3) Wedding - friend of mine just had wedding reception here, spectacular - they use Santa Barbara Catering (top 3 in the Valley - AMAZING) and the room was all glass, sat on the infinity pool that "merged" with the lake.

A must see - whatever the reason is!
