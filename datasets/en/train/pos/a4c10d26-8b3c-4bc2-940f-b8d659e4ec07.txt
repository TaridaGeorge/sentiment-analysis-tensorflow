My daughter went to buy a car, it was her first.  We were greeted by the BEST SALESMAN EVER, Tony.  My daughter bought her very first car, financed it and we were out of there in an hour.  I do not understand the negative reviews, the staff was nothing but courteous and helpful.  One of the owners walked us through our paperwork and was GREAT.  I worked in the car business for 18 years and wish my clients were as great and honest as the guys at Truckmasters!!  I will be purchasing a vehicle myself from Tony and recommending to anyone who will listen =)   I don't think my daughter has gotten out of her 2011 Corolla yet, it has been a week!!
