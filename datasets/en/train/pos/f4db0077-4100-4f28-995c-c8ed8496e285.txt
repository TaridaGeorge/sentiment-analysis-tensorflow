If Bacon was in Santa Fe, I would eat there at least once a week. Our waiter was a little bit flighty, but he looked like eye candy to one of the people at our table, so that was forgiven. The food blew us all away. Thick slices of ham, perfect potatoes, homemade English muffins, and thick slabs of toasted bread rounded out every order, and that doesn't even include the entrees!
The restaurant space itself was open and inviting, the patrons were cooler than cool, and even my 97 year-old grandmother sang praise on the restaurant days later...
Highly, highly, highly recommended!
