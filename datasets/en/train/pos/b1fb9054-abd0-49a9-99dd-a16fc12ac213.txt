Ok...so I am one sided about this place! My husband and I consider ourselves "regulars". If you are looking for spaghetti and meatballs, this is not that type of Italian food! This restaurant is truely authentic Italian food....the "soul food" of Italy. I just love the boar, yes I said boar meat sauce over Pappardelle! Don't knock it 'til ya tried it!!
