How do you rate nature?   Or describe it in words?  One of the most stunning backdrops for a hike I have ever seen.   Not terribly hard (in the winter, 65 degrees F)  for the walk around the bottom of the north  peaks for about 90 minutes.  There are a good number of trails that would take many days to explore.    Things change as the day progresses and the peaks emerge from the shadows.  Brilliant!
