Fuck it. I'm five-starring this place. I've been coming here for awhile now, and I'm always oh-so happy when I leave. I just wish that I could convince my sebaceous glands that they don't need to pump out THAT much sweat. Seriously guys, it's just a little bit of pepper. We'll make it through this!!

Their food is good. REALLY fucking good. The flavors are exactly what they should be, and that spicy-numbing tingle makes my tongue feel like it's wearing a warm Szechuan snuggie. Seriously if Szechwan cuisine didn't tend to make my bootyhole hurt so much, I'd eat it every damned day.

(Pro Tip for all you other Honkey McCrackersons out there... Prep H wipes work GREAT for Sichuan butt!!!)

Yeah, I said it.
