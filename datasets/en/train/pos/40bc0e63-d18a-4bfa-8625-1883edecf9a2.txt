I will never order from chain pizza places again! Mama Mia's is so delicious and never disappoints. Not to mentions very reasonably priced.  They have slices for just a few dollars and such yummy meatballs and cheesy bread.  We always get the pizza slices with basil (simply and tasty) and the side of meatballs. 

We probably go to Mama  Mia's far too often for our waistlines, but we live right down the street, how can we resist? Honestly though, even if it wasn't so close to our place I would go out of my way for their pizza.
