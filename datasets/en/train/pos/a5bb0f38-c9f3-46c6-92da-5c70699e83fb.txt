I'll admit up front Liberty Market is my all time favorite restaurant, and I love it.  Spent a lot of time and money there.  They even allowed us to have our small rehearsal dinner for our wedding there and it was FANTASTIC.
Pros: everything.  Food is great--ALWAYS.  People are great--ALWAYS.  They are friendly, attentive and enjoy being alive.  My favorite dish, the salmon BLT... HIGHLY recommend it.  It's fabulous.  Breakfast is also GREAT here.
Only thing you could complain about is it gets really busy, but that's what happens to good restaurants.
This is a must-visit restaurant... might become your favorite too!
