I don't know what it is about this damn chain but I absolutely love it. I pay $10 for a sandwich but can't find anything to complain about.  The chicken carbonara is by far my favorite, however I do vary sometimes and get the turkey peppercorn parmasean.  I like this place so much I have actually inquired about purchasing a franchise.  I have never come across anyone who doesn' t enjoy a delicious toasty Quizno's sub sandwich.  In fact, I refuse to go anywhere else when it comes to fast food sandwichs.
