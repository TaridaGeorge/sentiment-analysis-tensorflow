As good as it gets, only when it is cool and beautiful weather. Been here twice. Once when it was sweltering hot. Did not enjoy the botanical gardens so much then. I also went for the Chihuly exhibit recently and it was beautiful and fun. 

They have so many different types of cacti. Check it out. Take your out of town guests here e.t.c. But remember, only when it is cool weather!
