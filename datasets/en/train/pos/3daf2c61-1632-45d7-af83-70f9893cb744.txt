I am in-love!  After my first visit, I just wanted yogurt for every meal!!!  The oatmeal cookie & red velvet are SO freaking delicious!  They are pretty rich so add some vanilla to tone it down.  I ended up trying every flavor, not a good idea as I'm terribly indecisive -it's a curse!  The chick doing the samples was super funny & sweet.  She kept making me try different combinations, SO ridiculously yummy!!!  I love love love the Tarte Nouveau.  Unfortunately my bf was not all that impressed :-(
But, I love it so :-p
And, I think it's way better than Mojo!
