I will definitely be back again! I was greeted promptly by a host and server and seated promptly. I ordered Eggs Benedict and French Toast and the portions were huge. My server Jess was kind and extremely helpful since it was my first time visiting. Overall, a great experience from the food to customer service. Thumbs up!
