My boyfriend and I bring our puppy here all the time.  Luckily enough we can walk here so it's great exercise for us all.

My puppy is smaller, roughly 25 lbs and we've taken her to the passive side since she's a new member of the family but we think it's about time for her to go to the active side!  She just wants to run and play with everyone! :)

The "passive" side is very much for the little "yippy" fluffy dogs.  We've come across a few snobby owners but everyone has been nice for the most part.

Oh well, our puppy loves it and a snobby little purse dog isn't going to ruin her fun :)
