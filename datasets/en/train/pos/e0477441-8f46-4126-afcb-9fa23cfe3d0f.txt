Centennial is the way used car buying should be. Centennial has a no hassle business model - offers fair pricing, amazing customer service and a true no pressure experience. My girlfriend purchased a truck from them last year and it was an infinitely better experience than the other dealerships we'd dealt with previous. When I recently needed a car I went back to Eric Wilson at Centennial - while they didn't have what I wanted on the lot, they spent a couple weeks searching for me. 

Unfortunately they weren't able to find what I wanted in the timeframe I needed (ended up having to go out of state to find it) - but they didn't try to pressure me into taking a different car or exceed my budget. Truly excellent people to deal with and the next time I need a car it'll be my first stop.
