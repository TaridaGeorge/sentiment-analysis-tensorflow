I love Cornish Pasty. The atmosphere, the service, and the food are all wonderful! It does have a pub feel and can get a little loud with how busy it gets, so I wouldn't recommend going here if you're looking for a quiet dinner. The pasties are very nicely priced with how much food you get. Honestly, I usually take half of it home to eat later (if you do take it home, I'd recommend heating it up in the toaster oven). If you need pasty recommendations, I'd recommend the cajun, portobello mushroom, and cheese steak. The desserts are also delicious. So, in conclusion, come into Cornish Pasty and enjoy the world of classy hot pockets.
