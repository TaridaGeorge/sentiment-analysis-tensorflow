Loved the BLT on this late afternoon lunch...  perfect with a iced cold Tea on 100 degrees outside !  Freshly toasted bread and the beefy thick sliced tomatoes on this baby were perfect fit with the apple bacon !!!!!   Love the Big Bar as a center piece , and the Atmosphere was just perfect for lunch..   late lunch that is. GREAT SERVICE  and CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN !
