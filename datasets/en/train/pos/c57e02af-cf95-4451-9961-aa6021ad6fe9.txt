Could ask for better chinese delivery! I ordered Hunan at 8:30pm one night just because they were nearby and I'm super impressed. This is the place in Tempe for chinese food!

The order came quickly, within 20 minutes. The order was correct and they threw in the extras that most chinese places should but some forget: sweet and sour sauce, duck sauce, crunchy noodles, and of course the fortune cookies.

The quantity of food was crazy. I was barely able to finish a fourth of the meal! Left overs for days!

The quality was great. The shrimp were large sized, the rice was excellent, the noodles and sauces were wonderful.

Let me put it to you this way: if you need chinese food in Tempe, order from Hunan!
