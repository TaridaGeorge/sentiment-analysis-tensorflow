I just moved to the area, and it's difficult to find a good dentist.  After visiting Downtown Phoenix Dental, I have to agree with everybody on here - it's a great place!

They had everything ready to go when I got in - they even e-mailed me the forms before the appointment so I had nothing to fill out.  Super friendly staff, not rough at all and they are very good about telling you all about what they are doing. 

Very easy to get too, just a quick few blocks walk from the Light Rail stop.   Will be returning for sure!
