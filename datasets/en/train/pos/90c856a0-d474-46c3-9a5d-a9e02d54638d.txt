For a fast food place, this is 5 stars.  Excellent chicken fingers - juicy with a think breading.  Their Texas Toast is delicious too. Fries are average - but i am a sucker for a crinkle fry.   Service is always friendly and my order is right every time - which isn't always the case for fast food.  If you want delicious fast food this place is great.
