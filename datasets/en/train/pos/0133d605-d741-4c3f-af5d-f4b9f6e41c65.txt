hey arizona, you dont realize how privilaged you are having east side records! i splurge on records from time to time, but id rather spend my money here than at Zia. I mean come on, where else can you find bands like Lords of the New Church, Magazine, Ultravox, and 999 for hella cheap? Bravo Eastside keep up the good work!
