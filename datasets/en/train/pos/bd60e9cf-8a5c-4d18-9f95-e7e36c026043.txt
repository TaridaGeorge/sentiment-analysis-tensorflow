We have been here twice and have enjoyed both the food and the service. Both times we sat at the bar and we treated like a regulars. When we returned for our second visit we we welcomed back, that was a nice feeling. You have to try the skinny margarita, THEY ARE THE BEST! So far everything we have tried is very good and it is worth the drive since we live in Glendale, it is a bit of a trek but well worth it.
