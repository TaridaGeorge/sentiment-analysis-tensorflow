Like many other reviewers I had not gotten to this treasure while intending to for years. This garden is not as mature as some but it is a lovely respite. I went first for an earthquake fund raiser and then joined when I saw the Groupon. We took family from out of town and the membership paid for itself even with the summer closure.
