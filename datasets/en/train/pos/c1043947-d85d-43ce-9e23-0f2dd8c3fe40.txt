I love this place. I used to not be a big fan of polish food but then my Dad dragged me here and I've been hooked ever since. The Hunter's Stew and the Kielbasa platter are to die for and the service is excellent. I have never been disappointed with this place and plan on making a trip there this weekend. They also do these cooking classes which are a bit expensive but I sort of want to try one.
