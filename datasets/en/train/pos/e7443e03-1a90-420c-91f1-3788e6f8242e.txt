Spinato's. Where shall we begin? First of all my boyfriend and I were looking to try someplace new, and thanks to you Yelpers we found Spinato's!
FANTASTIC PIZZA.  I feel ruined.  I could never eat from another pizza joint and feel okay about it...This place is in its own league.
The only knock on this location is the ambiance leaves a bit to be desired. We'll be back :)
