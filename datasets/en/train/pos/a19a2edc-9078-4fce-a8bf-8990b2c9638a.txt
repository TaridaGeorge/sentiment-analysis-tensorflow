After having to pay last, year, I convinced hubby to take our taxes to a professional, and I am happy we did! When I walked into the office, I could tell this was a family business that I could trust. There are pictures of the Hacker family throughout the office, which is a good sign for soon to be parents like us. Bobby Hacker was thorough, but he also completed our taxes quickly. it was a pleasure to be in his office; this was a nice change from previous years trying to follow Turbo Tax directions and failing miserably! In this time of skepticism, especially with identity theft concerns, we felt completely comfortable sharing our information with Bobby. We are actually getting money back for the first time ever! Bobby is friendly and professional. I highly recommend Hacker Accounting. It was easy and so work the expense.
