This is a very lovely shop.  Amanda who was fantastic was helping me. As far as wedding gown prices are concerned I would say that Mariee is ranked right in the middle. I tried on dressed around $3500 and that's pretty good. I did ultimately get my dress somewhere else but I would still highly recommend stopping by Mariee. They only recently stopped caring the designer I was interested in buying.
