Dave Jr. has been cutting and coloring my hair for years.  I'm the kinda gal who will come in and ask what looks best, so basically, Dave gets to do whatever he wants.  Seriously, this is the way to go, since I come out with the most amazing cuts and beautiful color.  His prices are very reasonable, especially for the quality of the cut and color.
