I've been to a few Filipino restaurants (in a variety of cities) and this by far is one of the best.  The establishment is very clean and the entire set-up (tables, chairs, etc.) allows for a comfortable eating experience. The food is served in reasonable proportions. I ate one of my favorite filipino dishes, Kare Kare, which was cooked to near perfection. I recommend this dish to anyone that eats over here. Our group also ordered Crispy pata, which offered the right texture and crunchiness that one expects from a dish. The service was also fantastic. I highly recommend this place!
