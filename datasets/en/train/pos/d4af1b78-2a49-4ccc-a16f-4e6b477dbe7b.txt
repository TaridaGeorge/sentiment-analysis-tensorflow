Not to be repetitious, but really nice buffet. No one's addressed the regular (non-Sunday) breakfast, but for $9.95 you get juice, coffee and food. Omelets, cheeses, bacon and thick cut applewood smoked if you want, smoked salmon (not little pieces, but a whole slab o' fish you slice off a piece yourself) and all those deserts (pastries, pies, cakes, etc.) including the sorbets. And then there are the non-US selections with Thai, Japanese and other cuisines represented. Fantastic ranges of spices and flavors. And kudoes to the designers for keeping the 'sausage-making' out of view of the diners, making the entire experience more pleasant than most buffets.
