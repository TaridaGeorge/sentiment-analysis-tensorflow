We found this place after trying to go to a different sushi place in Chandler that had we found had closed.  It was a great find! We ordered a ton of food:  miso soup, beef teriyaki, tempura, several different rolls, every item was delicious! They have a large menu with a lot to choose from.  The service was very friendly and fast. The price was more than reasonable. We will definitely be going back.
