I love reading others reviews about my favorite restaurants. Regardless of the nasty health reports which have since been taken care of,  this is the best southern Indian food  have ever had. The lunch buffet is always good. There is this cauliflower dish on the menu that is so friggin good, I wish I could remember the name. Everything I have put in my mouth here as been worth telling about. If you don't need meat at every meal like most Americans think they do then try it. I love it when I go into any ethnic restaurant and see more people of that particular ethnicity than your run of the mill American. To me it is a good sign of an authentic food experience.
