The food was wonderful.  In our party, we had the chicken satay, red curry, ahi, crab fried rice, and pad thai.  Everyone enjoyed their dinner very much.  I had the ahi.   I am very picky about my ahi.  It is my favorite when done right.  It was delicious!

The atmosphere was very nice and the owners and waitstaff were very nice, welcoming, and accommodating, despite it being a special event night in downtown Chandler.  

Bottom line:  we can't wait to go back
