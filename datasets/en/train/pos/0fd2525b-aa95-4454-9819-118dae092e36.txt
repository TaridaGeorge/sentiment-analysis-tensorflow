Cynthia went the extra mile to deliver a beautiful arrangement to my godmother who is hard of hearing and didn't respond to the doorbell. Thanks for going back three times until the flowers were delivered! She also gave me a credit because the flowers weren't delivered on the scheduled day. I highly recommend this business.
