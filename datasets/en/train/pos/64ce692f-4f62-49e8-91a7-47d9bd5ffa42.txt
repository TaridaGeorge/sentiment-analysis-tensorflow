This place is great! Very small lil hole in the wall right outside Luke afb. 
I always get the beef bulgoki, I don't know how other menu items 
compare but the bulgoki is phenomenal!

You get a lot of beef, 2 big scoop of rice, 4 sides...not sure what they are called. They are all veggies but I only eat one and make hubby eat the 
rest w/o touching mine. They are really yummy almost pickled carrots?

Seems like I only go for dinner and that portion is about $13. Its poppin' for lunch though with uniforms all over the place.

They offer military discount and always tell me they deducted it, but I'm not so sure.

A must if you like tasty food!
