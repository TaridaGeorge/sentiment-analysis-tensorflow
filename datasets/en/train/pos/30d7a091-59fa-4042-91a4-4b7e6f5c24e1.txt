Finally got around to trying something other than just the dogs. Had an Italian beef for lunch yesterday and was in HEAVEN!!  And they have gravy bread, too!!  If I have to explain it, you don't know what it is.  We used to make this at my Aunt's pizza restaurant in Skokie and just seeing this item on the menu brought back memories.  So glad I tried the Italian beef cuz I've been jonesing so bad for one since I was let down at Venezia's a few weeks back.  Yummy yum yum!
