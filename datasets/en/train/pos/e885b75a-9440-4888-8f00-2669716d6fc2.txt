like everyone says, this place is a hidden gem in oldtown!  Reminds me of restaurants in Italy. once you are inside, you will litterally think you could be there!

The pizzas are delic and quite large. Have had several types and all have been delicious.  In addition, they will do half and half if you cant make up your mind on the ingredients (how awesome is that??!!) 

We always order their caesaer. Its one of the best we have had anywhere in the world. None fo their other salads can compare

Go for the atmosphere, good priced meal and delicious pizzas/salad!
