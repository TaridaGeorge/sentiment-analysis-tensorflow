What can I say - I just love this place and their food.  We usually get a salad before our special pizza.   It's reasonably priced.  The bar area seems to always thrive with thirsty patrons.  The dining area was thoroughly populated as well.   The staff was friendly and gave my recently born twin grandsons onesies with "Grimaldi's Pizza" written on them!   They will be fans too I'm sure!  :)
