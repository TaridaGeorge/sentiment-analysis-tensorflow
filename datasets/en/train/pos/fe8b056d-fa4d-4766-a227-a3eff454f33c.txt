So there are two things I MUST visit when I go to Arizona:

1. My Family
2. Raul and Theresa's!!!

Seriously, if you don't love the food here, you must be INSANE!  Talk about authentic Mexican cuisine!  It is the best!  I literally am scraping my plate clean with my TONGUE every time I come here!  Enchiladas....GOOD...Tacos...GOOD...Specials...GOOD....Beans...GOOD!

Nuff said people!
