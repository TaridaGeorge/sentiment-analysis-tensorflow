Like a lot of people, I passed on this place for a long time because of the ghetto exterior. My loss! 

Stacy's is fantastic! The smoked pork sandwich is amazing as is the chicken. Even the fries exceeded my expectations. 

No frills, just great food for a cheap price! 

There is a Wells Fargo ATM across the street in case you forgot to bring cash.
