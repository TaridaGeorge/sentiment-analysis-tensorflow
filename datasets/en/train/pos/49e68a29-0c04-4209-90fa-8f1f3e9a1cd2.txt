This is one of my favorite little gems in Phoenix. I've never had better pho than here. I usually order the "spicy beef sate" pho, which is miles above the rare beef pho. My family and I also order the pork "spicy treats" which is a roll-your-own spring roll. It's delicious and fun! One order feeds all five of us. 

The owner is also extremely nice. They also offer discounts to ASU students! Have to love that.
