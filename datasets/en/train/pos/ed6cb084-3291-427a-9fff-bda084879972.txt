I was shopping around for a Christmas gift of 16 year aged Bushmills and a friend told me that it was in stock here at Total Wine and More. What an incredible place! Aisles well-marked, and a superior selection of wine, spirits, and more. The staff was helpful, and friendly which is saying a lot as it was the week of Christmas. I didn't have to wait long at all to check out and found a couple more items that made great gifts. This will be my go-to place for spirit shopping.
