I have worked with Niall on several projects personally (at my home) and professionally. He is a top-notch contractor that actually has integrity. I have never been disappointed by his work and would recommend him over and over. He is extremely knowledgeable on all topics having to do with your home improvements. He is a trustworthy guy who won't let you down...he is efficient, affordable and down-right likable...but...he kinda talks funny.
