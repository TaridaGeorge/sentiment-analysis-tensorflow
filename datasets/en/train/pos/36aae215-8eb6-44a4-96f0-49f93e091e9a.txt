Excellent service! Fabulous food! Warm and modern ambiance!

The wait staff was cheerful and helpful, which made our dining experience very pleasurable. 

On to the food . . .  the chopped salad is something to come back for with all the different textures of the ingredients and merried mixture of flavors. The porkbelly steak was outstanding and my partner loved the scallops. The star was the bread pudding (bacon pieces in every other bite was perfect) with homemade cinnamon ice cream.  I can't go back soon enough.  I miss you already bread pudding.
