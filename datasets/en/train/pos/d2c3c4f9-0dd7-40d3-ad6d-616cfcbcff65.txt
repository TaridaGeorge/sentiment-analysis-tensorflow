Loved this hotel and the staff was fantastic. Our friend had a graduation event about 15 minutes from the hotel that we wanted to attend. We went to the front desk to ask them to call us a cab, but one of the staffers actually took us over there in the hotel van. How nice is that? The rooms and the rest of the hotel are very clean, spacious and have everything you could ask for (huge TV, free WiFi etc). The breakfast was fine with me. Fresh fruit, cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, Starbucks coffee. My boyfriend ordered an omelet (extra cost for hot breakfast items) and it's wasn't that great, but still a much nicer continental breakfast spread than most hotels have. Again, we had a great time and the staff was perfect!
