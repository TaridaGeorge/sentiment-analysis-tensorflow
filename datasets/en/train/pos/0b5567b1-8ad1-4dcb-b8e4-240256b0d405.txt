Ok, ok I bite my tongue. I have been here way more times than my check ins say and it has been great every time. I know I was not to sure at first but they have been good to me. The food, the service, the drinks ( Thank you Haley for the newly crowned Ebony drink lol) Seriously, great people, great drinks, great food, and great company. What more can you ask for?
