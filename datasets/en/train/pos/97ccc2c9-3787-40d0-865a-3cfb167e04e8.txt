I've never had a bad meal here!  It can get crowded, once you taste the food you will see why.  We love the entire appetizer menu.  You could also try the vodka penne de parmia...everything is so good.  

Last time we went the waitress told us that it is ALL DAY EVERY DAY happy hour!!!! from now on?   YES.  I wish we lived close.  We would be here all the time.
