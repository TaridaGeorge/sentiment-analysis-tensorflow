I go here for happy hour a lot.  Its a classy place to go after work.  Its open, modern, and the prices are cheap for a place like this.  The service is always good too.  In the summer, I usually get the white wine for about 4 or 5 dollars.  Last time I got the chips and dip, which was kind of addicting.  I think they've got a burger for 6 dollars too.  My only complaint was that the sangria was a little watered down and I couldn't taste much alcohol in it.  But, I still think this is my favorite happy hour place downtown.
