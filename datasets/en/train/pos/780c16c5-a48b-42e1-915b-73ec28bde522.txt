I had saved a newspaper article dated 6-24-09 which talked about Petit Maison.....and thought one day I need to visit.  Well a week ago that "one day" plan came to fruition and four of us went for dinner.  What can I saw but WOW!!!!  We wre blown away by the food, service, ambiance, etc.......and we were upset that it had taken us so long to patronize this wonderful restaurant.  It is really a hidden treasure and we will be returning over and over!
