the 8th Annual Pat Tillman Run was today and man did it get hot! it was a great, fun event, with a ton of participants. 

the run is fun, but of course, you can get bogged down behind walkers and strollers that obviously started in a much earlier corral. no bother because i guess this run is more about the cause than your personal best. 
they have plenty of water stops and fruit, water, and energy drinks at the end. something about finishing in the stadium seems so very cool to me. 

a great event and i really like the red shirts this year.
