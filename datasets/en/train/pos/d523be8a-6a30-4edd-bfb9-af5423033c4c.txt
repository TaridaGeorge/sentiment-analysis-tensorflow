How do you not love this place and the owner?  I don't know, because we love both!  Jackie makes some seriously great eats.  We've not ventured far from a few items in our brief time since discovering this gem, but if you never have anything but the stuffed French toast, you'll probably be very happy.  Jackie is warm and wonderful and so is her food!
