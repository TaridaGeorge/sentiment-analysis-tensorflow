This is short and sweet. The Buffalo Chicken sandwich I had was very good. One of the people I follow on Twitter kept talking about the cocktail called Caipirinha so I Googled "Caipirinha Phoenix" and Switch came up. The Caipirinha was the primary reason I came here and I'm happy I did. Caipirinhas are delicious. They are a bit like a lemon infused Mojito. I loved the experience of sitting on their patio and listening to music while I dined...it was a gorgeous day for it. If you were looking for a good place to start your First Friday I wouldn't pass up Switch.
