Have to give it 5 stars because since I moved to Gilbert about 8 months ago, it's probably the restaurant I've gone to the most times.  I keep coming back because the food is just pretty darn good.

It's like a Panera but much, much better.  They have a good menu with pretty fresh food and good sandwiches.  

Their chocolate croissant is also good, but it's not always available. :(

The service is also kind of iffy sometimes, but in spite of everything I keep coming back, so it must be good!!
