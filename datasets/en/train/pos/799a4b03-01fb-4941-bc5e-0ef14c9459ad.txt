So good.  But, be warned - it's expensive!  Four entrees, two appetizers and a couple of beers totaled nearly $180.00.  Our server, while a bit confused, was charming and likeable.  The food was delicious.  We tried the fried alligator (a first for me) and I'm hooked.  I also got a tilapia fillet that was cooked perfectly with a delicious sauce and side dishes.  I'll go back, just maybe not while we're still in a recession.
