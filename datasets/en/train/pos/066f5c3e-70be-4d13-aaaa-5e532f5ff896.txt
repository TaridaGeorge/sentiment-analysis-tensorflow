I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Yes, parking is an issue...and yes, it's cramped and crowded and run down inside, BUT that is part of the whole experience.  The food is amazing!  The fried chicken is the best around, coupled with the waffles...and then I usually add grits, scrambled eggs with cheese and onions, side of bacon, side of mac n' cheese...and wash it down with some tasty red koolaid in a mason jar.  The red velvet cake is a MUST for dessert...order it to go if you are too full, it's SO good!

They do have a newer location in Scottsdale that his much bigger, but it just isn't quite the same as the original Phoenix location.

If you are going for lunch, get there early(like 11:30 or earlier), otherwise you will be waiting in line outside the place for a long time.
