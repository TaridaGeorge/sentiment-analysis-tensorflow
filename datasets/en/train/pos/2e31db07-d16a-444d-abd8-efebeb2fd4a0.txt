We stayed here in July 2012 and had a blast. The room was great, the kids had fun and the lake is only minutes away. We spent time in Phoenix and surrounding areas. The staff were very friendly and helpful during our week stay. It's a fun getaway. I've read other reviews on here and I'm wondering if they stayed in the same place we did!
