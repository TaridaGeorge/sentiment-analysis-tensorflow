My best friend took me here my first night in town and it was wonderful. The salads are good and the pizza even better.  We didn't have to wait long for our food.  I heard the pasta dishes are just as good.  The best part is the customer service, from the friendly cashiers, front staff and waiters to the fact that the Manager was walking around and personally asking each table how everything was.  That says a lot, especially these days when customer service is forced and non-existent in most establishments.  I would suggest going here for a good meal and relaxing environment.
