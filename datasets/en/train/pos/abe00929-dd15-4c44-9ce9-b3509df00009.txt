This place was off the hook and the staff was top notch!  We went in and couldn't decide what entree to choose, because everything looked so good but when talking to John, he recommended the meatball sandwich on panini bread which wasn't on the menu.  One of the best sandwiches I've had and the atmosphere was good.  Definitely gonna come back on my next visit
