If you want seafood in AZ, this is the place to go....actually, this is the best seafood I've ever had.

The scene:
Okay....the bar area?  Older crowd, for sure.  It was actually quite entertaining watching these older women trounce around like they're still 20something, getting hit on by the older men...well men probably in their age bracket.  

The food:
Great.  Amazing.  The presentation and service is fantastic.
