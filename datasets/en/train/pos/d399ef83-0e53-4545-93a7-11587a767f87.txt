It was fantastic!  I can't recommend it enough.  I was super excited that they have wonderful coconut ice cream on the menu in several different flavors.  My husband and I will definitely be going back just to get a chance to try the ice cream sampler.  The only issue will be resisting the urge to fill up on their other delicious food.
