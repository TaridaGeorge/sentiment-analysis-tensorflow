Holy 5-star food, Batman!  

We visited this place 2 nights in a row, it was that phenomenal.  The service here makes you feel like royalty.  It is unmatched in the attentiveness and professionalism of the staff.  

The sushi is out of some award-winning class of food; trust me, I'm a big sushi fan and have had a lot of sushi at many different places.  The attention to detail given by the sushi chef wins an award.  My husband had some well-prepared Japanese steak dish which he could not stop talking about the next day.  

Finally, dessert was fantastic!  We ordered this dessert from heaven.  When you go there, just order the dessert with pop-rocks on top of it.  You will not regret it.  

If you want a truly special, unique, polished and out of this world dining experience, visit this place.  You will not regret it.
