We had our wedding here last month and it was better than I had even hoped for! Kim made our day perfect with every detail!  All of the guests commented how beautiful the venue was and how good the food was! She thought of everything! No detail was to small. My pictures reflect the beauty of the ceremony & reception. The price was great for all we got! I must admit I read a few other reviews and am shocked they all didn't get a 5 star. There is nothing you will not love about your perfect day at Trebella! I would recommend it to all who want their day to be flawless!!!
