Looking for a place to train my son to help him improve his skills in football and basketball, I stopped in at Athletes Performance.  I took a tour with Trent, and was immediately impressed! They have a great program where they train you how to work out to get the performance you want on the court/field.   They have an ice bath and a heat bath to help your muscles heal to top performance.  The facility is simply incredible!
