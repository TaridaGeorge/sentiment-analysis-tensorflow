Ive been trying to quit drinking coffee since I moved here, but Conspire coffee keeps putting me back on the junk.  I think about it, and then I start itching, then the cold sweats, then I make the 5 minute drive and get a large Americano and then the cycle continues.  I've been off coffee 2 days now.  Lets see how long i can go.   

Conspire is a much needed vestige for a "scene" downtown.  A nice place to meet up with folks, hang out and watch people be weird, or try to be weird and fail, or try to be normal, and end up being weirder than the ones that try to be weird.   Conspire has shown nothing but growth since they opened, and I'm sure we'll see nothing but more from them in the future, cuz they deserve it!
