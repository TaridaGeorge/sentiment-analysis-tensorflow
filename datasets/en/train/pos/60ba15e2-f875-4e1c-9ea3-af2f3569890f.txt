This store is wonderful.  They have a website: www.milksmile.com

Chuck owns the store and works at the counter; a little odd to see at first but he's so friendly and knowledgeable about breastfeeding and pumping.  They also have a lactation consultant available (Mary) for $35 and she is wonderful.  They have a nice assortment of products available and you can weigh your baby for free.
