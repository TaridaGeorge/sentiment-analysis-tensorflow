This is, far and away, the BEST used bookstore I have ever been to.  Everything is well organized, including the children's area, and everyone is friendly and knowledgeable.  This is a large store too.  It is probably the largest used bookstore I have been to.  They have a cafe too.  How many used bookstores do you know of that have a cafe??  Used books don't smell quite the same as new ones but I still love it!  A book is a book in all it's glory.  I will be bringing my used books here from now on.
