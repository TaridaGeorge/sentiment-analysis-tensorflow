I've eaten here a few time and everything I've tried had been outstanding. I love the bread and pesto you get while you're waiting for your food. Decor is probably my favorite thing about this place other than the food. It's romantic and outside seating is beautiful, right on the water front. I absolutely love their weekend brunch, until around 3. Try the sangria! Prices are great for the quality of food.
