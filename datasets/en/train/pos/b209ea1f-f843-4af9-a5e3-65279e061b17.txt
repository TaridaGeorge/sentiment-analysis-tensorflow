I just visited the antique plaza a few days ago, and I was in Heaven!  I felt like time stopped, as I walked around from corner to corner, top to bottom (2 stories), admiring all the antiques and treasures.  It was sensory overload, and makes me just want to go back again and again.  Be prepared to spend a while touring this place.
