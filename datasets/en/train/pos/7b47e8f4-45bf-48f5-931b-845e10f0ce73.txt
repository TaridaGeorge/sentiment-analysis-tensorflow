I'm repeatedly astounded at how many people in this city who claim to be in the "culinary know" have no idea what Schreiner's is. Besides the tremendous brown bag lunch special, which consists of any dog or sausage with chips and a soda for $5, Schreiner's is a great place to buy loaf meat, weiners, and sausages. Many chefs in town swear by their products and it's for good reason, they are some of the best around. 

I made some home made Sonoran Hot Dogs last night using Schreiner's hot dogs, and it was one of the best dogs I'd ever had.
