I have hunted around for the best deal and found Discount tires are honest about their pricing and what is tacked onto it right up front. I don't have to guess what else needs to be included with my new tires. Even when it's extremely busy there is always someone happily ready to help you out. I have never been disappointed with the customer service in any of their stores.
