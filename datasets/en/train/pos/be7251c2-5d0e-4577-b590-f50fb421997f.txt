First review ever! So glad I could do it for this wonderful hot spot. I usually am a Starbucks girl, and I enjoy their pricey drinks because I learned to put up with the long lines, and the awkward mess of ingredients. At It's A Grind I think it's safe to say that you get the best tasting drinks and there's no fuss. I have never had to wait in a line and the staff is very friendly. If I don't know exactly what a drink is, they're happy to share. I still do visit my favorite Starbucks now and again, but when I'm on the go, or when I just need to relax, It's A Grind is definitely one of my go to places.
