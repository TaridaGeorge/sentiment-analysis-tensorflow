YUMMY!!!!!!  Seriously in my neck of the woods when something new comes in HOLY EXCITEMENT.  This is fantastic.  What a treat.  You can't have it all the time but every once in a while you just know that this is going to satisfy your everything.  I had the pleasure of having home made fry bread from a friends mom and was pleasantly surprised and then this comes in to my area.  SCORE!  

Hubby and I ventured down and got down to business.  I ordered one of the sampler platter deals.  In my opinion this is the way to go.  A little bit of everything.  Nothing has been bad.  We even tried the dessert sampler.  Hubby was alright with it but I was ALRIGHT with it!  It's good.  I hope they stay.  Please support this business.
