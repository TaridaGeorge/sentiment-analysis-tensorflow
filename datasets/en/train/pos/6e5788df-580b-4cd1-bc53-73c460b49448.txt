My fianc√© and I visit Dozo 2-3x/week, and we are always delighted with our visit. The fish always tastes fresh, is always cut perfectly, and we couldn't be happier. The staff loves us, and we love them. 

Our favorites are:
- Aji (Spanish Mackerel, limited stock but *so* worth it.)
- Salmon (Duh, it's salmon. The sashimi cuts are generous and buttery.)
- Seafood Salad (For a $10 item, you get an amazing amount of food. Lunch? Yes!)
- Pork Belly
- Hamachi Kama (Yellowtail jaw meat; some of the best! What a hidden treasure!)

As well, we love the Orion beer they carry. 

Dozo is a bit more expensive than other sushi spots, as we spend about $100 for two. Truthfully, to get sushi this good in Arizona, it's worth anything. Once you've had Dozo a few times, $100 will seem like a bargain.
