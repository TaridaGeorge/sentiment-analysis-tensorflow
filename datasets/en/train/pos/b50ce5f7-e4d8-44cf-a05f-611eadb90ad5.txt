I moved to Arizona in 2004 and have been searching for this taste of Mexican food ever since.  Last night I finally found it!  I now have a spot to take guests where I know for sure everything and anything they order is going to be delicious and served by a great staff.  Also, the margaritas are some of the best I've tasted.  Many thanks to my new in-laws for introducing me.
