I visited the Elephant Bar Restaurant with some friends. It was my first visit, but will not be my last. The food menu was extensive and prices were very fair. I even had to take a portion of my meal home as it was very large portions. I give the food 5 stars.
The drinks werer very good and the service was very good as well.

I highly recommend this restaurant; it is on my all time favorite list.

FIVE STARS+++
