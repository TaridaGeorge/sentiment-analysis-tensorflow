Tryst Cafe is perfection! Went here for my birthday dinner with the family. 

The servers are very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu and wine pairing. 
The Ahi wonton cups hummus trio, and desert ridge summer rolls are amazing as a starter. 

For dinner I had the turkey burger, the brie cheese and strawberry jam are perfection to this burger. 

For dessert, I love the creme brule, and bread pudding are my favorites. 

I love this place and will continue eating here. LOVE IT!
