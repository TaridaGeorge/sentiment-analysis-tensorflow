This is by far the BEST buffet I have eaten at in the Phoenix area!!! We were here a few weeks ago for dinner, and again today for the Sunday Brunch. 

The selection is enormous. And so good... there is so much seafood options to choose from. 

What I hate about buffets in general is that the food is usually cooked poorly when cooked in large quantities... but that is totally not the case here. All the meat and fish I sampled were cooked perfectly. 

This venue is very comparable... if not better than most buffets in Vegas!!! 

Sunday Brunch was $26.... but well worth it. Besides... you can earn your money back for your meal at the slot machines!
