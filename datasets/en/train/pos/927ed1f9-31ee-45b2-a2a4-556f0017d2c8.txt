I've gone here a couple of times now, and I love it! Gelato is always good, but its exceptional here. I've tried about ten of their flavors and my favorites are pistachio and raspberry. The people working are always super friendly and don't get upset when you ask to try five different flavors before ordering. If you've never tried gelato this is a great place to start, especially if you're an asu student since you get a large for only $2 on Tuesdays, that's when you can find me there!
