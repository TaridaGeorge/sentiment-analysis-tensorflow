Probably one of the best chain restaurants. Very casual, great atmosphere and nice patio. The servery brought a small plate with some bread dough to play with while we ordered and waited for the food. We had the Guaca Tony as appetizer, which was delicious. If you like good wings, try the Italian Gold Wings. They are awesome!!! When we went there it was extremely busy and it took a while to get the food. I was a little upsetting in the beginning, but the manager came to the table and offered us a complimentary dessert. The original pizza cookie.
