Does this bag make my butt look big?

Any store that has that written on its shopping bag ROCKS in my book.  And that's Haus for you.  Sleek, modern, irreverent and witty. 

Located over in the Biltmore Fashion Park, this is where I go for off-the-wall novelty gifts - everything from frames, to travel accessories, to funny cards, to "I'm Not a Republican" breath mints.  And this is where I WOULD go if I could afford the expensive 1950s modern Copenhagen-ish (but better) furniture.

The staff has always been friendly, helpful, funny and on occasion even cute. 

And when women ask the aforementioned "butt" question the answer is ALWAYS a resounding "NO!" -- if you know what's good for you.
