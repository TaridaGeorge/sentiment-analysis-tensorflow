NCounter is fantastic! Though this really is just the TC Eggington's menu re-invented in a new location. There are some differences, but not many. It's run by the same family as TC Eggington's. These guys know good food. I eat at both restaurants regularly. While I don't stray from my favorite menu items very often, everything I've had here is above average. My favorite is by far the Natie Bomb sandwhich, though I get it on Ciabatta bread instead, and sub swiss in for cheddar. Friendly, helpful staff. Lots of menu choices. Breakfast available all day. Beer and Smoothies, too. Can't go wrong!
