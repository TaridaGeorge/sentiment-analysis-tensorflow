I got my Shih Tzu in 2006 and the person I got him from highly recommended this groomer. They were at a different location but have now moved to the main street location which is even better for me. This place is absolutely the best groomer around. I have 4 dogs and take them there ALWAYS to get them groomed.  Don is the best and very flexible with my schedule. I have dropped them off at 7 and picked them up at 5. The best part is that it is only 30 bucks for a small dog and they do an superior job. If you are even thinking about trying this place just go for it, you will not be let down!
