It's awful of me not to have updated this in a more timely fashion.

Simply put, Middle Eastern Bakery is fantastic.  Excellent food, great lemonade, superb market and low prices!

What really makes the place stand out is the service.  I'd like to share a recent experience I had.

After ordering some take out, I struck up a conversation with the owner, who was eating breakfast.  We discussed the various types of feta available, and which kind was best.  This guy, the owner, sliced off a piece of cheese from his own breakfast and gave me a sample.  That's right, he feels so strongly about his goods that he was willing to share his breakfast.

I love this shop and only wish that the hours of operation were more in line with my schedule.
