Loved the food. The place was awesome. Great ambiance and incredibly fresh tasty food. The place has a really cool vibe and was super charming. The orange trees were blossoming so it felt like a warm night in So Cal, w/o the Smog. 

I had a grilled buffalo chicken sandwich with a side of slaw and the table shared a standard portion of rosemary onion rings. The food was great!!! My buddies had the burger w/brie cheese (I think) and they liked it too. 
If you want good food, at happening spot where the locals go, this is the place.
