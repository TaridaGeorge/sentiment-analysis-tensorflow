I attended a reunion party at Firesky and had such a great time at the bar and patio area.  Something about Firesky makes me want to .... what are the words I am looking for.?.... MOVE IN!   The decor is so inviting and so cool, it really makes you wish that is what your house looked like.  

The bartender was really nice and attentive.  The staff at Firesky are all so nice, I know it's a hotel and that is just the way they are supposed to be but this felt like genuine nice-ness.

Drinks are made well and the bartender is rally good about remembering what everyone was having, I love that trait--- makes people feel special. 

I've never stayed at Firesky, but I would imagine it would be just a pleasant as my night at the bar.
