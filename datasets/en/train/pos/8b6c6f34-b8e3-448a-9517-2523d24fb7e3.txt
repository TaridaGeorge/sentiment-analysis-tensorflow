I'm reluctant to give 5 stars when I rate things in general however there is no question that Cibo deserves them all! Every time I've been here the food is consistently delicious and fresh tasting. The restaurant itself is a cool little house turned yummy Italian joint. One of my favorite places to eat downtown by far.
