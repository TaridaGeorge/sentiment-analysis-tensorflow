OH YEAH...I chose to eat here because I read about it in some magazine and it sounded unique.  My husband and I took our real estate broker with us, a guy a little younger than us who loves to eat as much as we do. I ate the catfish, black eyed peas, collard greens and yams...I ate it ALL! We all shared the peach cobbler. I think I scared our RE Broker who was with us...he said he had never seen a regular sized woman eat so much at one seating...yeah, I can eat! 

I don't remember what my husband or our friend had but we were all happy and it was all amazingly good...I love soul food and this was the best I think I've ever had.
