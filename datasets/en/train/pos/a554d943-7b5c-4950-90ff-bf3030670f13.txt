My experience here was exceptional. Moving from the west valley to downtown, I had to find a new nail spot close! Went for a fill and my nails look amazing! I get acrylics and I get the stillettos (sharp points) and Alex did a wonderful job. He also recommended products for my dry cuticles. He was quick and thorough. Love this place and will be going there for all my nail needs!
