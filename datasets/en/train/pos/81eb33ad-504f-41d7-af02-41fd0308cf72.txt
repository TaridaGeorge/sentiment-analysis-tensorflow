I take my wife here all the time.  It's a great date place.  The food is always good and the staff is always knowledgeable of the wines and paring them with foods.  We haven't had a bad glass or bottle yet.  My wife likes to order their Cherry Lemon Drop Martini and I have to admit I enjoy it too.

The food is always prepared with care and I've always enjoyed a cheese plate or a Flight of wines with their recommended cheese pairings.

I would like to extend my kudos to Barry.  He is the reason I kept returning as he has what it takes to take the front of the house experience to the next level.
