For local neighborhood eats, nothing beats Sierra Bonita Grill.  If you don't believe me just ask anyone from that neighborhood.  Sierra Bonita has the most loyal customers for a reason... actually many reasons.  Amazing and inexpensive food, great big drinks that are masterfully crafted and waitstaff that knows what you need before you even know you need it.  Sierra Bonita is the "Cheers" of the Southwest.  You walk in there enough and soon you'll get everyone saying Hello and calling you by name.   If that's not enough, the place is practically a small museum of Arizona History.  Curious about any of the art you see on the walls? Just ask GM Nate Hopper, he might as well be Arizona State Historian Marshall Trimble.  Sierra Bonita Grill:  One step closer to heaven!
