WHATEVER YOU DO...GO TO PEARL!!!!

Sushi, Drinks, Good Looking people are just the start. 

Ask steve for the secret handshake. Ask Tammy for the discounted shots and martini (which she will put in a rocks glass for you so you dont feel like a chick). Ask server Kelly for a smile...she never runs out!!!!

Seriously, best value, food, fun, drinks and quality food in all of Scottsdale...maybe Arizona.

I recommend only eating when Kelly is working and if her section is full, WAAIITT..it will be worth it. BEST SERVICE EVERRRRRRR
