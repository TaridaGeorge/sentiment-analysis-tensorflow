Wow, what a great place for breakfast, had the rancheros and eggs breakfast on my first visit last week and had to stop by again this week for a breakfast burrito.  Both were nothing short of awesome.  I love that there is an outdoor patio seating area that is under shade and the whole place is open air because their doors are always open.  Service was great, its is a tiny place in the corner and the parking can be a struggle but well worth it.  I get sick of the chain places for breakfast and this is a great alternative.
