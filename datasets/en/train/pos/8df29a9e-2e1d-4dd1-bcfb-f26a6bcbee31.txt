At first I thought I couldn't give a Wal-Mart 5 starts, but as far as Wal-Mart stores, or one-stop shopping stores go, this one is as good as it gets.

I've been to around 50 different Wal-Marts.  This one is by far the best.  The worst I've been to has to be any Wal-Mart in the Los Angeles area. 

I refer you to Mike W.'s review, I agree and it's a great one.  

Clean, friendly, well managed.
