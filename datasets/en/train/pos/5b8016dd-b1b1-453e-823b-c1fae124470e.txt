Been hiking these hills for about 5 years.  My favorite entrance is the main Parking lot, located off Shea & 40th St.  (North on 40 till it ends at the lot).

So many trail choices, so little time!  You can easily hike a few minutes on flat terrain, or difficult peak hikes almost up to elevations of 3000'.  

I like the fact that, because you can design your own route, it never becomes boring.  If you want a 30 mins easy hike, or strenous 3 hour circut, it's all up to you.  I generally find that in the early mornings, it's very rare to run into other hikers.  (maybe 3-6 in 2 hrs).  So, that is a big ~Zen~Factor~ for me.

Here is the exact location and hiking trail map:
