Went here for the first time this week and was completely charmed! I took a basic class on how to make a skirt, it cost me $25, but it was very useful. I was actually the only person in the class so I got one-on-one instruction. I could see there is a big sense of community here, everyone seemed to know each other and they were all so friendly! 

They also have a cool selection of fabric, like prints I would actually wear (this is not always true at Joann...who wants a piece of clothing with hot dogs printed on it? Ok, maybe some people...). It is a bit more expensive so I will probably continue buying basics elsewhere but get really cool fabric here! 

They have a great list of classes, I will definitely be attending more of them!
