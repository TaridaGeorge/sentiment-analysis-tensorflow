Yasu is about as good as it gets in Phoenix.  The fish is as fresh and high quality as you could possibly expect this far from a major coastal international airport.  Everything was clean tasting and delicious.  Especially noteworthy was the sea trout, which you don't see very often.  The very lightly seared hirame and the yellowtail carpaccio were both so light and mild that the experience was almost like eating clouds.  Perhaps most importantly, the rice was outstanding.  It was a perfect foil for the fish in the nigiri.  The sushi bar is interesting in that it is small and the fish is hidden by an opaque screen.  At a lesser restaurant this would bother me but they are so good here that it's excusable.  I guess they don't want you to see the magic happening!
