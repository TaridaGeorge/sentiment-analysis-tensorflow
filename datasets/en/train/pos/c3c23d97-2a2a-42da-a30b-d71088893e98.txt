I am 52 years old and always wanted to try yoga but  didn't know where to start.I picked up an advertisement for a 101class at Metta. What a great class. 4 sessions on the basics to get you started.
 Since then I have been to as many classes as I can jam into my week.Metta has given me a new passion. The Teachers( Jo  Ann 101) and all level instructor is amazing) are caring, welcoming,patient  and very helpful and encouraging.I love this place and you will too!
