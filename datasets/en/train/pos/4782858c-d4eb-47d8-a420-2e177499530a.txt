Seriously great pizza.  Friendly staff.  It's an added bonus that they usually have a Yankees game on & are very welcoming to those of us who support the Bronx Bombers.  That's not very common out here in the desert.  At the end of the day tho, the pizza is super tasty and the price is right.  Home run!!
