Coffee is only one of the reasons I frequent this Starbucks. Everyone that works at this location is Amazing.They know how to make your coffee right and they always have amazing suggestions for new drinks when I just can't decide what I want,Again!
Days when I am running late I still find time to come here and see my peeps that make my day with their cool Barista skills and their even cooler personalities.
