Best place to watch a movie!  I'm more of a rent a video at home gal than go out to the movies, but I'll make an exception for this place.  The reclining seats are fabulous.  Order the popcorn - it's seriously the biggest bowl of popcorn I've ever seen.  The only thing I didn't like was the water / soda comes in a ginormous cup with no lid.
