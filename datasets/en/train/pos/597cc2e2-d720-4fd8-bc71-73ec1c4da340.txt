Well opening day and Robyn N. , Rand H. and myself are here for lunch. The place is big and comfy and well over 100 food choices, Everything i tried here was very good . It has all your typical Chinese buffet items and a whole lot more .  All these new super Chinese buffets keep getting better and better and this one is right up there with the best of them. So I will give this one five stars and a big YUMMM
