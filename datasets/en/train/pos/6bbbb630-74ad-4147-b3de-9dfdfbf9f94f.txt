My boyfriend took me here on my birthday and it was AMAZING! I cant even remember what we ordered but everything we got was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!! our waiter was great. So friendly and engaging. His recommendations were fantastic. The view was spectacular. We went at night, but the view would be even better if you went during sunset (az does the best sunsets!). Its pricey but well worth it! You are getting 5 star food for your dinero! I highly recommend this place! YUM!
