Great park....one of the best spring training facilities.
The park is even better than some major league parks Ive been too.  One of the coolest things they do there is give you free sunscreen from from a dispenser  How cool is that.  There is a nice grass area for families in the bleacher area.  The food is also much better than most parks..especially the pizza stand.  They also have some cool bar areas where the servers are easy on the eyes.

Also go get a Sangria guys..trust me...you won't be disappointed.   All in all this was a great place to visit and has become a must visit ball park when I attend Spring training.  Also they have a shuttle that takes you from the Casino to the ball park for free....Good times
