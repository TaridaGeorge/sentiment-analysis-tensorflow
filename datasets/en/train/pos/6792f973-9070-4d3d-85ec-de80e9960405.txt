Bookman's has been totally remodeled and looks great! All the aisles are more easily navigated and the store seems to flow much better. Before it Not that I thought it was bad before but you can tell they've put a lot of effort into making the book shopping experience easier for customers. 

The multimedia section has expanded too and is no longer cramped into a small area.

They've also added a lot more seating! There's tons of comfy chairs and couches to lounge on while looking through their enormous selection of books. Yay!
