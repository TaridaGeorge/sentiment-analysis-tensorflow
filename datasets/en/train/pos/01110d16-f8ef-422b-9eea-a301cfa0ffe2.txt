My absolute favorite is the Rosa Pizza. I have tried almost every pizza here. The service is fantastic, atmosphere is very cool with brick walls and exposed rafters it just gives it that Rustic feeling of sitting in  a small Italian village. There are a few reasons why there will be wait in the evenings especially on the weekend. They don't take reservations do get there early or plan on hanging out across the way at the wine bar. Enjoy!!!
