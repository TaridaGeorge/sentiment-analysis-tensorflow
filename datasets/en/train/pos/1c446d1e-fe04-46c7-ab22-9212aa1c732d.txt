Ace and fried mushrooms at Casey's. My version of heaven. 

The food is good and the beer is even better, but what people really go for is the ambiance. The most awesome potpourri of people. Old, young, but always interesting.

Say hi to Thomas the cat for me! He's chilling with the patrons when ever it's not too crowded.
