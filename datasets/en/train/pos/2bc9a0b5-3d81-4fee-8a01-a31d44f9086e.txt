This place is as good as it gets for shooting.   I became a full member today after also researching Shooter's World, Phoenix Rod & Gun, and Scottsdale Gun Club (where I will also become a member).   The cost is VERY reasonable at $85/year ($110 after adding the initial administrative fee).

The club is huge (140 acres).   There is a main range for members and the public.  Then, there are multiple other shooting areas for members only.   You can shoot out to 500 yards at this facility AND you can shoot any weapon.   The only restrictions appear to be on the allowable ammo.  

I'm really looking forward to shooting at this club next weekend.
