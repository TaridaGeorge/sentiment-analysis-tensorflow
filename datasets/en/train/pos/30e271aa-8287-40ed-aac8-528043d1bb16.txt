get the zipps wings, golden-medium hot. it's sweet, spicy, and comes out hot. that's all you really need to know.

okay, it's also a cool place to grab drinks with friends. their zipperitas are strong as balls. there's tvs everywhere and it gets packed for every game. 

but really, get the zipps wings, golden-medium hot. I just moved to LA and I really, truly, deeply, miss zipps wings.
