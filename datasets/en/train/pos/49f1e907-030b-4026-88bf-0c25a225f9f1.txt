The bagels are great here. I usually end up getting a toasted wheat or sesame seed bagel with veggie cream cheese. The owner said he visited AZ six years ago and couldn't get a good bagel so he made it his mission to open another bagel shop (his family has one in NJ). I'm glad he did. 

Good food, good prices, good place.
