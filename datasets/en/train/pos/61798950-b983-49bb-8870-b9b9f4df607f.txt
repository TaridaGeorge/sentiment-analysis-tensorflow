Extensive menu and really friendly staff.  Always have had a good experience here.  Super for first timers as the owner does a intro course to Pho.  

I thought I wrote a review before, I should have.....

Pros
- awesome service
- extensive menu
- Ã¼ber fresh ingredients 
- good portions and price
- side sauces are an excellent touch.  Each table has an assortment of sauces to spice up your dish.  All good. Like the hot stuff!

Cons
- none

I am not being easy by not coming up with any "cons" as the restaurant excels as their craft.
