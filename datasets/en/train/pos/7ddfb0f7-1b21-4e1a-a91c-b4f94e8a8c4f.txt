This is my favorite Thai restaurant for lunch.  I of course get the Pad Thai which is always great.  But they also have a soup ans salad bar.  I can not tell you how much I love the hot peanut salad dressing.  I have also had a few of the appetizers and desserts and every single one of them have been fantastic.
