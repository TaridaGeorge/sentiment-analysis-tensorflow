I've never been disappointed at Luke's! And this comes from a Chicago kid who used to eat their pizza puffs back in the day! Everything about the beef or meatball sandwiches is perfect.

I'm glad they've started offering a smaller version of the beef sandwich - now I CAN order Pizza puffs to go with a small beef. The net result is a small bit of heaven shines down into my me. Ahh, Lukes...
