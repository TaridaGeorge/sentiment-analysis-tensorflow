As with everyone else here, this vet clinic is pure genius. Dr. Holmes is compassionate, kind, and flexible on how he treats pets. One of my cats cannot go to a low-cost clinic due to her violent nature at vets. We usually go to their sister clinic, North Kenilworth, but they were booked out. So we drove into Tempe, during rush hour, and this staff is just as compassionate and caring as the other site. No complaints.

Dr. Holmes felt it unnecessary to examine my little Lola due to her attitude at vets and just gave her her shots and was done with it. What I love about both of these clinics is that since he did not examine her, he did not charge us for an exam (despite having an appointment for one). This saved us $50! 

Thank you Pecan Grove, you guys are awesome!
