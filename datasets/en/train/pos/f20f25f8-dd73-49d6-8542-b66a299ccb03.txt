This is a family owned restaurant and serves great food!  I went for dinner and ordered the Veggie Burger. The server informed me that it was made in house, and not just a frozen patty.  It was the best veggie burger I had ever had... and I'm not even a vegetarian!  The side salad that came with it was awesome as well.  It was more than just your typical bed of lettuce. All of the salad dressings are homemade as well.  Going to try breakfast next - the breakfast menu looks amazing....
