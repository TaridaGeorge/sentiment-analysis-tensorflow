Excellent food,  large variety and great service.   Lobster broiled and.sweetened to perfection.  
The molten choc filled cake was an awesome end to dinner.  Expensive,  but to be expected for having great seafood in middle of desert. There were two waiters for my family of 4 and the service was impeccable.  

Very expensive, but if you want to eat something special, be treated special, and for special occasions, this is the place.
