Holy christ on a cracker, I've been coming here for 3 years now and am absolutely in LOVE with this place. My favorite is the Avocado Pizza ($14) and I like to add prosciutto ($3) to it for a little extra flavor. It's thin crust, no sauce and made with asiago cheese(yummm) It's a good size to eat by yourself if you want to take some home, or it's perfect to share for two people. They also have great specials on pitchers of sangria and some sort of vodka lemonade from what I remember. 

Be sure to check out their grocery area and the gelato shop next door as well. I'd suggest to call ahead and make reservations since it's usually pretty crowded after 5 or 6pm.
