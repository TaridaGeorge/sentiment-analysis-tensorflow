We had a group of 14 and the service and food were amazing.  It's hard to find both with a party that large, but Wally's scored the highest markets.

Not one person in our party did not love the food - from the burgers and mac and cheese to the pot roast and fish and chips everyone gave Wally's a 5 star review.  

The staff was friendly and had our table waiting upon arrival.  The waters were already set on the table and the drink orders came out quickly and correct.  The food for the group was out within 15 minutes of ordering and again it was all so tasty.  

Its great "pub" food and we will be back!
