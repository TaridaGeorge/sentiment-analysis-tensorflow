After reading the great reviews, I tried out Kore for the first time by bringing in a wheel that I thought needed to be trued.  Ryan checked out my wheel and told me the wheel looked trued and it was just the tire.  Turns out I didn't have the bead all the way seated in the rim.  Didn't make me wait or even charge me.  Based on my first experience, I later had Kore build me a set of custom wheels for my MTB single speed.  Ryan took the time to help me get the components I wanted and told me the good and bad of each component, which made my choices much easier.  I was very happy with the service and the quality of the build.  Oh yeah, the price was very reasonable as well.  Couldn't be happier, I highly recommend Kore.
