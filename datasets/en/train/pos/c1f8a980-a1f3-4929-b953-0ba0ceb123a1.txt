I LOVE Touch of Thai! I eat here any chance I get & I've never been disappointed with their vegetarian dishes. I haven't tried a lot of their veggie selection, but as for now my absolute favorite is #69 - Tofu Curry. Mmm mmm! I am also a huge fan of their Pad Thai and their Thai Iced Tea. Great stuff!
