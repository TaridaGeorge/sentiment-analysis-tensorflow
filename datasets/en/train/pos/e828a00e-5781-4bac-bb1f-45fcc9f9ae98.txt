Songbird is a breath of fresh air in this neighborhood. The minute you walk in, you feel right at home, and not overwhelmed by any one person or decorations. The monOrchid building is incredible, and Songbird accents it well. The two definitely compliment each other, and visiting is always a nice way to slow down my day, and take in some scenery and delicious coffee. The tea is outstanding, and if you're into it, don't hesitate to ask Erin about the different types they carry. 

Regardless, if you're looking to catch a break, grab some drinkage, or just do some homework quietly, Songbird is definitely the place for you. 

Don't forget about the breakfast burritos!!
