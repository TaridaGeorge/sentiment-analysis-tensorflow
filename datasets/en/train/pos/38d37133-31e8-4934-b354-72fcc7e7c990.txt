Needed to get my Louboutin heels fixed and was scared to take it any shoe repair. Apparently they are an authorized Birkenstock repair shop, and had great reviews on Yelp, so I decided to give them a try.

The guy at the front is very young and super nice. He told me he could fix the heel for $16 and would be done in a week. It's a family owned business and he says all of his brothers work there too. (I love when family members work together!)

Great job, Fast service and trust worthy enough to drop off my expensive heels!
