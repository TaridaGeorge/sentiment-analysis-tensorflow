An Arizona Humane Society satellite location located in a dog friendly out door mall, and a beautiful one at that.  This is a wonderful addition to the Biltmore.  The staff is knowledgeable and friendly, they have all types of pet goodies and feature local businesses and artist of pet products which is just another plus about this store!  The best thing is they have kitties, pups, bunnies up for adoption so it's great way to raise awareness, funds and forever homes for these furry friends.  One more quick thought - prices are less expensive on some products I've seen at big box pet stores which is pretty amazing since it's not usually that way with smaller independent stores.  Plus, they have a members system that allows you to get a small discount on items so save money and help a great cause.
