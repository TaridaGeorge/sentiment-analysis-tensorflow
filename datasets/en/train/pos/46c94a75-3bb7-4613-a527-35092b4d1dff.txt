Finished a site inspection with their sales manager Rich and I was blown away. Rich was an absolute pleasure to work with and knew his property inside and out. 

The property (common areas, restaurant, guest rooms, suites, meeting spaces) is absolutely gorgeous. A lot of attention has been paid to the smallest features of the decor (including the reason why they carpet and wallpaper the guest room corridors with alternate dark/cozy spaces and higher and brighter spaces). Memory foam beds, toiletries from Bliss Spa, welcoming colors...a lot of great amenities.

This property is supposed to be the flagship hotel that Sheraton is rebuilding it's brand on. If that's the case, there are very bright things in store for its' future.
