AMAZING!  Went here after licking my lips watching this place on an old Man vs Food Episode.  I sank my teeth into the Torta Del Rey and washed it down with the Watermelon Fresca.  The food was hot, fresh, and tasty.  The fresca was so perfectly refreshing.  Can't wait to go back here again in the future.
