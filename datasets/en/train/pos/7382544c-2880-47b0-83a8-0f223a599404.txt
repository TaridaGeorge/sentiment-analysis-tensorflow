Found by accident or perhaps divine intervention. Truly this is what Phoenix has been missing in the independent film circuit. Good drinks at very reasonable prices and a single spacious theater where they screen local as well as international independent films. Great atmosphere and very friendly staff. A must for the art community. Highly recommended.
