I loved my friend's dress on New Years...asked her where she got it...& found Divaz. I'll be honest. I have walked by before, but the whole "divas" with a z bothered me...so I kept walking. How very unfortunate!!!  Silly girl.

The shop is reminiscent of my favorite little boutique in Flagstaff, with lots of the "cheaper" quality brands I search for. I shop like a crazy person...I grab everything! The cute little shop girls grabbed everything from me straight to my dressing room...and they didn't even act annoyed! 

I ended up with three shirts, a skirt and a dress...$156 something. This is the perfect place to run to if you have nothing to wear before an evening out. Steve Madden shoes, silky shirts, higher end denim and bags and jewelry...I like. A lot.  I'll be back...
