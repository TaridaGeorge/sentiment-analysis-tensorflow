Oh dear goodness, the fact that Yogurtology has become something of an obsession of mine over the past couple of months + finding this location ON MY WAY HOME FROM WORK= very bad news for my wallet. On the other hand, I will now be in heaven without having to drive 30 mins out of the way.

There is peace and happiness in my life.

(Read my other review of the camelback location, but its 5 stars now)
