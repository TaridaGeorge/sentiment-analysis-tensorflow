This is definitely one of my favorite Tj's. I always seem to find stuff here whether it's clearance x-mas stuff BEFORE x-mas, clothes, lotions and shampoo, or most recently- some little valentine thingys for my honey bunch. 

Like somebody already said- it is waaaay cleaner than some TJ's I've been in and it's well organized. I always pop in just to see what's there and typically find at least one thing worth dragging home.
