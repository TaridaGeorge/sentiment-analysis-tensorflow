I bought my husband a gift card to Custom Medical Massage for Valentine's Day. He just had his massage and called me on his way home raving about Tammy. He was so impressed he said he will never go anywhere else for a massage again! He said it was more like a combination of sports massage and physical therapy. Tammy listened to him and told him what she was doing, sort of educating him about his body, yet it was still relaxing. He said she was very knowledgeable. I will be going to see her soon too!!!
