I freaking love The Good Egg. It's a great straight up, no frills, breakfast place. It almost reminds me of the diners back home in NY. You can pretty much get eggs any way you want them along with all sorts of other breakfast goodies. (They have inventive/creative options.)  In my experience the service has been great and the food is inexpensive. I wish there was a place like this in Boston, but alas, I will just keep pining away for it until I move. 

And the 6th free entree "Best Thing In Life" card is sweet.
