My boyfriend and I love Thai food. we have been to most Thai restaurants in the east valley. That being said, Thai paradise has the BEST Thai food we've ever had!! The place is small and tucked into a strip mall, but don't let that stop you! The owner/ server puts out some amazing food. Try the Pad See Ew, def my favorite!! Thai Paradise is a hidden gem!
