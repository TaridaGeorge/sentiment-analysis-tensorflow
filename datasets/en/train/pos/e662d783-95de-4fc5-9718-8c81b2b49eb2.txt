Just took my 3 yr old son for an exam & Wow! I LOVE this place!! Clean environment, friendly helpful staff, plenty of games & movies for kids in the waiting room. We didn't wait long. I could fill out medical history paperwork online before my appt. They had TVs w/ my sons favorite movies playing on the ceiling in the exam room & a treasure chest full of prizes for him when he was done! I especially appreciated the kind, attentive hygienist that used "kid-terminology" to explain to him what the implements were used for. He could play & touch tools before they used them. My son who is very timid & frightened of any kind of medical facility was comfortable & cooperative! He was having so much fun he didn't want to leave! Highly Recommend!
