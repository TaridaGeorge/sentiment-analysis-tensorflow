Love this place. Inexpensive ($12 + tip!), usually less than a 5 minute wait, old-school, sports on television, discuss the news or sports of the day with the friendly father/son team of barbers, and I leave looking great and with money still in my pocket. Cannot recommend enough. Great cut and CHEAP!!!
