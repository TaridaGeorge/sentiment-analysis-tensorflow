Unbelievable Thai food.  We are picky about Thai but this moved to the top of our list. We found it on the way to Trader Joe's, which is nearby.  My wife and I had the red and green curry and both were fantastic.  Mine was with chicken and she had the green curry with veggies.  Wonton soup and "chubby dumplings" which are like pot stickers.  The portions were large.  I am a big guy with an even bigger appetite and we took food home.  Everything was great, the service was perfect and we will surely be going back soon.  If you like Thai, you need to give this place a try to see if you like it as much as we did.
