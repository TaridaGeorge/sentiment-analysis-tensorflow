Haus defines modern decor.  I was literally drooling over the selection of Angela Adams rugs and Jonathan Adler vases.  They sell books from my fave publisher - Chronicle books.  They have some Marimekko pieces.  A good selection of Jack Spade bags.  A great baby section in the back featuring Dwell baby linens.  Haus has all the accessories you'd come to expect from Umbra and Alessi.  You can pick up a lot of great gifts here including Bluewick candles.   The world needs more Haus.
