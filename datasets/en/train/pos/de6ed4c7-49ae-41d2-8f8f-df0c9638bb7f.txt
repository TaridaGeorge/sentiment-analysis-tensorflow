This is one of my favorite bars in the world to spend time at. The crowd is always a great mix of people. The drinks are always cheap and come quick. I always run into a friend or two that I haven't seen for awhile, and wasn't expecting to see here. 

It does get overly crowded sometimes, but that is definitely part of the charm.
