Fantastic!  I'm a displaced NY Italian and was dismayed until I found the Queen Creek Olive Mill.  I honestly didn't expect to find decent olive products here in AZ.  I was very impressed with the product quality.  The selection is pretty diverse too.  I tried some of the food at the bistro counter and was also impressed by the quality and presentation.  Very tasty.  The staff is knowledgeable and helpful.
