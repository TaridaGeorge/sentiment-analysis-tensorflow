I grew up in Texas, we had a delightfully experience eating the Whataburger and their onion rings.  Living in Vegas, there isn't anything here like it.  So when I get a chance to get one of the burgers, I go for it.  

Today, even though it's morning, I want a burger and that's what I get.  They grill the bun and it makes the burger.  I avoid mustard, not on my burger!  I love mayo and ketchup, with old fashion lettuce, tomato and pickle!  

The onion rings have changed a little, but I still like that batter and the freshness of the onions. 

This was a good burger and definitely brought me back home!
