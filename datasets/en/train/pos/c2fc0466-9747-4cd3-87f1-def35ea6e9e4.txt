Bad Donkey is far from my house and every time I go, I feel bad for driving so far for food.  

That is, of course, until I'm eating.  With perhaps, the best breadsticks in town and made to order salads, Bad Donkey is simply amazing.

Throw in the hip atmosphere and friendly staff, and Bad Donkey is worth the extra $7 I pay for gas to get there.
