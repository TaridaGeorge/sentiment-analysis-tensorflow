Stopped by the Apache Junction location recently to purchase a Keitt Mango Tree, 2 Curry Leaf Trees and a Tamarind Tree. Love the selection he has. He even had a bunch of sugarcane plants and other types of Mango trees.

The owner is Very helpful in answering any questions. The store is only open most days from 8:00am to 12:00pm but if you let him know, he can stay around for a late pick up etc.
