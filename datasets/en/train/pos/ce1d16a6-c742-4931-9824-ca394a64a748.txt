My wife and I went to pearl Thursday night, 5/20, for dinner and had a great experience. Our waiter, jonny, was awesome. Very knowledgeable of the menu, great enthusiasm for the food and drinks and the Scottsdale area.  I would recommend pearl for anyone looking to get great sushi, great drinks and a fun night on the town.

Nice meeting you jonny
