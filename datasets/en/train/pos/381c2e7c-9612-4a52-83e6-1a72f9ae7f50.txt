Next Door rocks.

I attended the grand opening. Coolest outdoor bar in Phoenix as of this date. Hands down.

Funky downtown crowd, as expected. Love the music. I have no idea what the hell Johnny's doing with the house interior, but whatever. 

Add this to the list of reasons to go out in downtown Phx.
