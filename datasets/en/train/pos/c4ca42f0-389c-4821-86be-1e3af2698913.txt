Awesome little place right in the heart of old town Scottsdale! For Breakfast you can't go wrong...mimosas and pancakes or what ever you like.... This Family owned (for decades) establishment offers over 300 items on their menu!  I highly recommend breakfast but they are open for lunch and dinner as well!  It's definitely a hangover heaven!  You could go in your Pj's!
