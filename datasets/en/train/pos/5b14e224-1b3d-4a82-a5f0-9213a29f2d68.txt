I have been going to Dr Koerperick for four years.  I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else!  Why?  He has the best staff that bend over backwards to make you comfortable.  They are truly happy to see you when you walk in.  I have referred  many of my coworkers to this office and will definitely refer other people.  

This is a very honest dentist office!  They will give you a quote over the phone prior to you coming in and guess what...that's how much you pay!   They don't try to up sell you a bunch of stuff you don't need.  

Give them a try!  You won't be disappointed!
