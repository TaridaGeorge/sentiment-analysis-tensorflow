Overall I am a big fan of this place... first how can you beat a place that is BYO???!!!  You never have to worry about a bad wine list or paying too much because it is your own stuff...  I find the food excellent... they menu is not large and changes often...  but I have never had anything that I have no liked... the chef is defiantly 5 star and since you bring in your own wine the prices don't seem that bad... but it is not exactly cheap... 

The only down fall of the place is that it is real small and has funky hours... I think it is only open Wednesday to Saturday.  I know that they take reservations and I would venture to say that is the only way to actually eat there... This is a nice place for special occasions or a date...
