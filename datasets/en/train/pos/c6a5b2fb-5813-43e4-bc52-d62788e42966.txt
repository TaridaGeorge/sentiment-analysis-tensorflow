I love this place.  The staff are very friendly and on the ball.  The food is the best for Korean I have had in the metro Phoenix area, and I have eaten at just about all the Korean restaurants.  The owner Richard is really nice, and makes an effort to remember you by name, and even what you had to eat last time.  As for the cost, I wouldn't say it's anymore expensive then any other Korean joint.  Oh and did I forget to mention they have really good sushi as well.  If you like Korean and sushi, this is the place to go.
