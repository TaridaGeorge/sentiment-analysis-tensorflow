I finally made it to PastaBAR and boy am I glad I did! A-freakin-mazing. The menu seemed to be in Italian (or so I remember) and we had to have a mini lesson on the types of pasta they make in house. 
The portions seemed a bit small for the price, but I don't even care. It was toe-curling good. I got the cheapest thing that was on the menu, don't remember what it was called because I don't speak Italian. When I was done I threw my head back and honest to god felt like I needed a cigarette. 
Then came the gelato! Sweet jesus could this night get any better!? Fresh, delicious, refreshing, palate pleasing gelato.
A wee bit pricey but so worth it. I can't wait to go back.
