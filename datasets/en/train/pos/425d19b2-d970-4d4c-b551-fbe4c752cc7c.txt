I am a huge fan of YC's. I work right next to this location, so we frequent it for lunch. My favorite thing about YC's is not only the fact that the food is fantastic, but they let you pile the food as high as you can. It's always a competition amongst my co workers to see who can stack their food the highest. You just have to buy a $.50 cent to go box and you have lunch for the next day. 

The staff is always super friendly, the restaurant is clean, and the variety of food never disappoints. I have absolutely no complaints for YC's.
