Stopped by last week & picked up a supersweet deal (apparently was miss marked but they were easy 'bout it) & noticed a nice pair of headphones. Just went back to buy them for my nephew's 18th & decided jewelry would be more appropriate. One of the few places with well designed & made (some locally, a big plus for me) men's jewelry. Peter was incredibly patient & made my usual struggle of buying gifts for the nephs a little less painful. Def will return for the great service as well as nifty designs.
