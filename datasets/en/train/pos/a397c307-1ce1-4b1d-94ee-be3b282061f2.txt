I've eaten here twice this week! It's fantastic. Great food, service and beer.

The beer selection is top notch. I tried the Rogue Hazelnut Brown. Which, I had been hoping to find on a local menu for awhile. 

The service was great. Zach knows his food and his beer!

The muffaletta sandwich was so good that it brought me back a few nights later. That night, I ordered the antipasto platter (served after 4pm). Delicious.

The only complaint that I have is that I was hoping to try more of the house cured meats but the antipasto platter came out with all baked meats. The platter is selected by the chef and I'm told it changes daily. 

I'm already planning my next visit to try the house made pasta.
