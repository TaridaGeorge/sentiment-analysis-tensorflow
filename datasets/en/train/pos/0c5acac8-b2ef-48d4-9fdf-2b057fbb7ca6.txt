OK, I must admit, I miss this place. This place has got to be my holy grail restaurant for BBQ and I used to bring all my friends from California to this place and they all LOVED IT. I haven't found any restaurant like this in Northern California. Oh the yummy BBQ with the meat that falls right off the bones, how I miss you!!!!! Definitely a place to hit up if you're around the area!!
