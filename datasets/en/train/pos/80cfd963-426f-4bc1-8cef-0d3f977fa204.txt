I belonged to a Gold's Gym in Tucson, and used to go to Gold's Gym in North Scottsdale.  This locations surpasses both of those gyms.  Here, they've got an option for laundry service that will do your laundry and put it back in your locker the next day, if you chose to buy that option.  The views while you work out are great.  Its very open, clean, and modern.  The front desk staff are very very nice and always helpful.  The cardio theater, which is a big screen that plays a different movie everyday is a great plus.  The one in Tucson has two smaller versions of it, but I like this location's better.  The parking is underground and they give you validation for up to 2 hours.  This is by far the best gym in downtown and one of the best I've seen in Arizona.
