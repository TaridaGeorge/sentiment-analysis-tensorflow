My coworker lives up in Anthem and has been raving about this place, knowing that I am a fan of good BBQ. He brought me in a half slab of ribs with some baked beans. Sauce, awesome smoky flavor with a tangy sweetness; ribs, flavorful, falling off the bone, even the bones were soft; baked beans, sweet not spicy but very delicious, Seriously my only complaint on this whole meal is it is such a far drive but well worth it.
