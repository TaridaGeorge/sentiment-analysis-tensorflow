I dropped by King Gyros after reading the raving reviews about this place. Now I know why! Their gyros are delicious and super cheap. It's kind of a hole in the wall place, but that made me even more fond of it. The staff was very friendly. I wish I lived closer to this place - it would definitely become one of my regular joints!
