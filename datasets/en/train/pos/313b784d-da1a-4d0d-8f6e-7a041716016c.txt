Made a last minute reservation here for 5 and was able to sit outside and enjoy the view and sunset.  I can't really add much except confirm that it really is amazing.  The food was good and the service was very nice and not aloof at all.  Make sure you request Jessica as she was very nice to my young son and helped us to feel comfortable and enjoy the experience.
