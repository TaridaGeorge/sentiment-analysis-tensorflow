I rarely write reviews but know how difficult it is to find a good dentist so I felt compelled to share. I made an appt for my son with Dr. Nielsen based on a recommendation I received from a friend and could not have been more pleased with the experience! Not only is the office clean and new but they are open on Saturdays! My son thoroughly enjoyed the play area and the distraction of the plasma TV on the ceiling above the dental chair. Dr. Nielsen was thorough and gentle in his work. I highly recommend this Practice to anyone looking for a children's dentist.
