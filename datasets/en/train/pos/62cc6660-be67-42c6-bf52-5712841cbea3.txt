My friend and I had such a wonderful happy hour here. After a whole day of driving around the Valley, it was so relaxing to go into the beautiful patio and indulge in made-from-scratch sangria. Our host and our server, who were a pleasure to talk to, guided us through the happy hour menu and we decided to have the ropa sliders, followed by the pernil asado sliders - both excellent.  We capped off the evening with the creamy decadence of their banana burrito, then headed out into the cool January night warmed by our pleasurable experience at this charming place.
