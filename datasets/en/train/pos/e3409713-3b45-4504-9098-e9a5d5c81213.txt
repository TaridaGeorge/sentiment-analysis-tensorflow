Cartier may be the last company on the planet to actually make an effort to show that they appreciate their customers. Mere days after I opened a so-called Red Card (their house credit card), I received a humongous package by FedEx containing a very kind thank you note and a lavishly packaged set of Cartier stationary. It may have cost the company far less than a hundred bucks to do this, but the effort speaks volumes -- they create a customer for life. Thanks, Cartier -- I wish more businesses took the time and effort to show their customers some appreciation.
