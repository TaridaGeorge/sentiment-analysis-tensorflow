I've been lucky lately because everything I've picked to eat has been delicious. Usually I always want what the person next to me is eating when it comes out, but  not this time. I had the ham, cheese, jalapeno croque-monsieur. It came out perfect, melted cheese, salty taste from the ham, a slight kick from the jalapeno and crispy bread. They have great potato side salad (wish I could make a potato salad like that). Their caramel macaroon is to die for, wished I got more!
