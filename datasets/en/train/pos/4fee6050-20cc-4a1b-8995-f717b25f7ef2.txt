Toyama is a fine Sushi restaurant that has been consistently excellent since it opened several years ago. This is the real deal, fresh, quality Japanese food made properly. Sushi is fresh and delicately cut and prepared unlike so many other restaurants which completely miss the importance of proper prep and proportion. This is REAL, QUALITY Japanese food and highlynrecommended
