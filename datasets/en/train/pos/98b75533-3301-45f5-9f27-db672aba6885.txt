I can't tell you how long I have been going to Cheba Hut, but I can tell that I will continue to frequent these establishments in the future!

For the money, it is a great value. They always load up the extras on my Majik Mushroom or Afghani sandwiches (on wheat). The subs are toasted to perfection. The ingredient quality is superior to even the most elegant of competitors. They even have spring mix lettuce instead of using iceberg! 

The environment is great! Incredible music is always blasting from the speakers. You will hear Led Zeppelin followed by Jimi, and then a little DMB to keep you entertained while munching on your grub. And the staff is always friendly and genuine.

Looking forward to the next encounter with Cheba Hut.
