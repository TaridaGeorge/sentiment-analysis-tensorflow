I really like the flavor and variety that this restaurant had to offer. I really enjoy coming here for the food and some Thai flare. I recommend it. The only thing I would recommend is serving the curry dishes in different styled bowls. I love knowing I can dip my spoon in a deep bowl of curry and spoon out the goodness onto my plate. Good stuff and great work!
