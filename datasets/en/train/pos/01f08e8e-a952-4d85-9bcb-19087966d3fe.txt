Hands down the best Brewery in the Greater Phoenix area...great atmosphere, and even greater food and service.  This place is hallowed ground for beer aficionados and anyone looking to enjoy a great night out with friends or co-workers.

What I appreciate most about Four Peaks (aside from the beer) is the overall consistency of my experience (beer, food, service).  I live in the adjacent apartment complex so I am there at least once every ten days and the quality of service and deliciousness of the food and drink are always exceptional...this place is top notch!

If you have never been, then grab a few friends and order a few pitchers at Tempe's finest establishment!

Kiltlifter and the Raj IPA are personal faves if you can't decide.
