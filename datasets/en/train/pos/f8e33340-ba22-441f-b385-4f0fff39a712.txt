This is one of my favorite spots to eat. Whenever I come I get in almost immediately. The servers are all really nice and the food is amazing. I usually get a cheeseburger when I come here and it is amazing. This place has a great atmosphere for families (with or without kids). You can always watch the big game here or just come for a drink. Always fun and always a great experience.
