The one thing most Ohio girls love is a dive bar, and Patties is one of the best dive bars I have ever been to. The service is excellent; the drinks are strong, and the bartenders are quick. There is so much to do at Patties. You can play ping pong, darts, Golden Tee. Are they shiny new tables? No, dummy, this is a dive bar! This bar seems out of place in snotty Scottsdale, but it is a reprieve for those of us who forgot our Gucci handbags and stilettos.
