I fucking love "The Parlor".  Love it.   What ever Joe Pesci wiss sack decided ta toss fresh herbs and  prosciutto onta cracker thin crust with  fresh motz is a credit to the race we callz peoples.  God damn, my taste buds were smoking... in a good way...like a 'after wild monkey sex' kinda smoking.   And holy fo-shizzle, try their zepolle with salted caramel sauce.  I think I need new underroos.  

Don't forget to get meat. And Cheese. Together. Before or after your orgasmic pizza adventure.   Wine list ain't too shabby neither. 

I love you Parlor.  Right here, in my arteries. Mmmmmmmmmmm.
