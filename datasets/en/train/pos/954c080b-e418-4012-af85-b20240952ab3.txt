WCG has been a favorite for years. There is always a crowd so make a reservation. Very cool ambiance with dark lighting. The wait staff is very professional.
We order the artichoke app every time. Recently I had the ribeye (their most popular steak) it was cooked to perfection. Nice and tender and juicy. My wife loved her tomato soup. And our 2 yr old scarfed down the kids pasta ( and my skinny French fries). 
The food is delicious.
This is truly as good as it gets.
