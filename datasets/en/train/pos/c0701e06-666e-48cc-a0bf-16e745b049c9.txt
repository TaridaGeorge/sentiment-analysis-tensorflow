I called AZ Auto Doctor today when my battery died.  They provided such exceptional service to get me going again that I want to write this review.  The staff there, from the manager Ian to the technicians like Josh, are the most customer-focused people you will EVER encounter not only at an auto-related business but at any business anywhere!  I have taken my Acura there for over 7 years and when I buy another car, like other reviewers have noted, it will be a car that they service.  I have been remiss in not writing a review for this outstanding business previously and want to make sure I do it now.  If you ready the other reviews giving these folks 5 stars you will know why they deserve such praise.
