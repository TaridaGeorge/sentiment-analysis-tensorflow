I've taken my car here about 5 times now and drive completely out of my way to come here, so it's probably time for me to write a review.  I've been super satisfied each time with the detail of the cleaning especially for the price.  I always get the wash that's $14.99 and my car is like brand stinkin new!  

My tip regarding the windshield guys is to upfront say you know the spiel and you're not interested.  They usually back down with me after that. :)  I do wish that they had coupons to print out online that I could actually use, however since prices are cheap already I'm not complaining too much.
