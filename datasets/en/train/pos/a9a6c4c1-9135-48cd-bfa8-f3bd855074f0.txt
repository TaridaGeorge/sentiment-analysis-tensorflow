We had lunch here and loved it.  I had the Sudjuk, a spicy beef sausage on a roll with hummus.  Very good.  My son had a kids plate.  The presentation was very nice on the kids plate, and his chicken tenders were very good.  He didn't want them, so I ended up eating them.  There's a small grocery section and we bought some fig preserves imported from France-- hard to find.  We'll probably hit this spot again next weekend.
