One of the best places to get pizza in town.  The ingredients are quality and the old town location is prime if you want to go out and get a drink afterward.  

The crust isn't too thin and not too thick either.  The atmosphere is decent, but you really can't complain about the food.  

This is my favorite pizza place.
