I absolutely love this museum. 

To put it simply, the curators did an amazing job. The museum is well organized, neat, high-tech,  fun and constantly engaging. As a musician, I found it particularly interesting, but even for the everyday music lover, there's a display for everyone to enjoy. 

We thought two hours would be enough, but it wasn't even close! Sure you can whizz through, but my buddy and I watched, listened to and read every single display. We only got through maybe 1/3 of the whole museum! We are definitely going back to finish it all.

As a strange and frustrating side note, I thought it was interesting that they displayed a violin made in Germany on the Israel wall. They couldn't find an Israeli made violin? I find that hard to believe.
