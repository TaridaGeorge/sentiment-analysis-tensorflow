Great place for organic, grass-fed, locally sourced beef and pork, both my dog and i love this place. I go about every week and a half, call in the order before hand for my dog (offel meats and femur bones), and my own food needs. I made some Tartar from the boneless rib-eye a couple of times, not cheap for this cut of beef but sure was delicious. The bacon is great too and I noticed that the cost is simular to the junk they sell at most grocery stores. This is probably the only place I would use meat for Tartar (raw) in the valley. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, and most customers are really friendly and happy to share about what their favorites are.
