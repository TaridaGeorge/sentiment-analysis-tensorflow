I am a big fan of Fuddruckers, I think the the fresh grilled bun gets me every time.  I love the side inexpedience and the spicy mustard.  I pile on jalapenos, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onion, mayo, spicy mustard, & ketchup onto my 1/3lb cheese burger.  What can I say, it is a consistent great meal when I am in the mood for plain old American tradition.  I have been going to many of their location over the years and I was sorry to hear that the Highland and 20st location closed but I still have Metro and Arrowhead locations to fill my craving.  Also the atmosphere is great and very casual, my kids also love this place since there are games for them to play and the decor has so much going on that it is very kid inviting.
