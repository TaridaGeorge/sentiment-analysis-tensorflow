I needed to fill in holes in my ski wardrobe--nothing too fancy, as I only ski once in a blue moon. I walked in and upon asking one of the employees, Susan, where to find ski pants (preferably on sale), she took me right to the spot, and proceeded to help me find everything I needed. She was just great. Helped me find the right sizes and fits for a helmet, water-resistant pants, the whole kit--AND saved me a significant amount of money by bringing out items that were top brands on sale. She was also tremendously nice and knowledgeable about everything from the clothes to the slopes. I walked out very happy and with all the supplies I need to stay warm on the mountain. Superb service, wonderful staff, very competitive prices. Thanks, Ski Pro! You've got a customer for life.
