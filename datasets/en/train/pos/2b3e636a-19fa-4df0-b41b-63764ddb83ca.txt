I came here for an open house and while I have not taken classes here myself, from taking to the students who were taking classes there currently during the open house, everyone was very happy and satisfied with the guidance and instruction they were receiving. 
The space itself is open with a clean, modern decor. The owner seemed very warm and kind. 
Offers acting classes for both kids and adults. 
I would definitely consider taking a class here!
