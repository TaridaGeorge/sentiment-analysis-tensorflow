Hands down the hippest coffee shop in Phoenix. With the recent expansion - it's HUGE now - there's tons of space to spread out, read the paper, work on your laptop, or simply enjoying amazing coffee, teas, cocktails and food with friends. I spend a lot of time here during the day and it's got everything right. Always great music, fast wi-fi, I love the $2 hibiscus iced tea, the pastries and now the drinks! It's a wonderful urban feel and such a breath of fresh air for the Valley.
