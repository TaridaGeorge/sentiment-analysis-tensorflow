Went here today and tried this place for the first time. I had a cheese burger with hot peppers and it was one of the best burgers I have had. The chili cheese fries were also very good and I liked their fry sauce. My friend was very happy with her veggie sandwich. 
Overall this place is awesome, I'll be back!
