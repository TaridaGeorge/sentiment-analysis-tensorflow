I have been going to Dr. Patel since my first child was born over 10 yrs. ago.  Since then, he has taken on the rest of our family including me and my husband.  He always gets you in whenever you need it and his staff is nice.  I like that he himself treats his patients and he doesn't have nurses and PA's doing his work for him.
