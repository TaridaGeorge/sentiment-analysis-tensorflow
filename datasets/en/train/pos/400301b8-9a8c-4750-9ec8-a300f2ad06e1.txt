Wow, what a fabulous restaurant! We were greeted with big smiles as we walked in the door. 20 minute wait on Friday night was great. Cocktails were wonderful...Bartender knew what he was doing.

Our Server was fabulous. Big smile, good sense of humor and anxious to make us happy. We tried Prime Rib (outstanding), Steak with Enchilada (also outstanding) and two enchiladas (wonderful). We all had the Mexican cucumber salad with our entrees and it was delightful. The enchiladas had a savory sauce unlike I had had before it was fantastic.

Service was outstanding... water always filled, cocktails refreshed, check-in often and very personable.

We'll be back again soon! I can HIGHLY recommend Bandera...You won't be disappointed!
