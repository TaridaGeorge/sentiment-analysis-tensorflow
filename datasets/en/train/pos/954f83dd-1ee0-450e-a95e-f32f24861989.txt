Love this park! 

The walk around the lake and watching the fountain go off makes for a great way to peacefully exercise.

This park is great if you just want a leisurely stroll or if you want a place to take the children. Playground equipment, splash pad and BBQs can be found here as well as a pizza place which overlooks the park.

We have been here many times and always enjoy it.
