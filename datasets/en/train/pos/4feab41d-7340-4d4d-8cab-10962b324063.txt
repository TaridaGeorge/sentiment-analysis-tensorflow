I think this is the only "Artisan" ice creamery in Scottsdale and it is sooooo good!  In a strip mall, this cute place has a variety of sorbets and ice creams to choose from.   

I choose my 3 scoops for under 4 bucks to include Watermelon sorbet with mini choco chips, almond crunch ice cream and lychee sorbet.  All fabulous and totally making me wish that they sold this stuff in Cali!
