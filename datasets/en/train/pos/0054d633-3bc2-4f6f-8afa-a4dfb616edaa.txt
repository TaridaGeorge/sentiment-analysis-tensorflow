Am a huge fan of this eatery!!! The owners hit the jackpot when they brought Chef Holly in from Ticoz. My very favorite thing on the menu is the Blackened Tilapia Ceaser ..... amazing! All the Street Tacos are deeelish ......especially the Pernil Pork and Chicken! The chips are not too greasy or salty and the salsa is roasted and exploding with flavor. I am always blown away by the service and love the atmosphere! It's already a good value for dining but you can get promotions if you are on Living Social or Groupon.
