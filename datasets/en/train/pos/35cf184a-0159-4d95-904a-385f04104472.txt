I have been eating at Famous Daves for at least 12 years, the chain is consistent, the food has always been good, the service may be inconsistent from location to location, but ,out of the 10 or so that I have tried, I have NEVER had a bad plate of food.I am glad they are here in Arizona, as this was one of the few places I ate at  all the time in Minnesota, and I thought coming south would never happen. Thanks for filling my rib fix.....oh and the devil's pit sauce it to die for !
