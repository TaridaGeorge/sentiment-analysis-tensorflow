I stop by here to get my Texas kolaches ever chance I could, they make it so good with either spicy sausage, regular sausage, or ham& cheese. So so sooooooooooooo good (haven't found any other place that have Texas kolaches).  Their ham&cheese croissant are so darn good also. Lastly, can't forget the donuts. They are all so yummy. Great service also, the young ladies working here is so polite and helpful.
