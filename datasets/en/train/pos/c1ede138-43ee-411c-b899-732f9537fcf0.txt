Very honest shop.Hard to find good people these days. Tim gave me a good estimate and also called me to make sure if i am ok with the price. He also suggested me I don not need to change plugs right now as they have another 5k on them. He is not in hurry to sell you any of their package. They are my shop from here on. Thank you TMK!!!!
