Hands down my favorite establishment in Phoenix. I love the character of the old brick building, the tanks of beer right next to the tables, and the enormous bar. Service is awesome, as you can tell everyone loves working in the Best Brewpub in Phoenix. 

Just tried this year's Pumpkin Porter, and it was outstanding. Living in the desert where there's almost no sign of seasons changing, I look to the release of Pumpkin Porter to distinguish Fall. Grab a pint and taste fall. 

Cheers.
