I called Miguel at 11AM with an A/C problem and spoke with him briefly. He told me unfortunately they wouldn't be able to make it until 4PM the same day, but would call me when they were en route.  At 2PM they called and asked if they could come early.  By 5:30PM he and his son had diagnosed the problem, picked up the replacement motor and installed it.  They couldn't have been prompter, more responsive or friendlier.  Pricing was very fair and  they basically could not have done an overall better job.  Of course, I hope not to see them again, because no one like having A/C problems, but I would highly recommend them.
