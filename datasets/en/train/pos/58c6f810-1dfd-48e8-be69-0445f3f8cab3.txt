I don't do caffeine anymore, or calories for that matter... so this is my fave place to eat yummy & healthy guilt free food!

They can make pretty much any tea you can think of- I used to love chai(but I'm off caffeine, remember?) so now I always get the vanilla rooibus tea  with soy milk & a little splenda of course.  And I love their roasted chicken salad for lunch.  Something about the way they make it- I wonder what the secret ingredient is!

Best part- when you get a salad or sandwich, you can add on a large tea of coffee for just $1.

What more can you ask for?
