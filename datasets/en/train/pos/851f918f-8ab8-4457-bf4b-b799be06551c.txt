WOW! WOW! FANTASTIC!
I have lived in Glendale 2 years, and I am so sad that I have not known this place earlier. 

They make really great side dishes, and they only carry good quality products. 
I cannot say enough how good they are. 

And I really like rice cakes and I counldn't find good quality rice cakes for 2 years. 
But they have it. 

So HAPPY !!! 5 X 5 Stars !!!!
