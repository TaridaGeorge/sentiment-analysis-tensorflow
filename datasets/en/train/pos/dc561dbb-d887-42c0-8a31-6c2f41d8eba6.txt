I absolutely loved my first experience at Sweet Republic and am already looking for reasons to go back.  I believe I will start taking all of my friends one at a time (this means many more trips for me)!  I loved the customer service, the flavors and the passion that they clearly have for creating wonderful flavor combinations.  
Choosing was the hardest part!  I was only able to decide on what to have after I consoled myself with the knowledge that I would be back soon and could have something different...
