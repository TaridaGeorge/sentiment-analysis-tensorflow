My girlfriend came in from Atlanta to visit me for mothers day since this was the first mothers day without my mom. She passed in October 2010.  The spa was fabulous! We enjoyed our massages and then we enjoyed margaritas around the pool. The staff is wonderful and the morocan decor is just lovely! This its truly a first class and I will be going back for sure!
