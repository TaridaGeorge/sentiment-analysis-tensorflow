Eff. I really love Easley's. Sometimes I go in and don't even buy anything just to stare at the costume heads all lined up in a row. 

This past weekend I went in for items to put together a nontypical outfit. It was busy, as it typically is around Halloween, but it didn't bother any of the employees. I had several on hand to help me with every small piece. What's even better is that they pretended to be all into my costume and thought it was the best idea ever. Great salespeople skills!!!

From the accessories to the wig to helping me find ways to customize a men's costume as I really don't think every single dress up idea should be turned slutty, they were on it. And I left impressed and happy.
