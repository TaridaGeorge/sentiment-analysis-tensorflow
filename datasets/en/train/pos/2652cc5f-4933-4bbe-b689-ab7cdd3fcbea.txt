We were in town for a convention, arriving Thursday night and looking for a comfortable dining venue.  Cibo delivered.  Service began slow, which my wife and I don't mind because we actually enjoy a less rushed meal.  The owner saw things getting backed up, and helped get our salad order expedited to our table.  The pizzas and wine were great, and the outdoor patio was unique and cozy on a cool April evening.  We enjoyed it so much we dined there again Saturday night.  This time we sat in a cozy corner and enjoyed another delicious pizza.  The owners are very nice.  We spoke to them during brief wait for our table.  Highly recommend the food, the atmosphere, and the service.
