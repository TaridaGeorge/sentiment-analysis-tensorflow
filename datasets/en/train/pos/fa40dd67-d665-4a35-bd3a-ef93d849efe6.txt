Huge props to the folks here! 

Right before midnight on Saturday night a big green bus rolls up with 17 drunks girls and guys... warning sign one. 

They proceed to storm the building to find that it is locked, closed except drive through.....flash mob warning sign two. 

The drunk girls somehow get them to open the doors, so they could use the restroom....we are in the closed building.... warning sign three. 

We proceed to order a shit ton of food, barely able to order in any sort of language that would make sense... warning sign...you get it. 

The food came out PERFECT, we were all super happy and happy to have a large hamburger bun in our bellies to help with "digestion" of previous liquid we had consumed. 

What-A-Crew ROCKS.
