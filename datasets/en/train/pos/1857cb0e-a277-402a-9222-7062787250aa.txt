Yes, this place is amazing, as so many other reviews say.  So amazing, that when family of mine decided to buy a place in Fountain Hills, one of my first thoughts was "OMG Sweet Republic is ON THE WAY.  I'll have an excuse to go ALL THE TIME."

They let you taste samples, of course, so go nuts!

Some of my favorites:  Peanut Butter Chip, Basil Lime Sorbet, Honey Blue Cheese--which you HAVE to at least get a sample of--and Real Mint Chip.
