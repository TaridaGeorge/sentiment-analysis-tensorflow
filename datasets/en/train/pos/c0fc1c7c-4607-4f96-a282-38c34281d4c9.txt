WOW! This is one of the best breakfast I've had in years, from the fresh OJ, amazing Cave Creek Coffee, special three egg scramble with bacon, locally grown peppers and fontina cheese, with a tortilla and oh the rosemary home fries... drool. My family took me here and I would recommend this to anyone who lives in or is visiting Phoenix. Tuesday morning we waited about five minutes for a table. This really is the best quality local produce in a great little diner. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will have to try the Butter Burger.
