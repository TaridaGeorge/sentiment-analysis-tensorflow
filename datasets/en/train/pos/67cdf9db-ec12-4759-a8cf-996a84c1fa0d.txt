Picked up a Raspberry Chiffon Pie.  Easily could make 8 ample servings.  The Crust was nice.   The Pie was super fresh and Traci's Commercial Kitchen is spotless.   Pass up the Pie at the local Grocers as you will not get the quality or taste that the Pie Snob will fulfill.   This small business is a hidden gem located in a central phoenix neighborhood.  The Pie was full of sweet and tangy flavor.  Fresh Red raspberrys in a raspberry glaze, covered generously with Raspberry Chiffon and then covered with a hefty amount of real Whipped cream which was not overly sweet.
