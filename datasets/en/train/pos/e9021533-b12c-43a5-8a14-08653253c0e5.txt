My girlfriend and I eat here about once a week!! Love this place! We always sit at the bar, because Katie always treats us well, and she really knows what to suggest, when we want to try something new! She always welcomes us with a big smile...and has taken time to get to know us, as regulars!  Best service EVER!! Food is always good...but Katie is the real reason we go back again and again!!
