This is my new favorite place to eat in Phoenix.  I have been here a few times, and it has never failed to impress.  Their ginger ale is homemade and absolutely divine.  The chicken and waffles are incredible.  The chorizo stuffed dates? Excellent!  I can go on and on.  The tuck shop is a slow food restaurant, so don't expect to come here for a quick bite.  However, if you are looking for a unique and creative meal in a down-home atmosphere, you should definitely give this place a try.
