Around 150 beers... team trivia... no nonsense. A cruisers paradise and and eclectic mix of people. Beer snobs and frat kids alike! You always find something you like with the super knowledgable bartenders/staff, and you will never feel out of place. I love love love this bar. There are different happy hours every night and Team Trivia on Tuesdays

Oh, ps. This is NOT a sports bar... there are handful of older televisions through the place so go to BWW if you're looking for a game.
