I have been to your restaurant many times and each time I have received the most courteous service and the restaurant has a warm and friendly feeling.
My most recent visit was to introduce friends that were from out of town (Ohio) to your wonderful micro brewery. We all ordered a variation of food from your menu, each was well received with compliments to the chef. 

My personal favorites are the Fish and chips and the Koby burger. I also want to add that I never leave the SunUp Brew house without eating the DELICIOUS coleslaw. If you are a coleslaw lover like I am, this is a must. 

Keep up the good work that is served with a smile, great beer and food with lasting memories.
