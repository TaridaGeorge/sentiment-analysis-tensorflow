I took my dog to Warner Vista for an emergency issue at the recommendation of another area veterinary office. I ended up having to make a decision to put him down, but the entire staff was so amazing through the entire process. They were extremely compassionate, provided detailed, extensive information regarding the condition, treatment options, etc. that helped me to make a very difficult decision. I didn't feel rushed; they answered questions up to the very last moment, explained the process and really took the approach that it was all about making sure that my last wishes for my dog were carried out. I highly recommend Warner Vista.
