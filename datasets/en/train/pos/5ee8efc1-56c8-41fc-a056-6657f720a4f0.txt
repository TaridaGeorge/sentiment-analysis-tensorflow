I went here after a long night of working to take my cousin out. We were tired and there wasn't much open (keep in mind this was a Tuesday). My friend told us to go here and it was just FABulous. We split a salad for starters and this was the salad of my dreams. Not your typical greens decorated with accessories, but actual FOOD. Incredible. Then we split the flat bread (sort of like a pizza) and it was equally amazing. Not to mention the price was not bad at ALL. And I'm your hard core stingemeister. I would tell anyone to go.
