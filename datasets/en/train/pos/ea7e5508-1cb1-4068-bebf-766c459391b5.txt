I love US Egg! I had never heard of this place before, but now I'm a big fan. They had really delicious items on the menu--lots of items with avocado and Monterey jack cheese, which admittedly is my favorite combination of food. They had a pretty wide variety of items on the menu--omlettes, other breakfast foods with protein, hearty sandwiches, and salads. Everything seemed like good quality, delicious food. I ended up getting the Club Sandwich (turkey, ham, avocado, bacon, and Monterey jack cheese--YUM), with a side of hash browns. I wish I could have finished it all, it was delicious. Besides the food, the waitresses were all really friendly, and got us everything we needed. The physical restaurant was also really nice--a very calm color scheme of calm ocean blue walls and white wainscoting. I'll return next time I'm in the area!
