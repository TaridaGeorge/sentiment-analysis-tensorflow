The Heart Attack Grill is definitely one of the gems of the valley. For all of the negative reviews about the food being greasy and bad for you, I'm not sure what you were expecting. They are exactly what they advertise - a deliciously quick trip to the grave. The burgers are dripping with lard, making them tantilizingly juicy. Of course this is not the place for someone looking for a light, healthy lunch, but for those of us who enjoy indulging in what might be our last meal, a double bypass burger is a worthy choice. 

Personally i love the gimmick of the naughty nurses (who i may add are more than willing to sit on your lap while you sweat through a burger and fries) and Dr. Jon.

The Heart Attack Grill is well deserving of their recent fame. Ignore the whiners and try it out!
