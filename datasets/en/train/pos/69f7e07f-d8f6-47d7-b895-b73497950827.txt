I have a problem. It starts with my need to exercise, and it ends with the proximity of Karve Studio to my home. 

I attempt to visit at least 3x weekly and with the auto-pay package, I get an incredible deal over every other  'ballet-barre fitness class' that is being offered as the craze hits the Valley. I appreciate that Kendra has a studio solely for Karve, and that the quality isn't compromised by instructors who don't know what they're doing -- these ladies are pros who not only teach, but TAKE the classes and 'shake' with you.

I make no claims to be the thinnest or fittest person in the world, but if the ladies of Karve have their way, I'll be the same size (or smaller) for the foreseeable future
