We came down from Prescott for the weekend to visit the folks If you are looking for great frozen yogurt you will want to try this place. It is located at Dana Park on the NW corner of Baseline and Val Vista Dr.  It feels like it is in Gilbert, but actually a Mesa address. 
The location isn't really very handy though. The shop it tucked deep in the corner of the plaza and would be easy to miss if you are just driving around.
  
They have a good selection of flavors to choose from. I think you will enjoy the visit. We also found the Ocean Blue at Chandler Mall.
