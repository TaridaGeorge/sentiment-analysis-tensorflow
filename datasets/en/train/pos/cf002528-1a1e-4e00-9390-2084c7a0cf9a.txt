This little tiny restaurant (which I NEVER knew was there!!) is definitely tied for the best pizza I've had in Phoenix. The penne alla vodka was amazing as well. Two small pizzas and two pasta dishes filled up the 4 of us to the brim! 

Great atmosphere, reasonable prices, amazing food and excellent, friendly service...I'll definitely be bringing my family here the next time they visit Phoenix!
