Have you ever  dreamed about a restaurant you visited,, and wanted to go back no matter that it was 2000+ miles away? This is one of those. I want to go back, NOW. The pastry, the orange juice, the eggs. yum. you need to go and try it. I believe it's worth the money ( not cheep).  The only big down side is the lack of parking and line.
