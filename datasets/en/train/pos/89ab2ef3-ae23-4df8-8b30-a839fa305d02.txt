Those of us "foodies" know that if the company is not good, the food is not good...regardless...which is why I am happy to give Bar North such a great review.  I was there with a terrific group of people [STAR 1].  We were able to relax on the patio (with clean furniture, I might add) overlooking the fountains, in an intimate setting where we could hear one another [STAR 2].  The wine list was good, at a fair (i.e., expected) price [STAR 3].  The appetizers and salads were awesome [STAR 4].  And the waitstaff (Damn, I wish I could remember her name!) was incredible [STAR 5].  'nough said.
