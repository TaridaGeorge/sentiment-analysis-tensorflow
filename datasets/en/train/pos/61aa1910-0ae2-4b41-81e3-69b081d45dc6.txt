I love this little street in Phoenix dubbed as the "Artsy District" by my friend who lives there. I walked in to this house that's turned in to the JoBot cafe/coffee house vibrantly playing Beats Antique and related tracks. I was instantly in love!!! I got a banana and nutella crepe to go which they wrapped up like a roti in a cup. I grabbed a few forks and knives on my way out and went to town - damn was it good. Top 5 crepes I've ever had in my entire life.

5 Yelps for the location, environment, one of the 5 best crepes ever, attitude, friendliness and hipster vibe. Fantastic - my only complaint is that it took 15 minutes to make me a crepe?
