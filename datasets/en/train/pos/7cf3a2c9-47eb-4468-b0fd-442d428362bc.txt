We are from San Francisco visiting and a friend recommended this place.  It was awesome.  The tempura was the best.  I loved  the chicken Marsala pasta.  It was weird to find Japanese and Italian in one place,but it works.  Don't forget to try desert.  We had chocolate cake and strawberry cake.  They were so light.  We went back for dinner again the next day to try the salmon spinach pasta and some of the sushi rolls.  The service was attentive even though the place was packed.  I look forward to coming here whenever we are in Az.
