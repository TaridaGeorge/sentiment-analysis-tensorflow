This is the best hidden gem in Chandler!! Best sushi I have ever had! It is fresh and prepared right in front of you! They display the fish they are using, so you know it hasn't been sitting out all day. You can see how tender and fresh it looks! The service is quick! You would never find it if you weren't informed about it. The inside is tiny, but it's never too packed in there. You can sit up at the bar and the sushi chef is really knowledgeable and enjoys talking about the sushi with you as well! There is a back room for private events. I found out about Shimogamo for a birthday party I attended in the back room, and it is intimate, but not too restricted! Try the best sushi in town!
