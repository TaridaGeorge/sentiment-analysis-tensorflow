Ok, I eat here A LOT... and for years they have never failed me in making some really, really good food.  I am closing in on 300 meals from this place.  I do quite a lot of take out and in 5-10 min its ready to go!  As of late I've been killing the Lettuce Wraps!!!!  Holy goodness!  Ummmm...   Some of my Favs are Spicy Korean chicken w/brown rice,  Stir Fired Chicken w/ xtra chicken and xtra egg!  Ummmm...  Working out and want to eat clean...  their teriyaki chicken over steamed brown rice is super!  The chicken is prepared very nicely!   All in all, you can count on some good food at a good price.  I'm hungry!
