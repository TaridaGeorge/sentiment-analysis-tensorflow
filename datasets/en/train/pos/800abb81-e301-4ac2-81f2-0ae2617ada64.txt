I hired Meg, from The Lucky Shot, to do my kitchen photoshoot a few months ago. She came highly recommended from other friends. I could not have been happier! She has a great personality and is able to make you feel really comfortable during the shoot. She is very patient and open to whatever ideas you may have. The photos came out beautifully...and I could not have been happier with the whole experience!!
