I defy you to find a better dining option in any airport - seriously.  While I'm an unabashed fan of LGO I have to say I'm shocked to see how well the quality carries over to this location and as a frequent traveler I only wish other airports maintained such high standards for their dining options.

Had the Red Velvet Cupcake, Oatmeal Butterscotch Cookie, and Giandujia Croissant this time around and as usual everything was high quality while service is every bit up to snuff with the original location.  The best part?  No price hike for the airport location.
