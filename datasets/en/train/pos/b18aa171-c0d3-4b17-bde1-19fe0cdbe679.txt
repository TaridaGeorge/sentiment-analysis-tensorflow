bought a camera and a lens here a few weeks ago and i am nothing more than 100% pleased with everything about this place. Judith is amazing and so knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Morgan is very helpful and knowledgeable as well....both have been a great help to me in the process of getting my new camera.
they have a wide selection of camera bags and accessories, filters, tripods etc...everything really that may need is there. They dont have a whole lot of cameras but they do have lenses you can choose from new and used :-) 
if youre in scottsdale or looking for a great photo store....DEFINITELY CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!
