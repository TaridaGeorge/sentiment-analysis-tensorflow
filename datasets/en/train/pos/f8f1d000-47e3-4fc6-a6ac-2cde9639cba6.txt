Eating here it felt like I was Riding a Unicorn down a mountain while drinking from a Goblet filled with the laughter of Children. Demolition Man the movie has Taco Bell as a fine dining establishment in the future I can now see why. Eating the Chalupa Supreme makes me have faith in humanity that we can over come obstacles and create beautiful things. You could put anything inside a Chalupa bun and it would be delicious. I cut off some of my beard and put it in the Chalupa it was outstanding. I think part of the reason it was so good is because I had some Hummus from Greek Pita left in my beard.
