Over the last three years we've tried at least a dozen different Phoenix-area Indian restaurants.  Indian Paradise is easily the best around and as good as we've had in any other city.  

We've eaten here dozens of times for dinner, and a couple times for the lunch buffet.  The dinner is much better than the buffet, it tastes fresher and they do a great job of cooking to the requested spice level.  

I love the Rogan Josh and get it almost every time.  Also good are the Chicken Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala.  Make sure you order Naan for dipping in the curry.
