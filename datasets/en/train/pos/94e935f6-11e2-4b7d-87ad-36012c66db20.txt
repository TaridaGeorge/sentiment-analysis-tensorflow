Glad to see them on the map after winning Cupcake Wars!!! Their cupcakes rival if not beat Sprinkles. Brown Velvet, Peach-Berry Shortcake, and Tomato Soup & Grilled Cheese (sounded weird) but that last one was on Cupcake Wars and it was surprisingly really good as well!!!! 
Not to mention their stuff is all organic (hence the brown velvet instead of red) Definitely get their cupcakes and you won't be disappointed. Just try and keep yourself from going too many times.... Hasn't worked well for our family yet. lol.
