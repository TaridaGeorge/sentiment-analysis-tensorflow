The Roosevelt has it all. Amazing beers, craft food and exceptional service. 

Set in a lovingly restored home, this cozy spot feels like a second home, where everyone is welcome and treated like family. 

The Roosevelt is great for many reasons, and the great food is one of them. Don't miss the tasty pretzels and most of all the grilled cheese!

They also have amazing beers served so cold- it is a feat of science. Seeing tiny frozen beer particles floating in your glass is very peaceful- especially in the summer. 

My favorite beer is temporarily unavailable on tap, but I hear it will be making a return soon. Look for Great White Ale, it's tremendous with tones of orange and delightfully crisp.
