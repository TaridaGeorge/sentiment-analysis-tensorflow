A MUST TRY!

My husband and I have been searching for good Thai food in the area.  We were not expecting a lot as we have yet to find good Thai food here in Arizona.

At Thai Paradise were pleasantly surprised with the authenticity of the cuisine.  The food here is fantastic!!!!  Definitely bursting with flavor and Thai Hot was perfectly spicy.  A great kick but not too much that it was over powering any of the great flavors.

My husband ordered the Curry Noodles with Chicken and I had the Spicy Basil with Beef.  Both were delicious!  And echoing what Jamie M. wrote, great depth and complexity in the flavors!  We enjoyed it much more than Thai Rama.  We're glad we tried this place, we'll definitely be back!
