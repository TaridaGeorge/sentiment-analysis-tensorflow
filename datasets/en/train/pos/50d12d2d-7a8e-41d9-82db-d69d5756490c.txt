If you've got the Starwood Points (or the cash) this is THE place to stay while visiting Scottsdale.  Its in the BEST location, has a great pool, complete with a lazy river and activities to keep kids and adults busy alike.  Highlights of the trip are drinks during sunset with the bagpipes playing on the golf course and FREE smores with the kids in the playground until 8 pm.
