Wanted to explain further about the prices. I go on Friday always after getting paid so I don't know if the prices shift over the week. Anyways - 

Cucumbers - 10 for $1
Potatoes - .59 / lb
Cabbage - 3 heads for $1 
Bell pepper - .79
Navel oranges - 7lb for $1

Suggestion: Go to the freezer aisle. Tina's burritos now come in a six pack for $2. You save .40 by getting the bulk package. I recommend getting three packs for 2 week groceries. 

Our bill for 2 weeks for 2 adults comes to around $60-70.
