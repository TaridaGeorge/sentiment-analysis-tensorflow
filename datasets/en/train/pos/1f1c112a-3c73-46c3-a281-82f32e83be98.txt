Mad G's has all of the right ingredients to become a go-to spot to bring friends or even for a date night.   Since it's so new I'd imagine it's still building up its clientele. 
A couple of pool tables, darts, a nice selection of beers on tap, and fun mixed drink options.   I didn't get a chance to try the food, but I did spill my second glass of wine and the bartender refilled me with no questions asked.  Mucho appreciado!
