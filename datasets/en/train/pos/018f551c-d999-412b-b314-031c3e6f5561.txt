This is one of the best and only vintage music stores/art galleries in the valley. 

The prices are actually incredible. You'll find one-of-a-kind, very rare gear in good condition for flat out steals. Last time I was there he was selling a 73 Gibson SG in perfect condition for less than $900. Which is obscenely affordable for that iconic guitar.

The owner, Rob, is friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful. Come in and chat with him, play his gear. He's been around the Phoenix scene for a long time and is a very rad dude.
