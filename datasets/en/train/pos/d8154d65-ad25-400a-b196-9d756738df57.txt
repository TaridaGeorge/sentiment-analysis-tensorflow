Z's Greek is great. It doesn't look like much from the outside, and one could easily drive right by without giving it a second thought, but they'd be missing out. I have been coming here for the past year or so, and everything I get is better than the next thing. Their gyro meat is wonderfully spiced, their crazy fries are delicious, and their salads are always fresh and full of flavor. And best of all, every delicious dish is priced at really really affordable rates. The atmosphere is more of a diner/fast food joint than a restaurant, but the staff is always friendly and the place is always clean. Thanks Z's!
