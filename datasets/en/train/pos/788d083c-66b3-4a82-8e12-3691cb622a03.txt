Yummmm. It's probably going to say how many time's i've checked in next to my review and it's kind of embarrassing but not really because Lo-Lo's is  awesome! It's always busy on Saturday and Sunday mornings but the wait is never very long and the food always comes out fast!

I typically order the Tre-Tre's and a side of cornbread which is the perfect amount of food. The fried chicken is consistently crispy and the waffle is not too fluffy.  I've tried the grits too! Everything comes with heaps of butter so be prepared!

I've definitely gone more than 5 times and its really weird how two or three people always ask what you want to drink..even when you've already been helped but other than that, no complains about the service!
