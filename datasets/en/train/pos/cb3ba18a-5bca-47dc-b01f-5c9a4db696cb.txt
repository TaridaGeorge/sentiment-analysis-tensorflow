I love this place!  The food is delicious!! Great gyro plates, hummus, and chicken kabobs!  Oh yeah and the tabooli and baklava are awesome! Price is right also! Ding! Ding! Bonus!

Staff is friendly and recognized me as a regular just after a few visits.  I usually call in my order for pick up and they know it's me.  If you cook Middle Eastern food they are also a grocery store.

Gotta try!!
