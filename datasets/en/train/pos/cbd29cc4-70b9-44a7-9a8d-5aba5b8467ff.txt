For a romantic dinner, the patio of this small cafe is beautiful at night.  We sat outside as the lights began to come on throughout, it was wonderful.  We enjoyed two margaritas at happy hour prices each!  We also enjoyed wonderful pork empanadas, they were huge!  I ordered the seafood chile relleno with green chile cornbread and the maple-glazed chipotle carrots.  My honey ordered the chipotle chicken with green chile cornbread and chipotle mashed.  We were highly impressed with the quality of the food -- everything was fresh and delicious.  The prices were high, though.  Anyhow, still a fan.
