I am so grateful that Yelp on my phone steered us to D'LIsh. We had planned to follow up a great dinner at Green, just down the street, with breakfast at the same spot, but Green was closed. No problem! We drove up to D'Lish and had a great breakie of the California Club breakfast sand and a veggie sandwich. The coffee with first-rate, and the staff was super cool to a couple of out-of-towners who were gawking at all of the outstanding options on the menu board. Too bad we had a plane to catch. We would have stayed for lunch.
