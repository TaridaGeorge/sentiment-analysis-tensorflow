The grounds & building are magnificent!  The Museum is so well laid out you could spend an Hour or a Day depending on how much you want to get out of it.

Cool set of earphones that go on when you are in front ot the TV displays at most exhibits so you hear the music or information- OR you can take them off and just READ and LOOK.

Puts that whole "Phoenix has no culture" Urban Legend to rest Once & For All!  GO..........take adults, teens, even little kids - its something for everyone.  

My 75 year old dad and 16 year old teenager BOTH enjoyed the Experience Room where you get to try out a variety of instruments!
