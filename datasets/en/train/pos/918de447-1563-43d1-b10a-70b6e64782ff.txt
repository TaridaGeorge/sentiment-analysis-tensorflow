Stopped in quickly today to return an item I bought online. I had my packing slip so it was no problem and that way didn't have to deal with shipping the return back through the mail. 
Also got my free beauty insiders birthday gift today! If you sign up for a beauty insiders card you accumulate points which you can redeem for little extras or deluxe samples. On your birthday they give you a little treat like a lip balm set or shower gel!
