Maricopa has tried to do pizza, but Barro's finally got it right.  It is located in a strip shopping center taking up the corner shop.  It has several booths along the walls, but gets busy around lunch/ dinner times.  You walk up to the counter to order, sit down and wait for them to bring your food out.  The pizza is sooo good.  Especially when it is hot.  The veggies taste fresh, and they offer many, many topping choices.  They do have their own specialty pizzas that are worth a try, (hint, hint: the White Pizza).

Several pizza places offer wings, but Barro's, once again, got them right.  There are a variety of flavors, and they are a decent size.  They also offer bread sticks, salads, pastas and sandwiches.  
For lunch, this is one place you can still get a single slice of pizza.  YUM!
