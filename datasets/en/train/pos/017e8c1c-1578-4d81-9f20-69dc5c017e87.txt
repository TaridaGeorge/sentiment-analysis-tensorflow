Best beer in Arizona: Hop Knot IPA. Their Raj IPA is great too, but Hop Knot is their gem. Do not buy into the hype over Kiltlifter, it is not all that. Their food here is great, some of the best pub food I have had. Fish N Chips are especially bomb. Be sure to try theri sweet jalapeno sauce with your fries...
