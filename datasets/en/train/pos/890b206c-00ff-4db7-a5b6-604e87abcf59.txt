The distinguished puertorican writer and  political advocate Lola Rodriguez de Tio in her 1893 publication of the poem: "A Cuba" said: "Cuba y Puerto Rico son de un pajaro las dos alas". (Cuba and Puerto Rico are the two wings of a bird). And for those of us living far away from our beloved Islands, The Havana Cafe offers the perfect mixture of culture, food, flavors, music and atmosphere.  Especially when one doesn't feel like getting in the kitchen or catching the next flight to San Juan.  Pricey?  Yes, like any other premium service of its kind.  Delicious and as authentic as one can find 2000 miles away from home.  Don't forget to try the "Arroz con Gandules"; it is phenomenal! Sorry mom!
