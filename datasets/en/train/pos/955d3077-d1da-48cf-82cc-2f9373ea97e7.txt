First time eating at Pure was last night. Loved it. We met two other couples and really had a great time. The place was hoppin' when we got there -- good sign -- but it was easy to get a quick drink at the bar and the wait was only a few minutes. Our server, Jaymie, was fantastic. The Dragon roll was phenomenal, as were the other three rolls we had. Sushi and sashimi were very good, too. We split the butterfish -- it was over the top. I will be getting that every time. If you like great food, sushi and a fun place, we think you'll dig Pure.
