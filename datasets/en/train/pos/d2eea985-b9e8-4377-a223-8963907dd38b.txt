Awesome steaks. This place has certainly changed over the years. It has recently been updated and given a face lift, but the top rate service and food has remained a constant. Ryan, if you are looking for cheap, tough meat Monti's in Tempe is fine, but if you are looking for something a bit more refined this is the place. The Prime Rib is one of the best in town. Some people are dressed up and others are in Jeans or nice shorts.
