You can only hope that, on every vacation or long business trip, you will have at least one simply wonderful meal.  On my recent trip to the nearby Boulders resort, our dinner at Cartwright's was the one.  Everything we had was somewhere between "very good" and "amazing", with the "Cheyenne Indian Buffalo & Chipotle Sausage" appetizer, the buffalo tenderloin and the cinnamon ice cream with homemade peanut brittle being the real standouts.  

I suspect we may have been served by the same waitress that "Nathan L." (in a previous review) was served by.  She did seem a little high-strung and humorless for the job, but she did her job well enough and her co-workers were all excellent.
