Bottom Line: Everyone I've taken here keeps coming back for more.

This place hands down is better than Five Guys and In & Out combined. 

I stumbled upon Smashburger after coming out of the movies and I've been there almost every weekend for a meal since. They have an amazing menu from their signature burgers to building your own, salads, hot dogs, sides (amazing sweet potatoe fries) and shakes, even BEER! 

I promise no one will b disappointed.
