I have been looking FOREVER for an honest and helpful mechanic.  Bob and his team are amazing.  What turned out to be quoted at another mechanic as a $600 repair turned out to be less than $200, and he took the time to explain why.  

Not only are they friendly, but for the first time in 3-4 mechanics, my car drives better after 1 appointment.  Can't go wrong with Bob and his team.
