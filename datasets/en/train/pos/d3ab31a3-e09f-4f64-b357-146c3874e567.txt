I have a puppy (6 months) and when my wife and I have to go out of town for work or fun we make sure to take him there. The best part is there is always someone the 24 hours a day and night (Petsmart does not). Included in the price is Day Care/Day Camp (Petsmart does not).

There was one time that it was midnight and I had to leave town right away so I called them and I was able to drop off my puppy that same night (1am).

This is the best Pet Hotel in the State!
