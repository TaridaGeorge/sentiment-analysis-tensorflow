Just got done last week with the Sunfare Optimal cleanse.  The program was easy to follow and not as difficult as I expected.   The food and shakes were enjoyable!   I mixed the shakes in the blender with ice and water and a little stevia and cinnamon and they were satisfying.   I lost exactly 10 lbs in the 10 days as claimed and I did not start out needing to lose any more than that.  Great program for those looking to drop the last 10 stubborn lbs or for those looking to get a quick jump start on a longer weight loss plan.  Thanks Sunfare for offering this great program.  I am now committed to remaining caffeine and gluten free thanks to your program!
