Came here for the first time after some fun apartment hunting. It was cloudy, hot, and I was feeling horrible from a bad cold. I figured a little bit of comfort food would make me feel better, and even with the hot weather, I wanted some soup! My fiance and I shared a spicy cuban sandwich and a bowl of broccoli cheddar soup. Both were super good, and I felt much much better. Although I loved our meal, I think the 5 star rating is thanks to the cranberry oatmeal cookie. O-M-G it was the most moist, most delicious cookie I have ever had. WOW sooo soft mmmm.. and the cranberries reminded me of thanksgiving. Get that cookie, you won't regret it!
