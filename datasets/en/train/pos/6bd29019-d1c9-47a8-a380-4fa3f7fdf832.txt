I have extremely sensitive teeth.  Or at least, I thought I did until Dr. Woodbury.  Somehow he is able to work on them (even on my upper front teeth) without me feeling ANYTHING.  

His staff is great as well.  I have yet to have anything less than phenomenal encounters with all of them.

I've been there 3 times now, and as of yet I haven't had to wait in the waiting room more than 5 minutes.  

Definitely a keeper!
