This is the pizza that California Pizza Kitchen wishes it could be like:  Organic, natural, and free-range products that are fresh, flavorful, and are balanced perfectly with the other ingredients on your pizza.  The crust is just right-perfectly crispy.  I tried a Margherita pizza and the chicken artichoke.  The chicken artichoke was delicious, with lots of toppings, huge chunks of artichoke, and very flavorful chicken.  Since they use free-range chicken, you can definitely tell the difference in taste vs. a regular mass-farmed chicken.  Service was excellent as well.  Despite being very busy, our drinks were constantly attended to and refilled as needed.  I will definitely be going here again for more pizza, and to try out some wings!

P.S.  If you get an appetizer, I highly recommend the brie and roasted garlic plate.  So delicious!
