The parking situation at this Oreganos is a bit better than their Tempe location, but is still a hassle. luckily, i lived walking distance from everything important in Scottsdale. the wait times are obscenely long as great pizza can't be rushed, but i feel like i can make a better push by calling ahead or coming in just before dinner-time (read: 3 or 4 o'clock). 
the roommate and i would come here often for a simple ice cream cookie dessert. i highly recommend it!
