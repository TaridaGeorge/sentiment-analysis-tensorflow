I went here last night, and it was a great experience.  I ordered 3by3 with grilled onions, fries, and a drink.  My mouth almost dropped when the dude told me the total: $7.80!  I'm gonna eat here more often.

The staff was nice, the girl callin out the orders didn't hump your leg, but was still attentive.  Fries weren't oversalted, burger was cooked well, and the Dr. Pepper tasted gooood.  5 stars.  Keep up the good work in-n-out.
