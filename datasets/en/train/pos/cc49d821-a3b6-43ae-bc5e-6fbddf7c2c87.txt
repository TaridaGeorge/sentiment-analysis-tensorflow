Great brewery!  They have at least 8 of their own beers on tap and some really good guest beers as well, about 20 +.  

FYI: They don't serve any food other than popcorn and snack mix.
But, they allow you to have food delivered or to bring your own food in to the brewery.

I find that it is better and less expensive to bring my own food in (In-N-Out, Papa Johns, Thai-Rama, etc).
