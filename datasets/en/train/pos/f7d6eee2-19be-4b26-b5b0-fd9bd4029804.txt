Southwest serves a purpose - safe travel at low prices. This is a no frills airline so don't expect champagne in coach.  I travel a lot for work and pleasure and don't see a need to pay more to get from point A to point B. 

Furthermore, Southwest is a true American story, starting out in Texas and growing and shrinking with demand, some I respect.
