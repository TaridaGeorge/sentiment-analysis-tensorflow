visiting from San Diego and thought we should stop in. Food was great and authentic irish (is that an oxymoron). The waitress did fudge up the order of beers but I like all beers so the problem wasn't really a problem after-all. It's location right around the ball park made it super convenient. We will definitely be back for a weekend night sometime in the near future.
