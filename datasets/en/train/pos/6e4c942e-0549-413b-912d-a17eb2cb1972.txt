Very good but let's start from the beginning.

The bread and dips were good.I recommend only dipping the "chippy" bread in the green guacamole looking dip. The brownish dip had almost every single flavor and was not very good.

The Curry Chicken was very good and no doubt about it I would get it again. Also the Korma Lamb was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! It had a very good sauce around it. The Tandoori Shrimp came with perfectly cooked onions and the shrimp was perfect too. Also the garlic strips are plain.    

Some of the downsides are just slow service and really bad drinks. Don't get any sodas! I'm telling you this is great food!
