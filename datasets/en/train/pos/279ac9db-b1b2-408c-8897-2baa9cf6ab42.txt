I have been a patient of Dr Pat Dietzgen for many years.  She takes great care of both myself and my 4 children.  I feel that she listens to my concerns and also offers good suggestions.  I have been to Dr Mark Dietzgen for weight loss help.  I found his recommendations to be very successful.  When my friends ask me where to go for good medical care I always say Ahwatukee Primary Care.
