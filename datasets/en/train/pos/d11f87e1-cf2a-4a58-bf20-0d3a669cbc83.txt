What can you do anymore for three bucks?  You can get a PBR-in-a-can at a hipster bar and play a few rounds of pinball. Or...you can go to Michael Pollack's strange and illustrious discount cinema!  It's nice and clean, they tend to have a pretty good selection at any given time: the latest Pixar movie, something staring Denzel Washington involving fast moving vehicles and explosions, a chick flick (I don't recommend the latter, but hey, I know they're popular).  I don't want to spoil your experience by listing off ALL the decor, but there's animatronics and life-sized presidents of the past.  If you want to make a night out of it and are up for spending the money you saved at the movies on dinner, eat at Yupha's Thai right next door.  It's amazing.
