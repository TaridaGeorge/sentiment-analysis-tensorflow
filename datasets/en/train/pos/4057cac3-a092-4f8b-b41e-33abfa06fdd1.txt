BEST COFFEE EVER! ...Wait, BEST COFFEE PLACE EVER!

This is the type of coffee spot I've always wanted to find but never could. My search is over (kind of...I wish it was closer to me). You can tell that Cartel is passionate about their product. They put quality first, and it's evident in the flavor of the espresso, roast, grind, milk, steam, pour, etc. Therefore the finished product is always a masterpiece. The service is great too. I'd move into the place if they let me.
