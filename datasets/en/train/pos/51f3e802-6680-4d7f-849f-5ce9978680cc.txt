So, a year after posting my review for Dr. Eckel...I'm now pregnant.  16 weeks to be exact as of today.  

Its been nothing but a wonderful experience!  My husband really likes Dr. Eckel and the entire staff, which means a lot.  Any questions you may have outside of an appointment, they're quick to get back to you.  And Dr. Eckel deliver's about 85% of his patients babies.  

To quote my husband, "I believe we got ourselves a 'Dr. Huxtable'!"
