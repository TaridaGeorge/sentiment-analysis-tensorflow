Have read a lot of reviews but have never been here prior to tonight. Not sure about the reviews regarding poor service. It's not McDonald's folks...this place is not meant to get you in and out in 45 minutes. If you want your food quick...call it in and get it to take-out. Take your time and enjoy the amazing food, affordable wine, and great space.

I was there with my wife and sister, and we ordered 8 different bruschettas, a sandwich, and a salad. They were all hits...no misses. Our service was quick, friendly, helpful and attentive. Giving us advice like recommending that we buy the bottle instead of three glasses of the same wine cause we get a free glass! Woohoo! :)

Will definitely be going back, and very happy that I finally went!
