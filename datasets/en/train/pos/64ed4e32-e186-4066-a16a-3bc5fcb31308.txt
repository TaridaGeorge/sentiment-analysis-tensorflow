Knew this was going to be great when it was a Mom/Pop hole in the wall.  Food was very good, service was excellent.  Waitress, Suzie was hilarious and a great help.  Would suggest asking for Carlos' special hot sauce if you like spice or will be a bit bland.  Great happy hour menu.  Had the happy hour chile rellano (massive) and the nacho pork (great).
