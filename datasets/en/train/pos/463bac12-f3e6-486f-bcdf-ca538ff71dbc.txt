We love this place! My wife and I have been coming here since it opened. Initially, we just used the dog wash. As they have expanded, we have switched to buying our food, treats, pill pockets, etc exclusively from Kimbur Pet Care. They are knowledgeable and seem to genuinely care for their pets (which makes me believe that they would do a good job in caring for yours).
