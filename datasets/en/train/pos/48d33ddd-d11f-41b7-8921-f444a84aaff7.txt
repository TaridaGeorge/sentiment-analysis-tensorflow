I refuse to shop at any other dept store they have extra 30% off sale merch every once in awhile so those reg priced $400 boots on sale at 25% off are now just $210 I used that nifty calculator feature on this pc :) This location is always getting better clothing lines I love that they actually have a large "Missy" section so that I can dress my actual age and not like a Junior or Grandmother. No other store has sales like them even those Ross (Eww) Marshalls, Last Chance, types of stores cant compare but you dont have to believe me ;)
