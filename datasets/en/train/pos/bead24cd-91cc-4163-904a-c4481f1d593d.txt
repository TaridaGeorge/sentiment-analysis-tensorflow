I have been going to Cafe Lalibela since it opened, which was a few years before I even moved to the valley.  I have never had a bad experience or anything less than excellent food.

They have an enormous menu, but I usually tell the waitress to bring me whatever is good - and vegetarian.  The waitstaff is prompt, attentive and very helpful.

The food is the star, from the injera to the teas, you simply can not go wrong at Lalibela.  Ethiopian food is unlike anything else, and it is SO tasty.

My only problem is convincing my friends to go with me!
