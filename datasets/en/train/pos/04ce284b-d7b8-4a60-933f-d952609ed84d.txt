Tried this place out on a Saturday night: had the sisay (a crispy pork with onions and green chillies) and spare ribs, and it was really good food.  You can taste the freshness of the ingredients, and it was prepared quickly by the waiter that was also the cook.  We were the only people in there, although several people came through for to-go orders.  Will definitely try their breakfast buffet some Sunday.
