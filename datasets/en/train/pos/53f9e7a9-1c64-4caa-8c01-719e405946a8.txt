I love this place.  We come here often and have been since it opened.  I love the 4B burger (bacon, blue cheese, bbq sauce and onion ring), the chicken pesto sandwich is to die for as well!  I love how fresh everything is and that they get most of their veggies on site in their garden.  The BBQ pizza is also good, as well as their shakes, malts and sundaes.  We always bring company here especially when the weather is nice because you can sit outside and bring your (leashed) dog too :).  Plus, they give you $10 towards your meal on your birthday!  Love this place!
