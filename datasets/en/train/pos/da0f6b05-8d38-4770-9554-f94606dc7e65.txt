While on vacation, I found this place thanks to yelpers. I had a caramel soy latte & a bacon w/ a scrabbled egg croissant sandwich. Yum, simple, just as I would make it. 

Fresh baked goods. Nice employees--- I think it was the owner that I was talking to, very nice & helpful.

If I lived here I would be a regular.
