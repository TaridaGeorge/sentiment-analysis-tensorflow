Love appetizers and drinks at the Capital bar!  The calamari with peppers is excellent, and you can't beat their signature pineapple infused vodka (Stoli Doli) martini! The staff is friendly and attentive. If you like a steakhouse with a warm wood ambiance and outstanding food, this is the place for you!
