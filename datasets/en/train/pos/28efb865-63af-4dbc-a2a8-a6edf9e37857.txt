Every time I have come to enjoy a nice morning meal I am surprised with something on the menu I never thought to order. Stinging here this morning it was the norm: huevos rancheros YUM!

A recommendation from the exceptional waiter (cute by the way) and I am now finishing my mouth watering taste bud pampering order of Chelsea's Hot Cakes!!! Plus Plus Plus

P.S. don't ask for the Bellini... They are out. Sad Face. But Saturdays the endless Mimosa sounds like a good deal.
