I have never had any pizza, ceasar salad, or chicken parmesian as good as at Defalco's. Somebody once told me, "quality takes time" well let me tell you waiting an extra few minutes or so for this delicious meal was WAY worth it. The quality this place puts out is like nowhere else I've ever eaten, no other place that outshines it, can't wait to go back!
