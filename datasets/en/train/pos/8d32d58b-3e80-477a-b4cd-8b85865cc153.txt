Service is fast and friendly and the burgers are amazing. 

Today I had the blue cheese balsamic burger and it is amazing as it sounds! My friend order the Fez burger and really enjoyed it. I have tried most of the menu items and have yet to be let down. 

I've been here quite a bit for happy hour or farewell lunches for coworker. I really love the ambiance. Its modern but retro in a way and sleek. The large windows make for a happy lunch time setting and an ultra classy dinner setting. The patio is large and well spaced. Tables are not set too close together so its nice not to have your dining neighbors listening in on your conversation. 

Over all a really nice experience every time!
