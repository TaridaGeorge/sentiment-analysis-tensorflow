I ate here for dinner for the first time last night and I loved it. I was immediately impressed walking in it seemed like everything sparkled. The decor inside was simple, modern, and chic. It made me feel like I wasn't in Arizona anymore. Everything on the menu looked great and I ended up ordering the grilled cheese sandwich with a salad on the side. The food here is really good. I would come back for the side salad that came with my sandwich. I loved the salad so much I forgot I ordered a sandwich! AZ88 is a beautiful restaurant filled with beautiful people and I was surprised that the prices were so reasonable. I think this is a great date spot if you want to impress your date bring him/her here.
