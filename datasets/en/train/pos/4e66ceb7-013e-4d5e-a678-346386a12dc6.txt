Ahhh gelato.....what would the world be like without it? I don't want to know. It's amazing stuff, and this establishment has a great selection of flavors. They offer sample tastings and although I could easily try all of them, I figured two was socially acceptable.  
The decor has a euro-retro feel and there always seems to be somewhere to sit which is nice. We've never ordered the Italian coffee although it smells delicious as well. 
A great treat anytime!!!
