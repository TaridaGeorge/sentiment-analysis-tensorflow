Its great to see RedSeven expanding, The new store is in a great location, the store looks really cool and very high tech. The grand opening was great, got to commiserate with other FOSS geeks and scored a cool coffee mug that is big enough to hold half a pot of coffee! Why talk the talk when you can be like Mike and walk the walk..;-)
