I found this place by accident while I was visiting Starbucks and I am so happy that I did! I went in for the first time last week and was back this week. I only tried their hummus with extra pita and tomatoes! Yum! Their pita bread alone is so delicious and of course the hummus too! I cannot wait to take my boyfriend here because I know he will love it as well! I just keep thinking about the hummus and pita! OMG! Soooo tasty! *MOUTH DROOLS* The lady up front is very nice too and I liked that they had tables outside! I cannot wait to go back!!
