Addicting food at an incredible value.

Ask the owner/manager (last I saw he shaved his head bald and had a beard) for recommended combos-- pretty sure he recommended a chorizo and cabeza taco and it was fantastic. Fish tacos are top notch.

Must drink the horchata. It get scooped out of a giant bucket, which is weird, but it is to die for.

I live a solid 21 hours away from this place-- it's definitely on my agenda whenever I come to Phoenix!
