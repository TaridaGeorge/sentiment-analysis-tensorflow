It's a totally different experience than DPOV....totally different. 

This restaurant is like an old English library with some really fabulous eats. I think we have only enjoyed filet mignon here but I am telling you...it was really delicious. Of course, as is always the case with me, I enjoy starting each meal with a salad...and their Ceasar was delicious!

As Bil Z mentioned, their brunch is outstanding! We enjoyed it each day during our stay at Tapatio while trying something new each meal. This is a wonderful place to go out for a nice family meal while staying at the resort since there is something for everyone!
