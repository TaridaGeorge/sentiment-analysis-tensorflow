Love the customer service, the produce is always fresh and a terrific deal and the choice of Gluten Free foods is amazing!  I love the customized coupons you can get when you join their email list and they are terrific at answering questions posted on facebook.

I really take advantage of their twice yearly gluten free sale as well as their overlapping Wednesday sales!  I love that you get the joy of two sales flyers price then!  The meat department is good as well and everything is very fresh.

Oh, don't forget the essential oils and vitamins and nutritional products!  Great selection of organic and specialty items.  Love it here!
