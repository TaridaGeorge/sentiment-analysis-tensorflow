This is definitly one of my favorite places in town. The selection on the menu here is smaller than most Pho's around but this place is definitly more upscale than most also. They bring the food out beautifully plated so everything looks real upscale and tastes excellent.  The downside is they don't have some of my fav things but I have learned to like some new ones. Service is very good also. I have tried the house special pho, the curry, and the spring rolls. One of my  friends ordered the combo plate,  it looked really cool the way they plated it and he said it was very good. Everything I ordered was very good and I look forward to going back and trying some more things.
