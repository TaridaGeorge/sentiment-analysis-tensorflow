Love this place!

Went during lunch with my colleagues so could not try off their wine/liquor list but the food and decor did not fail us.

We sat outside and enjoyed a nice spring day in Arizona. Pre-summer so able to enjoy lunch without the heat.

I ordered their mix greens salad with chicken; the greens were fresh and the chicken was seared to perfection. My company both ordered sandwich combos (chicken salad and tuna melt) and both said it was really good.

I will definitely be returning and hopefully check out their happy hour that is 11 am - 6 pm daily - can't beat that!
