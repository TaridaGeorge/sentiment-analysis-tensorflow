In a somewhat disjointed location lies a tiny gem of a restaurant. And any time I see "express" in a name I am usually hesitant to partake. But on a whim I gave Gyros Express a shot:

It's hard to argue that a proper gyro is one of every single person's favorite sandwich. And they can range from blissful to horrible... Right? Well, here you have them executed to near perfection, at least for my taste. I am a sucker for too much tsatsiki, and overly tender lamb. And solely for those reasons I whole heartedly recommend this establishment! 

The inside feels and looks like the "dining room" in a doublewide trailer, and the plateware and utensils match...but who cares, the food is cheap and delicious. Skip the million places that have "pita" in their name and seek out my favorite place for gyros! 

Oh, and the hummus! Go!!!!!!!
