We LOVE the new store!!  Everyone really knows their Oils!  The quality is the best around and shopping there is always a treat!  They did a great job moving to a larger location and often cook a little so we can taste more of the product on food.  
The Blood Orange EVOO and Cinnamon Pear Balsamic are my two favorite flavors along with Basil EVOO.  I just cannot get enough of them.    Please indulge yourselves and stop by for a visit.  Great Christmas presents!!!
