Looking for something refreshing on a hot summer day?  Check out Paletas Betty at Mill and 5th Ave in downtown Tempe.  I got the Limon flavor, just like a slice of key lime pie on a stick, even has the graham cracker crust on one side.  It was light and refreshing and definitely satisfied that afternoon sweet tooth. They have many interesting flavor combinations. I'll be going back to try them all, after all it's going to be a long hot summer.
