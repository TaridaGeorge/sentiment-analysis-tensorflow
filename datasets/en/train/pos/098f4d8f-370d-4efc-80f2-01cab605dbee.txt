my wife and i went for the Scottsdale healthcare employee appreciation night of Zoolights. 

i love, love, love zoolights. the zoo puts on a phenomenal experience for this event. just when you think "that's it", there are more and more lights. if there weren't so many damn kids and strollers around, it could be even romantic!

great job Phoenix Zoo and Zoolights. see you next year (or if the family ever comes to visit, then maybe sooner).
