Still the best!  Stopped in for a Sunday evening dinner with friends and it was a great time!  Portions were generous, served hot and very tasty!!!  Pass up Sunshine Moon at your own risk!  This place rocks!

Tonight the service really made it a great experience!!  Thank you Sunshine Moon Peking Pub!!
