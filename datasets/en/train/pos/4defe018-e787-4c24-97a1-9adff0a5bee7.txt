I sometimes eat here with my friends after hiking Dreamy Draw Hiking Trail.

Yeah we ruin the burned calories by stuffing our faces with pastas and pizzas at Babbo afterwards.

Is it good? Definitely!

As you sit you are swarmed with servers laying down complimentary breads with olive oil, and balsamic dip.

However, I cannot eat bread and pastas all the time, or I'll gain weight.

I have to watch my svelte figure now that I'm getting older.

They do have an interesting menu and the ones that I've had were extremely flavorful. I've had the Garlic Cheese Crostini, Bruschetta Romana, Roasted Asparagus, Mandarin Spinach, Mushroom Asparagus, and Pasta Rustico. The place is also very clean,  the ambiance is fabulous, and service is always great.

Highly recommended with a great lunch menu too! :-)
