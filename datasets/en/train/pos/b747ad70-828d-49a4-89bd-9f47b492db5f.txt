Flying 10+ times a year on average, I couldn't do it out of any airport besides Sky Harbor.  Using terminal 4 exclusively, I've never had a wait longer than 10 minutes going through security (Flying out mainly on Friday afternoon or early Monday morning.)  Food choices are plentiful around the terminal inside and outside of security (I am disappointed Burger King doesn't have the BK Stacker there.)  People movers are a quick way to get around or you can tip the guy to drive you right to your gate.  The decor is nice and warm compared to others (SFO.)

Getting here is very easy and the Cell lot is a great place to wait for arriving passengers.  The $2 for parking is worth it sometimes just to meet people at security so you don't feel so rushed to get baggage and say hello.  All and all, good job Phoenix.
