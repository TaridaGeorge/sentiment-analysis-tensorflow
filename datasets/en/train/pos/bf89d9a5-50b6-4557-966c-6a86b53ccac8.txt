This is a great place to hang out!! We always bring our out of town friends to check this place out. The place is very homey and cute. Lots of pink. It reminds me of high school hang outs in the old movies. The ice cream is excellent , yummy and lots of choices and affordable. I can say it is a destination place for tourists.. they have to visit this place if they come to Scottsdale...
