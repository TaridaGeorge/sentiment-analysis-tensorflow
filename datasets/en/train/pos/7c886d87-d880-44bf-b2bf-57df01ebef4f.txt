Amazing wings coupled with amazing service. I go once a week and the tell me my order as i sit at the counter!  THis makes for a small town local bar feeling.  now onto what makes BWW different...

1. You can ask for ALL DRUMETTES if you prefer at no extra charge!! I don't like the 2nd wing sections as much (double bones) as I like the first wing section (drums) 
2. You can ask for them extra crispy if that's what you like. Most places I have been to and asked for this, the wings are not any differently cooked.

The mango habenero is the finest sauce available in my opinion.  It's super sweet and tasty with plenty of fire kick to balance it out.  They sell their sauces to go too. honey BBQ is great for the kids.

Tuesdays are 35 cent wing days, see you there.
