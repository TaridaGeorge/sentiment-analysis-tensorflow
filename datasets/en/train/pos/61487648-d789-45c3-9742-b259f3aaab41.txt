The search for amazing barbeque in Phoenix is over!  I have driven past the BBQ house for a few months, always wanting to stop and finally did.  Walking in ordering my food, I was reminded of Rudy's, and as I ate my brisket i was throughly impressed.

The brisket is moist and flavorful, the potato salad was amazing and the atmosphere was perfect.

By far the best barbeque in Phoenix, I've already recommended this restaurant to friends and co-workers!
