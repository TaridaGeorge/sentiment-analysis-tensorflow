All I gotta say is "Monkey Cakes."  Holy Mother of God, they were a delight to the senses.

I've had the omelettes there too -- absolutely wonderful.

The service is less than stellar.  Sort of the "tragic hipster/totally unaffected" vibe.  If you can get past that, good, because your tummy will be happy!
