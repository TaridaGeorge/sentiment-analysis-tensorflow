Huge, beautiful, awesome. 

Never been to Scottsdale before but I've stayed at another Fairmont do I gave this one a shot. So glad I did!

The hotel is huge and spread out. The super nice bell boys give you a hold cart ride to your room and help get you acclimated to the area. 

There are three pools (at least one open 24 hours), multiple restaurants (only tried Bourbon Steak, bomb!), and pretty areas to chill and walk around. Also from a Californian it was pretty awesome to see rabbits hopping around everywhere. I'm used to squirrels. Rabbits are way more fun. 

The rooms are all super clean. The service is great. If you're in Scottsdale then this is a great place to stay!
