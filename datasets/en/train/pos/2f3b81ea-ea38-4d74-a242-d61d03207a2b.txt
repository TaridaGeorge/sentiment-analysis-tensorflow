I've been coming to SMC for almost 4 years and can't say enough great things about it; however, I'll list a few tops attributes:

1. Craig is the best wrench in town and also a hell of guy - I don't like anyone else touching my bicycles.

2. They have a great selection of gear, bikes and accessories across all price points - If you are looking for a starter bike or just want to look at the lastest and greatest high end stuff- SMC is your place.

3. The staff is incredibly helpful and welcoming.

No other local shop I've been to can compete with the top notch service and long lasting relationships you find at SMC.  They ride the roads and trails.  They care about you and your bike.

As you were.
