Great clinic with amazing medical providers and staff.  You can't find clinicians anywhere else that care about their patients from the bottom of their hearts like they do at AMC.

The patient population is very diverse at this clinic, so they usually have staff who can speak Spanish, Burmese, Nepalese etc.  If they don't have staff who can speak your language, they will provide you with an interpreter through the language line :)

There is a TV in the main waiting room and in each exam room that show family friendly movies.  Pretty awesome!

Perfect clinic for your primary care!
