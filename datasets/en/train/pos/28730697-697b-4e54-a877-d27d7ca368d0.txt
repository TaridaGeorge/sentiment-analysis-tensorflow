We bought wiindows for half of the house last year and were really pleased with them.  We bought the windows from Elias and Pete and Miguel installed them.  We were very pleased with their installation.  We had a problem with two of the windows and they came out immediately and fixed the problem. We are now in the process of getting windows for the rest of the house.
