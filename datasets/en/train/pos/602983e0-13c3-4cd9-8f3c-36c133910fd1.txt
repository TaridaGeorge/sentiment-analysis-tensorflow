I admit I only come here for the beer, but what great beer they have! My cousin loved the Peach Ale. ( What girl wouldn't?) and even I had to give it a double thumbs up. The Oatmeal Stout and Pumpkin Porter are my favs (when you can get them). And the Hopknot IPA is killer too. Happy Hour is the time to go when pints are a smidgeon over $3.00.
