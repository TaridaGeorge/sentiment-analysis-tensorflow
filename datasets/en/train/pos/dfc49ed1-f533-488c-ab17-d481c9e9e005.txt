Went with a party of 6 people who were game for mixing and matching, sharing appetizers and what not. Great- Got to try a ton of things on the menu! Everything was really good, nothing mediocre or crappy. I had the duck, an unusual choice, but wanted to get something that no one else ordered. Fabulous. The crab cakes were great, the cheese and fruit platter was pretty good, Wifey had the beef tenderloin, exceptional... and so on. Even the mussels were great. Service was fair to good, atmosphere was just OK... Not too hip of a place, and I am not a fan of dining outside, but it seemed to work for us at this place. Overall, it's rare I give out the coveted five star rating, but this place had a lot going for it- Creative menu, neat setting, and much more. Try it out!
