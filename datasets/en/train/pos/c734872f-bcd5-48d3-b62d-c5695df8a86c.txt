i've been going to Crazy Jim's for eons.  the place is more crowded than it used to be, but our waitress, Myrna, ensured that we had absolutely everything we needed and that our drinks were never, ever even close to empty.  my friend marveled over the fresh, sticky feta in her gyro with feta.  i was on a hummus kick, so i marveled over the freshly prepared hummus.  even on a busy night, the staff was attentive.  the food was excellent, and the prices reasonable.  i left a hefty tip for our waitress.  the meal, ambience, and service was worth every penny.
