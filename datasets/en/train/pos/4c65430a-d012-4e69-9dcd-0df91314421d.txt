Somehow I've always managed to live very near to a Clean Freak Car Wash (no matter where in Phoenix I move) so they've been my go-to ever since I came to Phoenix! After realizing that having a black car in the desert means constantly having a visible layer of dust, I signed up for their unlimited wash package! For $17 a month I can take my car through every day if need be! Add on a complimentary air freshener, detail towels, and vacuums, and I've got a spotless car, inside and out all the time!

The staff are extremely helpful and friendly, and always remember me and my wash preferences! Thanks Clean Freak!
