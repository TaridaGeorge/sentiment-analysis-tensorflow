REAL NY STYLE CHINESE FOOD HERE IN ARIZONA!!! 
FREE HOT TEA AND FRIED WON-TON SKINS LIKE BACK HOME! (BY REQUEST)

I am from New Jersey and so are the owners.  They opened up shop here 1 year after I moved here (1998) and I was delighted i could get a real NY egg-roll and spare ribs in Arizona.  Their best dish i feel is the Szechuan Garlic Chicken (or shrimp).  Try it once and you may never try anything else on the menu it's that good!!  Taste's the same as the best of NYC.

Their lunch specials are amazing.  Comes with soup, spring roll, crab puff, fried rice, hot tea (by request) all for a very low price.  Sunday is Dim Sum if you like dumplings.  This place NEVER disappoints and I bring work clients here from New York all the time.

they all agree, REAL NY CHINESE FOOD!!!!
