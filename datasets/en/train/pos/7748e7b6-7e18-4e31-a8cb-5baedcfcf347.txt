i always get a 6 inch BLT and a 6 inch meatball on white bread. Ive tried other items but this has been my favorite for a very long time. Some of the staff even remembers my order and asks if i want a BLT today before i tell them what i want. its pretty clean and i take an early lunch so the wait is not very long
