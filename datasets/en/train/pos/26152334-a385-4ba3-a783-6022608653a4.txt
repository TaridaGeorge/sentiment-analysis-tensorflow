So I think that I have a tie between my opinion of best Cajun/Creole food in AZ and its between Chez Monieux and Baby Kay's in Phoenix. This place had awesome Boudin balls for appetizers. I love boudin so much! When I lived in Louisiana I ate boudin like it was going out of style. The way I test good Cajun joints is by getting my favorite dish, Crawfish Etouffee and this place has it RIGHT! It was amazing! Go check this place out if you want some authentic cajun food.
