Until I ordered from Truckin' Good Food, I was a crepe virgin.  So fittingly, my first crepe was called "My First Time."  My First Time also became my second time...just so you know.

I love the nutella and I love bananas, and at first, that's all I wanted in my crepe.  Jeff persuaded me to get it with walnuts as well.  I'm glad I did.  It was delish!

Truckin' Good Food is awesome.  I look forward to trying other crepes and seeing them around in their new truck.
