This was one of the first places I tried when I moved here from Ohio last year. I was told, "you have to get the crepes!" and sure enough that is what I get every time I go. It's hard for me to order just one thing so usually I order a crepe as my "dessert" even though I'm tempted with all those delicious pastries staring me down in the display case. If I didn't live on the other side of town, I would probably be there 4 times a week(and probably weight four times my size now.) It is such a unique little place with not one bad thing on the menu. I always bring my out of towners there to eat as well!!
