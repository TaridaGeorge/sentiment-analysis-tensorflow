I tried OllieCake cupcakes today and they are the most amazing, tastiest cupcakes I have ever eaten. I tried the orange, coconut, strawberry, and peanut butter cupcakes. Right now the orange is my favorite, but I am trying the chocolate tomorrow. They are so moist and the frosting is the perfect balance of lightness and sweetness. Not too heavy, just right :)  You can really taste the quality and the organic ingredients really make a difference. These will be the only cupcakes I buy from now on, I'll never be able to eat a cupcake that comes out of a box again!
