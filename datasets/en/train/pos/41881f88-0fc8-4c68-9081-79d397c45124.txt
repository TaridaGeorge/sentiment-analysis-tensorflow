This place is ultra cool. Mis-matched mid century modern furniture. Brick walls, exposed unfinished ceiling ( you see air ducts and stuff) and lots of art.

Great people watching place as you have students, professionals, artist, all ages, all ethnicities come together in this hipster joint.

Coffee is great, the dutch pancake that they serve on weekends - AMAZING. 

I don't believe they have an obvious sign in front so just look for the building next to Pane Bianco.

Oh and this place converts into a bar at night.  Moscow Mules in copper cups anyone ?
