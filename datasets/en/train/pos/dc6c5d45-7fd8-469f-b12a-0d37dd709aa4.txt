Okay, I have going here once a week now for months and I just have to say how great this place is once again. for the first 10 times or so I always got the Pork Bun or the Sirloin Pho but I am finally starting to break out and try different items on the menu. Everything here is awesome! The staff is always the same people and extremely nice and attentive. The place is always very clean. We have to get there when they open because they are starting to get quite popular and people start packing in there for lunch. This place has my repeat business for a long time to come.
