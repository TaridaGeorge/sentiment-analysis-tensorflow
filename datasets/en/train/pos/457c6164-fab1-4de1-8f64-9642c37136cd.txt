I have to agree with Tim W. on this one. Watch your wallet when you go in here because it's very easy to spend lots of $$.

When my partner and I we're updating our condo we bought all of our celing fans and lighting here. Just about everything we bought was on sale or clearance. Some of the sale items we got an additional discount on because they were having a sale.

I highly recommend this store.
