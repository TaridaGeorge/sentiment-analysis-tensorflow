This place is 12 miles away from my house. My boyfriend and I make it a point to go once a week. The wraps are AMAZING! And, fresh! And, you don't feel like lard after eating one. Doesn't drain you and/or make you crave a nap. I get the Farmers Market Wrap which is vegetarian and is sooooooooo good. My mouth is watering right now. And, my boyfriend gets the Laguna Tuna. He loves it!
