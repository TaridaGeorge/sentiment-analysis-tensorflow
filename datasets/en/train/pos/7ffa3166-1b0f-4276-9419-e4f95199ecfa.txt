This place is awesome. I have tried the rainbow salad and Hawaiian burger on several occasions.  The service is quick and professional.  The food is wholesome and great tasting.  The bathrooms and dining room are very clean.  There is a peaceful vibe to this joint.  Even though it is popular, there seems to be plenty of good seating when I go (even at lunchtime).  I highly recommend this joint.  Eat well.  Be well.
