This was one of my fave Yelp events so far!

I enjoyed getting to know a few more lady Yelpers while sampling some of Mood Swings great services.

Much thanks to Cecilia for my mani and advice about what base coat to use for a DIY mani!

An even bigger thanks to Lindsey and Brandon for putting this together. So much fun!
