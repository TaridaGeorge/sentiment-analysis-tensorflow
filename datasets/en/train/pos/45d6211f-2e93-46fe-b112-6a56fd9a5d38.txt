Mexican cuisine at it's best!!! The mole tamal is out of this world, and the Nacho Libre is huge, definitely something you can share. We drive 35 miles just to go to this place and I started getting into the habit of ordering a tamal to go (for the next morning, you know!) They now have happy hour from 5-7 wed-sun, I recommend you to give it a try during that time, that way you can try many things for a very good price.
