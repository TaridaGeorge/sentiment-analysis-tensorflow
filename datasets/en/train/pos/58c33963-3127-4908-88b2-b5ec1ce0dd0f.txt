These aren't the snowcones we grew up with. Kids, adults and even the elderly can enjoy  Bahama Buck's shaved ice (teeth not required). They have any flavor you can think of. I was the weird kid that drank pickle juice from the jar, but if I could have gotten that from a snow cone!? Um.. yes please!!

Yes the shaved ice is a vehicle for artificial flavors.. isn't that what shaved ice is all about? That's like giving a burger place a bad review because the buns were vehicles for meat.

I also recommend getting the cream on top (traditional Hawaiian-style) and getting the vanilla ice cream-surprise in the bottom. Pick a flavor you like, and ask them what they recommend with it.. I wouldn't pick more than 2 or 3 flavors for one shaved ice, but go crazy if you like!
