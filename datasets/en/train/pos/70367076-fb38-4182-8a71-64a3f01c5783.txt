Mexico is a country.  A large varied country with many different cultures and styles of food.  Not unlike United States except your average Mexican has more in savings and less debt than the average US of A-er.

Going to Barrio to get a taco, chips, salsa, rice and beans is the equivalent of going to Des Moines, Iowa for seafood.

Order the tamarindo sauce or the red mole -- yes there is more than one kind of mole.  Order anything rubbed in Achiote. Have an amazing tequilla neat as your dessert as the uber knowledgeable staff can steer you in the right direction.

And the tacos for $1.50 at happy hour with a half price low rider will knock your socks off.

Truly is "effin' good food" as the t-shirts say.  Other idioms also apply.
