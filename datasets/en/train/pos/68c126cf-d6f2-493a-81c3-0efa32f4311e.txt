This place has it all, and they are super big. You can sure get lost in here. The staff is very friendly, very professional and very helpful.

I get ORGANIC VODKA here, and they offer 3 selections so far. Their prices are the cheapest to be found too. You would not think it by the looks of such a high-end place, but they are very competitive.

They are located outside the Mall - just outside of Macy's - North of Bell Rd on 75th Ave. AND! They are open until 10pm on the weekdays and 9pm on Sunday.
