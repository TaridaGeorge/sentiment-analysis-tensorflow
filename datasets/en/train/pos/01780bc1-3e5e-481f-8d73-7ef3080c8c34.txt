Jen p rocks! Every monday I love to come hang out and have lunch at mimis. I always have a hard time deciding what to eat cause everything is so tasty, so it all depends what im in the mood for. Like today I had the delicious veggie burger and last week I had the monterey omlet. All very good. And the pamosas are awesome. Oj pomagrante juice and champagne. So tasty!
