We wanted to try something new close to us. Went in expecting bar food , but was surprised to find great food, awesome service, and reasonable prices. Nice sports bar feel, separate dining room, and an area for the Friday night band and dancing.

Nice to find live music in Gilbert!!!!!   Great spot for the 30+ crowd,
