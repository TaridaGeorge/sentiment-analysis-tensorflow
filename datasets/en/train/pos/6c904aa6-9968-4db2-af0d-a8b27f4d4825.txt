27th Ave and Peoria.... This area really needed the In N Out boost!
This one is right around the corner from my house. On multiple times I've order my usual:

Double double animal style, extra lettuce, extra tomatoes, extra spread, chopped chilis, buns extra toasty, extra spread on the side
Fries EXTRA well done

Not once, not even on their most busiest of days, have they tripped up my order. I'm no fool. I would *NEVER* take such an order to go. The spongy bun is meant to be eaten immediately, while the burger is hot and the condiments cold. 

Always reliably fresh. Always reliably friendly service. Always reliably clean. 

LOTS of love for In N Out, especially for bringing a bit of So Cal to my neighborhood.
