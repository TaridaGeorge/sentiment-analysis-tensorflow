I'm totally in a wonderful state of shock.  Not even a week after writing my review, the owner of the restaurant sent me a private message apologizing for the experience I had and offered to comp my next meal.  What a wonderful, attentive business owner.  The fact that I only have 4 reviews and am a relatively new Yelper didn't matter a bit.  Mad props to Flavors, I am completely impressed.
