Great food, drinks, wait staff and atmosphere! 

This restaurant is adorable and the wait staff are professional and attentive.

For appetizers try the grilled cheese or the sausage and grits. The chicken and dumplings are an absolute must, but the cast iron chicken and spare ribs are great too. Full flavor and cooked perfectly. Save room for dessert too; they are all wonderful.
