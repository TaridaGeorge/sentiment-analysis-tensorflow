I just picked up Charlie from Hug N Pups and his haircut is absolutely the best  he has ever had out here in Phoenix. I found a great groomer in Dallas and was never able to find someone comparable out here. I've tried so many groomers in Phoenix and nothing close to Hug N Pups.

The staff is very welcoming, loving, and detailed. This is top service for a reasonable price! Don't waste your money at Petsmart- come here!
