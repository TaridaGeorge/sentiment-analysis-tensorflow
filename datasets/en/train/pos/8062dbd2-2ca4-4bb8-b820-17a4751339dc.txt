We met my uncle and aunt here after meeting at the Hotel Indigo across the lot. We sat at one of their comfortable, roomy booths and had some cold ones. I had a couple Cores Lites and was satisfied. I cannot comment on the food as I didn't have any as I was full from lunch at the Silver Spur (see my review;) but, it smelled wonderful. They have half off appetizers and beers during happy hour.  The small padio outside is perfect for a warm Scottsdale day.  Our server, Michael, was very friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed the classic rock and soft rock they had playing. This restaurant/lounge has a cult following and it is easy to see why. So, for good drinks at reasonable prices with friendly service in a casual atmosphere, The Lodge cannot be beat. Keep up the good work guys.!
