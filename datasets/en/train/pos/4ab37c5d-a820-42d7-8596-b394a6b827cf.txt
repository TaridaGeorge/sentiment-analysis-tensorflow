Great sliders, friendly service, and best of all, awesome stuff to look at.

The wings are the best that I have ever had, lots of sauce, but they aren't drowning. The sliders are great, even reheated as leftovers.. but trust me, you wont want to stop eating them!

The service is very friendly, and the walls are plastered with Chicago memorabilia new and old. 

Its small, a hole in the wall, but its a great place for good food
