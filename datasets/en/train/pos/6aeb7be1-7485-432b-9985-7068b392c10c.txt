Modernized pizza and dining out spot...I am a fan of this place. The bar is crowded for the most part, but it's a good sign. I crave their wonderful selections of the pizzas...Most of the pizzas here have a fresh and clean tast - which is really good with their wines and cocktails selections. You can get in with a reasonable waiting time. I choose this over Pizzeria Bianco since it doesn't have the ridiculous waiting time - it's simple yet offering a great ambiant for dining experience. If you really like heart-warming and traditional pizzas, try Spinato's. Yummiest of all pizzas, by far.
