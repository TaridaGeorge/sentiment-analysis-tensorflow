I have been to this new location a few times now and I am really impressed.  Maybe it is the newness of the store.  Maybe it is the helpful employees who are all cheery and positive.  Maybe it is the great selection of produce.  Whatever it is, I like it and I will be shopping here.

I went to another Sprouts not too long ago and I really did not expect to step foot in another one.  When I saw the great Grand Opening specials at this one, I had to give it a shot.  I am glad I did.

This store is in the perfect location because it is right across the street from my favorite Target.  With the two stores so nearby Fresh & Easy, I can get most everything I need in one trip.  

You should check it out!
