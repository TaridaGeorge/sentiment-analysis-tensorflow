This is my favorite Chinese Joint in Az.  The owner Margeritta is very polite.  They have a Huge menu.  and the best part is everything is REAL!  Nice atmosphere for a nice family dinner, quick lunch, or a date.  This is the best joint and beats out all of the other places at the Chinese Cultural Center by far.  If you haven't gone here do it.
