My family and I have been shopping here since 1993. We are usually there from two to five hours a couple times a year.  I would not suggest going shopping when they have a sale because of the crowds and the huge line. It is usually not as crowded during lunchtime and in the evenings. No doubt it is disgusting, BUT they have great prices that cannot be beat at Nordstrom! I bought a $300 Trina Turk purse for $70! Pretty sweet, don't you think?
