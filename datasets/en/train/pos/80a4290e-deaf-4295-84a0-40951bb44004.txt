Such an amazing atmosphere as soon as you walk in. I was greeted by smiling happy faces which were genuine! I ordered the tacos vivos, recommendation from the lovely knowledgeable girl working there, I also got an abundance drink which was made to perfection!!! I have no complaints about this place! I will def be referring friends to this unique and healthy place!!!!!!!! The food was amazing, the staff was sweet and KNOWLEDGEABLE they could answer any questions and helped me even if I was being a little indecisive, and the atmosphere just added the cherry on top, the energy and vibe in there was just great! i cant say enough good things about this place!!!!! If you have any questions the pretty redhead girl knows what she's talking about!!!!!!!!
