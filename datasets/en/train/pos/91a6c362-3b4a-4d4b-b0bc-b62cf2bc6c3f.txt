Just about the biggest menu with the most variety of anyplace I've gone. Nice ambiance, very consistent dishes, generally friendly waitstaff. Amazing deserts. I really wish that they'd take reservations though, they're always busy. Still bitter that they did away with the Shrimp Poor Boy sandwich, that was my regular dish, and they ditched it. It was cheap and delicious and huge.
