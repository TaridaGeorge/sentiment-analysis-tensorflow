I don't understand the negative reviews.  I go here every time I visit family in Scottsdale!  Literally, every visit I spend one night at Brennan's.  

The food is delicious plus they have TVs everywhere.  Sometimes, it's packed and sometimes it's empty.  I'm picky on Mexican food and find theirs to be good.  Plus the chips are good too.  Wait staff is always really nice.  I've taken others during visits and they like this Mexican food-serving sports bar too.  We order a pitcher of beer and then usually a tostada or tacos.  I wish there were more sports bars like this -- good Mexican food and lots of sports on TV.
