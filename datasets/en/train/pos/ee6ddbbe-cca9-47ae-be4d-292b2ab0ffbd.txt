Dr. Weil should come to L.A. with his restaurant sooner than later!  I had the ahi sliders which were super delicious and cooked to perfection.  The hummus and flax seed pita was amazingly fresh and light and something I'm craving right now.  Have the Medicine man elixir and feel immediately energized and enlivened.  A kale salad side is the perfect add on to the main dishes and lets me get in my daily vege requirements in one full swoop.  This is the best thing to happen to healthy dining I've seen in a while.
