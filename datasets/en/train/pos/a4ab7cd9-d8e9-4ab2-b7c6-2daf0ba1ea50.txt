This is a self-serve yogurt place.  They have a very large selection of yogurt and a large selection of toppings as well.  The fruit is all fresh and does not appear to be caned, jarred, or frozen.  The staff is friendly and they have a giant wall made for drawing on with lots of dry erase markers.  They also have a computer to take pictures of you and your favorite yogurt concoction, which they proudly display on a monitor i the store.  There is seating both inside and outside.  Outside is located right by the fountain at the strip-mall.  This is one of our favorites and go often even though it is father from us then several others.
