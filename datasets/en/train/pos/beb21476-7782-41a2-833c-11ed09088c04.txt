A first impression of this modest, stand-alone, building just east of 16th street is likely to be misleading.  Dyna-Tronics is the "go to" place when your prized amplifier or flat screen t.v. head south.
I found Dyna-Tronics when my four-months-out-of-warranty Sharp Aquos flat screen lost its sound.  Turns out that the Aquos, the top end of Sharp's LCD flat screens, is prone to this problem.  At the suggestion of Dyna-Tronics I called Sharp to see if they'd honor the repair, but, no, they were entirely unhelpful.  Fortunately for me, that wasn't the case with Dyna-Tronics, who fixed my t.v. for a relatively modest amount and in time for the super bowl to boot.  
The staff here are informed and helpful and there is a decent selection of old electrons for the true audiophile.
