I live in Gilbert, AZ so this is a fairly close place to help beat the heat (a little). The lake is very pretty. You can swim, jet ski, water ski, just cruise in your boat, and fish. It does get pretty crowded on the weekends, but it still is fun.
If you prefer land, they have nice picnic areas with grills and a swimming beach.
Wear a good pair of water shoes, there is alot of glass and fishing hooks on the ground and some in water. Have fun!!!!
