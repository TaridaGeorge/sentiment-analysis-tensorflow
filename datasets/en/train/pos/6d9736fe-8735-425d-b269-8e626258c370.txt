You will not find a better Italian restaurant in Phoenix than Avanti. Ignore the hype, this place is serious class. The owner meets you at the door and the food is the best Italian around.  I'm Sicilian so I know good Italian food and this is the best Italian restaurant I have found in Az. It is not inexpensive, but you will not be disappointed.
