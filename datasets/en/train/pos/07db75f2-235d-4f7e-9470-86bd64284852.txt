My boyfriend and I were looking to rent bikes for a day and The Bicycle Ranch on FLW directed us to Arizona Outback Adventures. Their main business is hiking/biking tours, but I still wanted to review them because they were so friendly and helpful with our little rental! They got us set up with bikes and helmets quickly (each bike was $25 for a few hours). They gave us a map and suggested specific trails that we take and said they would come pick out to help us if we got a flat. 

Great group of people and excellent customer service. I'd imagine they're great with their tours/activities!
