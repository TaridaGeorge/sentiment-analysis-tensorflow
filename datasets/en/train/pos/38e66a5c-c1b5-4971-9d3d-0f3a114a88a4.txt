Happy Hour until 7pm- this is fantastic, many places end HH at 6pm so this was a nice bonus.  1/2 price appetizers as well.  We had the deviled eggs, lamb chops and chicken wings.  It was a lot of food with a lot of great flavors!  The lamb chops were delicious, cooked perfectly and had the perfect amount of seasoning.  

The crowd for a Tuesday was mellow, there was live music.  

A great spot for a meal or just drinks.  The Garage may be one of my new favorite picks!
