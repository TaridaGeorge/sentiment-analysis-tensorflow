I found this place on Yelp & I'm glad I did.
We are always looking for somewhere new to get a good hamburger. All 5 in my family really liked this place, the food & the service.
It's cute that the staff wear ties to make our burgers. We had 3 cheeseburgers, 2 hot dogs, chili fries, french fries & a grilled chx sandwich.
Portions were pretty big. The fries are super crispy. I appreciate that they sell small (1/6) of a pie slice & large (1/4) of a pie slice. We'll be back
