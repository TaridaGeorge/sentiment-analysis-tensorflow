As soon as the hostess saw us coming , she kindly opened the door for me & my wife! That was a great touch. 
Also, our server was very nice and friendly. Overall all the service we recieved was top class and really had a family feel to it. You can tell the staff is kept happy and thats important and good to see.

The food was great! Good sized salads and the tenderloin sliders appetizer is seriously the best thing ever! I love going to a bar and grabbing some filet sliders w/ garlic aioli and au jus sauce with a beer!

Everything was good. Water kept full. Clean bathrooms. 

Overall very happy we decided to eat there and will be back whenever we are in the state of AZ again.
