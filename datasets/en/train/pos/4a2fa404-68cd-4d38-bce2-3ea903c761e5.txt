Burger joints are pretty trendy right now, and out of all the trendy burger joints I've tried, Smashburger has to be my favorite. The burgers are good, not too thick, not too greasy, and really flavorful. I especially like the fried onions they put on them. But it isn't the burgers that actually make me love this place- it's the fries! The smash fries are covered in rosemary, garlic and olive oil and they are delicious. No kidding- you can't come here without trying those fries.
