I go here at least 3 times a week. For a single person, the pre-made meals are fantastic. The pasta is always great, and I always get the salmon filet with brown rice and vegi - for $6 you just can't beat it.  Throw in microwave for a few minutes for a quick healthy meal. I regularly buy produce there. The fresh and easy Greek yogurt is the best. The fresh grapefruit juice is always a fav. They have a great selection of nuts, trail mixes for a great price. Their meats are always great- the chicken breast is always perfectly cut. Go to their website and sign up for weekly coupons- they email me coupons that make shopping there very affordable.  $5 off when you buy $25 of groceries - a great value!
