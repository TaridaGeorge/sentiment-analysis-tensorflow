I will only go here for Giants games! None the less its a one of a kind stadium I hear there is a pool I will hunt for it next time. The light rail drops you in front, yay!  Plus there is parking all around downtown phx at an affordable $5 or $10, way cheaper than the a normal busy city like sf!  The dome closes when its hot, AMERICAS only in door field, yay!! U-S-A! pretty cool, i have yet to experience a closed dome game.
