Shopping at this store today was  an amazing experience. The staff was friendly and funny, and EXTREMELY helpful. They had everything I was looking for and knew a lot about their business. They have nice quality things, and they have extremely reasonable prices. They went above and beyond what I would expect from a beauty store employee. It's also a great place for hair dye in funky colors. They had EVERYTHING! SO GOOD!
