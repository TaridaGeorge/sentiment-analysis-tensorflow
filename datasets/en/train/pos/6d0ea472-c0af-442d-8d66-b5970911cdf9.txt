I was driving by this place and decided to stop in for lunch. Boy, am I glad a did! The owner is from France and is very friendly. Everything that I have tried on the menu is excellent. The Ham and Brie sandwich is one of my favorites as well as the freshly made desserts. 

I have been back many times since stumbling upon this place and they are always consistent in delivering great customer service and stellar food!
