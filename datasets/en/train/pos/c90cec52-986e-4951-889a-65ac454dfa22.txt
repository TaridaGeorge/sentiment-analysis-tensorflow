I have been here several times and it is wonderful. To be honest I have never gotten past the lasagna - tons of cheese, good sauce and piled thick. This would be like my Mom would cook, if my Mom could cook. A nice place to hang out with a glass of wine and an good Italian. This restaurant has other locations - all in Illinois. Definitely give it a visit!
