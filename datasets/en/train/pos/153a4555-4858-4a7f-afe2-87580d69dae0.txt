For my last anniversary, I couldn't decide what to get my wife.  We had already done a ton of cool stuff and exchanged great gifts in the years before.  That's when I thought I should contact Debbie, a local artist who I trust to recommend something great from her jewelry collection.  Sure enough, she produced a great necklace/earrings set almost immediately, and Catherine (my wife) was totally impressed.  Thanks, Debbie, for your wonderful creation.  Catherine still wears the set frequently; order #2 is on the way soon.
