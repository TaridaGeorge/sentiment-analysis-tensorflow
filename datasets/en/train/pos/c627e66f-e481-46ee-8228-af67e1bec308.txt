A great restaurant and bar with a trendy assortment of foods and drinks ranging from the rosemary roasted nuts to the bacon fat infused pop corn.  The service at this place is first rate.  The employees know their dishes and their drinks.  The location is smack dab in the heart of Old Scottsdale.

A fine selection of beers, hard liquor, energy drinks, etc.  

A great choice!
