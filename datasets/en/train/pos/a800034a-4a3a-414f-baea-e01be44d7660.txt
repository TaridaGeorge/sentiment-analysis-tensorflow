I am skeptical of chains for mechanics/car repairs.  While I would not recommend all Midas, this location is simply AMAZING.  The guys here know what they are doing and will explain it to you, they are honest and fair with their prices, and they truly understand customer service.  I will make them my official place to take my car if it needs any work.  

Simply amazing to find people who know what they are doing, do it honestly, and value their customers.
