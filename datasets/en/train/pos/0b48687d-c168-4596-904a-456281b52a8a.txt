I have been to this Sprouts more than any other. It is very clean and smells clean. The staff is very willing to help you find anything. They have samples of coffee for everyone to try and when i was there yesterday they had samples of cake and bread.  They have a great selection of local vegetables,(very important)! All sorts of natural products that are sometimes hard to find.  Even Buffalo meat which is wonderful and low in fat.  You get .5cents off your bill for every bag you bring in as well. The only thing that is a bit of an issue is some items are very high priced and the other thing is you have to watch that when something is on sale you get it for the sale price. other than that fantastic!
