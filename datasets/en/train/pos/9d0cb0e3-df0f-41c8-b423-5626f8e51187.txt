My first choice in the entire city of Phoenix!  This place always provides a stellar experience for all of my senses.  The view is spectacular, and I (a weather buff) recommend going during monsoon season to enjoy the fantastic electrical storms flashing off in the distance.  The food is excellent (I also recommend the filet).  The service is second to none in the Phoenix area.  It is expensive, but this is the type of place that is meant to be savored only once in a while.  They recently instituted a ($14-ish? can't recall exactly) minimum per person, as many people like to simply enjoy a drink and the view after a downtown event.  The minimum is easy to meet with a drink and dessert - and worth every penny.
