This is my Go-To Spot for lunch. The food is always great, service even better and the prices just perfect.  

I usually get the mediterranean  (sp?) tuna pita . it's a great soft pita filled with tuna, onions, capers and tomatoes. The tuna's mixed in with this oil and vinegar mixture, totally awesome! I sometimes will get the Greuben, which is a grlled reuben made with turkey and their home made slaw with feta!  My all time fave meal there is the Power Protein Plate, which is grilled chicken served with caramelized onions and a huge heap of the slaw!

They also have great sides like killer potato salad, pasta salad and the aforementioned slaw. If you're looking for a great pretty healthy spot to get lunch, check it out!
