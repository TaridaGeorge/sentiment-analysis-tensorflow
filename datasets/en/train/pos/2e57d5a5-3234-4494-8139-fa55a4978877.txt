I brought my 2, male, three year old pugs in to get neutered. The staff was so very friendly with the people there and the animals. Check in took maybe half an hour and I was 5th in line. Pick up was super easy and quick. I would highly recommend this wonderful low cost spay neuter clinic to anyone! 
Keep up the great work. 
The ONLY inconvenience I had was the entrance was around the back of the building and I park in the front at first.
