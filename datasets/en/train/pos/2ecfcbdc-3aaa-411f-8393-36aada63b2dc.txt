Best Mexican I have found in phoenix. 

I have been here many times and have yet to try something that I haven't loved yet.

This place is a bit of a hole in the wall but to me that is what makes it even better.

Great cheap margaritas and excellent chips, salsa, beans and rice.

Every time I have been the service has been fast and really good.
