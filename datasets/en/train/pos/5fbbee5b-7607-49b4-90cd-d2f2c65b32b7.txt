Times have changed. Unfortunately, I am no longer a Sun Devil. I am not in between classes and certainly don't look the age of a college student. Therefore, I feel like I stick out like a sore thumb at this particular location. Do I care? Nope. In-N-Out is good no matter what college campus it is on :) As with most of their locations, GREAT customer service and a fantastic product. Nothing like a grilled cheese (animal style) to make you feel a bit better about life.
