This place does it.  This place is absolutely wonderful.  Local fresh ingredients, great atmosphere, excellent service, delicious dishes, great cheese, beer, and wine list.

If you want a really romantic dinner, and want it to last.  Go here.  Your meal will probably last 2-3 hours.  I went here with my fiance for her birthday and we loved it.  We sat outside and enjoyed a 3 course meal with drinks.  It is sort of pricey, but completely worth it.

Highly recommended.
