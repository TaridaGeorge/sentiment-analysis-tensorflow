I recently stumbled across Durant's while I was downtown. This is quite a gem. I felt like I could have seen the characters of Goodfella's walk through the door at any minute.

The decor is classy, old and dark. Very vintage-classic steakhouse. Its refreshing to go to a restaurant and totally feel like your in another time. All the staff was nice, knowledgeable and attentive. The food is to die for. 

Seeing as I only went there for lunch, I had a sandwich and sweet potato fries (which were the best I have ever had). Hopefully one day I can go back and try what they're famous for, steak! 

I would 100% recommend this place for anything from an intimate date to a place to impress your boss.
