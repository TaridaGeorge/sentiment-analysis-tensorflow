I gave 2 stars to the Lincoln/Scotts Rd store, it stressed me out so much.  This NoSco store is such a great experience, though.  Easy parking.  Well organized store.  Racks have a good balance of selection and ability to easily look through them.  Even though it doesn't have as large an inventory as the Lincoln store (or maybe because of it?), I've actually been able to find several great pieces.  Thanks for leaving the insanity at the other store, MSC!
