This place is fantastic! It is a bit of a hidden gem, not easily seen from the road. We got the chicken tikka masala (wonderful) and the curried chicken which I have dubbed the best I've ever had! We also got the naan basket which is several different flavors of naan. We will definitely be going back. Food was amazing, service was fantastic!!
