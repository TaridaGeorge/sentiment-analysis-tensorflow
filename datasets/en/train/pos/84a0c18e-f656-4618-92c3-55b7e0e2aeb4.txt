Decided to give Indulge Burgers another try and am sure glad I did.   Everything was phenomenal!   There were two of us in the party and we each ordered a "create your own" burger."    On the create your own menu you get a choice of protein, cheeses, toppings, sauces and buns.   The choice of proteins include beef, turkey, veggie, grilled chicken, salmon.   The cheese choices include a choice of ten high quality cheeses.  Sauces and toppings are all very fresh and tasty.   The burgers had a great flavor.  We also ordered frys and they were hot and flavorful.   To drink I treated myself to a margarita and it was one of the best I've ever had.   Will definitely be coming back here again and again.   They also have a gluten free menu.   Head to Indulge Burgers and More right away.    You'll be glad you did.
