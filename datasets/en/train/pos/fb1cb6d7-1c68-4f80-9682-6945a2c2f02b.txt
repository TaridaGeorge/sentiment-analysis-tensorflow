A friend of mine recommended Freddy's because of the steak burgers which he said were lean and delicious. He was right. The texture of the meat is extremely different than anywhere else. I'm not sure how to describe it, but it is flaky and crispy, in a good way.

I also tried the Hawaiian frozen custard for dessert. It was the smoothest frozen treat I have ever eaten. I will definitely be back for more.
