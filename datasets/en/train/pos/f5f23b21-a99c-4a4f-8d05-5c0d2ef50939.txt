I bought a new Accent through their internet sales (after requesting quotes from area dealers via services like pricequotes and invoicedealers). It was very straightforward. Michael White was very pleasant and straightforward about pricing. Leroy Welsel did the final paperwork, financing, etc. He's a great guy. No hard sell for gimmick addons.  Just a down-to-earth guy you can have a conversation with. I highly recommend them. 

I can't evaluate the service department yet. And, I didn't walk in off the street to buy a car, so I can't evaluate the normal sales process. But, if you do the "request for quotes" and get a rock-bottom price from area dealers, you should find Tempe Hundai has the lowest bid and easiest transaction. (A couple other dealers tried to pull a bait-and-switch with me.).
