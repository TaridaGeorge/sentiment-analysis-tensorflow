What a great find!  A fantastic local hangout for a business lunch or to have an intimate dinner.  The atmosphere is perfect for escaping from the day to day routine.  It is truly a hideaway.  

The, the food.  I love the carne asada with the spicy rice and beans with tortillas.  This is my favorite dish.  The meat is cooked perfectly each time with generous portions.  So far, everything I've tried has been very good and very welcome in the desert!
