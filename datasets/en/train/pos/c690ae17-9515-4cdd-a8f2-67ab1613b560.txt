If know about the Welcome Diner, chances are you've heard about it by word of mouth or just stumbled across it by chance. Regardless, this place is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. Everything in the place feel like you stepped into David Lynch's mind while having happy thoughts. The place is super small (8 seats) but that just adds to the authenticity of eating in what might one day be a museum piece of 1950's culture.

The food is incredibly good and surprisingly cheap. If it's the right day, be sure to see if they're making veggie burgers and ask for a float too. The staff is also really chill and make sure that you're satisfied. They offer everything: good food, good atmosphere, and a good experience.

I just wish they had later hours....
