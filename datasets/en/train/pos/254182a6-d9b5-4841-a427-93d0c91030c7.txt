A true gem...I too was a regular hoodlum in the MU basement between classes during my undergrad....I'm glad to see that Hoodlums has only changed locations, but not it's quality or atmosphere.

I too was super-bummed after the MU fire forced Hoodlums to relocate, but this place still rocks.

I stopped by yesterday to sell a few dvds, and pick up some new music.  Hoodlums is still the ultimate place to do that in Tempe.

The store is a great place to find unique music and still get vinyl.

I highly recommend Hoodlums for anyone who loved it when it was on campus or for anyone looking for hard to find music....or just a great place to browse and find out about new artists.
