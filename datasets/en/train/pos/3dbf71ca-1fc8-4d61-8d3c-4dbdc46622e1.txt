+Decently, large theater in Gilbert (it's not too small but it's not humongous but large enough!)

+I like there's little shops near by - ie cupcake!

+The seating is slanted so as long as you sit anywhere on the top, it's good to go - no one's head would block your way :) 

Note: I came here for the opening weekend of Batman and it was NOT crowded. Not sure if it's because of the incident or because it's Gilbert. But My impression is that the theater doesn't usually get too crowded, LOVE IT! 

Also, I like the prices. :) They are very reasonable ticket prices [maybe because in CA I pay a lot more :(]
