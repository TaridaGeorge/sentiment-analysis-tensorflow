In the years I've been enjoying the valley bar scene I've almost always avoided Mill avenue.  The exception to that rule is and always will be The Big Bang!  I love this place.  I hadn't been in a while but went back last weekend and remembered why I love this place so much.  Everyone you deal with that works there is super fun and nice.  The atmosphere is amazing, it forces you to not take yourself to seriously, just enjoy the night!  Drinks are tasty and reasonably priced in my opinion.  The entertainers are hands down amazing!  I had such a great time!
