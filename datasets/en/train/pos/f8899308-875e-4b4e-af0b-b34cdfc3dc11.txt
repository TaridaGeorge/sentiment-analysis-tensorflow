Sprouts has purchased the Sunflower Market chain and has heavily invested in upgrading this store. New cash registers, new flooring and displays, new Sprouts products and new Sprouts shirts for the employees. Awesome retooling of an already great store. Unlike the Sprouts on Ray Rd, this store actually has sufficient floor space to accommodate a large number of customers at the same time.
There is no other chain store in the Valley that can touch the quality of the meat, poultry, and fish here (no antibiotics, no hormones, mostly grass-fed).
The fruits and veggies are amazing and fresh. The prices are reasonable. Parking is easy. Wednesday is double ad day, where you get two weeks worth of sales items on the same day.
This store is the best of Sunflower Market bred to the best of Sprouts. Give it a try!
