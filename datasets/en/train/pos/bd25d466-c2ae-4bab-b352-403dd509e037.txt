My husband and I were first time homebuyers AND buying from out of state. We had a very limited timeline in which to buy our house, but within a 5 day period in which we were in town, Blair helped us find our house AND have it inspected before we flew back home.  We LOVE our new house, and Blair and his team are largely to thank for making the process go so smoothly.
Blair is dependable, quick to respond to calls/emails, and does a fabulous job of working with and coordinating the other players in the home transaction (bank, title company, seller, etc.)  I coudn't be more pleased with my home buying experience and will absolutely use the Blair Group again!
