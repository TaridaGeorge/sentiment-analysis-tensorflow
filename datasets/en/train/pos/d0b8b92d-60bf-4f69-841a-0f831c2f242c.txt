STRAWBERRY PECAN    
Fresh grilled chicken over mixed greens with fresh strawberries, candied pecans, goat cheese and a maple apple vinaigrette.

Best Salad I have had in a long time, just the right balance of healthy and tasty.
I was here for lunch on a Monday, service was good and prompt.
I will definitely return, probably for Happy Hour. They have a lot of interesting beers on tap.
