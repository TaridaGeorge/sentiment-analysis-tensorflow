I just came to this location to get my measurements again because I didn't trust the first place that I got them from. The lady that helped me was so incredibly nice, she answered any questions that I had and reassured my confidence about buying a dress online! If I do end up needing any alterations this is definitely where I plan to go.
BTW the measurements were only $5! Absolutely Amazing!
