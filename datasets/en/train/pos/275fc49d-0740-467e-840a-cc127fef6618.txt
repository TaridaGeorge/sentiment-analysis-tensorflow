FINALLY!! Green has been talking about a downtown location forever and it is here and WORTH THE WAIT!  Best Vegan food you'll find anywhere, and you don't have to be Vegan to enjoy it! I'm a hardcore meateater, but I'll take Green's buffalo wings and Mexicali Burger over the real thing any day!! The "No-harm chicken parm" is the bomb.com too! 

The parking is an issue, only because of the small lot Green was built on, but again... it's worth fighting for a spot! The interior is very comfortable, and perfect for a sunny warm afternoon when they can open the large garage door at the front of the building for some fresh air!

Go Vegan!! Even if its just for one meal, and give Green a try!!
