Tied with the Camelback Inn for my favorite resort/ hotel in greater Phoenix. I spent many a hot summer day here as I swam for the Biltmore's team until I was eight or nine, and since have returned periodically for events or other random occasions.

Since then, many things have happened at the Biltmore. It has continued to refine and improve upon its "desert oasis" accommodations by turning the pool area into a full-fledged water park for adults, equipped with bars and lounge chairs by the dozen. 

The rooms are comfortable and elegant but manage not to overwhelm. It captures that which I try to convey to non-Phoenicians as all that is great about growing up in a desert, even in the summer months when it is most difficult to do so.
