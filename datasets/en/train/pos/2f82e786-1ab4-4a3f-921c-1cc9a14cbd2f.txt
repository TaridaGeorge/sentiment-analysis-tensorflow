Definitely the best fast food burger out there right now. I've been hearing about Five Guys for well over a year but I didn't think I would like it when I heard the burgers are all cooked well done -- I usually eat mine medium rare otherwise they taste dried out to me.  But this was a huge, juicy burger patty - very tasty, and an awesome combo of topping choices. My new favorite take out burger spot - sorry In N Out!
