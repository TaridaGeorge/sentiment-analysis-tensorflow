This place is incredible.  If you want to experience authentic French food, this is the place.  We got the traditional flammenkuchen to start.  My wife got the Bressine crepe and I got the table side French Raclette.  The food was incredibly similar to the food I had in Europe.  I will be coming back for sure.

Previous reviews have mentioned that they felt the food was too expensive and that it wasn't filling.  Most of the cheese and meat you are served here can't  normally be found at a typical grocery store, which explains the expense.  French food doesn't use the grease and heavy creams that weigh you down and make you bloated.  If you are looking for that type of full feeling, go to a Chili's or TGIFridays.  This place serves light refreshing food that doesnt give you the "I need to go take a nap" feeling.
