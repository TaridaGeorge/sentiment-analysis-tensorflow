Hot dogs for breakfast??? Oh yes, my friends...
You must try the Breakfast Special during the Downtown Phoenix Farmers Market on Saturday! 
Scrambled eggs with chopped up hot dogs, mushrooms, a little salsa, and a few other yummy ingredients- all nestled in a pita. Lots of flavor with a little kick that made my taste buds sing! And a portion size enough for two meals- or one if you're hungry. Good price, too. If they're busy, order one and shop around- it doesn't take too long anyway, but also gives you a chance to explore the rest of the Market.
It's not on the menu, so ask for it!
(Also loved the little lollipop surprise in with the to-go box!)
