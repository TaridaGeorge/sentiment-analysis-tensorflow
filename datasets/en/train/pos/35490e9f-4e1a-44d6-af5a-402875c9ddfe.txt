What can you say after 186 reviews? I'm just writing No. 187 to let you know that it is still excellent . . . 

5th and Wine must be doing something right!  We sat on the patio at sunset on a warm February evening - food and wine were outstanding. Company was great. Service was attentive, but not overpowering. 

A place definitely worth visiting, if you are in the Old Town Scottsdale area and hungry.
