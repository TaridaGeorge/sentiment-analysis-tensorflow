Wow! What an amazing place. The food was absolutely to die for. I had the escargot, and my friend had a brie and truffle oil soup that was absolutely wonderful. Even their Caesar salad was the best I ever had.

The service was great. I ordered a lemon drop. The waitress realized the glass was too small and sent it back to the bartender to put (and add more) in a larger glass. I didn't even have to ask.

This place is far above what Bomberos was, and I liked Bomberos. I highly recommend this place to anyone and plan on becoming a regular customer here.
