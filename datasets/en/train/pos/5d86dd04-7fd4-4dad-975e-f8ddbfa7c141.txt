This place was great. $8 for a haircut and the girl did an awesome, awesome job. It is a nice, professional atmosphere and the teachers were really nice and helpful too. 

I will definitely come back here to get my hair cut again.

Leslie cut my hair if you want a specific person to ask for, but of course students come and go so I don't know how much longer she will be there. (I think March.)
