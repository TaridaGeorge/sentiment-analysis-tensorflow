This is a comfortable, fun, new modern spot to hang out in Tempe.  The food is delicious!  Fresh and affordable.  They have breakfast items and all sorts of tasty sandwiches.  I have a new favorite every time I go in, but last night I had the Chipotle Chicken Salad Sandwich on a warm pita and it was sooooo good!  If you don't like coffee, they have yummy Italian sodas.  The owners are super nice and welcoming.  Don't park in the back in the Vue parking...
