I'm a fairly new patient at DDoA and everyone I've met has been very friendly and welcoming.  They always explain what is going on in my mouth and tell me what to expect which really helps reduce my anxiety about the going to the dentist.  I needed a couple of fillings and they used a special laser to get the cavity out so that I didn't even have to get a shot! I would definitely recommend seeing Dr. Maro & Dr. Prade, I've seen them both and they're very nice.
