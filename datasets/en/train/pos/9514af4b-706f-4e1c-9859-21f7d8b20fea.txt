Based off the of the Yelp reviews, I decided to give this place a try. I tried the ground beef fry bread taco, and the boy had the green chile fry bread taco. Mine was very good, his was AMAZING. When I go back I'm definitely getting what he had. 

I also tried the hominy stew based off of what everyone says here, and while I thought it was good, I don't think I'd order it again - it just wasn't my thing. 

To top off an evening of absolute indulgence, we also got a honey & powdered sugar fry bread. It was....mmm. Delicious. Gluttonous. Fantastic.

The staff were great, super friendly. The prices are low, and the portions are huge. Bring your appetite. :)
