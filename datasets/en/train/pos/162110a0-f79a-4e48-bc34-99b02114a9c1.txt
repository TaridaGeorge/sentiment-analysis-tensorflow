This facility has so much to offer!  There is really something for everyone in your family from children up to seniors.

The gym is awesome - they have cardio machines, weight machines, free weights and group classes.  Childcare is available and I'll be interested in checking that out when my little one is big enough.  Room/space rental is available for parties, meetings, etc.  Chandler residents get to enjoy slightly lower prices than non-residents, but I think all of the fees are very reasonable.

In the heat of the summer, the indoor track is a good place to go to get a real walk in! 10 laps = 1 mile. Tip to Parents: Strollers and children are allowed during family walk times.
