Hmmm...I'm surprised that this place has only garnered 3 stars overall so far.  This is by far my favorite Chinese buffet in Phoenix.  I have not had any of the experiences noted from the above reviews....room temp sushi and greasy food.  The sushi has always been excellent in my opinion but I'm no sushi expert by any means. But it has never been "room temp" in my experience.  As for the food they are definitely well above average in my opinion. They make the best sweet and sour soup that I've ever tasted to date!!   The decor is very upscale and pleasant looking.  So far I've always found it very clean in appearance and have been very satisfied with every visit I made to this place.
