We recently adopted our new dog from the humane society and were able to take her to this vet for a check up. We were very impressed by how sweet everyone was. The receptionist, vet techs, and veterinarian did all they could do help our dog relax more and have a good exam. We will definitely continue using them for our new doggie's care.
