I'm usually at this location on my way to work or the on on Rural in Tempe. I've never had a bad experience at either! Wonderful drinks and everyone here is so HAPPY. They are consistently the happiest baristas I've ever seen and their drinks are incredible. I usually either just get a plain coffee (which is always great) or an Annihilator if I feel like indulging....it's awesome. Once you go to Dutch Bros you'll never long for Starbucks again.
