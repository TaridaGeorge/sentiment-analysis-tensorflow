These guys ROCK!  When you enter this store and see the overwhelming beauty of all the jewels displayed before you, you immediately assume pretense, but there isn't any.  This is a group of guys who love great, quality stuff, and are eager to help.

They have GORGEOUS jewelry for women.  And they carry some very unusual lines, like NightRider...very manly...for men.  Actually, once you get to know them, you know that all of them are manly men.  So there is this incredible irony that I just love!

I attended a Girls Night Out event last night, and it was amazing!  I highly recommend the upcoming Fast Times, Fast Cars event for men!
