I went to #FirstService at @BigEarlsBBQ.

I love the decor! And the music was top notch redneck music!

Stephanie should bring water for everyone at the table

HUGE chunks in the bleu cheese!

Nachos was a good mixture of meat and cheese, and more than enough to be a meal.

Five cheese Mac'n had great flavor!

Pulled pork was tender and juicy. Baked beans great.

Potato salad had good flavor, but we were so stuffed we couldn't finish it.

I'm definitely headed back ASAP!
