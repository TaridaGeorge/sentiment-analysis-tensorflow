I brought the work crew out for dinner at the Roaring Fork. Every single person was amazed.

Personally, I have had a ton of great meals here, so I wasn't surprised. 

This trip was: Starter: New Pork Wing appetizer with the old Dr Pepper BBQ sauce. EXCELLENT! (Bring back this sauce!)

Entree: Beef short ribs swapping the sides to get their awesome grits and corn! Wow!


Incredible
