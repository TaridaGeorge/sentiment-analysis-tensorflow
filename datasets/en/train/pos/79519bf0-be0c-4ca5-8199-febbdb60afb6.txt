It's very difficult to find Victorian furniture on a budget. Ross in Ahwatukee makes that possible. I bought a bedside wicker tower for $20. HELLO? You can buy the same thing at Moore Furniture "for Less" for about $100. Even Target wouldn't sell something that nice for that cheap. One day, I saw a big inventory of Victorian tapestry chairs. They were $100. I found one that was being sold as "slightly scuffed", which meant some scratches on the leg. No big deal, but they discounted it to $50 because of that. Of course I took it. ~SCORE~
