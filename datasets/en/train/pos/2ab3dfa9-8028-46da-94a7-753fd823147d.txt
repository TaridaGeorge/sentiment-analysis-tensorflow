I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. If you enjoy girlie girl things, this is THE place. Yes, I know I'm not 6 anymore, so playing dress up isn't something I really get to do anymore. However, this place allows adult women to feel dainty and girlie with all the amazing little things in here. Lots of little pretty headbands, barrettes, jewlery, clothing......Feels artsy in here in a good way. Just a fun place to come into. Plus the prices are SOOOOOOOOO reasonable. In a place like this, you would expect boutique pricing, but when feminine feather headbands are $9.00 and dainty floral dresses are $30.00, how can you not be excited???
