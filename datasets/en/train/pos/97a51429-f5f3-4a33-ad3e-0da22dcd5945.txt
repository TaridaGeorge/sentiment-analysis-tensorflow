I was in Mesa last week for business.  I was stuck in a conference room all day teaching classes.  One of the ladies from my company ran out to grab food.  She brought back some Frye Bread and it was soooo good!

This was my first time having fry bread and I was hooked.  I tried the brown sugar which was ok, but the honey butter was amazing.  I think I ate most of it by myself.

Too bad the stuff is deep fried in lard.  I would have gone after work that day and tried one of the dinner dishes but yeah...unfortunately, I have to watch what I eat and lard didn't fit into the plan.

If you haven't had fry bread make sure you check it out!
