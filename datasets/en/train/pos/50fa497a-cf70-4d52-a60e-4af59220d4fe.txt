Came to this office thanks to Groupon! X-rays, cleaning, and whitening trays...all for $30. 
Not sure anyone ever really gets excited about going to the Dentist, but coming here is almost an enjoyable experience (aside from the drilling and other things that happen in the dental chair). 
ALL of the staff and Dr. Blyth are supremely nice! Thorough is the word that keeps coming to mind. X-rays were explained in depth...the man really seems to enjoy teeth and what he does. 
Will continue to come to this office and would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a Dentist!
