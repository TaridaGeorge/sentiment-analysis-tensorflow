Great Dentist! My dentist I usually go to told me I needed not 1, but 2 ROOT CANALS & 2 CROWNS- $4,200. I went in for a second opinion at Dr Rays and he told me ZERO Root Canals, 1 cavity filled and replaced the crown that had come off. Stand up office with morals & ethics plus he's an ASU Sun Devil. Thank you!
