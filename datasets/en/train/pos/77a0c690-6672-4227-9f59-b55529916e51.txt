This place is really good! I went there w/my bf who is an Asian guy from California. He introduced me to this place when I went to LA. When we went to this location he ordered like 4 different sandwiches. I tried the grilled chicken, the grilled pork and the pork deli cuts one. I liked the them all but prefer the pork ones. I love the slaw they use in the sandwich;  sweet taste of the shredded radish they use, the carrot and cucumber make it crispy. They add sprigs of cilantro and jalapeno  slices. The sandwich is sweet, spicy and savory all at once. I also got a an avocado boba drink, which was delicious, thick and creamy. You think an avocado smoothie would be weird but its not...its delightful.  This place is awesome.
