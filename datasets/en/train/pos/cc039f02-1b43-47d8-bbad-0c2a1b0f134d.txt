Yup, a great living social find. Kim's enthusiastic and welcoming. Plus, her barre class left me a good kind of sore. And the candlelight yoga was a perfect destresser for the mid-week crazies.

I know Kim's got plans to take over the place next door.. knocking down some walls and expanding! With the popularity she's found I wouldn't doubt it all coming to fruition sooner than expected. But even if this place grows in physical dimension, it's going to keep that initimate feel. At this studio you're greeted by name and with a warm smile. I'm sold.
