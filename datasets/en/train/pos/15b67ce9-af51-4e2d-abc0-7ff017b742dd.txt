I can indulge on these burgers any day. And the best part about it is that I don't have to feel guilty about it! They have tons of healthy options such as turkey and veggie burgers on a whole wheat bun. I would recommend to build your own burger. The options are endless! I really like the ordering system they use here. You will get a check sheet to fill out your order and mark what you want on your burger. This makes it easy to decide what you want and I'm sure easier on the servers and cooks! 

Reading other reviews I noticed that I missed out on the fried pickles. I will be trying those the next time I visit here for sure!
