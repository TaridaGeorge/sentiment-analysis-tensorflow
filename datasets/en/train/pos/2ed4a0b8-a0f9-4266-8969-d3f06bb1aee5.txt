Got me perfect flowers , perfectly delivered on time, and at a reasonable price. The staff was super nice and tolerant of my ignorance on flowers in general! 5 stars for the flowers, 5 for the arrangement, and 5 for the customer service. My entire transaction was over the phone, I never went in to the store in person and still everything was just as requested if not better. Highly highly recommended.
