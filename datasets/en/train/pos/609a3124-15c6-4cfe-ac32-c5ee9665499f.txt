I cant believe Sierra hasn't gotten more 5stars (Lauren, how dare you?) This place is great. Strong drinks, good wine, Kiltlifter on tap. No joke, I like every appetizer,but honey child, it dont stop there. Azteca soup? BOMB. Yummy burgers, carna asada, and so many of my friends favorite, buttermilk chicken with mashed sweet potatoes! I tired scallops for the first time at this place, and was not disappointed, i crave them all the time now.
Everyone who works here is friendly and very helpful. I always sit at the bar, (cause I'm that kind of people,) and I notice that there are always alot of regulars who keep coming back ,which is a good sign. I work down the street from the restaurant, and whenever a client ask where to go for lunch,dinner, or happy hour I only, and always, suggest Sierra Bonita.
