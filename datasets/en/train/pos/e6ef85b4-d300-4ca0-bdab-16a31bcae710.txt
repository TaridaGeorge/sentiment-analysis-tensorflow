Both times I've eaten here it's completely empty inside. I guess they make most of their money off of delivery service. 

I suppose the emptiness is due to their out of the way location, because the food, service, and atmosphere is great. 

The Chinese food is what you'd expect for the prices-- tasty, a bit americanized, but still very satisfying. The place is family owned, and our waitress is extremely friendly and talkative. I would go there just to have her as our server again. The atmosphere is much nicer than other Asian restaurants of similar price range-- cool decorations on the walls, nice booths/tables, and fancy gold Chinese characters painted everywhere. 

A great casual location for dinner with family or friends.
