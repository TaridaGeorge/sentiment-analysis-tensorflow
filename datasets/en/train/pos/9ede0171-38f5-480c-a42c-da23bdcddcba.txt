This is my favorite place to go for breakfast. The line is not that long, and is always worth it!! I walk in feeling like it's a friends restaurant even though I don't know anyone. I leave with a smile. Get the Daybreaker. I've never liked any breakfast item more. The food is so fresh! Great selection of beverages too, since it is a Grocery as well as cafe. You can eat cheap if you want, or you can go moderate.
