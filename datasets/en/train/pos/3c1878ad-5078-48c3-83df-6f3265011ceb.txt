Ok
So

These people make vegetarian dips, salsas, chips, and tamales.

AND THEY'RE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!

They sell them at AJ's in the refridgerated section.  They're pricey and have black lids.

My personal favorites are the
- pineapple mango salsa (so unique and refreshing, and sweet and hot all at the same time!)
- the spinach con queso.  OH MY GOD IT IS SO GOOD!!!

So yeah.
These people rocks my socks off.
