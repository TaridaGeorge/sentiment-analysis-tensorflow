We live in the Arcadia area and this is a great indoor play place. I have been with my own children and with friends with children ages 1 - 4 and  1/2 on several occasions and they have all LOVED it. 

Great train set, play houses, slides, ride-on train, and small bouncy to get the energy out. Lots of other great toys too!  

Very friendly owner. 

Also, a great place to go if you have multiple age children because you can see the entire play area from the numerous sitting areas (including a small caf√© that has wifi) and you can bring in outside coffee (yay!).  Definitely recommend for parents of little ones!
