Love Trader Joe's! I always come to this location (at least once a week), and I have never been disappointed by the selection and quality. Return policy is great if you ever get food that spoiled too quickly, etc.

Staff is always super friendly and has a genuine interest in helping others. When checking out the cashiers are personable and you can have a genuine conversation with them.

This is a little smaller of a location, but they still have the necessities. Very wholesome food, really good prices (usually cheaper and better quality than a grocery store), and they have a wonderful selection.

They usually have samples of stuff in the back, and for a dinner idea just browse around or even ask one of the associates for ideas! I very much recommend this location and recommend supporting Trader Joe's as a company.
