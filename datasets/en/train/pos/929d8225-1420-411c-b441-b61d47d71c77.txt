Try the Larb, it is on happy hour and it even comes in tofu as a veggie option. This one dish alone ($5) at happy hour would make me love this place but there were many more delights that made my visit so great.

I don't drink with dinner but here it was happy hour all day sat, and they had a unique drink the Curry Gimlet, IT comes in a martini glass has a orange hue, it is fruity but has a curry finish from cardamom I assume, truly unique.

Our dishes of Pad See ewe and Dragon noodles were great, and huge portions.   Rich flavors, well textured tofu and crisp veggies. 

When I made my reservation I let them know about the birthday of the person I was with. We were surprised with fried banana and ice cream along with a candle and signing it was great!
