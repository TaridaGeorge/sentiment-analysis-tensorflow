Husband and I were visiting the fam for Thanksgiving weekend and since nobody wanted to cook, we decided on AJ's for their fabulous Thanksgiving pre-cooked spread.  I must say....it was one of THE BEST Thanksgiving meals I have EVER had (sorry Mom and Dad!)
We ordered the meal for 6-8 people which included a Turkey, gravy, sweet potatoes, mashed potatoes, green beans almondine, rolls, stuffing, and cranberry relish for the amazing price of $130.  All we did was reheat the turkey in the oven for 2 1/2 hours and bam.....it was ready!  I have absolutely no complaints about this meal.   The turkey was extremely juicy and tasty...along with all the sides.  We were all satisfied!  
Oh yeah and I forgot they also included a Pumpkin Pie which was DEEEELISH!!! :)
The leftovers were even better then next day!
