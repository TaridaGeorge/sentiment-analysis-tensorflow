I love this place on every night except First Fridays.  It's waaaaay too crowded, so I usually stay away.  

Other than that, this place rocks.  Good , varied beer selection (all bottle though) and they usually have good musical guests.  Sadly, this is probably the best place for jazz in the valley.  Not as a knock for this place, but the lack of a dedicated jazz venue is troubling, but I digress.

Always open, The Lost Leaf is a great place to catch a drink and shoot-the-shit with people.
