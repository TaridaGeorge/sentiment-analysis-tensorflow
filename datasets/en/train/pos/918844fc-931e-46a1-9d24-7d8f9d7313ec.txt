THIS PLACE USED TO BE CALLED BUFFALO KIDS!!!

This is a wonderful gently used kids clothing store that only caries the best of the best used clothes! They are extremely selective! I brought in a bunch of stuff for trade, thinking that all my beautiful pieces were exactly what they wanted. They only chose two items that were worn twice! Quality and selection are always the best here. You pay about $2 premium over other resellers, but I like to think of it as a service charge for the work they do to filter out all the ugly used clothes. Some of my daughter's favorite pieces are from here. :)
