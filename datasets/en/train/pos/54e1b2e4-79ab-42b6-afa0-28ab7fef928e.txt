This is so convenient.  I used to place a call for take out every Sunday after church.  I usually had a hard time finding a parking place and then going to the bar to pick up my order.  Now, I can simply pull into the parking space up front that is reserved for take out and pick up my food.  This was a great idea, Lenny!  I also love the display of tempting cupcakes...too bad I am on a diet!
