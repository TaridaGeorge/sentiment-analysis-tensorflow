Perhaps the most beautiful church in Phoenix.  The Greeks have a reputation of being a loud, friendly bunch, and this church prooved the point.  The greeter at the door asked if we were familair with the Orthodox, and offered a prayer book tohelpus follow the service.  Being raised in the Eastern Catholic Church, and Baptised Russian Orthodox, I know a little about the church, so his help was unneeded, but greatly appreciated.  The Choir is magnificent, the Priest LOUD AND CLEAR in his chanting, and the whole atmoshpere is great.  Go some Sunday, and see what worship should be!
