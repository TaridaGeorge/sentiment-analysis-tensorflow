Seriously, this buffet is awesome!!!! We visited a couple weekends ago, and for $25 a plate we got our money's worth. The butcher station was serving lamb and new york. Absolutely fall off the bone good. They have themed stations.....asian, mexican, etc. I tried a little from each and everything was awesome. It's a bit of a drive for us since we are in the far northwest valley, but we will be back again SOON!
