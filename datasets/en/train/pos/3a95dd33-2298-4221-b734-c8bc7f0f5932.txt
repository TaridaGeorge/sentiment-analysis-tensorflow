I always love coming to Sprouts. They have am excellent selection of extremely reasonably priced produce, and they carry a lot of healthy alternatives compared to other grocery stores. Their bulk section is great, too. The have bulk sugars, flours, dried fruits, legumes, granola, veggie chips, and more. I really enjoy the new-ish line of coconut milk and almond milk yogurts and their great supplement/personal hygiene section is top notch!
