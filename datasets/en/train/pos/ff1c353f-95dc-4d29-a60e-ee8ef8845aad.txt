I've lived out in the west Valley for about 5 years now and I'm yet to come across a Chinese Food place better than this one.  This place has a local feel to it and is very clean and well taken care of. The staff are very friendly and willing to make substitutions to meet customer needs. The food is spectacular sit-down style. This place also has some classic dishes that you can't find anywhere else around town. The crispy orange beef and chicken sizzling rice dishes are among the best. This place is truly a gem of the west valley hidden in the north-west corner of Surprise.
