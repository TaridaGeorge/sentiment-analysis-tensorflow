My wife and I were on our honeymoon, and were just looking for a nice place to stay before we flew back to the midwest.  We stayed here and could not have been happier.  Spotless room, tasteful decor, great shower, free wine during happy hour.  We wanted to make an evening out of our last night on honeymoon, and actually never even wound up leaving the hotel premises.  Had an AWESOME dinner on the 2nd floor restaurant, and poolside drinks both before and after dinner (not to mention a nice dip in the pool).  I'd definitely go back and recommend this place to anyone headed to Phoenix.
