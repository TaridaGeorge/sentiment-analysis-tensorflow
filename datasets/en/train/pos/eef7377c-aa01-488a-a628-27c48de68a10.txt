I had cake pops made for a reception on 10/22/11. They made 3 kinds, Vanilla Cheesecake, Pumpkin and Red Velvet. Today is 10/26 and I am just finishing the last few! AMAZING that they taste just a good today as it was 4 days ago (of course I kept them in the fridge). We had people telling us they didn't make it home with out eating the ones they had taken for their kids!
They took time to arrange them for me in my own baskets and added my personalized Thank You tags. The cake is sooo moist and the texture melts in your mouth. Your mouth is filled with joy and amazing flavor! Great work guys!
Thank you!!!
