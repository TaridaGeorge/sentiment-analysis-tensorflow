I have enjoyed working with Kristi Dee Doden and The Mindful Way for about 10 years. I have had the benefit of her skills as both a massage therapist and a communications coach. 

While I always enjoy her body work, through Kristi's workshops, I have learned tools on how to relate compassionately to myself and ultimately to others. This has had the most impact on me. I appreciate her ability to hold a sense of safety for me when issues feel overwhelming. I trust that she can help me find a win-win result to particularly emotional situations. 

I experience great personal growth under Kristi's guidance and I find myself turning to her often for support and clarity. She is a very effective listener and I am glad that I have found her in my life.
