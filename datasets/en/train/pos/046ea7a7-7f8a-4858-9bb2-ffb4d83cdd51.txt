I saw the name Hyatt, then I saw the price of $75 after taxes and fees, and something just didn't add up. We check in and the front desk attendant was extremely courteous and helpful. We walk into our room and are simply amazed. You will have a hard time finding a better hotel for the price of this one. Large room, very sheik trendy decor. the sofa in the living room looked like something out of a trendy art deco store, not something that would normally contain a sofa bed! the kitchen area was a bonus, and dining/desk was great. The 50" LCD TV was amazing, and what's more, it had all of the connections needed to hook up a computer, dvd player or any other device you want. The beds were comfortable. All in all, a great hotel!
