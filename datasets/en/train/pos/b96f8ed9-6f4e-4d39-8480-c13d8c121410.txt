Great pizza!! Chicago style!! Good thin crust Good cut in squares like back home good sauce and cheese. Best pizza in the west valley!! Small hole in the wall, no AC in there I think, had to call and ask where the hell it was, I passed it 3 times but was dark out lol I drove from near PIR race track and was well worth it!! It was great and will go here few times a month I bet! A must try and not to far from sox spring training for Chicagoans to get some descent pizza!
