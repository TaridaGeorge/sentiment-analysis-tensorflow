I wish I could eat breakfast here everyday. Everything I have eaten here has left me only to want to try another breakfast. The sweet and the savory choices are equally delicious so just take your pick. The pecan french toast melts in your mouth, the eggs benedict's hollandaise sauce is amazing, and the vegetable frittata or the ajo breakfast wrap will certainly satisfy. Did I mention the large portions and the side of mouthwatering potatoes? I also like to try to be a little healthy, so the choice of egg beaters or whites is appealing. Finally, the owner is always around and she is super nice. She runs a great business, and its great to see her involvement with the diners. Oh and did I mention... ITS AMAZING!
