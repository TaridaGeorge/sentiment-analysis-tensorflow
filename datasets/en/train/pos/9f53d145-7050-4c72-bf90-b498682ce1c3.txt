Paletas Betty provided a refreshing cool treat after our meal at San Tan this afternoon.  We walked down the block and around the corner and I had a blueberry lemonade popsicle and Mr. M had a mango popsicle.  For $2.50 each they beat the hell out of a fatty 8-dollar dessert at a restaurant.  We will definitely be returning for more of these.  The mango tasted like I was eating a chilled fresh mango and the blueberry flavor just popped AND that one turned my tongue purple, so that was a bonus.  I am so glad we stepped into this nice, clean little shop.  We'll definitely be back.
