Great service, great food & fabulous complimentary tiramisu for your birthday. We had 5 different dishes Salmone Va Bene ,lemon chicken, pasta w/ chicken, pasta w/ seafood, pasta w/ veggies, and everyone was happy. 

A nice quiet patio if you want to avoid the loud bar, but don't want the formal dining area.

My stand-by favorite Italian restaurant for years!
