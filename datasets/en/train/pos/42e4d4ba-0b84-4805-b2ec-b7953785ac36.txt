Just like home!  Every time I'm visiting a place with In N Out I have to go because it always reminds me of home.  The food is awesome and the prices are amazing.  For a double double cheeseburger, single cheese, french fries and 2 shakes we spent $11.  The shakes are super thick and excellent on a warm Phoenix day.
