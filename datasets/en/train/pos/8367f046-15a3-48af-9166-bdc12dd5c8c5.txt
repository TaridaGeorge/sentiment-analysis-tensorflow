I loved how everyone was so friendly and I found some really good deals that you cannot find most of the time on ebay, craigslist etc. If you come here with $50 you can potentially walk out with a lot of stuff! Giant print screen blankets for $19, nail polishes and hair accessories for $1, lots of beautiful jewelry and food.

Bre's bakery makes a delicious red velvet cupcake! There are tons of cheap toys for your little one and let's not forget clothes and fireworks! Only open on FRI, SAT, and SUN 10am-6pm.
