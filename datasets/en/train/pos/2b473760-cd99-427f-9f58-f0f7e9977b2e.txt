I have been to Sack's a few times now always really busy at lunch time... On this trip I ordered the Sack's Encore a hot sandwich (Prime steak, melted provolone, saut√©ed onions, hot peppers, feta yogurt dressing & lettuce with grated parmesan, on an 8 inch baguette with a side of potato salad. The Encore was really good I would order it again for sure and the potato salad was pretty tasty as well... each meal comes with a free cookie so that's a bonus to end a great meal.
