I love this place. I have met Dean about 6 years ago when he was at Casey Moores, yes it is a small world. He is a great guy and he really took the time to learn his mothers way of making the pasty dough. Good for him for bringing a great piece of England to America. 

The size of the place makes it just that much more or a neighborhood joint. The beer selection is great, Boningtons on tap! If you have never tried a Boningtons, try one, now!

The Pastys are awesome, the lamb and rosemary is my favorite. The meatball is by room mates. Irish Car Bombs for $3, I've gotten pissed in there ,more then once. 

I know that it is a little hot,but we are in the middle of the desert, deal with it. 

Thank you dean for bringing a little British to America.
