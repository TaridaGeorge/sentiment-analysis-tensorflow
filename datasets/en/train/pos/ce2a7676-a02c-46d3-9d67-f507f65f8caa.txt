This place might be my favorite place to eat in the entire Phoenix area.  Not only are the sandwiches during lunch and pizzas at dinner spectacular, the whole experience is top notch.  The wait staff is great and the building is an old home with such a great ambiance to it that you cannot help but have a great time at this place.  Whether you are looking for a date place or a place to go with a bunch of friend and share great conversation, this place will work great for you.
