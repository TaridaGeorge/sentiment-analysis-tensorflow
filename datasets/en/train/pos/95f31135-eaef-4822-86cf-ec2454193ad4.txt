Wow!  I have been driving past this place for eons, barely giving it a second thought.  What a fool I've been!  

Veneto Trattoria is insanely good.  I'm talkin' really delicious Italian food.  Who knew!  Apparently two other Yelpers!!

I guess I should have looked this place up on Yelp like a good little Yelper would and then I would have known a while ago that I should check this place out. 

Everything I had here was excellent- the app, the entree, the dessert- all delicious.  I had the bruschetta, the spinach ravioli and affogato (espresso and scotch flavors with chocolate chips on ice cream).  I also got to try my boyfriend's food, and everything was delicious as well.  This place is my new favorite restaurant!

And if the weather allows, they have this perfect little patio with twinkling lights for you to dine in.
