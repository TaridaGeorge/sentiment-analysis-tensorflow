If I lived in this area, Zinc Bistro would become a hangout and I would get fat.  I walk out of Zinc Bistro feeling like I'm floating in a butter gondola down a canal filled with butter, all while wearing a butter beret.  I always get the mussels, which is essentially a butter soup with HULK SMASH mussels in it.  Throw in the house salad (more delicious and well-crafted then it needs to be), a basket of bread (to soak up the mussel butter so you don't look like an asshole slurping it with a spoon), and a glass of bordeaux (or two) and call it a night.  A buttery, drunk, fat night.
