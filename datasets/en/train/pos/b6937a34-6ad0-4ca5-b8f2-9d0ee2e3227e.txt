Having dinner here is an absolute EVENT!  Don't expect to get to anything else that night, if you are doing dinner right that is.

This is not fast food, they give you plenty of time and do not rush service at all.  (I doubt they don more than one turn a night)  And you know what?  It is great!  
The food was fantastic, and I highly recommend the aged Manhattan to start out the night.

Sit back, relax and enjoy.
