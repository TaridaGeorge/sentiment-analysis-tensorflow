So glad Tempe has an area like this... a few miles down Mill and you feel like you're in another town. Nothing but green everywhere and water..love it!!

Went to the batting cages... for $1.25 you get 14 pitches... 

you got pools...lake..basketball/tennis courts you can even pay to join games i believe..

just an all around cool place for some physical activities. And cheap at that!
