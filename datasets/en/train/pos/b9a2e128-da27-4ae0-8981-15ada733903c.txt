This place is amazing!

I should start off by saying I don't eat red meat and even though this is a burger place, they have lots of other options such as turkey, mushroom, or even veggie burgers. 

I had a turkey burger and loved it! The bread is also just amazing! My boyfriend had the Blu Burger and he notes himself as somewhat of a food connoisseur and he said this was the best burger he had ever had in his entire life and he raved about it all day long! 

Also their sweet potato fries are to die for. I absolutely love them and I have never liked sweet potato fries before anywhere else!

This place is a must visit and we will definitely be back when we're in the area!
