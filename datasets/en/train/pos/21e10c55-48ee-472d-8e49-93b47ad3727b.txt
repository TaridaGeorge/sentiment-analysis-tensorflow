The only Thai food I've found in the valley worth eating.  Scottsdale Thai is good but I'm not spending $10 + on a dish.  I only do take-out but the hand-carved panels and atmosphere are really nice, lovely staff -- the place to go for Thai food in Phoenix. As good as the best in San Fran, Portland & Seattle.
