My son absolutely ADORES this place! There is plenty to do, they have made some good changes to their layout and also their exhibits and play areas if you haven't been here in a while. A lot of hands on activities for the children, and the adults can participate too. Definitely a nice place to let your children explore their creative side in the East Valley.
