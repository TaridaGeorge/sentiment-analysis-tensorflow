It's simple: if you love Mongolian BBQ, you'll love this place. It's delicious. The quality is always top notch, and with the ability to create many dishes from the various ingredients, it's entirely possible to never have the same meal twice. Plus, I can get the big bowl, eat my meal, and take the rest home for another meal or two later on. That's a definite win.
