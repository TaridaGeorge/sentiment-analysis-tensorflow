Love love love this place! Great place to relax and have some great grub. Food is always great which go well with any beer...depending on which kind you like. Don't like beer? They have wine and other liquors I'm sure the bartender can make a drink to your liking. Crowd is laid back and there to have a good time. Great place to watch games as well. They close at 2am which is good if you work late and need a beer to relax you. Cant go wrong with this place!
