Went to Phoenix on business and I wanted to take an associate out for lunch. He always talks about how much he loves BBQ ribs so I did a search on Yelp and decided on Bobby Q. They did not disappoint. Not only was the entire meal one of the best BBQ I ever had, but they took 10% of the bill for mentioning Yelp. How cool is that? Great place, great waitresses and phenomenal ribs and sides...
