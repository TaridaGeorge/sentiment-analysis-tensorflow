Not much has changed about this fantastic place, except for some fancy decorating improvements and rearranging of furniture.  Desert Nails Spa is clean, well-maintained and professional.  The women who work here do a great job and they work hard.  Also, if you are local there is a coupon in the money mailer for 2 dollars off a manicure or pedicure, not too shabby.  The wait time is unpredictable so I would suggest calling ahead for an appointment.
