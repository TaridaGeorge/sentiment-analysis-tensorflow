While living in Phoenix, Tucson and Philadelphia, I've had a lot of really good Pho.  Today I had Pho at Boba Juice for lunch and it's probably the best I've ever had!  The best part is that everything's vegetarian so you don't have to wonder if the broth is vege or not, plus you can get fake meat that is delicious.  The staff is unbelievably nice and the prices are impossible to beat.  Please eat at Boba Juice so they can keep me full and happy for a very long time :)
