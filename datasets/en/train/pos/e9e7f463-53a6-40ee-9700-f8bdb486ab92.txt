This was my first time eating at an actual Thai restaurant, and I loved it!  Went for lunch and our waitress was very helpful and recommended a great spicy tofu dish, which was amazing!  Lunch combo came with soup, which was sooooo good!  Our waitress said they (the servers) make it themselves during the week for lunch.  It's very light and fresh tasting...and vegetarian!  Also came with a spring roll, rice and wontons.  Our bill came to less than $20 for 2 people!  I will definitely go back!
