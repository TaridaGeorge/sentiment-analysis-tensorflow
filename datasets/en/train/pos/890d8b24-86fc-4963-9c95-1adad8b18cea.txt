Today I had the chicken shwarma at Chicago Gyros and I think it's good. Nice flavor to the chicken, lots of toppings, good tzatziki, tons of fries. I would like to see one change though. For a true shwarma, the meat should be carved off of a piece of broiled meat. At Chicago Gyros, you get big chunks of chicken on the shwarma. So technically, it's not really a shwarma... 

I'll definitely go back! I think I'll try their baba and falafel next time. Yum!
