I LOVE this place. The women that work there are so nice and helpful, I don't even scrapbook but the scrapbook room makes me want to SO bad. The furniture is amazing, from what I have seen better quality than Anthropologie and less expensive too. and ohhh the chandeliers!!! I have looked up, down, and around the world for chandeliers and they have the most perfect ones ever. 
We stopped in for supplies for Christmas gifts we were putting together and found almost everything we needed. I will definitely be back - even if you are not looking for anything specific you will more than likely find the exact something you have been searching/wishing for.
