This place is like my Cheers! I go at least 3 times a week on my way to work for my iced tea and the staff always greets me by name! The fact that they have crushed ice is just icing on the cake.  Plus...where else can you find so many different fountain drinks in one place?

Always clean and well stocked!  I feel like I'm cheating on my QT if I go to a different one!
