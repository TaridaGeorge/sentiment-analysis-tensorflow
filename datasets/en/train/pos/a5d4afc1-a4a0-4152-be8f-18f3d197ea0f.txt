This is hands down the BEST Greek food in AZ. I've been coming here now for a couple of years with my family, and their food has never once let us down. Saganaki is AMAZING, just amazing. The same guy is always there and he's super cool and friendly. Outdoor seating, indoor seating,  and it's never REALLLY busy. . .but I won't eat anywhere else because, well, why try to change a good thing? :)
