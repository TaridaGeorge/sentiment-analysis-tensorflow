This place is So Johnny Chu. Sochu. So good.

Basically this seems to be a larger Sens (my ultimate favorite restaurant...RIP) with a more streamlined menu. Whatever, it fills that void in me that so longs to eat every meal of every day at one place.

My happy hour was especially ecstatic because of all the terrific items on their $5 menu. Soup gyoza. Chicken lollipops. Spicy chicken wontons, to name a few. Seriously, I could have ordered one of everything on this menu and been a very happy person. This was my friend Lio's first time at a JChu restaurant and he really enjoyed it. And being right off light rail makes Sochu that much more accessible. I already want to be back there.
