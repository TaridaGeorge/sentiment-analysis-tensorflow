I love this place.  It's not a trendy Scottsdale place - just great quality and value food.  They've even added brown rice to the offerings after years of harrassment from yours truly :-)  The lunch specials are great for a business lunch - though they can get busy now.  Also a new Happy Hour (three of them really): 4-7pm.  I agree service quality does tend to vary but it's part of a small business growing.  I am usually with people I want to talk with so it's never an issue.  I am glad we have an asset like this place in the neighborhood and never get sick of trying out the menu (which BTW you aren't limited to if you're open to Tottie's suggestions!).
