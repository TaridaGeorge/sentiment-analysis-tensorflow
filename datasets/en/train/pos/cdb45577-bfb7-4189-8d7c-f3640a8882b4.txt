I really love visiting Liberty Market.  The food is always good and the sides are rotated so I seem to always try something new.  The first visit to LM I had the Maiden Lane and the slaw was delicious...as a side I had the sweet potato salad.  I have also had the vegeterian pizza that has asparagus and squash.  The pizza crust was cooked perfectly and had a wonderful wood fire taste.  The sangria is wonderful, full of fruit and goodies.  Also the carrot cake is something to have every trip.  So dence and moist.  I would eat at LM every day if I could afford it!  Love Love the Liberty Market.
