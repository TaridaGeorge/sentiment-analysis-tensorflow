I've ate here three times in the past two weeks for lunch and have to say I LOVE the food.  Excellent service, reasonably priced full meal lunch specials with soup, crab puff, spring roll, rice and main course for under $5 (even the Shrimp dishes are under $6)

I'm going to check out the dinner there soon.  I loved their Hot & Sour Soup and would recommend any of the Prawn lunch specials or the Cashew Chicken.

For your local neighborhood Chinese sit down meal, you just can't beat it for the quality, price and service.  At least that has been my two friends and my experience over multiple occasions.  My friend who lives in the neighborhood has ate here many times and recommended it to us.  Thanks, Ian!
