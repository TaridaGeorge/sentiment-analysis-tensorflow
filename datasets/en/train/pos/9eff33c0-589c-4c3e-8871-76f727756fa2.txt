I dined here last night for my 33rd birthday and I was impressed!!  Everything was outstanding and healthy to boot!  I had the Wild Copper River salmon and it was delicious.  My Mom and Dad both had the lamb chops and they were so good they wanted to order more!!  The individual portioned desserts were just right and a great ending to our meal.  Service was great and I'm so glad I picked this place for my birthday dinner!! We will be back!
