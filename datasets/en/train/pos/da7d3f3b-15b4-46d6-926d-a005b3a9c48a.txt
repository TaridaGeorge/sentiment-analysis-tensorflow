Four Peaks has been one of my favorite places for years now. 
Local beers are awesome and this place does it best. Although my absolute FAVORITE is the Pumpkin Porter seasonal, in off season I'm happy with any of their beer, but usually stick with some Peach Ale. It gets crazy crowded on game days (of all sports and all teams) but always worth the wait. They have the best spinach artichoke dip I've ever had. The servers are 100% hit or miss. Usually I have a great service, but occasionally I've had terrible service (bad servers but still great food/beer). Oh, and parking is kind of rough... but even then I cannot give this place less than 5 stars b/c of their consistent food and drinks. Oh! And Sunday Brunch... bloody marys and peak's mimosas. Seriously, do it.
