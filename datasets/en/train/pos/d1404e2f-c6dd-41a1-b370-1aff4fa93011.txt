I love this place! I'm an ASU downtown student and its perfect for a quick, healthy meal. I can get grilled chicken, veggies, and brown rice. The place is always clean and the service is always GREAT. Plus they gave me 10% off for no reason today. I'll take it! 
Oh, and they have a really good green peach iced tea too. 
I have never had a bad experience here, and I'll miss it when I graduate!
