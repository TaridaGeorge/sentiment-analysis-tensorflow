This is one of the best grocery stores in Arizona.  They have everything that you are looking for and if they don't, they will order for you or suggest another store that does carry the brand.

The wine selection is awesome.  Need a Sancerre and recommendation on what they have- they are happy to help.

Fresh organic fruit for your day at the pool- everything you can think of!

This is the type of grocery store that makes you want to go through every aisle, even if there isn't anything in that aisle that you need. 

Best of all, they carry Gianna's organic cookies!  My ultimate weakness and damn them, they place them as you enter the store. They so have my number!
