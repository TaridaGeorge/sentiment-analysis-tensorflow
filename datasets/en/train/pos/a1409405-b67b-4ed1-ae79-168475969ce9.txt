This place is amazing.  The biscuits and gravey are my go to almost every time I walk in to that place.  Anybody who goes there needs to try this! 

The breakfast burrito is a close second.  Having these two items on the menu makes me think gaining weight and eating both may be worth it.  

The bagels are a great way to go as well.  They have very good cream cheese and the bages are always very fresh.
