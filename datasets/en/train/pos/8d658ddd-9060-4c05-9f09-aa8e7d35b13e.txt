The food is absolutely incredible! Last night I went for the second time and at this point, we have tried everything on the menu....

The service was excellent and I LOVE the open kitchen. 

The only downside(not a bad thing) is the winelist. At all of Peters restaurants they have that 200 page book of wines. I can't handle that many choices!! It took me almost 45 minutes to make my mind up!

Can't wait to go back!
