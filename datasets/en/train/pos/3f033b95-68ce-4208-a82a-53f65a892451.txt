Even though this place is closed, I am putting a little note here to say that every Hawaiian BBQ place I encounter is compared to Jay's Ma'i Island grill.  It is a high standard, because Ma'i island is the best Hawaiian BBQ I have ever had.  It was a well liked restaurant in Tempe, and it is a shame the owner moved away.

So, good luck other Hawaiian BBQ places, because the bar has been set high.
