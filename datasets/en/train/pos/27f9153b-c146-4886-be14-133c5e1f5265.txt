This is a great place if you love good beer.  And life is too short to drink bad beer!  They have a great selection of bottles that you can purchase and drink in the bar, or take out in a mixed 6 pack.  They also have a rotating menu of beer on draft.   This is not a bud light drinker's bar. They have great pizzas also.
