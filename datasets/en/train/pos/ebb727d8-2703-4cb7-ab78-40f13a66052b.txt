Whole Foods, How do I Love thee? Let me count the ways: 

-Vegan Cheese Cake by Earth Cafe (To Die For!!) 
-Vegan Deli items like: 
-Vegan Sheperds Pie (Amazing) 
-Vegan Margherita Tofu Lasagna (Ridiculously Good) 
-Endless Salad Bar Creations (Love the stuffed Grape leaves) 
-Vegan Soups, 
-Vegan Pizzas, 
-Vegan Made to order Sandwiches (Love that Olive Spread) 
-Vegan Sushi (Avocado Cucumber Rolls, better than most restaurants) 

-Beautiful Organic Produce (Local Choices too) 
-Organic Almond Milk 
-Hemp Seeds in Bulk 
-Mrs. Gooch's Pasta Sauce (My Favorite, try it!) 

-Much more Spacious than other Whole Foods I've been to. 

Listen, I could go on all day, I think you get the idea.
It's my Vegan Paradise and, even though it's a little pricey, it's worth it! 

I do miss the mini shopping carts though, what ever happened to those?
