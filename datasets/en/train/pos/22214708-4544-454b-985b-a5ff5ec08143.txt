I have been working out with Chrissy for a month now.  I have bursitis in my shoulder and was afraid to start working out again.  Chrissy has been great helping me stay in shape without irritating my shoulder and is helping me to strengthen my shoulder so I can avoid a flare up in the future.  Her workouts are different every day and the best benefit is that I work out in my own home, before my kids wake up for school and she trains me online with her virtual workout!  I have never felt better and she truly takes good care of me!  I would recommend her to anyone!
