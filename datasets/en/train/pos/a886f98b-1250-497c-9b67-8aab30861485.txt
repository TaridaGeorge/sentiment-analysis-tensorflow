I have been a regular at LifeQuest Chiropractic & Massage for almost six months now.  The reason for my visit, originally, was because I used to wake up periodically with back pain and have difficulty falling back asleep--this hasn't occurred even just one night since my second week at LifeQuest.  

Not only is Dr. Scharf great at what he does--but so are the other staff members!  I've had multiple massages and each of the massage therapists were great.

I highly recommend LifeQuest Chiropractic & Massage.
