Even though few people have ever heard of Astara (Biogenic Skincare) - this natural/holistic line - used in spas - is terrific.

Expensive but not crazy, and terrific products that really works.

It truly is like food for the skin.

Awesome!  Try the Golden Flame, Green Papaya and Blue Flam masques.
I also swear by the antioxidant emulsion.

The products also happen to smell divine.  (All those essential oils and plant-derived ingredients make them smell so good.)
