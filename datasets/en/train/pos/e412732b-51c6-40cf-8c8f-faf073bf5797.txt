Located across the parking lot from Maggiano's at FLW and Scottsdale, the recently opened Capital Grille offers the best steaks for the money in North Scottsdale (edging out my previous favorite, Mastro's; The Grille at the TPC may have the best beef, but they're 20% more expensive). The bar is great, and the dining room is really well done (the ambience is better than at the Capital Grille at the Biltmore). Try the 20 ounce New York Strip. Superb wine list. Ask for Jarrod when you arrive. Tell him John Maar sent you.
