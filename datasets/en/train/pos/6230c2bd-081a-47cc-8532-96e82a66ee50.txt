i'm an east-coaster  transplanted in  southern california so to say I go through DD withdrawl on an almost daily basis is an understatement.  
This DD could have been the most run down DD in the world and I wouldn't have cared- as long as I was able to get a Bacon, Egg Cheese Croissant w/ a coffe coolatta- i would have been thrilled

Alas, this was one of the nicer DD that I've seen compared to the one's I'm familiar with on the east coast- can't say I'm all about their new expanded menu options( hasbrowns ,flatbread sammies etc) just give me a donut and we'll call it a day.

I love DD- they can do no wrong in my book.
