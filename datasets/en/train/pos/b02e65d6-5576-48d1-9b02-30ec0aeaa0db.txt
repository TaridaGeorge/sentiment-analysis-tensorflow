Uh, Oh, Oh, Woke up today, feeling the way I always do.. Uh, Oh, Oh.. 

Last night was the first time I've been to the Orpheum (Hairspray, 5 stars!).. what a fantastic theatre! Classic architecture.. very good sound quality and of course comfy seats. All ushers were extremely friendly and helpful unlike some theatre in Tempe were the snotty ASU students, well..

This theatre is SO Phoenix!  It fits right in with the current scene downtown..taking the old and making it new again! 

A class act (no pun intended, uhg)!
