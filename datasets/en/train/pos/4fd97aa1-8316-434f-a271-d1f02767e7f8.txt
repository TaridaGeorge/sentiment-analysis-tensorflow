I don't know why it took us so long to hear about this place. Our lunch today was some of the best Chinese food we have had in a long time. The orange chicken and spicy chicken dumplings were superb!!! I shouldn't say this, but they need to raise their prices. This is probably the best deal in town as far as authentic Chinese food goes. Can't wait to go back and try something else.
