WOW, they sat us on time and  the food was very fresh, cooked perfectly  and tasted great and the decor made us feel like we were in Tuscany. 
My wife and I called them Saturday around noon and made a reservation for 7:45 as we were taking some friends out for their birthday. we showed up at 7:15 to try their wine before hand. When we got there they were telling people that there was over an hour wait. However, they sat us right on time.  The wine selection was limited however, everything we tasted was excellent. The two slight negatives for us personally are that they serve Pepsi instead of Coke and I don't like Pepsi and because it was so busy, it was rather noisy which made it hard to carrying a conversation. I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE and cant wait to go back.
