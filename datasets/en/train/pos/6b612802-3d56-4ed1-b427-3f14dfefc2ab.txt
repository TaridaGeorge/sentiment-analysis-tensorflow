The name of the place is what attracted us to look at the menu during our 3 day visit to Phoenix, we went for Sunday Brunch on my birthday and at the end of the meal they brought me cake! The food was good and the service was excellent, a younger crowd but family friendly. It was so good in fact we went back again on Monday morning!
