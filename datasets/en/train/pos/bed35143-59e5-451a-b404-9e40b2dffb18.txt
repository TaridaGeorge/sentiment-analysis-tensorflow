The Phoenix Mountain Preserve is one of the best kept secrets in town where you can escape the city in moments and enjoy miles of hiking and biking trails and solitude.

Fred the Dog and I hike out here most every morning... he is quite fond of  his trail time. There is a good mix of folks on the trails including hikers, walkers, mountain bikers and horse people.

I started a FaceBook page called Phoenix Mountain Preserve Life if you'd like to join and add your own pics and comments. We even have a page for dogs of trail 100... my personal favorite.
