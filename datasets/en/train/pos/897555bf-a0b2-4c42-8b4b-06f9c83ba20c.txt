I have tried finding a spin class in Arizona that is of the intensity and variety that this studio offers.  Bar none.  The CoreBalance Studio has dedicated instructors that push you to your limit in an encouraging way.  The unique thing about this studio is they use the "RealRider" (or is it "RealRyder"?) bikes that cause you to turn right and left to work your obliques.

Outstanding workout! I recommend it to everyone who wants to get into shape.
