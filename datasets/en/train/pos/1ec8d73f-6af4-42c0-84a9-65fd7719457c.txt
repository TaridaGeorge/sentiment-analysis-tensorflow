Great Place for a Vegan treat! 

Vanilla soy frozen yogurt, soy based gelatos and vegan crepes! 

Everything is made on site and they don't use Corn Syrup in any of their products!! That alone is a reason for 5 stars! 

My only complaint is that they don't have much for toppings and are really scarce on the fresh fruit.

From now on this is my go to place for a frozen treat!
