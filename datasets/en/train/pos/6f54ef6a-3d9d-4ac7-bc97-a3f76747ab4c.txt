My new watch needed to have its metal-link bracelet resized and after a frustrating search ("We'll do it only if the watch was bought here" ... "We don't have the right tools for that kind of bracelet" ...), it occurred to me that I should have yelped it first! So after reading the more recent reviews for the establishment under new management (the 1st review is no longer valid - it was for the previous management; I'm waiting for yelp to take it down), I brought my watch here. Eddie was friendly, fast, and got the bracelet resized within a few minutes, for just 5 bucks. Now I know where to bring my watch for battery replacement, or if it ever needs repair in the future.
