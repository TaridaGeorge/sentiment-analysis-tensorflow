This is a place that really helps a lot of women across the valley find direction and help during transitions in life. Whether you are new to the valley as I am or a long time resident they openly receive you and assist you. 
They offer short term programs to assist with finding resources for counseling, education, car repairs & transportation, interviewing, networking, resume writing, self esteem & empowerment, divorce workshops, housing, entering & returning to the workplace, the list goes on. 
They provide a clean, quiet & safe environment with some free daycare while using the resources at the location for all women, so as to minimize their worries and assist with getting them stabilized in the communities. 
It is the best such program, I have seen in any city and a beautiful environment as well.
