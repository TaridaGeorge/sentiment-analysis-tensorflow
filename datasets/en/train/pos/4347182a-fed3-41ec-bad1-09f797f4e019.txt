Move over Pizzeria Bianco you have met your match. I have been to Lamp at least 12 times and it keeps getting better. The young owners are there day and night and really have mastered the limited menu. Ingredients are very fresh, the choices provide tasty and interesting salads, pizzas and yes even desserts. The crostini which come with the salads and made fresh daily are outstanding. The entire experience from the greeting at the front door to delivery of the check is done with a spirit of " we appreciate your business and we're here to accommodate you"

Being from the NY area I have probably eaten at over 100 pizza restaurants over the years and rank Lamp within the top 3 or 4. Bellissimo!
