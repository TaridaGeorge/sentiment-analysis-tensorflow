Amazing. Amazing. AMMMMAAAZZZINNNNG!!!!! Here is the deal I spent a year abroad in Florence during college. Loved it. Loved the food. I think Florence is to blame for my foodie ways. A few years back my friend who lives in the valley and also lived in Florence found this place. We went . . . and since then it is one of my favorite places to go. AUTHENTIC. Is the only thing you need to know about this place. From the Italian TV on the station - to the staff (speaking Italian across the counter at each other). This place takes me back to Florence. The sandwiches are amazing. And the desserts . . . well they are delicious. To put all this into context this is a place we will drive 45 minutes across town to for lunch.
