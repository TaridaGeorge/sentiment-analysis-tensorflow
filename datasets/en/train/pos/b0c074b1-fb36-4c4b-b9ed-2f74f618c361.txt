My family and I have eaten here at least a hundred times over the years. This is one of two spots we eat lunch at if we are near downtown Phoenix. The price is right and the service is always excellent as is the food. The family who runs the restaurant is always very friendly. I would recommend this place to anyone. My only complaint is that they only have one location in the valley.
