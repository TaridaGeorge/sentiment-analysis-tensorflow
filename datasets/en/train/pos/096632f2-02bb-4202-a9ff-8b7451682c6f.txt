There is a gentleman at this place who makes the best carna asada fries and nachos late at night.  And for only $6 including tax, you cannot go wrong.  See photos.  He packs on the cheese, meat, and sour cream every time.  I just can't get enough. 

Now as for the lady who makes them mostly during the day, she packs on the beans and pico de gallo instead of the cheese and sour cream.  This lady is really nice and she works there all day long.  She always has a beautiful smile.  

So, you can have them one way during the day and another late at night.

Come try this place out, and you will be inviting all your friends to this spot.  Dining area open all the time.
