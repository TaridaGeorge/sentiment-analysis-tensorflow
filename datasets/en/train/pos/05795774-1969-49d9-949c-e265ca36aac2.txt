Pizza Mia is fantastic!
We usually order Papa John's or Domino's.  We were in the mood to try something different but we still wanted Pizza.  We called in our order and let me tell you, I'm now converted from commercialized pizza chains.  They said it would be about 45 minutes, it took about 35.  Gotta love it when your food arrives earlier than promised.  The delivery guy had a personality.  The pizza crust is so light, even the kids eat this crust.  Oh, and the wings are soooo good and they have an even better price on them.  For a large pizza, order of wings & breadstick (comes with sauces) our total before tip was around $24.  Most places, you start adding wings it really gets up there in price.  Great service and great food for the value.
