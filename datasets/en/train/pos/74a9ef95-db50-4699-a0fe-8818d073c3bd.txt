Ah. Papago. How I love thee so. By far my favorite brew-pub in the inferno I call home. Fortunately, it's far enough south to (mostly) avoid the douchey Scottsdale scene. They have a very good selection of beers on tap and a fantastic selection in the coolers-- of which you are allowed to purchase and take home. Food is so-so, Four Peaks is better for that; but let's be honest, you're here, as Jake from Sun Also Rises would say, to get tight. So drink up and enjoy yourself.

Hipster friendly, so bring your fixie and avoid a dui.
