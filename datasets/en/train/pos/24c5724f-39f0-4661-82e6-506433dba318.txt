I follow a few rules in life to keep things simple. Go to the beach? Swim in the ocean. Ordering a beer? Choose something local. Walk into a half-decent mexican joint? Order the carnitas burrito. 

Oh my god. This was the best carnitas burrito I've ever had. You'll feel like you should be wearing protection while you eat it. That good. Just go there and order it. Thank me later.
