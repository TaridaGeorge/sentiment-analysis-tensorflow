Their spaghetti calzone is the best calzone I have ever had. Their signature spinach-tomato-garlic pizza is not my fav. pizza though. I like their spicy italian pizza with easy onions. Their sauce is very sweet, but it really is addicting! Get the thick crust, I think it is way better than their thin.
