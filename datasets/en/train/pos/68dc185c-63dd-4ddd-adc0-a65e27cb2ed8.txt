Very fresh vegetables and really tasty chunks of white meat chicken were found in the dish I ordered - the namesake Thai basil. Glad I branched out from the usual pad Thai because the garlic sauce on this dish was boldly flavored and still prepared mild for me as requested. Huge chunks of onions and broccoli really elevated the dish and the rice was great touch on the side for free. I have my eye on the peanut sauce and the curry for the next visit. Open til 10pm and free parking is great since I really can't pay to park and get take-out on Mill, it just doesn't seem right. Very nice staff too.
