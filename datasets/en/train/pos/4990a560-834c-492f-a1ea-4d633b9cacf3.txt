I went here for a Financial presentation with my Young Professional group tonight. The drinks were great! The girl next to me told me it was all gone as I was sucking the residue out of the glass. I had the chicken sandwich and fries. The chicken was grilled perfectly and it was the largest piece I've ever seen. Def going back.
