While I don't often end up in the neighborhood of monOrchid, I can say without a single doubt that I'll end up at Songbird every time I do. 

The coffee is delicious, the ambiance is laid back and friendly, and the locally-sourced food options are excellent. Pastries? Awesome. Cookies? Tasty. Burritos? I want to go to there. Where "I" is "a burrito" and "there" is "my mouth." 

I haven't tried the tea, but if they've chosen that partnership as well as their others, I have no doubt it's damn fine. 

In fact, it's probably best I don't end up near Songbird too often, because otherwise I'd be morbidly obese and permanently jacked up on caffeine. Go, relax, have some good food and drink with some very nice people.
