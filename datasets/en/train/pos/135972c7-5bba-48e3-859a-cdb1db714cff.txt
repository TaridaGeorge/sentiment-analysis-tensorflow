My new favorite place in Phoenix.  How have I lived here 2 years and I'm only now discovering how great central phx is??

Love the random movies they play on the tvs in the background, the list of sidebar cocktails, the music they play, and how friendly the bartenders always are.  If you're looking for a mellow lounge, a good crowd of normal, non-scottsdale people--this is it.  It's hip without the stuck up vibe.  Very modern looking inside--All the couches they have make it good for a group as long as its not too crowded.  Every time I walk in this place, I want to move next door, so I can walk over for a pimm's cup instead of driving from Scottsdale!  But it's worth it....
