Have no idea why this place has been given a bad rap.  This is my new favorite place!  Brittany B  and Luis are the bomb !  The food rocked and the $10 beer flight special was awesome!   
Two dinners a flight of 8 tastings 2 12 o and two black velvety for 48 bucks is a fricken steal !!!'
 Enjoy!  We will be back
I only wish they cooked with canola oil as the vegetable oil contains soy.
