I hear that in China, people can be very pushy, even rude, by American standards, shouting across a dining room, ordering their servers around.

Don't worry, no such behavior will be necessary here. All the servers are speedy and attentive. Expect to order drinks within seconds of sitting down and food arrives faster than McDonald's. 

One of the cleanest and largest Asian restaurants I've seen. They have family sized tables with a huge turntable in the middle. 

Lunches are large enough to share and dinner is family style.

The shrimp dishes are particularly exceptional, large and always de-veined. Try the "prawns with vegetables" or "honey walnut prawns." 

Sizzling black pepper beef is great too.
