We stopped at this place on our way to the theatre on a Saturday during dinner hours, the place was hopping and I thought we won't make it on time to our play. Needless to say, I was wrong, the waiter took our order and it only took a whole 7min. and that's with our drinks. BTW if you like mix drinks try the jumbo frozen Mango Margarita delicious!. In addition, I ordered the 3-course steak dinner that came along with the Cinnamon Apple Beignets dessert, and my partner ordered the Steak Paired With Chicken, Shrimp or Crab both diners were delicious for $11.99 each. Needless to say, we will be back to try other dishes on their menu, excellent choice for lunch or dinner.
