Quality food for a really good value.  Had the Walnut Shrimp, crab won tons and the House Soup tonight and everything was great!  I don't usually find myself this far west, but if you are in the area, I would definitely recommend stopping in. Also, call in your order before you arrive and it will likely be ready when you get there.  This place is really quick.
