I needed new tires for my Acura TL this weekend as I'll be driving the car to California soon.  I called around to several local tire shops, and none of them had the right size in stock.

I did some research on TireRack.com and decided on a brand and style of tire and decided to call a couple more places to see if I could find just what I wanted.

I called Discount Tire.  They had the exact tires I wanted in stock and could install them on the same day.  Dude gave me a quote over the phone and I made an appointment.  He told me they'd have me in and out in 45 minutes.

When we got there for the appointment, they had the tires, they were the exact price quoted and they did get me out in 45 minutes.

Can't really get much better than that!
