You may be asking yourself, "Are their meatballs, and meatball parms good?"   The answer would be, "Yes, yes they are."  Even though the restaurant is named after an orb of succulent meat, and the restaurant excels at that fare, I rarely find myself ordering anything with meatballs when I go here.  The reason being is that their chicken parmigiana is the secret star of the menu.  And unfortunately since Meatballz's chicken parms and meatballs are so good, I haven't explored much else of their menu.  However, I have been told by friends and family who have eaten their pasta and cold-cut sandwiches that those items are very good too.
