I have been to Noca so many times and every time it is a home run!  We just had the Rib Eye and it was melt in your mouth perfectly seasoned masterpiece!  Hungry thinking about it!   There was a parsnip and apple amouse bouche they brought out and it was amazing!  We hade the homemade pasta and it was the best I have ever had.  The sauce was tomato but a nice light summer one!  We loved it so much we went to the pasta making class the next day!  It was a blast...we are making homemade pasta this weekend!  Elloit and Chris you are the best!
