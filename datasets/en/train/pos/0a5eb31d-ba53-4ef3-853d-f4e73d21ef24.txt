I ordered my usual lunch combo special- Cashew Chicken with lo mein instead of the brown rice... their lunch combo is a lot of band for your buck. you get the entree, listed above, 2 cream cheese wontons, and an eggroll for a little more than 8 bucks after tax. substituting the lo mein for the brown rice costs a dollar more but that's fine since I really don't care for the brown rice. I always call in my order and they have it ready when I get there. Sweet staff. Love it!!!
