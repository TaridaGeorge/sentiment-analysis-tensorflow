This is a simply fantastic Aveda salon. I've had Joel cut my hair for over ten years now in this location and the first one, on Indian School Rd. There's a great laid back vibe here and a comfortable setting. 

Joel in particular offers great input on styles and is terrific at executing a new concept or maintaining an existing one. 

Always a friendly and courteous staff behind the counter as well.
