Yuuuuuuuuuuuuum. 

This was our first pasty experience, and boy were we happy that Cornish provided our Wednesday night fare. I had the lamb and mint; Josh had the alfredo pasty. The red wine gravy that accompanied my dish was AMAZING. The pasties themsevles look a little on the small side, but they filled us right up. Good people, good atmosphere, happy tummies.
