This is the best gas station/c-store I have ever seen! They have a MASSIVE drink station with a wall of lids across from it, tons of fresh and hot grill snacks, ample registers always open to speed you on your way, and usually about 20 gas pumps out front. This is how ALL other gas stations should should be set!
