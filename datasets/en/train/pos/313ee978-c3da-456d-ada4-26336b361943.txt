Love this space.  It's so NYC to me. It's posh and modern and open.  The walls are perfect for large pieces.  The rooms are big enough for incredible installations.  

I have always liked the artists they exhibit.  The last two exhibits I saw there this year were fantastic.  I can't remember the artists name but she took famous paintings, recreated them with spools of thread and when you looked through a piece of glass you would see and recognize the painting!  It was so unique and interesting. 

The last show I saw was Pat Steir, who also happens to be alumni of Pratt Institute, where I went to graduate school in New York City.  So I always enjoy her paintings and exhibits. 

One of the greatest fashion shows ever to happen in Phoenix (Kristin Dinnis and Betsy Johnson) was held in this space.  It was transformed and wonderful.
