I lived in New York City for 10 years and have probably tried over 50 other restaurants in search of Teriyaki Chicken that compares to Yoko Fast Food.  None of them even came close.  (Second place is Teriyaki Boy, but its a long second).
   If I could somehow eat at Yoko every day I would do it.
  The chicken is singed just barely to give it a bit of crunch, the sesame seeds are a must, the sauce is not too thick (though I ask to have it on the side - nobody is perfect and they often put more than I like).
  Bravo - Yoko Fast Food's Teriyaki Chicken.
