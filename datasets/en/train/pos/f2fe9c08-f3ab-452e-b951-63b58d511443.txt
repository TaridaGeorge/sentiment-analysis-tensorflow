My husband and I eat here at least once a week. Not only is it healthy (for the most part), but it tastes amazing. Being Vietnamese fans, I'd say it's a huge step ahead of other local places. Another perk is the no cork fee for bringing your own wine and you can bring beer in if you want too. My favorite items include the Pho-nomenal, lemongrass chicken, and the pork chop dinner with egg and crispy rice with shrimp. Don't miss out on this one!
