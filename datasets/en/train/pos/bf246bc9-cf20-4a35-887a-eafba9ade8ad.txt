Phoenix Magazine got it right naming this little neighborhood jewel as one of "The Best New Restaurants in Phoenix!" Service was attentive and helpful with the very eclectic menu.

Have ordered five dishes that were each unique ("Roasted Beets"), satisfying ("Fried Chicken and Waffles"). very tasty ("Catfish Oscar") and a twist on the normal ("Garden Salad"). Desserts, based on the "Pear Cake," are absolutely out of this world and NOT to be missed! In addition to my savoring the selections, adjacent diners were raving about their selections, different from mine, as well!

Will easily, with one or two more visits, become my "Favorite in Phoenix," if both the quality and taste continue to excel and somehow I believe they will.
