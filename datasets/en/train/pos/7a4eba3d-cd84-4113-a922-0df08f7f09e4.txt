I go here several times a year and absolutely love this place!  The pretzels, red cabbage, spaetzle, sauerkraut, schnitzel, you name it-and it is excellent here!  Oktoberfest is always a good time.  The staff is great.  My favorite dinner dish is the j√§ger schnitzel and my favorite lunch sandwich is the Reuben-best Reuben I've ever had.  They have a couple different German potato salads-both very good!  This place is a must try if you are near downtown Glendale.
