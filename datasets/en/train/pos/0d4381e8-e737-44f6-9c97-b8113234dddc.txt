What a breath of fresh air! Finally, a market concept done RIGHT! Awesome branding, excellent design, friendly staff. I felt so at home! The food was amazing: fresh deli turkey, cranberry, Brie with a light tang of horseradish. And the sweet potato salad was a great new try. 

I love how every detail was addressed: well, but not oversized coffee mugs, great china, even the beverage station had the perfect set of utensils for my self-service coffee. 

One critique would be breakfast. It ends at 11a on weekdays and 1p on weekends. As an avid breakfast all-day advocate, this disappoints me. Think about extending those hours! LGO did it with great success. 

Overall, HUGE fan. If you haven't gone, check it out!!
