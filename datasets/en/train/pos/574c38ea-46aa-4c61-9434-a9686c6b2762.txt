Love this store for casual clothing and cute shoes ladies. 
Love the wrangler jeans that I found here. I have had issues finding a decent pair of moderately priced jeans that fit well. Wrangler Q Girls jeans fit great and Cabellas had them. Also found a great pair of winter boots that look like UGs here and they were 1/2 the cost. Found some great looking, fashionable outer wear and also some great casual but dressy shoes to wear with jeans. 

Added bonus would be of course the Fudge in the shop upstairs.
