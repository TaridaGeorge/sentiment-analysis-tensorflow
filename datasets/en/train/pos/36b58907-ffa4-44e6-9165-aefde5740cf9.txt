I stumbled upon Romantasy Cabaret online & decided it looked interested. I purchased a set of tickets, took my boyfriend, and was both entertained & amused. Romantasy Cabaret puts on a truly fantastic show, the performers are wonderfully talented. We have been back a few times, and plan to go to more upcoming shows. Get tickets early as they go fast, and you really do want to get a seat. The show is a few hours long, and for our first experience we stood the whole time. The best seats are VIP, but the reserved seats aren't bad. Either way this is a show well worth seeing time and time again. Each time we go its better than the last.
