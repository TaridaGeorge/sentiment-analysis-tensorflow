Just sipping a snake preview from the spring cocktail lineup: French Marmalade. Wow it is sensational! And after trying Gin Rummy and Jolly Roger I'm trying to decide which one I like best. Tough choice :-)
They are all great - my vote tonight... French Marmalade.
For appetiser snacks we had Plantain Avocado spring rolls - baked in a wanton wrap and served with mango salsa. Great pairing.
I'm glad to be back in Phoenix :-)
