Since moving to Arizona, I have found it difficult to find "mom and pop" shops in the East Valley. Imagine my delight when a coworker directed me to The Bread Basket. This is a quaint, privately owned bakery that has excellent customer service and delivers a fantastic product. My husband and I chose this bakery to make our wedding cake and we were not disappointed. We ordered a three tier square cake. It was a marble cake with fresh raspberry filling...no fruit preserves allowed. It was delicious and beautiful, exactly what we had wanted. One of the owners, Brenda, delivered the cake to our venue herself. Since then, we order a miniature version of our cake on every anniversary and continue to enjoy the baking bonanza at The Bread Basket.
