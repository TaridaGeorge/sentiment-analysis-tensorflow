The BEST TEA SHOP on the planet!!!  Super knowledgeable and warm staff.  It's as if this tea shop were in a small town because the staff knows EVERY customer's name.  They aren't pushy with sales either because the tea speaks for itself!!  I have been to many tea shops in my day and I have to say that I have never experienced such a down to earth and authentic shop as Souvia, not to mention such quality tea for such a great price!!
