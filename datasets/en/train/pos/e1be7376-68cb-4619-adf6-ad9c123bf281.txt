this is probably 1 of the best Chinese restaurants in the valley it's definitely authentic dim sum. They also a lot of fresh seafood in live tanks.  I have been there 3 times for the dim sum and it has been excellent every time.  I want to order an entree off the menu as it looks very good also.  Only 1 complaint last time.  the duck was cold and a bit too salty.  I still have to give the food 5 stars.
