Great new place near Desert Ridge! You've gotta try it! And for all those who are  environmentally aware  they are all organic, locally grown and don't even have paper towels in the bathroom. They even have an extensive gluten free menu. Breakfast/lunch/dinner.  TRY THE SWEET POTATO TOTS, the fresh squeezed (while you wait) Orange Juice and the Creme Brule ....OMG!  Will go back over and over again!  Great place :)
