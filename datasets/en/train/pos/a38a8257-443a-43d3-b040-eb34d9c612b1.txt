We try to come here at least once a week for their happy hour specials, we can't get enough of the fish tacos and spicy cilantro wings! The service has always been excellent, our servers have been attentive and knowledgeable each time. The restaurant is beautiful, last week we were lucky enough to sit on the patio, it was a perfectly lovely evening!
