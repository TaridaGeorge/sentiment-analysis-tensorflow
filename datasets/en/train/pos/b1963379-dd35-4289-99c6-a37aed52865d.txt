I love this place!  We've been going for years and the burgers are great!  The tuna sandwich is great too and the salads are huge!  I wouldn't describe it as a 'greasy spoon'...maybe a diner or cafe or mom and pop place would be more accurate.  I think if you go, you'll go back again and again!  Fun place to watch the small planes and have a great meal at a reasonable price!  The waitresses are really friendly and good!
