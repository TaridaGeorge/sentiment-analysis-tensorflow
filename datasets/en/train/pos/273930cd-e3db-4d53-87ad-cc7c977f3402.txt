Cupcakes are to die for! Butter creme frosting is the best in town.  I don't see how anyone can not love this place.  Yes the cupcakes are a lil overpriced 3.25 a piece but its totally a little bit of heaven.  I took my Grandma who is the ultimate cupcake critic (like all grandmas)  and she couldn't believe how light the cake was and rich the frosting is.  Simply the best.
