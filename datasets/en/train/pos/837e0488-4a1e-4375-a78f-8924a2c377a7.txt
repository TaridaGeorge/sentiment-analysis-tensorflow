Wonderful food, great ambiance, fabulous service!  This could be my new favorite place for breafast/brunch. We both had the ham quiche and oh my was it ever yummy!  The mini-croissants and jam were just as good.  The complimentary chocoate cake with vanilla ice cream rounded out a perfect meal.  And the price can't be beat - $22 for two meals and drinks.  I'm heading back next weekend!!
