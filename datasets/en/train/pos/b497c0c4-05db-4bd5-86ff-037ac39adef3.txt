I really dig this place!  The only problem with the U.S. Egg is that it is too far from my house.  I love that their pancakes are whole wheat!  I can find no other breakfast places that are "fiber-friendly"  with their 'cake stacks.  If I wanted a stack of average white pancakes I would save some money and Bisquick!  Their protein pancakes are sweeeet!  They are hearty, filling and tasty!  I wish that I could give an honest eval. on the rest of their menu but I am strictly monogamous with the Protein Pancakes.  This place is not your ordinary pancake hut!
