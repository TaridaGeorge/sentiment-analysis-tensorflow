My favorite two items were side dishes.  Au gratin taters, half crispy half moist.  Fantastic.  Butternut squash polenta.  Delish.

Dad's burger was done perfectly.  The Schreiner's sausage pizza was enough for two and really tasty.  Mom's eggplant stack-o-lasagna was my favorite, and presented beautifully.

Didn't try salads or seafood.  But what we got was great, and the service was excellent.  Decor is modern and comfortable.  All in all a really nice, relaxing evening, reasonably-priced and worth a return visit.  So nice to have good food in the hood.

edit: ten visits later and never disappointed.  bumping to five stars.  pork chop, burgers, veggie sides, everything's fantastic.
