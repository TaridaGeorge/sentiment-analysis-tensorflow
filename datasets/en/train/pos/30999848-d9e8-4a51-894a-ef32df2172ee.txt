Just returned from a Sunday afternoon of bloody mary's, wings, fries, and football. The holy trinity. Oops, I guess I'm a little over three things needed for a trinity. Oh well. Needless to say I wasn't rooting for Tebow! 

The wings here are amazing. We ordered them medium honey BBQ and they could have been a touch hotter for my taste, but I wasn't complaining. The crispiness of the skin was perfect. We ordered a dozen but filled up with 5 wounded soldiers still on the plate. These wings weren't skimpy, y'all. 

The service was awesome and the TVs were perfectly spaced out for prime viewing. 

Now if you'll excuse me I need a nap. 

Did I mention the Bloody Mary bar? With blue cheese stuffed olives? No, well you might see me there next Sunday.
