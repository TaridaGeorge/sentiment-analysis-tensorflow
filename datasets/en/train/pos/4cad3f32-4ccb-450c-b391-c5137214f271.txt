We stopped in here one night looking for dinner that strayed away from our usual fare of home cookin' or fast Mexican food and Maui Dog EXCEEDED our expectations!  

The seemingly unusual combinations of meat and fruit were matched perfectly and the flavors are unbelievable!  We got huge dogs, three sliders, a large tot and drink for less than $20.  

We had plenty of food and not only were our bellies happy, but our taste buds and brains were happy to have a chance to stretch their legs!  

I can't WAIT to go back!
