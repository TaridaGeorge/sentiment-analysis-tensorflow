With a line already at the door, one knows Ted's serves up some mighty yummy dogs. In addition, their "white hots" are fab, as well as their burgers. 
I'm not keen on their fries or onion rings, but that is just my personal taste...they are both fresh and the rings are home made.
The flavor of Ted's hotdogs are unmatched. 
Go!
