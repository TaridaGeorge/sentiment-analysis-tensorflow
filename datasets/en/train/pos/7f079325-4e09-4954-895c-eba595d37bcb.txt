Located in the Fry's shopping plaza just down from Dance Matrix, China Chef is where I order Chinese from in Queen Creek. The quality of the food is excellent and the wait time is short. I have always phoned in and picked up the order, although there are seats available if you choose to eat in the restaurant. 

I am basically a creature of habit and always order the same thing - General Tso (comes with rice & egg roll) and a small hot & sour soup. The combo dinner is $7 and the soup is $1.50. I typically finish the soup, but can only make it through half of the entree. Save it for a follow-up lunch and it is economical for 2 meals. The service and food quality has never let me down and I will continue to make this my primary choice in Queen Creek.
