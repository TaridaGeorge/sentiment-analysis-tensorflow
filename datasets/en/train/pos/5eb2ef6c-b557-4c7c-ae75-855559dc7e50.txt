ANOTHER YELP WIN!

awesome vegan brunch. the sis & I split the french toast & bfast burrito.  both were incredible.  tasty soy latte, too.

kids had all kinds of modifications & special requests- not a single eye was rolled.

love the sleek, modern decor. service was great. went on a Sunday at prime brunch time & there was no problem with the wait.
