Moderately-priced food with a beautiful outdoor brick-and-garden patio and simple dishes made with good quality, fresh ingredients. I had a proscuitto and mozzarella sandwich on some incredible homemade bread, similar to a ciabatta, of sorts. not really. Whatever - the point is, it's fresh and tastes amazing!
One downside - the lunch menu is pretty limited with just sandwiches and salads.
