Best Belgian waffles. Upon entering in my gym clothes I thought I was severely underdressed based on the fancier surroundings of the restaurant. Looking around however you can dress as you wish. After combing the city for Belgian waffles and golden corral breakfast only open on weekends I yelped for some waffles. FYI if you just type in waffles waffle fries is what will be searched so make sure you're specific:) the waffles were fluffy, big and the strawberries were fresh. The warm syrup put it over the top.
