Absolutely some of the best customer service I have ever received.

I recently purchased a fish tank and needed my second wave of set up materials (equipment, chemicals, etc.). Ashley (sales associate) in the fish department was amazingly helpful. She worked with me to get everything I needed. She explained how to use things and educated me further on tank care.

On top of that, she helped me find a dog product I was looking for.

I have a choice between a few PetSmarts but I will be returning to this one for all of my fish needs!
