I've taken all my vehicles to SAA and Moon since 1997. I don't go anywhere else. Honest as the day is long and hot (in Arizona). 
You might not get the little conveniences like a loaner car or a nice waiting room, but what you will get are honest mechanics who are detail oriented and knowledgable. 
I used to have an antique truck and Moon and company were the only ones who touched it. The truck ran perfectly while I had it( so do all of my vehicles). Don't go anywhere else with your vehicle, not matter what make and model you have. 
Oh, and if Moon can't fix your vehicle, he will tell you ( but that won't happen). I highly recommend this business, even if it costs you a little inconvenience.
