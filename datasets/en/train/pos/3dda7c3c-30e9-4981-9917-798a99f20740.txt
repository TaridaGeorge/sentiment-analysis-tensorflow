In town for business, and came to Pappadeaux's for dinner...what a great experience.  Hostess, wait staff, and servers were all outstanding.  The food was amazing.  Perfectly cooked vegetables to accompany the Costa Rican Mahi.  Ice cold beer on a hot, 102 degree day was a welcome addition!

Although we later found out our waiter was in training (it was his first day), he was attentive, professional, and available to answer any questions we had.

Highly recommended.
