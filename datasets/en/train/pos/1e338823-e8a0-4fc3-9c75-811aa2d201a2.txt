I have been to the Camelback location - This place has a serious selection and great prices!! 
I usually visit pre-season ( NOW!) or post-season for the best deals on pants, hats and gloves - some of the necessities that I am not too picky about.
I visit here to get my daughter's snowboard pants (every year!!) She's growing like a weed so our friends are getting great hand-me-downs in the meantime!!
