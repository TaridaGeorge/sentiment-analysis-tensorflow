Easily my favorite place to sling back some late night cocktails in the entire Phoenix-Mesa-Glendale Metropolitan Statistical Area.

I like the staff, and they seem to tolerate me at just about all Defcon levels of toxicity and still welcome me the next time without grudges -- yet.

While I don't usually get very adventurous with my drink, I have to say, they make an excellent Old Fashioned -- and I seem to remember enjoying a really good Hot Tottie during the holidays.

If frozen margaritas are what you are looking for, don't even bother showing up -- I don't think they have a blender.

It's never empty, usually filled with interesting looking and sounding people, and thankfully, they usually pick out good tunes on the jukebox for me.
