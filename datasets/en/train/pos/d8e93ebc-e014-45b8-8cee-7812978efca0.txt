My roommate came home the other night with a Chocolate Cream pie and oh. my goodness! It is AMAZING! The crust is this wonderful crunchy chocolately wonderfulness. I think she bought a Groupon and I don't know how much she paid but the pie was so good, regardless of full price, I'm sure it's worth it!
