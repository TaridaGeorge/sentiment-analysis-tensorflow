The Junk Guys were awesome. I had a home remodel to complete in two weeks - this included demolition of a kitchen and two bathrooms. I initially was going to get a dumpster and have it picked up a week later. After doing some research, it was much less expensive to use The Junk Guys. 

I liked that they were a locally based company, and I really enjoyed that I didn't have to have a dumpster parked in front of the house for a week, nor did I have to load it myself! After two separate trips (kitchen cabinets, old counters, sheet vinyl, remnants of two gutted bathrooms), the cost was still well below what other companies were charging for a small dumpster or one load hauled away.

They were professional, personable, and punctual. Highly recommended!
