Quality products at prices that are better or comparable to the big box stores.  The best things is that you are supporting a local company and not some huge chain.  The owners are knowledgeable and friendly.  If you have a cat, dog or horse, put your "loyality" cards away because at Tempe Feed, they remember their loyal customers by their faces.
