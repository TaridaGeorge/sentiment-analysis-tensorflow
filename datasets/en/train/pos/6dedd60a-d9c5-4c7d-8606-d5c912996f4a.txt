Absolutely my favorite pizza on the planet, and I've had zillions.  It's not any one thing that stands out, it's everything: the just-right crispy, thin crust, cooked quickly at some insanely hot temperature in their brick oven, their sweet sauce, the fresh toppings, the layered-on (not grated) mozzarella (which is actually cooked UNDER the sauce, we've been told). I like to plop down at the bar and chow down right there, while sucking down a cocktail. Staff always friendly and prompt.  I've had better experiences here than in Scottsdale or the new location in Gilbert.. Scottsdale has too many tables jammed very close together, and something's just not quite the same with the pizza in both other places, though it's very close. Can't recommend this place highly enough, I could  eat there 3-4 times a week!
