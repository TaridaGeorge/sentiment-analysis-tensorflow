This Starbucks location just opened a couple weeks ago about 1 minute from my house but yesterday was the first time I actually made a trip by.  I used the drive thru and the person asked right away what they could get for me and repeated my order back to me to make sure it was right, which it was.  When I pulled up to the window the girl there was super friendly with a big smile which always puts me in a good mood.  My drink was ready right away and I was on my merry way.  I will definitely be making this Starbucks a part of my routine!
