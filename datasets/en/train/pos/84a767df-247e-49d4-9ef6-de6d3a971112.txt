I've been going to this Fry's location on a regular basis for over 10 years and I've never had a bad experience. The cashier's are all super friendly, as are the greeters, and courtesy clerks. They almost always have extra lanes open so long lines don't form and the store is very clean. There is also a Wells Fargo inside this location. The unfortunate thing about this location is it is a stand alone store so there isn't any other business's, other than the Wells Fargo, in the shopping center. There is a Walmart, a Jimmy Johns, and a CVS across the street, and they also just put in a Fry's Gas Station. What ever your needs are this Fry's will have it and they'll get you in and out quickly
