I love Gabriel. He does an amazing job every single time I'm there. I generally get two peekaboo highlights put in, and a cut and style, and always leaving looking great. His attitude is always upbeat, it would be impossible to spend any time in his chair and not leave in a good mood. The salon is always clean and comfortable. I never feel like I'm being forced into spending more money or buying product, but when I have a question about what I should be using in my hair Gabe always makes excellent suggestions. I have recommended him a good friend and my mother and both love him. My mother even left her stylist of 10 years to start going to him because of the excellent service he provides.
