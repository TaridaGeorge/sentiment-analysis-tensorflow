This might be my new favorite night spot. The music wasn't too loud. The drinks were on point, and the staff was legendary.

I have been back many times, and have enjoyed each time more than the time prior.  I have eaten the food (perhaps the best Tuna in town).  I have gone on a Saturday night when it is packed, and on a Sunday night when Mad Men and live music is playing.  Each time seems to be better than the last. 

I am happy to add Mabel's to my local watering holes.  Hopefully they don't try to change.  Old Town doesn't need another carbon copy bar.
