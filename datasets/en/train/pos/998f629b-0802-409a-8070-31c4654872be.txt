They sell a stimulant from South America and are called "Cartel."

A joke's hiding in there, somewhere. 

Stopped by for the first time today. It wasn't easy to find, but that made it fun.  (Look in the BACK of the shopping center). I'm sure it's easy to miss!

All I have to say about my visit is... DAMN these guys serve a great cuppa joe. One of the best I've had. Ever.
