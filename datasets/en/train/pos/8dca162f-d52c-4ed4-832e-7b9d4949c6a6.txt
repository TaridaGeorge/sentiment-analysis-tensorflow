Great crowd and fun place for locals!!! Tried this place out a couple weeks ago on a whim and must have picked the right night to go. Friendly bartender and great music through out the night.  The drink price were definitely fair and cocktails were good.  I wouldn't go here all the time, but it is nice bar that avoids a lot of the scottsdale bar scene if you want to get away from that.....
