Easily my favorite restaurant of all time and I've been a lot of places....from the amazing seafood tower with dry ice for presentation to the bone in ribeye,  the creamed corn that is amazing, the succulent mashed potatos all the way to the warm butter cake....OMG...nothing gets better than this....and dont forget a great Dirty Martini!
