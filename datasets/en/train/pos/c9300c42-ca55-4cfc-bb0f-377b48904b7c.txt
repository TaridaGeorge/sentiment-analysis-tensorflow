Amazing place to go to in Scottsdale. Mastro's never seems to let me down. I am also a big fan of Oceans Club but City Hall is closer to my house. The atmosphere is fun and inviting. But be sure to dress up.
Now to the food. Everything was prepared flawlessly. I had the Tuna which was delicious and my man had the bone in filet. If you had to choose just one side to order hands down it would have to be the lobster mashed potatoes! Yummy!!
