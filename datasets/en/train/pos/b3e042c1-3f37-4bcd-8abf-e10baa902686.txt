Passed by this new store as I was coming back from the Home Depot on Thomas. WOW! Did they ever pull out all the stops with this store! You have to see this one as the manager told me its called a "Flagship" store. This thing is HUGE! Another drive-thru with ample parking and tons of seating inside and out. D&D has really improved their image big time in Phoenix and this store says it all.  A+ on customer service once again and the coffee was stellar. I tried the new Berries N' Cream donuts which was very good I must say. All in all another great location and amazing store....If you like Dunkin you need to see this store!
