our last stop on the pub ride and we needed some food. luckily, bungalows was close by and they serve food late. 

we sat outside on the patio which is always great in our night time weather. we were served almost immediately and had our water glasses filled thoroughly. 

i had the halibut sandwich and it was crispy sweet on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. the salty, crispy fries hit the spot as well. my wife had the veggie burger and was pleased as well. our friend had the cajun ahi tuna and it must have been good because it was in his belly in about 5 minutes flat!

a great establishment in a great part of town. we need to come here more often.
