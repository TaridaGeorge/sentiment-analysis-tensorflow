Great italian food.  Fresh, home made pasta.  Great Pizzas.  Real italian flavor, not americanized.  One of the best pizza places I've been to in the country.

Also worth noting that this restaurant is actually an old home that was re-purposed.  The have several rooms inside which each accommodate an individual group.  However, when the weather is nice, the "front yard" is the place to enjoy your wonderful meal.
