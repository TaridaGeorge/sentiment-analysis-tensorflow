Oh, Ice Tango... why do I love thee?

1. The small is freaking huge. I have a hard time imagining eating more.

2. The tart is surprisingly tart- and sooo very refreshing. What an awesome pick-me-up!

3. The fresh fruit additions are marvelous- my diced strawberries were so generously scooped into my cup that I had more strawberries than fro-yo at the end of my serving.

4. It is less than 3 miles from my new job. I may just make this a regular on-the-way-home treat. With so few calories involved, could you fault me?
