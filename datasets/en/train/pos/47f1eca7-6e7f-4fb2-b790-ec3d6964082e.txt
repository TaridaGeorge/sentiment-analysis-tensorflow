Friday at 3pm I called Honey Moon Sweets to order a birthday cake for Saturday.  They were super accomodating and helped me with my selection.   I ordered their classic fruit and shavings birthday cake with white cake, strawberry bavarian cream filling and whipped cream frosting.   The cake looked absolutely incredible and impressed all of our guests.  But the best part was the taste.   Great moist cake with lovely fresh fruit and great flavor.   All of our foodie friends from San Francisco who were visiting raved!  Thanks for putting the icing on the cake of our party!
