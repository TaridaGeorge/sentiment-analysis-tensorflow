Just saw the Christmas day game Cardinals vs Cowboys. Being there to cheer on the Cowboys you would think one might have a tough time. I would like to say the Cardinals fans were first class all the way. Very fun bunch of people who were very hospitable. The stadium is one of the best I have ever been to. Our seats were in the end zone in the first row (which certainly didn't hurt the experience) the facility is very well laid out. Anyone who complains about the food/drink prices obviously hasn't been to a sporting event/concert in Southern California.
