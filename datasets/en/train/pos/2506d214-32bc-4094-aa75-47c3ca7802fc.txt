Tricks is the only worthwhile option for fresh, creative fine dining level food in downtown Tempe.  The location is tucked away in a lovely old house, really two I think, with tables sprinkled in a lovely garden which is touched with artistic elements.  The house itself is very intimate, with brightly colored walls and warm atmosphere. 

The food is seasonal and inventive.  Each course we had brought beautiful presentation and touches of character.  The wine list is well thought out and the waiter really knew how to suit a wine with our tastes.

Excellent experience, can't wait to have the occasion to return!
