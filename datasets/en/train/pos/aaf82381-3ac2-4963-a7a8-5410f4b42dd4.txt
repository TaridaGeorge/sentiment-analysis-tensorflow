I'm constantly pleased by the quality of food coming from here, and am never let down when it comes to service. As a tip, if you place your order "to go", make sure you keep the containers as they are quite durable and reusable to take your lunch to work in. As for the amount of food you receive, I bet you can always have 1/2 or a little less left over for another meal 90% of the time.
