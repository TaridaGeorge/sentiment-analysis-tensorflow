Fez is such a hip, cool place. I love it so much -  I even had my book release party there last year. Thomas, the manager is such a peach, such a joy to have around, and if you're lucky enough to get Chad as your waiter, you're in for a treat. He's sweet, gorgeous, funny and treats you like royalty.
Try: the hummus, and the Ceasar salad. Fabulous!
