I have had the occasion to visit you pub a few times.  Being a local pub owner, I must say you have some great people there.  Both customers and staff alike.  If I did not live in North Scottsdale, you would see way to much of me.  Some of my good friends are always there.  So much so I can't get them to my pub:)  It's all good.  Keep up the good work and thanks for making your place feel welcoming and warm.
