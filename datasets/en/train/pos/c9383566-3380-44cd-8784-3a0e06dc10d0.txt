Have you ever been to one of the restaurants where the food is consistently good?  I guess you wouldn't keep going if it wasn't....but I digress.  I have never had a disappointing meal here...down to the last morsel.  I went there this past weekend and this really cool waiter told my friends and I about one of those "in the know" dishes called Dancing Shrimp.  It's supposed to be amazing.  Ask for it next time if you want to look really cool...or like you just go there too much.  Enjoy!  Also, it's really inexpensive for Scottsdale.  Four of us ate dinner for about $18 per person, including a shared appetizer and four entrees.
