Flew in on a business trip and asked the front desk for a recommendation on a Chinese delivery joint. Called Golden Eggroll, one of the best take out places I've been to. Had the twice cooked pork ( I always get it to compare), savory, rich and spicy. Loaded with veggies and nice helping of "fried rice". The rice was just plain and not your typical loaded fried rice but paired well with the pork. Biggish portion and came with an eggroll and some fried wontons for 8 bucks. Highly recommended !!!!
