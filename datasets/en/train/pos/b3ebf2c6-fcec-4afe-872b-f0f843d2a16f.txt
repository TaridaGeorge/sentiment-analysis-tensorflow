So I decided to do yoga stretch on Monday.  Boy is that a workout. 

First of all, bring your own yoga mat.  Bigger then the pads provided. 

Second, don't be too out of shape like I am.  Not that I'm grotesquely out of shape, I was sweating like there was no tomorrow.  Which leads me to my third and final point.

Stay hydrated.  Your in Arizona so you should know this by now, but this will definitely dehydrate you if your not careful.

The class overall is excellent and the instructor could tell I was a noob and helped me out with my form so i didn't help myself.  I will be back again, just after I lose the beer belly.
