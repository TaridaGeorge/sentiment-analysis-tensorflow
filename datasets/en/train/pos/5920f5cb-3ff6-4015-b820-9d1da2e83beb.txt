Dropped by the other afternoon while I was visiting family in Phoenix. Had a glass of red wine, but really would have preferred a mixed drink. The cost of the wine plus the movie ticket came to the cost of just the movie back on Long Island. The bartender/owner was very pleasant and engaging. Once inside the theater (love the fact that you can carry your wine in), there were just a few coming attractions, and all of them were for movies that I'd like to see. The feature film was spot on - a documentary about the life of Phil Ochs. It left me feeling sad because we could use Phil Ochs now more than ever. In all, this is a very positive thing for Phoenix.
