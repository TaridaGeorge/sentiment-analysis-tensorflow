Two things I am not...your typical Sam Fox food disciple and the type of person who would seek out healthy food.  So True food Kitchen,  is not the the type of face I would inhereantly rave about.  However, I am open minded and I do love a great product and service, so True truly nails it.  It is well documented that the food is great, match that with attentive, crisp, knowledgible service and hip yet comfortable dining room and this place rocks.  After a couple of visits it is now definately on my regular rotation.
