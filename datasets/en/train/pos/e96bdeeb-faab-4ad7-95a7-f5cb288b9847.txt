Food City is terrific!  When you go (and you should) think "fresh" - skipping the jars, cans, and prepackaged stuff.  The food moves (not literally of course, but out the door in the bags of paying customers).  Always, always fresh!  The meat counter is the best in all of Chandler with cuts not found in other stores (you can buy steak anywhere).  The same can be said of the produce, and if you want fresh tortillas - this is your place.  Great prices too.  Don't be "put off" upon entering the store.  Fluency in Spanish is not a prerequisite.  Fresh fire roasted green chiles from Hatch (the chile capital of the world,) a Mariachi Band, and the cafe, all make shopping here an experience.  Great food, low prices...you just gotta' go!
