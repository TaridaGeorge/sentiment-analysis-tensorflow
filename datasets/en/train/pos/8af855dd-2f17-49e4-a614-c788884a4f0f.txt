This place is so strange looking but the food was great. It seems to be a diner that was converted into a Thai place but all the original diner furniture and stuff is still there.

The food was delicious, though, despite the weird setting. I had the drunken noodle lunch special and my friend had the red curry. Both were hot, fresh, and had a wide variety of vegetables which was very nice. The drunken noodles had the perfect amount of seasoning and slightly charred, smoky tasting noodles, while the red curry was bright and the Thai hot really was spicy. Thai iced tea was also nice and a good accompaniment to all the flavors going on in our meal.

I will try it again for sure if I am in the area.
