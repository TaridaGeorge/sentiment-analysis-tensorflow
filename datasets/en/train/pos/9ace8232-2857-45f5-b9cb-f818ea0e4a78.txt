Best sushi I've ever had!

It's so fresh, it's so melt-in-your mouth delicious, it's pretty much the best sushi I've had the pleasure of trying.

Our party ordered lots of salmon, lots of tuna, and my all time favorite, lots of yellowtail.  We also had a variety of rolls too.  Everything, from the appetizer to the sushi was omnomnom.

The seaweed salad was perfectly seasoned, probably the best I've had.  The fish was generously and perfectly cut.  I'm usually not a fan of tuna, but the tuna was so delicious, I ate lots of it.  Obviously I stuffed myself with salmon and yellowtail nigiri.

I'm pretty sure I gained 20lbs after gobbling up everything.
