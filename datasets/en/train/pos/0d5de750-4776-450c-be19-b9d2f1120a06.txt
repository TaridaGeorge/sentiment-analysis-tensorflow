We went to Baker nursery on Sunday...I had a lot of questions and we needed quite a few things for the yard. I was very impressed! A very friendly and super knowledgeable lady named Bonnie helped us. She was patient and explained things and answered my million questions! She was honest and made suggestions to help me save some $ while still getting the look i wanted - this was muy bueno!!
We left about 30 min later with all of my questions answered and lots of supplies.
Thanks Bonnie & we will def be going back to Baker Nursery!!
