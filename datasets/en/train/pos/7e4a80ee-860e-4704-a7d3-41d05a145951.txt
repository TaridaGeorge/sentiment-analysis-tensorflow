I love this Barber Shop.  Other shops are charging $30 or $40 or more for a good hair cut/trim, but David nails it for only $13.  He knows who I am on sight, he remembers my haircut, and he gets it done quickly.  To top it off, he shaves my neck with a straight razor and hot lather, and he even scissor trims my old-man eyebrows.  I highly recommend this barber shop if you're in need of a quality cut for a great price.
