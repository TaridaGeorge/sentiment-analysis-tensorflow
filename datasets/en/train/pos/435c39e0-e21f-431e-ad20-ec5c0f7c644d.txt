I'm finally shocked! No one has reviewed Nick's on FLW? Okay, here goes!

In short I love Nick's 99% of the time. The 1% I don't like it we get stuck eating at one of the "two  chair" tables in the middle. Not my favorite. The food on the other hand is great, especially the pizza.

My partner and I have eaten here enough that Nick recognizes us and always sends over an order of Bruschetta. Delicious. We've sampled just about everything on the menu and can't say we've had anything awful. Some of the pasta dishes could be a little better (Penne w/Pesto is one) but all in all the food is very good.

Make sure you save room for dessert. The Chocolate Chip Cannoli is to die for.
