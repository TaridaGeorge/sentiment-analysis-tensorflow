This is honestly one of my favorite restaurants and breweries in the whole world. The beer is outstanding, affordable, and the seasonals are always well-stocked. And there's no end to my enthusiasm for the beer-battered chicken strips and chipotle mayo - sometimes this meal can be life-changing. I've never been to the Scottsdale location, but the Tempe restaurant is wide-open, with a rustic brick ambiance that makes you feel right at home and ready to get stuffed and loaded. The only negative is that they don't distribute Kilt Lifter to Austin! Cheers!
