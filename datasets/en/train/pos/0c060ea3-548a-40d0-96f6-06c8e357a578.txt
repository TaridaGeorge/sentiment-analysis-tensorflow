AMAZING!

I had no idea this even existed. What rock was I living under when I lived in Phoenix for 3 years? I mean, MY GAWD! This place is super cool. From the concept and vibe to the menu and coffee.... wowza. I was so impressed with this place, I could not be happier. 

Their coffee is divine. 
The veggie egg scrambler I had was beyond spectacular. 
And just sitting inside, chilling on a summer morning, you felt like you hadn't a care in the world. It was so inviting, with open windows overlooking Agritopia. 

I was thrilled when my friend took me here. I can't rave about this place enough. 

Oh, except, where was the recycle bins? That's the only thing this place is lacking.
