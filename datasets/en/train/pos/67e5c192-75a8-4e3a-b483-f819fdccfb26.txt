We've been here several times for lunch/dinner and IT IS AWESOME. Absolutely our favorite place for a quick cheap meal. They are always so sweet to my daughter and they bring out our food fast. I highly recommend their pork fried rice, we ordered it last time we went and it was better than any fried rice I've ever had. Not too greasy and not overly salty, it was flavorful and for $5 we got enough for all three of us and took leftovers home. We never spend more than $15 or so and always have enough for another meal at home. We love it so much that we'll be taking my parents here when they come visit so they can see how awesome it is too :)
