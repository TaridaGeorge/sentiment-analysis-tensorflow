I love Switch. I really do. In fact, it makes my boyfriend jealous.
Came here last night, again. Monday nights are $5.55 burgers and $3 house cab or chardonnay.
I got the veggie burger, added the individual side of hummus ( I LOVE their hummus!), also got a mixed fry basket (half sweet potato, half wedge) and a blackberry kir royale ($6).
This is my go-to restaurant.
Weekends are $3 carafes bloody mary's or $6 carafes mimosas. Oh, and the breakfast burrito- they must put addictive substances in it because something so simple should not be so sublime.
Go!
