My family and I had our first experience at Los Reyes de la Torta this weekend.  I must admit, we had never heard of it before watching "Man vs. Food".  We knew immediately we had to try it.  What we got was a real treat!  The food and the service are amazing!  Of course, I had to try the famous Del Ray Torta.  It is HUGE!  My daughter and I spilt it.  
It was probably one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life!
We can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu.  All the employees were so friendly.  Our server checked on us several times.  Service with a smile is something that you will find here!!  If you are looking for authentic, amazing Mexican food, then look no further! :-)
