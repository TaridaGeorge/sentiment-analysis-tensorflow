I would agree that it is hard to go wrong with froyo but I absolutely do not think all frozen yogurts are created equal.  Yogurtology is head and shoulders above the rest!  Imagine starting your yogurt creation with a tempting "bottoming" like a moon pie, brownie, or graham cracker crumbs, next add the smoothest, creamiest, most flavorful frozen yogurt ever created, and finish off your delight with any number of topping from the huge topping bar!  Not only that, Yogurtology is immaculately clean at all times and has very good customer service too!

My frozen yogurt habit is definitely on the ridiculous side of things and when I say I LOVE Yougurtology it is an understatement.

P.S. if you have been to Yogurtology and you did not at least sample the Oatmeal Cookie you have not been to Yogurtology...I advise going back now!
