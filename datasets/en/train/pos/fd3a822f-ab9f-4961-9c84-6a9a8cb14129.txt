Oh Yea, some great Chinese Food on the WAY east side of the Valley! No, really, its WAY east of the valley but worth the drive, really, it is...!

I love me some great Chinese Food but compared to what I've had in Europe, most of the restaurants around the valley just don't compare BUT Chen's is dead on!

The flavors are spot on, the portions are great, atmosphere is nice and relaxing and the service is the most friendliest you will ever experience (just make sure you speak clear English)...
