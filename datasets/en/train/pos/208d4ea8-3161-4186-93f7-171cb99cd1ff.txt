PSH!!!! YC has nothing on Genghi! here are my reasons why:

-fresh, not frozen protein
-way better veggie options
-seasonings- PURELY genius! i LOVE the option of seasonings, sauces or a mixture of both. genghi's makes all of these options available with my fav section of seasonings
-eggs- genius! 

and i'm sure this isn't just Genghi's but i love that they'll cook your food in water instead of oil. 

$10 for two meals worth of food. i lurve it!
