Ah, to the many countless nights I have spent here soaking up what I refer to as "the best drinks in the valley" hands down. To the mornings I have spent recovering from similar nights.  Hulas will always be on the tip of my tongue the second someone ask "where should we go in Central Phoenix?"  

The fish cakes are amazing, as is everything else.  The service is incredible.  The ladies there make sure I am never empty handed (even if that means delivering it to me while I get distracted hitting on certain people ::clears throat:: Dana)

Hula's is where I typically bring my first dates, just ask the servers I'm sure they will attest.  I have held my last two birthday parties here and they are always more than accommodating.  

Whether is brunch, lunch, dinner or drinks you can't go wrong here.
