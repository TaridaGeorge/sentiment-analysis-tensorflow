I've been going to this location for a long while now. I'm a huge fan of sushi and in the 7 years we've been going to this Kona we have never had a bad experience. My husband and I love the patio seating. It's great to just sit back, relax and have a nice afternoon lunch or casual dinner. If you are a fan of sushi I highly recommend that Dragon Roll.
