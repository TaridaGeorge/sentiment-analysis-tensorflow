I went to the Desert Botanical Garden by myself the other day and had a blast! I used the complimentary audio tour and followed the path, stopping to listen to the interesting tid-bits as I went. I also went to the butterfly pavilion and watched the butterflies fly around eating and sunbathing, which is a very relaxing experience. All the people who work at the Garden were very nice, knowledgeable and friendly. If you don't have anything to do one day, I would definitely suggest going to Garden, even if you're by yourself (and they have student discounts!).
