Pepper Palace is hot sauce heaven. They offer hundreds of salsas, hot sauces, wing sauces, bbq sauces and other spicy treats. They also offer samples of many that you can try in the shop on chip fragments. I LOVE this shop and will be a regular visitor. I started with a locally made version of a Tapatio-style hot sauce and I also snagged a blackberry BBQ sauce that is bursting with flavor. This is located in Scottsdale Fashion Square on the top floor near Dillards.
