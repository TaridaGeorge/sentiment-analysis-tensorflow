Outstanding Spring Training locale. Padres share this facility with the Mariners, and the folks who staff the place during spring baseball are some of the nicest folks you'll ever meet. Lots of practice fields, and access to players. If you're an autograph seeker, or just a fan of the game, this is a really unique (and at times surreal) experience. Great for young kids.

The fare at this park is the best of all spring training locations. They've got it all, and the layout is much more family-friendly than other parks. Lots of grass, shaded dining areas, and fun stuff for kids to play on/around.
