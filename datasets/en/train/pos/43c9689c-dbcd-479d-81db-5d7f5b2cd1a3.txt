This is a newer LA Fitness and located on the corner of University & Stapley. I regularly go to 6 different LA Fitnesses each week and this is the best of all of them. The machines are top of the line with an entire row + of treadmills. Each has a digital readout and a television if you want to watch while running. The spin room is amazing with the instructor on the floor and multiple rows of bikes in a stadium seating layout. I go for the Tuesday 5:45 zumba with Scheyla. Get there early because the room gets filled to capacity each week.
