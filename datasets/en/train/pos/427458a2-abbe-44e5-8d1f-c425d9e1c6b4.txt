This is aunique place and not much else I have come across is like this. The food was very good, the staff was helpful, friendly and on top of things plus they elicit the "Alice Cooper" image in a very accurate way (although they did a not bring me a snake-thank God). Rock N Roll, Food, and Sports are 3 of my 4 favorite things that AC has. If you are thinking of going here or not GO! why deny yourself a very necessary experience in life!
