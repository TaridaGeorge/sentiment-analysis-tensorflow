I finally found a gyno I liked! And then he gave up his practice. And then he took it up again. And then I moved... 

We all know how it is trying to find the right doctor, specifically the right gynecologist. I don't know about you, but once I find a good one, I will drive. And I do drive for Dr. Brodkin- from Chandler. 

Dr. Tara Brodkin is young, friendly, a good listener, and above all extremely professional. She is willing to answer patients' questions over the phone. She is patient with those patients who might spend too much time on Web, MD and self- diagnose on their blackberries while in her waiting room. 
The office is a nice place to be; the waiting room is well kept and welcoming. The staff are friendly and accommodating. 

I highly recommend Dr. Tara Brodkin.
