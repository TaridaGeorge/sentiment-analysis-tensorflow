GREAT! We found this restaurant near our hotel (the Westin Kierland Villas) on Yelp.  Read the great reviews and decided to try it.  Our family of 4 (our daughters are 11 and 8) went without a reservation.  Turns out the reviews are absolutely right!  Though it's wildly popular, they were able to find us a spot at the bar (which was a memorable experience for our girls who, being from Washington State, can't step foot in a bar), where we had an amazing dinner with service that was as good as the food.  Our 11 year old daughter, an aficionado of ravioli :) , thought this was the most delicious ravioli she'd ever tasted.  (I agree! It's right up there with the best. The chicken parmigiana and spaghetti pomodoro were excellent, too!)  We were extremely happy with the whole experience and will definitely go back!
