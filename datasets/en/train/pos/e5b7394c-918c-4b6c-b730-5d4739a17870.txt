I LOVE SCHLOTZKYS!  

There, I said it.  I don't know why these don't outnumber Quizno's and Subway. The bread and bread choices kick butt.  Can you get sourdough at those places?  How 'bout dark rye bread?  Any rye bread?  NO!

I try and stop by this or any Schlotzky's every chance I get.  I just wish there was one closer to my house (Arrowhead).
