For years I would always go to Lowe's or Home Depot first because I thought they'd have larger selections and better prices, but then I found that in many cases Ace was cheaper.  Even better, I can find things (or find out they don't have it) in a fraction of the time because their employees are helpful and accessible.  Lots of times Ace carries items that the other stores don't, especially hardware.  Now I always go to Ace first because if they have it, I am in and out in a flash.
