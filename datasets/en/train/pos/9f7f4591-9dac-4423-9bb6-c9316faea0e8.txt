On a sunny, winter day, there's nothing like a scoop of Baskin-Robbins ice cream. Seriously so many flavors to choose from. Now they even have frozen/soft-serve yogurt.

Two of my favorite flavors are World Class Chocolate (which I'll buy a pint or quart to go) and Mint Chocolate Chip.

I wish they had more flavors in their pre-packaged section.

The shop is clean and the workers here are pleasant.
