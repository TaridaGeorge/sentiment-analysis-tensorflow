REALLY friendly, great with the dogs and the prices are comparable to regular groomers. If you are sick of waiting 5 hours to pick up your dog then you are in luck. Not only was she on time, she crank out my two huge mutts in no time. I was shocked to hear the price. It was the SAME we pay at petsmart (wayyy better job than they ever did) without the annoyance of waiting all day to get them. My younger dog is out of control and slightly unbearable at times and she handled him with a smile. I plan to use this service on a regular basis and suggest you all do too!
