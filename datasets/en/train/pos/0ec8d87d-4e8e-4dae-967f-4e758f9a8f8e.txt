I will give this food store 5 starts not because they have neat shelves filled with mostly the same product you can find at any big supermarket  but because it's the only place where I buy meat and fish. I have 4 big stores in a 2 mile radius  but  I spend extra 15 minutes to drive to AJ's Fine Foods. I'm so glad I found out about this chain as they have the best selection of seafood and meat in Chandler + it's always fresh. It's not cheap though, but I'm willing to pay extra and enjoy my dinner instead of opening a package and wondering why it smells funny...

Note: How do you know if the meat you buy is fresh? Smell it, it should not smell at all. Same about fish - it should not smell fishy, oh no!
