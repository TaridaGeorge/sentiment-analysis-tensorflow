This QT located at 39th and Greenway is my favorite.  The staff are fast, friendly and the restrooms are always clean.  This QT is not nearly as busy as the others which makes it a more pleasant experience.  

My only gripe is that they charge .79 cents for a fountain drink ( 32oz ) when I can get a 44oz in a styrofoam cup at Circle K for the same price.

This QT is my QT of choice !
