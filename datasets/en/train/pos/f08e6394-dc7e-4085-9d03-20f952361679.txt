I don't always eat burger, but when I do I prefer SMASHBURGER.  There are a lot of good burger spots in town.  There are cheaper ones, high-end ones.  Smashburger falls in the middle, but is as good as  a high-end burger spot.  I got the Arizona burger.  Beef is high-quality, veggies are fresh, bread choices are good (you can get multi-grain bun).  I didn't get any sides.  I noticed on the menu that you can make your own burger by picking out the bread, the patty size, sauce, etc.
