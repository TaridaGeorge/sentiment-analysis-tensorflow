Needed some chairs done in a hurry, so I tried to reupholster myself with quick failure. I reluctantly looked on Craigslist to see if I could find someone in Chandler that could assist me or get it done quickly. I found the Covers Plus ad and called Rex (owner). I explained my job and my need for a quick turn around. 

Rex was able to accommodate my requested, I dropped the eight chairs off at my lunch hour and they were ready for pickup by the end of the day. I was completely impressed with his work, speediness, and customer service. I would use his services again and high recommend him to anyone I know.
