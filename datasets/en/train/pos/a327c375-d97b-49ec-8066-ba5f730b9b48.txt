I love Waffle House!
I grew up around the corner from the original Waffle House near Atlanta.

The eggs are always cook perfectly.  The hashbrowns are out of this world!  The sandwiches are yummy.

The best part is the waffle.  You can add pecans or chocolate chips.  You also have your choice as to the kind of waffle you get.

It is yummy, yummy!
