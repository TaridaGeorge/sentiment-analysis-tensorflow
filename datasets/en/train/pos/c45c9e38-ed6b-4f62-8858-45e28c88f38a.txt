The food here ROCKS!  I was a bit doubtful at 1st because this is a Kosher restaurant.  But I was hooked at 1st bite.  I've only had the chance to try a few of the dishes here, but it has all been very good.  The "garlic knots" a MUST.  The staff is super cool and very nice as well.  The complete dining experience.  I can't wait to get back there soon.
