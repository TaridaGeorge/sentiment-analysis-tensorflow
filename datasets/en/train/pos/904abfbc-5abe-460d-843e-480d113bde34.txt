I have used Aesthetic Creations three times for graphics on three different MINI's. The last time was in August 2011. I have found Mike to be easy to work with. Prompt at returning any inquires, creative with designs and to have fair prices. As these are custom designs I know it might take some time to design. Every time I have worked with him I have been satisfied will all areas of design, creation and installation. Always turning out perfect!  All of my communications with Mike were over the phone and via e-mail but he was always prompt and even sent me a mock up of the graphics.  I live in Colorado but will always go to him for any other graphic need I may have. 
Great guy and great company. :)
