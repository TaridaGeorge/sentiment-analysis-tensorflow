Although I have eaten at T Cooks, the restaurant, I haven't eaten at the bar as much. But, after my visit tonight I can say that the bar is just as good and a great economic option when you want T Cooks but without the dining room experience. With live music in the background and a fire warming up the setting, it was a nice atmosphere along with good food! Plus, I love that the Royal Palms hosts events like a live music artist who creates art based on the music playing.
