Great place to shop, the bakery and coffee area is cheaper than a Starbucks and the pastries are much better. The outside patio is a nice place to read the paper in the morning.

The staff is top notch and cares about the customers compared to other markets in town. For quick meals the sushi bar is excellent, so is the salad bar, and deli selections.

There is no negative to shopping here, unless you are using it as your main supermarket, then things can get pricey.
