Finally, a reason to go back to downtown Mesa.  

I've been to the Royale twice now.  I love this Place.  The owner is Tops and knows her movies.  The theatre is very cool they have interesting snacks at the snack bar, cool old school video games in the Lobby and a sweet seating layout in the Theatre itself.  you will not be disappointed walking into the Royale.  Also, they Ran the film Troll Hunter for a week.  I havee been waiting over a year to see that place.  The Royale RULES, no doubt about it.
