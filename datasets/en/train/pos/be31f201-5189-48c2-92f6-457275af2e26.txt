I've paid heaps of cash for crappy haircuts at "good" salons.
I've paid little for whack jobs at "bad" salons.

But I've never paid more than $12 for consistently good experiences at the T&G Academy. Hmmm...

Tip: ask for someone who's about to graduate and if you have long hair, get a stylist with the same. With short...you guessed it. They just understand better.
