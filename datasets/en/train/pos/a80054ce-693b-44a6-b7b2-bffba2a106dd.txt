khittie thinks it's the cat's meow! simply one of the best bars ever. wonderful bartenders, especially jason. fantastic music and never a cover. local art. nice friendly patrons. walking distance (for me). great prices. i really don't want anyone else finding out about it. i want to keep it all for myself & my neighbors. please, do not go here.
