Finally an airport restaurant with good food and good service.  I have made it a habit to stop by Sauce when I am at Sky Harbor Terminal 4.  The restaurant is actually managed like a restraurant and the staff takes pride in it.  I have only had pizza when I am here, but am happy nonetheless.  The food is reasonably priced and delivered within only a few minutes.  I would highly recommend this establishment.  It also has a bit of local flare.

Ironically, the food at this Sauce restaurant is prepared better than the other two locations I have visited.  

Seating can be difficult, however, the restaurant is at an airport, hence traffic flows cannot always be controlled.

Thanks for opening up such a fine place at Sky Harbor!
