OMG!  I totally agree with Jetta R.  A similiar scenario happens to me everytime I ask someone that has never heard about Chino Bandido.   When you do ask someone who has been to the place they get so excited and start asking have you tried the Jade Red Chicken, Jerk Fried Rice, etc etc... and how did they ever think that you could mix all those things together?  It's a crazy concoction that works and can not be described but must be experienced.
