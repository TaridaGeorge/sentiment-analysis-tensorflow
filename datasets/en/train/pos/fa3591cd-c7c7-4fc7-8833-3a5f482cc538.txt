There's nothing I don't LOVE about Char's.  Oh wait, they have a tiny womans bathroom and when you stand up in one of the stalls everyone can see you head... weird but when you have a few drinks in you it doesn't bother you as much.  

I love the regular bands, Lady J and Bad News Blues, really great.  The wait staff is always nice and quick to bring back the drinks.  It can be a bit of a sausage fest sometimes but I the guys have always been respectful and I've never hesitated coming here alone for that reason. 

The dance floor is really small but again, once you get a few in you it doesn't matter.
