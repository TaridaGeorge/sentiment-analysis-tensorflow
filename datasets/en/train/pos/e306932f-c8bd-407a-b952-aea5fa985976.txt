I've been to the Parlor many times and I've never been disappointed.  The environment is great, their staff is always very friendly and the pizza, of course, is amazing as well.  I tend to visit the most during happy hour and they always have a fun crowd with a great bar setup.  Parking can be a pain sometimes but that is what I tend to expect out of good restaurants these days and you can always valet if needed.  I have really tried the other menu items outside of the pizza and their salads.  That is what I go there for and it is too damn good not to have it every time!
