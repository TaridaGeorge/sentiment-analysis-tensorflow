This place has been on my "to try" list for about 10 years, and after a Saturday afternoon game at Tempe Diablo, we finally swung by. 

The meal was delightful. We ordered a small hummus, the falafel plate, and the "istanbuli combo:" chicken, lamb, and kafka kabobs. Everything, including the lentil soup and salad, was fresh and loaded with flavor. The falafel might be the best I've ever had.

All for 23 bucks before tip--some serious bang for your buck. 

Service was very friendly. We will definitely be back.
