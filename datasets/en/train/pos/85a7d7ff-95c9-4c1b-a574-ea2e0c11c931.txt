I have been with Dr Pospisil for about 5 years. I love everyone that works in this office and I would never go anywhere else! I have had routine checkups, fillings, and now 2 crowns. I have found Dr Pospisil to be knowledgable in new dental techniques, does very thorough work, and is careful and gentle administering shots and during lengthy procedures. He has been great at including me in the treatment plans so I understand what and why we are doing the work. 
I am very grateful to Shir're for her efforts in working with me as I changed jobs and insurance companies several times in the past years, and always explaining billings. Yolvi, Janice, and Wanda are wonderful, and I look forward to seeing everyone in the office at each of my visits.
