In one word: magnifico! Seriously, Tommy V's food is to die for. Their short rib pizza is wonderful. I usually get the parpadelle bolognese with a meat ball. It's three different meats and a wonderful pasta dish. Recently I've been eating the short ribs with saffron risotto and wow. Just wow. The short ribs are so tender and just flake off. It's such a good combination with the creamy risotto. Their wine list is comprehensive with most bottles under $40.00. This is a great neighborhood restaurant. I would recommend it to anyone.
