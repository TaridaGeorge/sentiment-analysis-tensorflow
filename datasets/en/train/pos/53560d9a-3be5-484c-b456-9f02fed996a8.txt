Not a supermarket, but super in many other ways.

It's hard to find something wrong with Trader Joe's at any location.  Staff are friendly, produce are fresh, and there is always something new to try out.  It is interesting to find a great assortment of orchids here at an affordable price along with your groceries.  It is ironic that over the years these stores don't get any bigger than the size of a Walgreens store.  They will never be a supermarket, but they are super in so many other ways.
