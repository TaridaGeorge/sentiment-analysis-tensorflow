I love this shop. My husband and I bought shoes in May, both new brands/styles from our normal based on the advice of the staff. We wore them for about 60 days; I trained decently hard in mine and we just weren't feeling it. Enter the VIP perk. We are VIP members which allowed us to bring the shoes back and try again. The staff spent lots of time with us making sure we got the shoes we would be very happy with this time. 

The Adventure Runs are great, the member perks are great, everyone is friendly and supportive, they have clinics, etc. I love coming here and will keep coming back.
