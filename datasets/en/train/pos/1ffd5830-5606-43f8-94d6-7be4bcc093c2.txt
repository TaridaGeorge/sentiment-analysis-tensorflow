Yay for the RN program! :) Kick butt statistics, kick butt teachers, kick butt nursing buddies! In the RN program right off the bat, semester one you are introduced into the program with some of the best teachers I have met! Kathy Pollard and Kathy Hanneken are awesome! Clinical instructors have all been great so far as well! The best part though is the friends you meet, they will be lifetime friends gauranteed!
