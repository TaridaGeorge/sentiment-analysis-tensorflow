This has been my car wash since I lived in midtown off 3rd street and Thomas. They do a great job, and are very accommodating if they miss a spot. They tend to be somewhat expensive, but then again they are not scratching your car with machines. I used to get the side wash with my Audi because of some modifactions that kept it from being on the rails, and for $15 you couldn't get a better wash in town. 

I don't recommend their detail service, as they are not very complete, but for car washes A+
