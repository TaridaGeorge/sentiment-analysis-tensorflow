Tough at times to get in on the weekend (very small). The breakfast is among the best on Earth if you are ready for a lot of food and spicy to boot. Great coffee for some reason, nothing fancy just great. George is a great bar waiter and a genuinely nice guy. Did I mention the best breakfast on Earth?
