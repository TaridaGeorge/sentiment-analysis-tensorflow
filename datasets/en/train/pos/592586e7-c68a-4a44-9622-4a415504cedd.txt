Everyone that works here are caring and lovely people (the guys). I just found out one of the people who worked here has passed away. If it is who I think it was, I went in there one night upset after a fight with my husband and I was crying. He reminded me not to worry about the small things and anything was able to be worked out. It was nice to have someone take notice and offer support. I'm upset he is no longer with us. If it's any consolation to his family and friends, he made a difference in my life and he was a great person. Also, Arlin is another nice person at Stayshons who stands out as a good person.
