If you know me you know that I have bad car luck (knock on wood just in case).  Case in point, my car is currently being repaired at Lovetts courtesy of an absent minded lady in a parking lot (LOVE those ladies by the way :)....) with a giant SUV.  However, I can cruise in my rental in peace knowing that my car is safe in the hands of the people at Lovetts.  Now, I must first tell you this shop is owned by women (insert jersey shore fist pump)!!!  Not only have they fixed my car to perfection on several occasions, but they are UN-believably fast, and professional.  This is without a doubt a place I would recommend to anyone who needs body work! Side note: they also have a full mechanic and do just about everything EXCEPT oil changes
