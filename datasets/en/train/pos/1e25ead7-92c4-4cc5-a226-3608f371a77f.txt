I have a love/hate relationship with this place. 

I love that they have everything you could ever want for cooking or baking but hate that my wife wants to spend hours there asking my opinion on different types of rolling pins and cupcake decorations.

This place really is a one-stop shop for cooks and aspiring chefs.
