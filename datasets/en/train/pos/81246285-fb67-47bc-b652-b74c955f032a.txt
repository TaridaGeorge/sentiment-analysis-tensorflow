Went here for AZ Restaurant Week! Amazingly, my fabulous foodie friend, Jan (she looked stunning in her gorgeous black dress) setup our dinner there. OMG, so many things I've never tried before and absolutely LOVED!

Legendary puffs, mmmhmmm. Check. Cherry Popped.
Tartar. Didn't expect to like this, being raw and all, but I love sushi so...bam...loved it.
Rib Eye Steak, holy cow! Seriously...Foodgasm!

When I'm rich and famous (wait, I don't care about being famous)...ok when I'm rich I'm going to be a regular. I'm gonna be so FAT! Average American fat :D
