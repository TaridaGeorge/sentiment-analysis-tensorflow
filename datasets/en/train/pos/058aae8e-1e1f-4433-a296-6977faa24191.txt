SHHHH! Don't tell anyone how awesome this place is.  Its like a secret little bar that has great beer and great music.  And part of the secret is finding it the first time you go.  I almost didn't want to write a review because I don't want anyone else to know about it.  After all, not too many people can fit in this joint but thats all part of the charm.  

Local art, artists, brews and free, yes FREE music.  Whats not love.
