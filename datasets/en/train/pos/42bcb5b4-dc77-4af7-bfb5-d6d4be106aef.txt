Now this must be how movie heaven feels like. As a pauper =( having the opportunity to enjoy the experience a couple times a year does it for me. It's first class seats and service for a mere $15 for a movie ticket, then add on drinks and an appetizer, and you end up spending close to $40. Not bad, especially if it's a real big blockbuster movie, then it makes it more worth it. check it out, it's awesome.
