So, we're in town on business and need a good Japanese food fix. We see rave reviews on Yelp. Got to give it a go, right? After eventually finding the Teeter House, we found the trip to be well worth it. The food was excellent! Service -- top notch! However, this is not your mom-and-pop Japanese diner. This is a quiet, quaint, spot for a special meal -- but not because of the cost, mind you. The prices are very reasonable. Although the dishes are not enormous, five guys left there very content for less than $30 pp total. Every dish was superb in taste and presentation. There was nothing that I wouldn't order again in a heartbeat. In fact, it'll be hard to go back and try something new because you will want to re-live some of those unique flavors again and again. Great find!
