This place is great. I'm always looking for restaurants owned and operated by locals. I'm anti-chain and I know these are local people that MAY own the franchises but it's all "formula" food and nothing special.

Lolo's is a delightful alternative to bucket chicken and "grand slam" waffles. And THEY'VE GOT OKRA AND GRITS!  I'm white folks but I was born in New Orleans and miss the food items they have. Their red-gravy is tops and hardy the only place to find decent fries with gravy.

Try everything, it's ALL good. I haven't made the Scottsdale location but it sounds like a great work-lunch place I'll have to try out. 

Gogo Lolo's! It's a can't miss in Phoenix local food.
