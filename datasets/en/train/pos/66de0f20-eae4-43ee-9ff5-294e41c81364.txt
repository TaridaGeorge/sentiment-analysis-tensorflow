I have been lucky enough to attend several classes here. Very clean studio, but very intimate setting (smaller classes, which is a nice change from what I have experienced). The owners are wonderful people, and the teachers are so good, too! The teachers make each class "custom" for the students that are attending the sessions. Great downtown location. Cannot beat the price, either. Definitely recommend this to anyone.
