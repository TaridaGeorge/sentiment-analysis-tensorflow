Been going to the Tempe location of Wildflower Bread Company for years and I have NEVER been disappointed ~ great food, clean facility, plus the Tempe location is adjacant to Changing Hands Bookstore, an amazing bookstore.  IF there is ever a time I am even a little blue I go to the Tempe Wildflower Bread Company ~ Eat, Read, and then go home and Pray.  It doesn't get better than that.  Blessings to them for being such a uplifting place.  Blessings : ) KC
