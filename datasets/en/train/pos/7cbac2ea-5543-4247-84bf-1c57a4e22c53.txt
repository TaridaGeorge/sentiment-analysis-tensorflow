We shopped around for living room furniture for months before a friend told me about Eurway. Everywhere I went I only found ugly-ass, boring sofas and uninspired living room sets, until that is, until Eurway. We furnished our living room with a sleek and modern set (which the animals are not allowed to go near) and am happy to say that we paid that off last month (0% interest financing) and went back for more this weekend. A new bedroom set will be delivered beginning of October, yay. Did I mention they also had a 20% off sale. Yay.
