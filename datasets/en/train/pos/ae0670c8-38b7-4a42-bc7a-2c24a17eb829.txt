When I was younger, my aunt who lived in Arizona at the time would take me here. I love going to this wonderful museum, mostly of Southwestern groups but of course that makes sense since that's the region. It was one of my favorite things to do when visiting Arizona. My Arizona trip would just not be complete without visiting the Heard Museum.

There is so much beautiful and famous artwork. Such a beautiful collection of Katsina/Kachina dolls. I loved making cornhusk dolls as a girl. I still have them to this day. It's a great place for kids and adults. I have such great childhood memories here. I haven't gone in years but checking out the website, it still looks great and I will always think of my aunt.  8.) I do plan to go back one day.
