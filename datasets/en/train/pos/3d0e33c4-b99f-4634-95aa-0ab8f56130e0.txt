I am a transplanted Midwesterner, so I love me some breakfast.  And by breakfast I mean:  Hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.  

Mike and Rhonda's makes a mean breakfast with huge portions.  For $7 you can have bacon/sausage/ham with hashbrowns, 2 eggs, and biscuits & gravy/pancakes/toast.  Come hungry or share.

They also serve classic american lunch fare:  burgers, chicken strips, fries, meatloaf, etc.
