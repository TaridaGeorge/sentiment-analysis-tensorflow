I LOVE Oak's Diner!  Besides the excellent breakfast chow the staff is incredible.  Everyone here is always bright and cheerful...which is always a great way to start the day.  

My wife loves the omelet's because they have lots of fresh veggies.  I like the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs.  They have a great selection of breakfast overall.  If you have the time they even make Apple Pancakes.  

The bottom line is my family always feels good and is smiling when we walk out the door!
