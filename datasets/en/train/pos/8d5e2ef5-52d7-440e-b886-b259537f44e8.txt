Shady's is one of my favorite bars to just go have some Miller High Life or a Bailey's OTR.  Ha ha.  I'm so not kidding.

I love the vibe there and it is definitely NOT a dive bar, no matter what you've heard.

It is clean from the bar to the bathroom.  They play rad music, show awesome old movies and have a pretty nice set up.

I can't say how I found Shady's since I don't talk much about that portion of my life, but THANK YOU to the person who first suggested we go here.

Whenever I need a getaway where I don't have to worry about getting the day/Mom/whatever off me, I can count on Shady's to provide a respite.
