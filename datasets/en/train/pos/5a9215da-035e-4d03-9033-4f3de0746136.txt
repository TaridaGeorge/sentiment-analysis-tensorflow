This is my favorite kind of Mexican place: divey with character (if that's not a redundant term). To have a place like this in Scottsdale is a rarity. 

Ditto to the previous reviews about excellent food and excellent salsa. The salsa is especially impressive, being the chunky flavor-packed kind that I love. Our entrees were both less than 8 bucks a pop.
