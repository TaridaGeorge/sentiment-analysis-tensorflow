I am a huge FLW fan. Well, I'm not huge. But man do I love his work.

Growing up in the midwest got me spoiled. If you haven't read "Devil in the White City" yet, run to your nearest bookstore and get it. Gives you an insight into Chicago that you won't get elsewhere, but I digress.

This is a must see when you're in Scottsdale. I mean, I insist. If you don't go, we will not be speaking until you do. It's not just the architecture. It's the beautiful combination of both the man made world and the awe inspiring world of nature. 

This is one of my favorite places on earth. It gives me hope for some strange reason. That we still have an ability to combine two worlds into one. And that one world is amazing.
