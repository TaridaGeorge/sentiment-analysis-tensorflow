Great burgers. I hope they are truthful, on the menu it states "humanely sustained beef."  Would be even better if it were organic grass fed, but one can dream. :o)  Usually prompt service, cute joint for a strip mall. However, a tad pricey for a burger, (ok, i do get the buffalo, and it's $14 or $15).  I most likely  wouldn't go here without a living social or groupon deal. But, luckily those are usually easy to find, and so I'm a regular here....
