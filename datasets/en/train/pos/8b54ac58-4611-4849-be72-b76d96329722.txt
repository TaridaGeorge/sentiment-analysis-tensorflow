Looking for a place to kick off your Friday night downtown? District Kitchen is the place to be! Happy hour from 5-7, then reverse happy hour from 10-midnight, featuring great discounts on craft beers, house made sangria, select wines, and amazing appetizers! Resident DJ Jared Alan sets up shop here around 10pm every Friday night to get you in party mode!

The District has a simple, yet modern, elegant feel to it. High class, but not overly stuffy or full of itself. The menu is the same: simple foods with elegant twists! The staff is nothing short of perfect: extremely friendly, humble, and professional. The crowd is a fun mix of rowdy tourists and laid back locals.
