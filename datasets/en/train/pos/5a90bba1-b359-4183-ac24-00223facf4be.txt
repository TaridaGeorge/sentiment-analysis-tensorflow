All the employees here are really nice and down to earth.  My boyfriend and I met one of the owners the last time we went and he was a really cool dude as well.  Probably the least pretentious vintage shop I've been to.

So,
Good prices.
Good selection.
Cute atmosphere.


Only downside is inconvenient parking.


woooooooooooooo!
