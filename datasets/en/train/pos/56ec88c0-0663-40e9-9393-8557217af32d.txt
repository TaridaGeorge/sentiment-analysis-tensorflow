This is by far the BEST restaurant I have ever been to. I am beyond obsessed with this restaurant. 

The food is amazing and always exactly how I like it-delicious. A few times I had less than stellar service, but since the food is so good I continue to come back again and again. The prices are pretty reasonable too. 

The pitas are so tasty and the pasta salads are to die for. The best part of eating at Pita Jungle is the fact that its healthy and affordable. Anytime I meet someone for lunch or dinner I suggest Pita Jungle because of how impressed I am. Even when I order dessert I don't feel guilty. 

They are great for take-out as well. I never have a long wait. It's perfect.
