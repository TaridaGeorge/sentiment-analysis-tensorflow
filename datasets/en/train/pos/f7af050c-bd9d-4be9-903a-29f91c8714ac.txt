I love this place! They have Boba and Pho style noodle soup! It's low calorie, filling and tastes so good! The staff is all super friendly and it's very chic and modern. I used to live down the street and pop in when I was feeling hungry. Theres a tanning center and a tattoo shop right next door too! It's on University near McClintock and if you know that area it's pretty good. Over all, wonderful!
