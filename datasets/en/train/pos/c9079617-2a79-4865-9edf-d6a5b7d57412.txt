This locale in a word is Excellent.....the staff....Excellent....the Gelato.....Excellent. The day I visited....I walked into a super clean and very welcoming Environment. All the Gelato just staring at me looking sooooo.....delicious.....I couldn't even decide what I wanted. The young lady recommended a great combination of Banana and Chocolate and I was not disappointed. I highly recommend that everyone who visits try this combination....but you are welcome to try them all....and the best part is that this locale will let you. I have said before I don't give many establishments 5 star ratings....but this locale certainly deserves it...please go and Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
