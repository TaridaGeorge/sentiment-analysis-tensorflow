Whoa, my friend insisted we order this for our study night pizza that we ate at home amongst the books, AMAZING!

We ordered the signature pizza and garlic bread so so so good.  Yeah it was a little pricey for a pizza, but it is worth every penny.

They delivered for us, is that standard?  We live right down the street from the Tempe one.

Again I haven't been knocked off my feet with pizza in a quite awhie, I agree with the review below that it is a distinct taste and if it's for you, you're going to melt...
