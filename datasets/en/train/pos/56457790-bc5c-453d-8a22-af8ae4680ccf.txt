After going through hell through JFK, I was happy to land here.  Easy to get through all the gates, and the outside of the airport was very pretty with nice paved roads and cacti!! Cabs were available as soon as I left the building.  The escalator to exit the building had some fake flying airplanes and some rocky fake mountains that were pretty also.  

The car rental service is the best.  I've never seen such an easier way to drop off a rental car.  There were signs to drop off the car like there were to drop off someone at the airport! So convenient and so fast! I thought it would take forever to drop of the car but a guy was outside checking everything.
