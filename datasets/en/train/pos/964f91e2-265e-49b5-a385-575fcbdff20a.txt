I was in Scottsdale on a business trip and I was looking for some light weight, compact shoes to take on trips, still bring my work tools and still work out. I went to the store try some Vibram shoes, not really intending to buy a pair. When I entered the store, I was immediately greeted by the staff. Ephraim (sp) and Jeremy answered all my questions, showed me multiple pairs and helped me get the right size. 

After I tried on multiple styles and sizes, I found a great pair. I asked Jeremy a few more questions, he provided me with answers and his opinions as well I decided to buy a pair. 

If you are a part-time runner, hard-core or just looking for minimalist shoes to take with you on business trips (like I was), you will not regret stopping by this fantastic store.
