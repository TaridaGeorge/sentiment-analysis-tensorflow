I had my hair cut for the first time by Pete Gulick today and it was fanominal! He couldn't of done a better job. I felt very comfortable and welcome the whole visit. Pete is a not only a fabulous hair stylist but a friendly person who has the best advice about hair! I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a great quality hair cut.
