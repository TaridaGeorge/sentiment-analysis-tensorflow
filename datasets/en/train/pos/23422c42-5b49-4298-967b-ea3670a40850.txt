Siver Mine is up there on my favorite subs list in the valley. I tried Jimmy John's and I regretted not going to Silver Mine. I have tried almost every hot sub they have and my favorites include: Cripple creek (if I'm in the mood for ranch), Frontier (if I want BBQ), Steam engine (meatball mood) or the Buffalo Stampede (buffulo sauce). I have a hard time choosing between these 4 every time and I have to go through every scenario to decide. It's awesome that they deliver so late! I would say my experiences are 50/50, half delivery and half at the Mill location, both awesome!
