Big fan of this place despite the fact that it appears they changed the recipe of their Malai Kofta the last time I was there. 

Their naan is delish! Combining a little malai kofta and palak paneer with their naan will get you laid on the first date. Money back guarantee. From me, not them. I usually get it to go and order ahead of when I think I need to because it tends to take just a bit longer than I love to get the food. 

But all and all my experiences here have always been very good. Great Indian food in Phoenix.
