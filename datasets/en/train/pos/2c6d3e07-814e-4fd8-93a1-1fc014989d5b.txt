Awesome food, awesome drinks, awesome staff.  We always enjoy our visit to Cowboy Ciao.  It's good to see a restaurant that can focus on the food as much as it focus's on it's ambiance.  It's probably a good thing that it's not on the canal because I feel those restaurants simply charge a high price to make you feel like you are getting something exclusive but in reality you are getting an average meal.  With the exception of Olive and Ivy which is great for the patio.  Regardless we will keep coming back to Cowboy Ciao.
