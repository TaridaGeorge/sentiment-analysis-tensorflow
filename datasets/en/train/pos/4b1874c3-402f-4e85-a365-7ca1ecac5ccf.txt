It's worth the wait.  

Seriously! 

This pizza was perfection. Since I had already waited two hours (thankfully a $5 cream ale held me over), I figured I'd get two pizzas to take some home. Both were lip-smackingly delicious.  The crust was thin and chewy and the ingredients were so much better than what you find at just any pizzeria.  

I would gladly wait two or three hours again for this pie.

Seriously!
