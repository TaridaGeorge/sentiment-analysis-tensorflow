Dreamy Draw, you've earned yourself a gold star. 

The trails here are amazing, landscape is pristine and beautiful, especially in the Spring. 

The proximity to the 51 is not only convenient, but surprisingly not intrusive. The 40th St. entrance is also a great way in. 

This park is an oasis for hikers and those who savor the desert landscape of Phoenix which is carelessly paved over everyday. I'll always have a spot in my heart for the beauty this park has to offer.
