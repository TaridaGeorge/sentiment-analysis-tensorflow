I really like this place.  Art(hur), the owner, was incredibly helpful with information re: the new adoption of my pet and he stocks a variety of the better foods in the industry.  He was informative regarding the food, but most of all he wasn't stingy and was completely willing to give me treats to try with my pet.  It's small, which may be a turn off for some, but it's extremely nice not to have to walk to aisle 15 to lug 40 lbs of dog food back to the car and pet friendly.  Great place to get advice from other owners also.
