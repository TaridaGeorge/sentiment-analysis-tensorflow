This D'lish location just recently opened close to my place.  Absolutely love the atmosphere, workers, and food.
Large four berry smoothie = awesome hangover recovery
Chicken breast panini is my go-to sandwich.  BOMB.

This place is so green that I feel guilty driving my car there..So I walk and get to feel extra good about the environment.  Only downside is the fact that they close at 4PM...

(Maybe it would be wise to readjust the hours when ASU is in session.  50,000 students are nearby looking for healthy options for food at all hours.)
