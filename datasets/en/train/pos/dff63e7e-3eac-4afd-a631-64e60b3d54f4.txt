I have a truly deep love of this place. Yes, the parking is a bit silly (with the parallel parking/sometimes lack of spaces/a bit of walking to get there), but it is totally worth the ridiculousness of said parking. The service is great, the food is wonderful, and the beer...is amazing. If you need recommendations, I'd recommend trying the 8th st chicken strips as well as (for beers) the hefeweizen and sunbru. So, come down to four peaks and deal with the parking there like a champ, you won't regret it. 

The only thing I'd keep in mind is that their happy hour is nonsensically busy, so if you're not too fond of parallel parking or walking, happy hour isn't the best time for you to go.
