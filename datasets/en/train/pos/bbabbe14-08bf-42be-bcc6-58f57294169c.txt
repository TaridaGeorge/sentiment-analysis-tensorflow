I always get great service when I go to Drybar. I've been there at least 3 times and have another appointment soon. The salon is beautiful and they make you feel welcome right away. Complimentary drinks include champagne and wine! Appointments are easy to book online, and I've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for my appointment (I always arrive early anyways.) You can choose a hair style from a picture menu. The stylists are friendly and style your hair just like the pictures in the menu. I always leave the salon feeling beautiful!
