I heart Shady's!! You are always sure to meet someone interesting here. And not in a one-night-stand kinda way. In a "Let's have an interesting conversation" kinda way. Plus, the bartenders are always a lot of fun. By your fifth visit, they'll know your name, I promise. They show great movies all the time, always on mute so as not to interfere with conversations, and have the best jukebox in town! The infamous photographer Aaron Abbott frequents this little gem. Give it a visit, you'll be hooked.

Oh, and for you smokers, they have a nice little tiny patio.
