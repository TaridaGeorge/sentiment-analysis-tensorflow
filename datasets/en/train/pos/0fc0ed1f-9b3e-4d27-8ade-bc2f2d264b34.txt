Oh-My-God!  There's a lot of good Mediterranean food in the Phoenix area, but this is the tops!  The name doesn't give the place justice.  The food is awesome (Gyro, soluvaki, everything else on the menu).  Doesn't matter the time, the place has a good crowd.  If you are hungry, go there!  Dang it, now I'm hungry again!
