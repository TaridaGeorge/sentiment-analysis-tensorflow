I thought this Hilton hotel was beautiful!  The staff were also very friendly. The list goes on with the friendly things they did to make our stay pleasant. 1. They opened the doors for us and greeted everyone when we came and went. 2. They offered free coffee and fruit flavored water in the lobby every morning. One evening when they were out of water the receptionist even offered me a free bottle of water. 3. Another evening they were handing out free cookies that I took up to my room to enjoy. Our hotel room was nice as well. We had a coffee maker and tea bags which is always a plus. The only downside was there were too many kids at the pool and I wanted to swim a little. Can't blame them for wanting to splash around in the pool on a hot day though.
