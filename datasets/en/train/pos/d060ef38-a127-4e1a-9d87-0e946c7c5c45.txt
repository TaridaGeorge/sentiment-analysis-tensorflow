Jason always does my nails perfect! I started going to tip and toes a about 3 or 4 years ago. I had to move a few times for work and recently made it back to az. While I was away, I never found a nail salon that did my nails the same. I am so happy to be back in az so I can continue coming in. I am never disapointed!
