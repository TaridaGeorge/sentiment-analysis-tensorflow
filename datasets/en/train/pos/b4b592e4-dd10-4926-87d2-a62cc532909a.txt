Jen is AMAZING.. she's super friendly and really takes care of my shelties!  My sheltie Koda was DEATHLY afraid of going to the groomer I used to have to carry him in.  Since he's been going to Doggie Doo's he now walks through the door.  They are average priced and super accommodating.  I can usually get an appointment the next day.  They are now open Sundays too so that helps!  I cannot say enough good things about them!
