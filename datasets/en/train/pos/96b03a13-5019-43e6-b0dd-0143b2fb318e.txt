I am not a big fan of chain restaurants.  I am a firm believer in supporting local business.  But I make an exception for Ruby Tuesday. 

My most favorite thing on their menu is the mini-combo.  You can get 2 sliders with fries plus the endless salad bar for as low as $8.99.  You can get cheeseburger sliders, turkey, buffalo chicken, crabcake and salmon patty.  I've tried them all. 

I am most in love with their salad bar.  It is well stocked and always fresh.  If you are looking for something quick, affordable and healthy (you don't have to eat the fries), then Ruby Tuesday is a great option.
