I will spare your eyeballs some work.  Same as every other review....fantastic food and vino.  The Monday-Tuesday special is a great deal.  Their bruschetta boards are simple, original and immensely satisfying.  We love the food, atmosphere and service.  It is a slam-dunk night out when we visit either Postino location.
