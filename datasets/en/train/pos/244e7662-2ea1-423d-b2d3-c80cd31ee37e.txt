As a woman, I just expect to be treated poorly and taken advantage of the second I step into a store that has anything to do with cars. NO MORE. 

This Autozone is phenomenal.  I was experiencing slow starts and when I went to get an oil change, they told me I had a bad battery.  I did not believe them (upsell technique) so I went here.  They helped me immediately, checked my battery, which was in fact bad, he showed me the reading, didn't try to sell me a super expensive battery but one mid range and replaced it for me...and here is the best part IN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES TOTAL.
