My husband and I went to dinner here on a friend's recommendation. We were so glad we did! The prices were reasonable and the food and service were amazing! All of the staff was very friendly, stopping by to chat with us and see how we were doing, and the manager seemed genuinely interested in our happiness. The lights are fun, too - they look like impressionistic pasta. :-) If you like seafood, pasta or cheese, then you will be quite pleased. We are planning to return in the very near future.

They are on board with social media (Twitter and Facebook so far) but I don't see them on Pinterest yet (wouldn't I love some of those recipes!) though they are part of CityScape: http://pinterest.com/cityscapephx/
