Some people go to car dealerships to gawk at new vehicles. Others window shop at their favorite department store. I myself prefer to frequent Williams Sonoma and try my best to keep from drooling all over the Le Creuset line. If I'm feeling really dangerous, I will hit this place up during one of their sales. This store has great customer service and the staff is very knowledgeable about the products they sell. With kitchenware, you get what you pay for. Believe me when I say you will not regret your decision to spend a bit more money on a much better product. If I could give this store any negative feedback it would be that is is highly addictive. Warning--once you enter, you are sure to return :)
