We went to dinner while in town visiting family.  I had the pasta a la vodka which was full of flavor and perfect size.  My honey had lobster shrimp fettuccine and said it was fabulous.  For dessert we shared the lava cake. Oh my god, it was incredible.  I would recommend this place to everyone and will definitely be back!
