This place is delightful.  Full of all things Texas, delicious chicken friend chicken, filet, great mashed potatoes, I strongly recommend this place.

See Stephen B's review: every time I see a boarded-up Lone Star Steak House, and now there are PLENTY OF THEM!, I smile a little smile for Texaz Grille, forced to change their name after then-20 years of operation.  

By the way, some of the best cole-slaw I've ever had!
