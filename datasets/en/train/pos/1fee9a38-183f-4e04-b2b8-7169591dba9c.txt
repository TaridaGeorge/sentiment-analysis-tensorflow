Mojo. I love you. Those other yogurt places try to tempt me with crazy new flavors but I can't do that to you. You're always there for me... clean and welcoming. To go to the other chain self-dispense yogurt dessert places (which shall remain unnamed) would be cheating. You've always given me stamps to make me come back for more and I do! You offer me super discounts with my light rail card and I use them. How could I go wrong? Please, Mojo, maintain your flashback appearance and your delicious go-to flavors (like birthday cake and white boy vanilla) and I will be loyal and I will tell all my friends about you. Your Mill Ave location is the best. The staff is friendly and there's never a crumb in sight. See you next Saturday night Mojo. Keep the fire burning for me.
