If you work in the area, you will certainly know of Miracle Mile.  Their sandwiches are huge, piled high and served with french fries and a pickle and they've been around forever.  I always get the vegetarian sandwich and it's delicious, but my mom always opts for the roast beef and she absolutely loves that. You know a place is good when you can barely find a spot to sit at and that's how Miracle Mile always is.  If you come a little before or after the lunch or dinner rush, you should be fine, otherwise expect a long line to order your food and a mad dash to secure a table. And if you like dessert, get the chocolate or carrot cake- they're both excellent.
