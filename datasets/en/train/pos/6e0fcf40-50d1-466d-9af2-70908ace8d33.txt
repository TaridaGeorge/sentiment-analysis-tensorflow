I have been to this CVS like a million times, it's literally a 30 sec drive from mi casa. I think most of the cashiers know me & my hubby since we go here so much, for anything & everything from Captain Morgan/Sailor Jerry's for him to yummy scented body wash for me. I like how they have coupons at the end of each receipt & the occasional extra bucks-woohoo! 

They are affiliated with J C Penney, so I use my Penney's card here 90% of the time & the other 10 is actually at J C Penney.
