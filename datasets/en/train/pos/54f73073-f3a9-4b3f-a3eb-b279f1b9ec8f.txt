I have been going to cornish pasty co for a long time now. We always went to the tempe location, but once the mesa location opened, it was were we always go. It is closer to where my wife and I live. I have to say the best pasty to get has to be the carne adovada pasty. I have probably eaten this pasty at least 50 times, and every single time I get it, I enjoy it as much as the first time. A place with great atmosphere, service and food. A must try for any person who enjoys quality food.
