I love this mall.  I frequent here often.  My husband has a handful of stores that he goes to and I go to all of the kids stores.  They also have covered parking, which is uncommon for malls in AZ.  I love the hours during December, their open till like midnight!!!  They also have a pretty good food court here and additional restaurants if you want to sit down.
