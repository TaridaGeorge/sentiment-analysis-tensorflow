Place is awesome.

Was in town on business for two days a couple months back and looked for a breakfast spot for the first day. Found D'lish on Yelp and ended up going there both days because the Breakfast Buzz drink was out of this world good.

It's a combination of peanut butter, bananas, espresso, chocolate, milk, proteins and vitamins, blended cold. Got it with soymilk and it was still great.

Sandwiches are solid, four-star worthy. But the Breakfast Buzz is six-star caliber. And the service was great. Fun, relaxing place to get some work done and they also have an unusual drive-thru, which could be convenient.
