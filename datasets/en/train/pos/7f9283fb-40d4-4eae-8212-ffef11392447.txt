I love this place! I came for breakfast by myself & it instantly became a favorite. I try to come each weekend that I'm home. First off It's a very relaxed atmosphere and the customer service is great! They offer breakfast, lunch & dessert crepes & they are Delicious!! My usuals are either the Nutella Crepe-YUM or the savory Chicken Supreme-Soo Freaking Good! If you're looking for a chill atmosphere to enjoy some amazing crepes, then Cupz N' Crepes is the place for you!
