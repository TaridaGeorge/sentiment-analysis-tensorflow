I love this place.  I wish I could move into Chelsea's Kitchen and never leave.  First of all the service is outstanding.  Things usually go perfect, but if they don't you really get a sense of how a restaurant should be run.  I take all out of town guest here and always end up getting a ton of praise for my dinner recommendations.

I have people beg me to overnight them the Red Velvet Cake.  The Nachitos are so simple, but done to perfection.  If all of the "Best Things I've Ever Tasted" menu isn't enough, they out do themselves with those delicious little cookies they offer you when you leave.

Try it, you'll like it.  There's a party in my tummy, so yummy!
