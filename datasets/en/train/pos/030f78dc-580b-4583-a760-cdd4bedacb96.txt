Not only did I really like this place, I wanted to support it.  This is a totally Vegan restaurant that actually tastes good.  The people who run this place take great pride in being vegan and not being cruel to animals.  They even have statements on their walls about it.  Walls which are super nice.  The place is very plain, all white, but for some reason, it's cool.  The restaurant is extremely clean, and other than listening to the TV talk about animal cruelty the experience was awesome.  My meal was great.  We stared with the spring rolls, I go the spicy cha cha and my gf had the curry.  The curry was some of the best I've had since coming to AZ, and my dish had great spices, and was delicious.  I will be back for sure.
