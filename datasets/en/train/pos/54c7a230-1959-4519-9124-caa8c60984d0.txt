This is my favorite frozen yogurt place. I've tried many others and this one just seems to have the truest tastes. I like the store design as well. I don't really live near any yogurt place, they are all equally far from me, so when I go I prefer to go here.

Tip: Nutritional stats are on the wall behind the cashier.
