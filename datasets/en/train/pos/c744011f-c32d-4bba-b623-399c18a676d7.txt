I just want to say these guys are the best floor installation company in AZ. They show up on time, they work long hours, before they leave they make sure everything is cleaned up down to a T. They did a such a good job on the floor, I recommend these guys to anybody out there that need their floors redone. These guys know how to replace floors!
