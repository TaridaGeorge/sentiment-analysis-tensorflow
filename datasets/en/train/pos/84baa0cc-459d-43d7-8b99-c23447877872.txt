Went here for my first time last week, and it's definitely the best place for subs!  I've been hearing about it for weeks; friends and family simply rave non-stop about it.  I figured it must be good, and I was sick of people begging me to go.

It's not much more than Subway, but it tastes sooo much better, and you get a lot more for your money.

I can't wait to take my husband here.
