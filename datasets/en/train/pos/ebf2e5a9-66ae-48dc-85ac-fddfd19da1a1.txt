I would like to mention that the Mesa office is NOT closed. I have an appointment to go there today. I believe their Gilbert office is still open as well. They are are very good doctors office. I can almost always get a same day appointment or an appointment within a couple of days. Even if they are booked up, they will find a way to squeeze me in if it is something urgent (like a migraine). Dr. Jensen is very caring and listens.
