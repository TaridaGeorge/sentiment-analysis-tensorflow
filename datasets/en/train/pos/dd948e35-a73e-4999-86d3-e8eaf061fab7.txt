I had tried their beer at the Flagstaff Beer Fest and I was hooked on the watermelon ale. We had some time to kill before meeting up with friends so we decided to stop by and have a beer. 

The space is in a industrial area but the feel to it was so much more than that. There is different types of art work on the wall that they display from different artists around the area. It is really awesome to see the different art work displayed.

I had a pint of watermelon ale and a taster of their imperial porter. Both were very good! The beer maker was pouring beer that day and he was very cool. I will be back!
