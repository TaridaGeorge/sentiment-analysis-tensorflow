I admit that, like other reviewers, we had to get up to get our check when we were finished.  However, the service was great when it counted (when we were eating).  And even if it hadn't been, the food was really AMAZING.  I ordered the gyro sandwich -- I love them, but they're usually pretty standard no matter where you go.  The meat was tender and flavorful here, though, and not greasy like in other spots.  We also had the hummus, which was great, too.  I had the lentil soup, which was superb.  My husband got the lamb kebab plate and was impressed with everything down to the rice -- and he's an extremely picky eater.  Great food, good prices and good service -- what more could we ask for?  We'll definitely be back.
