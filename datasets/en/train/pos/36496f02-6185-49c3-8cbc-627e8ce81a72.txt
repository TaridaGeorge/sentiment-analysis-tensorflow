We took our 18 month old son in for his very first hair cut and had the best experience with Cool Cuts. We made an appointment, even though we didn't have to... walk-ins are welcome. They took us right away and let our son pick out a movie of his choice. They have little cars with steering wheels and seat belts as barber chairs. The movie distracted him enough for the hair stylist to work her magic. We couldn't believe how quick and accurate she was, especially with all the moving around our son was doing. We were in and out in 15 minutes and the hair cut looked perfect!
