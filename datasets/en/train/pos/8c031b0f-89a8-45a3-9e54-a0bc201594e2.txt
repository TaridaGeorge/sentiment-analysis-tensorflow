First time I came here, I was visiting. After I moved here to AZ, I am still going here! Their quinoa burgers are fantastic. I always get the "naked burger" (served on a bed of greens) so I can skip out on those extra carbs. 

It is nice they have a drive thru...went through it once and the gentleman at the window was very friendly. Also addressed me by name (gave him my credit card to pay), which always makes someone feel special! Great service and food!
