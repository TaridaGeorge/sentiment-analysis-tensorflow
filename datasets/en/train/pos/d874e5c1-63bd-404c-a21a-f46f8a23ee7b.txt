My boyfriend brought me here for our second year anniversary and it was really amazing! We had a nice private seating area and the service was very polite and educated us on all the foods and how to pair things together over all a very lovely and romantic evening! They even brought us chocolate covered strawberries and wrote happy anniversary on the plate in chocolate. Would recommend for a special evening out (Would also recommend reservations)
