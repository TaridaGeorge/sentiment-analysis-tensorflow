who woulda thunk that the best pizza was not in new york, nor in LA, nor Chicago, but ARIZONA??  yes, folks, it's true.   I've had my fair share of the best pies in New York having lived there for seven years, and now that I'm in LA, Mozza made me do the nod, but there's something about Bianco that takes the cake, not by a mile, per se, but just enough to make you go "hmmmm...."  So what is it that makes Bianco the best?  I can't really pinpoint it, but I'm going to go with the crust.  That crust....Thin, and crispy (not soggy), chewy and, and, and..... just really damn good.  But be prepared to wait.  Get drunk while you do... :)
