The word is out, the counts are in, Parlour Hair Design is for anyone who wants to have their and make their own personal hair fashion statement.  I just have to say that the stylist (I believe her name was April) had some excellent suggestions, some things I  hadn't even thought of, as I have wavy and at time un-manageable hair. She was very friendly and full of personalty. Always willing to give a helpful hint and recommend product.
