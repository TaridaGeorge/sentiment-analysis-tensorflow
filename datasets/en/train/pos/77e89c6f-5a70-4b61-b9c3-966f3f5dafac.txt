I absolutely love coming here! Especially with Jo or Josefine :) she is awesome. She does a great job and knows what you are talking about when explaining to her how you want your hair. She actually cares about her clients and keeps up with you she just doesn't get your money and forget about you! I got hair extensions put in for the first time, she taught me how to take care of them and text me to see how I was doing. She is a great hairstylist and a fantastic gal. Here's her cell (623)698-4530 :)
