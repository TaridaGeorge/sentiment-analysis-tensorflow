Warning, if you come here for lunch, you WILL wait. This is an amazing deli located between ASU, MCC, Banner Desert hospital and many other medical offices so it gets pretty busy but that should prove how good the food is.
 I highly recommend the Dilly Club but everything is great on their menu.
One great perk is that they deliver. I've been a regular here since 2004.
