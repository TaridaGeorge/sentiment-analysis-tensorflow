I absolutely love love love this place. It's one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley.  Everything I've eaten here is wonderful, cooked to perfection and with zest.
I love the fact that they have REAL wasabi and not that horseradish paste that's dyed green.
There are a bunch of things I would recommend but my favorite is the Wasabi Chicken. Oh wow, what a pleasure this is. Everything else is awesome too. I can't even think of one thing I didn't like.
The alcohol menu is huge, the Saki list is grand and they taste wonderful. If you have questions about Saki just ask your waiter, they know their Sake.

The Ambiance is fun, I love to sit outside now that the patio is done.

Head on out...I can't even hear the name of this place without having a craving for it.
