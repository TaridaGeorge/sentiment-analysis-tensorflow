I have been taking pieces to Joanna for years. She has altered vintage prom dresses, turned flare jeans into straight-leg, let out sleeves and hems, and even recently stitched up a tear in my cashmere pashmina so beautifully that you can barely detect a scar! She does the best work and is SO pleasant and nice. (I've never met an employee at Joanna's who was anything less than lovely.) I would say that the prices are very reasonable--comparable to what I used to pay in Queens, NYC. For $18 she took outmoded flared jeans and turned them into a straight-leg pair that I'll be able to wear forever! I would recommend Joanna for any job. Fantastic work.
