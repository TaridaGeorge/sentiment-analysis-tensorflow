Changing Hands is such an awesome bookstore that I just love going to browse their collection. They have some of the best used books selection and also a good selection of new books. They are continually having special guests and events that keep me going back. 

I have honestly found most of my Chuck Palahniuk's collection at Changing Hands and all have been first editions, some were even signed. 

Plus their connected to Mayflower Bread Co. which is delicious as well but that's another review.

So check it out and if you'll be going back ask about their punch cards for extra savings. 

Happy Reading.
