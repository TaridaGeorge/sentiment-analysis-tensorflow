I come here once a week and really look forward to it!  I've had the soup/salad combo, the Canadian hamburger, the chili cheese dog, and HUGE chicken Cesar salad.  All of the dishes are huge (try the tuna melt!) and the wait staff is always friendly.  It's laid back and a great place to come with friends to hang out :)
