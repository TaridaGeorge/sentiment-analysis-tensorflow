Absolutely amazing service!!  I ordered flowers for my daughter's quincea√±era mass about two months ago.  Rachel listened to what we wanted and gave us input.

The flowers were gorgeous and really added to the altar.  She even had extra small arrangements, free of charge, near the prayer candles.  

When we went to mass today, the flowers still looked beautiful!

The best part is that the prices were so much better than other vendors we've used in the past.  The overall quality was an absolute steal.  We are very pleased!
