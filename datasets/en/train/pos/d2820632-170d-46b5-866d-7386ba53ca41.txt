I love this place. Its great to bring out of towner's or the family for a reasonably priced meal that you usually have left-overs of the next day. 
The fresh bread is awesome. My  family still raves about the broccoli dish ( not a veggie fan so I'll take their word). All of the pasta dishes are amazing and the spumoni is a great way to end.
The atmosphere has been covered by many, but let me just say it really does make the place worth the trip and the service is always attentive.

There's a reason we usually have to wait to get in (because they are doing something right), and its always worth it.
