AMAZING burgers!!!! The service was fantastic!!!! I had a buffalo burger and they ran out of buns, so my server ( I think he was also the manager) Marshall comped me on the bill for not having buns and he didn't have to do that, because I'm there for the meat not the bread, but that just shows their awesome service!!!! I've been here several times and I will be back!!!!!! Cant wait to try the Roo Burger!!!!
