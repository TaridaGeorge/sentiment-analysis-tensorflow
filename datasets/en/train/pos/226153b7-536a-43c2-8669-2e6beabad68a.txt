Love, love.....LOVE this place, super cool people work out there, you walk in and spend a few minutes waving and acknowledging people. The equipment is great, it is never so packed you stand around wondering what machine you can get in on. The trainers there are great....so worthwhile to invest in a little kick start. It is not oriented just towards "muscle"....it seems the trainers incorporate fitness, cardio, core in their programs and you can see all kinds of ages and diversities there.

Did I mention that I love it??? They have now opened up for 24hrs during the week and the monthly fees are mindblowingly reasonable!! I must say it is super close to my house, but if I didn't love it sooooo much I still wouldn't go.Staff are uber friendly too.
