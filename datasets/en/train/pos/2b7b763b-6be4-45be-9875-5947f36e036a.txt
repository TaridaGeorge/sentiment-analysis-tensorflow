I come here probably at least once a week. The prices are right, there's a good variety of "ethnic" food, the cashiers are quick and friendly, and they're just helpful. I locked myself out of my car when having a space-cadet moment and they let me use their phone to call AAA to bail me out. 

Fresh flowers + great selection of wine and cheese + all the essentials 

They deal is that they cut out the middle man to get great prices for quality products and they don't have sales because they always sell their products at the best price possible. =) GO TJ'S!
