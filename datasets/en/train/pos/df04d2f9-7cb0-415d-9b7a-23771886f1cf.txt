This is one of our favorite places to eat here in Chandler.  Delicious, well-presented foods, great variety, awesome side dishes, and a quiet, well-lit dining room.  The portions are enormous, so plan to bring some home, or share a meal with someone.  My only complaint would be about the background music (Kenny G? Really?).
