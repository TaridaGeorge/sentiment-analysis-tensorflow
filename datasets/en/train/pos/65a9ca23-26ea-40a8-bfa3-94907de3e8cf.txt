omg this place is amazing...Sushi is the best I've had!! Didn't think I'd ever say that about a buffet place!! It also has everything made to order if you don't see what you want. I love shrimp and crab and they had plenty of it!! :D I'd definatley go there again I just wish they were closer to me! :(
