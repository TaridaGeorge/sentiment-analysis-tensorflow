BASICALLY I love this place!  It's like the "Forever 21" of accessories.  They have tons and tons, and oh, tons of really cute and trendy stuff at very affordable prices.  If I'm looking for that one perfect item to go with an outfit or just want to jazz up my accessory collection, I hit up CC and probably spend 2 hours just looking at everything!  The quality of their stuff isn't awesome but it's just right for the price.  I say GO THERE! :0)
