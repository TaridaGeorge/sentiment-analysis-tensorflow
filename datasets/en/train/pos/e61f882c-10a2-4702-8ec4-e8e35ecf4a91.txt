Read the reviews as they are the truth. 

So much has been written about Kai that i cannot make it sound much better , so ill do a simple rundown. 

Service - A + And I'm talking about the French Room in Dallas A+. Not anything you would find in Scottsdale (unfortunately) or similar "classy" cities.

Food - Again A + in the way you would want coursed meal to look, taste and be presented.

Quality / Cost - Worth every penny, and the card, champagne plus chocolates sent by the chef waiting for us in our room after the completion of dinner was what has won me over and set Kai apart. 

Ps. This is after multiple visits, which is in itself amazing to have ZERO drop off in any of the category's.
