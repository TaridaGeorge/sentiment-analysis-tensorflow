I just recently moved up here to Phoenix and was looking for something good to eat. I started looking through things on Yelp and found this place. it took me forever to find it and I called and the lady helped me find it. Well I definitely found it. I went and the lady working was so friendly and helped me pick out what to eat. And the found was delicious!!!!  I had the number 1. I definitely recommended it to anyone.
