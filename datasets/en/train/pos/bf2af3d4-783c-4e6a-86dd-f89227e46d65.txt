Great food.
The staff is very friendly. 
The service was quick.
The decor and atmosphere is very modern and inviting compared to other Vietnamese restaurants. 
I had tried their Pho Duc biet, Pho Ga, Curry Chicken, spring rolls. All were very tasty. The ingredients used were fresh. I have no complaints about this place what-so-ever. I would recommend anybody and everybody to this place. I would definitely come back whenever I'm in town.  5*'s
