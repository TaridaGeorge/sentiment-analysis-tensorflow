Yelp has been on a roll lately, with all the best foods I've been eating, I've become a food snob. This place is nothing short of spectacular. Great outdoor seating, sitting outside right when the sun is going down in the warm breeze and eating great food. Appetizer of bread, meat and cheese, delicious and light pizza, a glass of wine and top it off with strawberry-nutella crepe = perfect meal.
