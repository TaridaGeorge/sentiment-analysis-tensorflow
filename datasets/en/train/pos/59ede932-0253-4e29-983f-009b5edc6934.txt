Married or dating a Comic Book Nerd?  Here is the perfect place to purchase a gift certificate for that special person in your life.  

The staff is always so nice here.  I only go when I need to purchase a GC for the hub, it's even bagged and boarded! 

The parking is a bit tricky, be careful when trying to leave.... you have to semi reverse onto Central if you don't plan accordingly.
