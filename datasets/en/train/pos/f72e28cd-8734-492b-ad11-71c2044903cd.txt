This is my favorite bar, hands down. I generally will go there more for the house/tech music scene upstairs because, well, I am more into that. Either way down or up its a great place all around and the drinks are always perfect and the people are always nice. I very rarely have to wait long for a drink and there is a lot of room for seating, lounging, dancing or standing. Be careful on those stairs though... I have learned the hard way. haha
