I was never a fan of Indian food until I found Indian Palace, now at their 3rd location in less than 10 years, and despite that the location keeps changing, the food stays consistent (which is a rarity).  

Their lunch buffet is one of the most diverse I've ever seen from an Indian restaurant, with 2 rice dishes (bryani and basmati), several vegetable dish choices and several meat choices.  small tossed salad and dessert as well at chai round out the offerings.

My favorites are the Chicken Tikka Masala, Bryani and spinach, but I eat almost everything there.  It is the best Indian food I've had...ever.
