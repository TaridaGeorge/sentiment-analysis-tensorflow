I brought my wife here because of the reviews of other Yelpers. We had the dinner for 2 for $29 bucks each. Outstanding dinner. The servers were very attentive. No empty glasses here.  Our server, Colin, knew how things were made and offered some great recomendations. Next time we're in Scottsdale we'll be sure to come back. I've paid a lot more for a lot less. Thanks for the nice evening.
