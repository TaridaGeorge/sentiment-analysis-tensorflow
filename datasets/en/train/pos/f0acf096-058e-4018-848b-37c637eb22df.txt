Giselle is one of the most classical ballets of all time.  I was so excited to receive my ticket for CMYE Opening Night of Giselle last week.  

I had seat in the top area, but were able to see and hear the performance.  The costumes were so exquisite, and the beautiful stage production was so well thought out.  The dancers and orchestra were magnificent!   This is one performance you do not want to miss. 

Thank you so much for Lindsey and Symphony Hall for an unforgettable evening!
