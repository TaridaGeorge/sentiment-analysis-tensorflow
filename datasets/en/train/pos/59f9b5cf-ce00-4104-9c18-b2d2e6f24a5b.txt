Absolutely amazing. My husband and I went, We had Farm Burgers, garlic fries, onion rings, a milk shake ORDER THE MILK SHAKE, and a fried banana split sandwich.

The food was amazing, the vegetables were crisp and perfect. I would drive the hour from one side of town to the other for this place any night of the week it was phenomenal.
