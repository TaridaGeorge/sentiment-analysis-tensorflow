Fry's is where I do ALL my grocery shopping. They have everything, and pretty cheap. Getting a Fry's VIP card is amazing. It saves you lots of money. I think it's alot cheaper than some of the other grocery stores.

Also, one of the best things is self-check out. i know most places have it, but there are still some grocery stores that don't.
