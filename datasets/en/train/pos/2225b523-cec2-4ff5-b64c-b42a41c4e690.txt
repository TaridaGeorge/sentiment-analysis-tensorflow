No hands down, the best espresso in the greater Phoenix area. Talented and passionate baristas (albeit strange sometimes), simple and direct menu, and no bullshit. In-house roasted coffee beans at the most premium quality. Almost always perfect cappuccinos (in house only, the way it should be), locally brewed Chai from Tucson, and organic/fair trade ingredients. A must for real coffee-lovers.
