I will make this one short and sweet. This is the second chef Mina restaurant I have been to in the last month ( American Fish in Vegas). I would go back to any of his establishments in a heart beat.

We had two dozen oysters, duck fat french fries, foie gras sliders, duck fat fried chicken with truffle mac and cheese, bone in prime rib, creme brulee, and the cheesecake pistachio streusel. Ohhhhh my lord did I just say that! It ended up being top five meals of my life. So F-ing delicious I shed a tear just thinking of it. If you ever have the chance to try any of  Michael Mina's places don't even think twice about it, JUST DO IT!

Service= 5 stars,  Ambiance= 5 stars,  Food= OFF THE CHARTS!
