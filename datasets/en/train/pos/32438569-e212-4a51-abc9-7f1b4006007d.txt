Hal is a Notre Dame grad, but I still think he is great!  He runs a solo office, has been practicing for 40+ years, and knows his business well.  He has helped me with business entity and our personal estate plan.  His fees are reasonable and reflect that fact that he has low overhead and no large corporate entity to support!  If he cannot help you he can point you in the right direction.
