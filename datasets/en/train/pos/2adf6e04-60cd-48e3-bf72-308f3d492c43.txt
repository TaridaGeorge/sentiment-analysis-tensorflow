I am always looking for good old American Chinese and this is the best place in Scottsdale for it...in my opinion the only place.  

We did take out and got the Mu Shu chicken and Chicken Lo Mein and  we were so happy with both.  We got the kids the honey chicken and although I think their kid meal prices are too high,  they were happy too.
