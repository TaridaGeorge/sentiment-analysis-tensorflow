On my little trip around the city I drove over to Sweet Pea. Very cute store and great personable staff.

Nice selection to baked goods and great taste.

What nice find in the downtown area. I've got Wicked Bakery up north and Sweet Pea downtown... North and South is covered for those sudden cravings... now time to find something on the on West and East sides of the city.
