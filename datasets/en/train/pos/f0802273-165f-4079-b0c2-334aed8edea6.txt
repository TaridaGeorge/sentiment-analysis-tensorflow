Amazing flavors, unique ambiance, and friendly staff. What else can you ask for? Oh yes...it's better than Starbucks!  Their menu ranges from your regular boba flavors to the unique Patbingsu plate (Korean ice shaved desert with all kinds of yummy toppings like, red beans, tiny marshmellow rice cakes, kiwis, cherries and more, topped with syrup/milk).  I am too lazy to make daily trips since I live in NE Mesa but this place is wonderful...I go at least once a week but always miss it.
