I was watching food network and they featured Zinc for their French Onion Soup.  I happened to be shopping at Kierland Commons with my mom and grandma and putting two and two together I stumbled upon Zinc.
     Zinc is an adorable little French bistro great for lunch or an intimate dinner. We ate in their courtyard and they had flowers, candles and all sorts of unique decorative pieces to observe.
    The food is as good as the bistro is cute! I had a amazing salad and we shared the souffle for dessert!  Next time I am going to try the soup!
