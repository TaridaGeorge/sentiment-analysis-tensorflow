This place rocks for breakfast!!  I no longer live in Scottsdale and I miss the gingerbread pancakes- they are soooo good.  I am NOT a sweet breakfast-orderer either, so if I  miss pancakes then it means they are truly amazing.  I can honestly say this is the only place I've been to that I would ever order a type of pancakes for breakfast.  They're so good that putting anything on them (syrup or butter) just takes away from the amazing-ness of them.
Their omelets are always fantastic, too.  My favorite here is the delicious caprese omelet and I've also had the veggie omelet which is fabulous.  Their breakfast menu is sooo great I wish I could go back and order everything.  Also, they serve breakfast all day!  Awesome bloody mary's, too.  
Love it!!!
