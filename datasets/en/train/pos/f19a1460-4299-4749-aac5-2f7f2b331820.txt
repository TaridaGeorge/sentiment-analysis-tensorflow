I've always loved this salon because the staff are all so nice and the services are reasonably priced for the quality of work received. I've never left here with a bad manicure or gel nails.  The nails don't lift and I can usually stretch over two weeks in between fills.  When I don't have tips put on, US Nails also does a great traditional manicure and really takes the time to groom my hands for a fair price. 

Even better, the staff and owner always remember me!  I moved away and came back three years later and the owner remembered who I was and asked why I had been missing. Great customer service always brings me back :)
