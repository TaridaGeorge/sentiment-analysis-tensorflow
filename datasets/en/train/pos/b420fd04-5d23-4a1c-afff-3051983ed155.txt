My wife and I eat here every chance we get.  The food is excellent, service is always fast and friendly.  You can't go wrong with any of the pizza's.  We usually get the margarita with pepperoni. My wife loves the linguine with clam sauce.  I love the Rigatoni Al Forno and the four cheese ravioli. This is one of the best places on the west side for some real good Italian!!
