Usually when you think of going to a Motor Vehicle registration, you think about long lines and people disgruntled, including the working staff.  I came in on a Friday around lunch time, and I was able to get helped within 30 minutes.  The service was great as I had all of my queries resolved in an extremely timely manner with the best efficiency that I have seen ever from a bureaucratic organization.  I have been to other MVDs in Arizona, and I feel that the culture here is stronger and more close knit.  Everyone seemed to be smiling.  Either they were happy or were putting up a good show.
