Hands down this is the place to bring your car for any automotive work!!  I brought in my 2005 Chrysler Pacifica to have it evaluated because there were a couple of problems.  I wanted to see what type of life it had left and was it worth spending the money to fix it or should I invest in a new car.  They were very honest with me and really helped me through my decision.  Needless to say, I decided to invest into my car and it now drives like a brand new car!!  I couldn't be any happier.  I highly recommend this place.  I have already told a ton of people about this place and I will bring any of my car needs to them!!
