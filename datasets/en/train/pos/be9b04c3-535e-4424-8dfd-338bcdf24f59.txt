Okay, I am thrilled with feeding my three kids lunch or dinner here.  Everyone can get what they want to eat from all the different stations.  Sometimes one of the kids wants a roasted chicken leg from the Smokehouse Grill for $1.50, sometimes someone wants sushi rolls from the Asian counter- spicy shrimp rolls, or avocado rolls, ect for between $5-$10, ect.  Then we go to the cold drinks and get fancy sodas for 50c or fancy honeydew white tea for $1.50, ect.  Then we all sit down at a table in the store or by the registers and eat.  Cheap meal, lots of choices and everyone is happy.
