I can't say enough great things. I was in a real tight jam recently and needed some things done before a work trip and there wasn't any time to get the alterations done, or so I though. Lynn and her staff had me covered. I got everything done, it fit great.. I will not to anywhere else. Aside from that they have all kinds of great clothes, nothing cookie cutter. All sorts of styles and hard to find sizes. Great staff, great clothes, and tons of available options and special orders. This place is tucked in the back, take the time to stop in next time you need something. It's THE best place in town!
