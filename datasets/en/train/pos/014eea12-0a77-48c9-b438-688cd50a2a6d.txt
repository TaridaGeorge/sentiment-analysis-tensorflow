I went to Lon's with my family on a Saturday evening while I was in town for the BCS championship game, and we had an absolutely wonderful experience.  The entrees were absolutely superb (especially the rib eye, wow), and the sides and desserts were perhaps even better.  The bourbon glazed apple tart I had for dessert was literally the best dessert I've ever had.  The bartender also mixed perfect drinks all around.  My only criticism was the pedestrian and underwhelming beer menu.  But that's the tiniest of flaws in an otherwise grand experience.  It's a bit pricey, but highly recommended.
