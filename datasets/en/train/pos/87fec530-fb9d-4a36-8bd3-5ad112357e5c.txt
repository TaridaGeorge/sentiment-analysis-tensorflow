Best $45 I've ever spent. I came to Valentina a totally confused bride and she was 100% honest with me--she could have made tons of money off of my desperation, and she instead told me honestly that I didn't need to do all the alterations I was thinking about. My dress was custom made, but she had the experience and know-how to help me out. She altered my wedding dress in 4 days flat. It was amazing and so, so perfect.
