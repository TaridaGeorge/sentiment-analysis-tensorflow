I won't be able to say enough about this place. 
First off, the best happy hour deals in town. I mean, who doesn't love seeing a $1-$3 price margin on delicious greek food ?! 
My friend and I "splurged" and shared like 6 items off the menu + 2 glasses of cabernet which was definitely NOT bad at all for $3. Everything was delicious so I don't think there's a need to go into detail about each one. The side plate of pita made everything that much better as well. 

The interior is modern and lively. Nice patio for those who like enjoying the heat/arizona breeze in front of a nice man made lake =p

Will definitely be back!
