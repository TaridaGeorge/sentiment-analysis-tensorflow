Excellent restaurant. The quality of ingredients and preparation are superb. Our server was very attentive and the meal was delicious. We shared the American Kobe special. The cut of meet was exceptional and it was perfectly prepared. The sides were also very delicious, so were the drinks. An overall great experience!
