It has been over 1 year since I have been back and the pizza was so good, why did I wait that long????  Four cheese thin pizza!  OMG!!!!  It is cooked (or baked) to perfection.  I literally could not stop eating it.  Nom, nom, nom....  I did share with Lou, she liked it too!  The place is nice, clean, open, and bright.  The service is always great!!!
