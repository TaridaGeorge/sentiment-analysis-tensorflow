Mint chocolate chip with lots of real mint...mmmmm! Lime-Basil sorbet. YUM!
We tried the famous Cheese Duo but had to go with the Mint Chocolate chip since it's a personal favorite. The owner was super nice explaining the flavors & offering samples. When we asked when they would be serving lychee again she actually offered to put a request in with the ice cream maker. Now that's personal service! 

I guess it's a good thing I don't live there or I'd be 30 pounds heavier. Go check it out. You won't be sorry!
