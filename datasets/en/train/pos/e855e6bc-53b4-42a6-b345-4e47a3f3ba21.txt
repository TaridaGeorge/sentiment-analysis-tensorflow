Excellent Ice Cream and excellent service by enthusiastic  workers who seem to really enjoy what they are doing.

When a business says something is homemade, I tend to say, yeah right. but Sweet Republic really does make their ice cream on the premises, what a treat. 

I wasn't as adventersome as other reviewers having two scoops, one belgian chocolate and the other toffee. MMMM they were great. 

I'd been wanting to try Sweet Republic for a long time since I live so close by, now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long!
