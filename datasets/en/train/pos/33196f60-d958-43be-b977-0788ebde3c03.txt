We used our local dines coupon for this experience and we were super satisfied. 

The food was quick, hot, fresh, and yummy!  

The service was great. Quincy took care of us! 

Atmosphere was comfortable. T.V's, booth space, air tempature, were all up to par and made for a pleasant dining experience. 

Happy hour 3-7 m-f

Thank you Blue 32~!
