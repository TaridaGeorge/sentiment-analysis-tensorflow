I love Switch!  The one thing I don't get is how Switch can be soooo good, but Fez & Ticoz are so not good when they are owned by the same people?  I don't understand how they get it so right at Switch, but yet so wrong at the other two places.  Switch has a great vibe and great food.  It's become my favorite place in PHX!
