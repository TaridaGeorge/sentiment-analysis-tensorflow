Whats not to love?  Fresh baked bread.  Fresh home grown ingredients.  Delicious combinations.  Pane has some of the best freshest sandwiches you will find in AZ.  From basil, tomato, and mozarella to more exotic daily specials.  The sandwiches are made to order and the bread comes hot out of the brick oven.  For a little more than a subway sandwich you get a gourmet one that is more than enough to fill you up.  I would advise you eat it there on the picnic table as I have taken some home and the bread tends to get soggy.
