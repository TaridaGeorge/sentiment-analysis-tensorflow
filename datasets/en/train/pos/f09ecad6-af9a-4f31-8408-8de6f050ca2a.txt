So when I have a craving for naengmyun this
is the place I found to be the best in the metro
area to satisfy it. And no - not because of that 
goofy KPOP naengmyun song stuck in my head or 
anything. I just get a craving for it every now 
and then.  They do the usual cutting of naengmyun 
noodles with scissors and you can add vinegar and 
mustard to taste. They have a decent spread of 
banchan and service is pretty good. The restaurant 
doesn't look like much from the outside but it's 
pretty nice inside. Don't freak if there's no 
parking on the Arizona Avenue side. Just go around 
the corner and you will find a lot more parking.
