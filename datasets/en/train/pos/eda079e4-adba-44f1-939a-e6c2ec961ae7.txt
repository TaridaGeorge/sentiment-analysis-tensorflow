Atomic is the best place in town for all your comic needs.  They always order a decent number of new releases so you shouldn't have a problem getting a copy of any new issue.  In addition to comics they have t-shirts, posters, card games, toys, candy and all sorts of other geeky junk.  

If it's something they don't carry in their store let them know and they'll find you a copy.  The staff is friendly and happy to help you find whatever you are looking for... or make some suggestions if you're just getting in to comics.

(Watch out for the swarms of kids on the weekends.  They come to hang around all day playing Pokemon and can really crowd the place.)
