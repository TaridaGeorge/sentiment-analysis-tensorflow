This place was the best Chinese food I've found in the area. I ordered the vegetable fried rice and received a heaping portion with large chunks of vegetables. Yum. Everything tasted fresh, and seasoned well.

Our waiter was polite and attentive throughout the whole meal and I felt very taken care of--which is abnormal for most Chinese restaurants. Am I right?

He also brought us some complimentary freshly fried chips with sweet & sour sauce.

The price was very reasonable. I will eat her many more times.
