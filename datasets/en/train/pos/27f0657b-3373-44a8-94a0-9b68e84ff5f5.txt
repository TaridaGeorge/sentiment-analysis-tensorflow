annnnd....  get the red drink.  
I've had the fish, the chicken the stupid fries.   Its not good for you, BUT ITS SO GOOD.  Depends on the day, the biscuits are better some days then others. The red gravy is different day by day ans so is the sausage gravy.
The brunch menu is almost ready and i can't wait!
