Update: It has been 18 months since I have been practicing Pilates at Maximum Pilates and I wish I had before and after photos to share.  What a difference!  Normally, I would be completely bored by any exercise routine by now, but I still look forward to this one.  It has been such a positive experience.  The studio has added mat classes to the mix this year and I am enjoying them, too.  I work out with Heather and Pippa and can recommend them both.
