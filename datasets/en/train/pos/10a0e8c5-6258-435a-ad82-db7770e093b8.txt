The view is awesome, a really great par 3 with hummingbirds, geese, waterfalls and gorgeous views of camelback...very pretty. The staff is kind of indifferent and either ignores you or gets kind of sassy. I like the course and will return. The beer cart was horrible, on Fathers Day Sunday, it was pretty croweded and our group had reserved about 12 or 14 tee times and we were shocked the beer cart girl was out of almost everything and said they dont really stock up or keep anything on holidays or summer. What...no wonder they arent making any money...Golf 101...everyone wants something to drink, and prob 4 somethings to drink...in English...Stock the Beer Cart with tea, water, juice, food and yes BEEER.
