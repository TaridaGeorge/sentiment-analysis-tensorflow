I honestly can't imagine anyone giving this brewery anything less than 5 stars.  It's the perfect combination of restaurant (with great food, especially the burgers), brewery (Hop Knot is outstanding), and sports bar (just look at all the TVs).

I love the idea of pairing menu items with various beer selections.  I've tried several of their combination suggestions, and they've always been spot-on!
