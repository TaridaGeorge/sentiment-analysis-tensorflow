THE JUMP OFF! As a new Arizonian a friend suggested this pace for live music and non pretentious dance. This is the kind off place where people go who know. A tiny dance floor with eclectic characters from all walks of live surrounding and coming in and off the dance floor with their date when the funky beat touches them right. The music is on point ranging from Earth Wind and Fire to Blackstreet Boys. The band is fantastic and really collaborates with the crowd energy. Great date spot or if you have a group of friends that want to get down then here you go.
