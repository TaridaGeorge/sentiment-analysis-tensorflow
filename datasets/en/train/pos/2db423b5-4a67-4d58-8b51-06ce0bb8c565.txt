I have been meaning to write a review for this place for over 6 months, so I apologize for the delay. I have been in the store a few times and every time I ask the associate for help, they are extremely helpful and knowledgeable. This one particular time, the associate helped my find attire that mimic Janis Joplin for a party I was going to and she spent about 30 minutes with me right before closing time. Another time I had to do a return and it couldn't have been easier. It is Stein Mart so the selection will be hit or miss, but I have always found consistent and excellent customer service.
