An absolute delicious dinner paired with a romantic atmosphere. I couldn't have asked for a more wonderful experience at Caf√© Monarch. The waiter was extremely courteous and knowledge. As for chef Chris he was a pleasure and sat and chatted with my date and I as well as another couple. I would certainly recommend this restaurant for many reasons but above all the food was outstanding.
