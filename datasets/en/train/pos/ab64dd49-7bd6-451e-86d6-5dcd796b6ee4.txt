Probably my new fav Greek spot(just wish it was closer to my side of town, but SO worth the drive).

Where to even start.... i guess by saying that everything was f*%$ing delicious! i mean everything.. the hummus, Greek fries, gyro club sandwich, the chicken, rice, potatoes...just fantastic!

i will be back again very, very soon. 

A lot o food so be prepared to take home boxes. Also they guys that work here are very nice...so if you have questions about any the food they will be more than happy to explain them to you and not get annoyed while doing it :)

why are you still reading this.. just go eat here already! you won't regret it. Cross my heart and hope to die.
