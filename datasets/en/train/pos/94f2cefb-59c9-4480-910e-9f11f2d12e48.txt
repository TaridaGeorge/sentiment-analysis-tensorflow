What a fantastic place! I came in around 7:30 on a Tuesday night, in a hurry to get some good grub before meeting someone at 8. I told the waitress this and she was extremely prompt the whole time. The food came out quickly as well and was great. I got the day's special - California rolls with spicy tuna on top, which they called a Boston Roll.

I made sure to leave a nice tip due to the great service. I'll have to come back again some time so I can relax and enjoy the ambiance rather than rushing through.

And yes, I was on time to my 8 o'clock.
