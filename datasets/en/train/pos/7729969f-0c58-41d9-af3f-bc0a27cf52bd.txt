Jay, the owner of healthy and clean, came to my house to clean my carpet in two rooms. He arrived on time and did great work (my carpet looks brand new). He's honest and friendly. He is someone I won't hesitate to recommend to my friends and family. He also guarantees his work for 30 days, which is nice! Will be calling him soon to do the rest of my house plus my grout.

Again, highly, highly recommend!!
