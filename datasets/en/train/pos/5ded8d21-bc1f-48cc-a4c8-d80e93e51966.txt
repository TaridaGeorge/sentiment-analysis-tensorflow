I love costumes! I mean I really love costumes.  Halloween is just ONE of the occasions I find to dress up. Don't forget about Mardi Gras, Talk Like a Pirate Day and of course the Renaissance Festival.  I also do makeup for a friend who does indy Zombie movies.  So shopping for Make Up and such is a fairly common event in my world.  

Fun Services has almost always, for over 10 years, had what I need.  In addition to having a great stock of wigs, theatrical quality makeup, costumes and accessories, the staff is awesome.  If you aren't sure what you need, they will help you.  You can explain what effect you are going for, and they will totally geek out with you to help you plan.  It's like brainstorming and buying at the same time!
