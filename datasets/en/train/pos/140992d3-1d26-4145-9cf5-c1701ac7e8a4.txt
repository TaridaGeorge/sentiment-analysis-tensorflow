First of all I would like to give a huge shout out to the ladies at AZ Laser in Glendale, Arizona.  I've had Laser done in various areas and so content with the services at this location.   I purchase a package of 5 treatments and to this day I'm overwhelmed with my results.   During my visits I also invested in the beauty of my face.  
The Ethetician gave me the best consultation regarding my skin and the beauty of myself.  I walked out feeling refreshed.  "Just a note" I walked into work the next day the girls were asking why I looked so vibrant of course I shared AZ Laser with them.  I would highly recommend anyone considering Laser and enjoying getting pampered by the best. 

Happy with my results and AZ Laser.
