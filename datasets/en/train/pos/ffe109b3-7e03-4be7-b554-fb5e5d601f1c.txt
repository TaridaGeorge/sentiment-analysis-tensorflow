Wow! 
The staff was attentive and friendly. The server was excited to share his input and help make an informed decision. The food was unreal!!! We had green chile kettle with tortillas.. It was amazing!!! We tried the restaurant week menu and had oven roast shrimp and grits with bacon. So so good. My gf had half a rotisserie chicken with corn bread stuffing and I had almond crusted rainbow trout. We could not stop eating!! This place is a must visit!! Don't miss out. The prices are decent too because the quality of the food and service is so un-parrelled it is rare.

Loved it.
