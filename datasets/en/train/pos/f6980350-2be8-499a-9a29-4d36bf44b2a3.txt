This is a grocery store like I have never seen before! Valet parking or covered spaces for those that park themselves. Once your inside you almost forget you are in a Fry's. Feels more like a high end whole foods or AJ's, but still with Fry's prices. Too bad it wasn't closer to home. I wouldn't mind filling up my cart here more often.
