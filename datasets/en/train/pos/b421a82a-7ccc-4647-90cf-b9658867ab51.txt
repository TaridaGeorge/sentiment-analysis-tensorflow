first off i just love the atmosphere, so cool that it had a waterfall and the walk up entrance is like you're entering a cavern on a wooden ramp, awesome!! n then there are hanging bats from the ceiling, so cute!! I had to go all out and try the enchantment platter which consisted of chili releanos, a blue avodaba burrito, and tamale ...to top it off delicious red and green sauce covered the delectables as well as melted cheese mmm, with tasty black beans on the side 
....the highlight of the evening had to have been when my dad, new to places reviewed by yelp was in awe of his chimichanga and had proclaimed it was by far the best he had ever had!!! what a night :D
