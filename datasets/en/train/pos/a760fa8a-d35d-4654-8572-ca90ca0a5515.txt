Our family LOVED the Pizzas.  The staff was very friendly to us.  We ordered Pepperoni & Sausage and a Cheese Pizza. The crusts was crunchy!  Even the bottom of the pizza!  By far the best meal we had on our AZ vacation.  Too bad we found it on our last night.  We will be back again next year during our Spring Training vacation.  Leaving there left me craving more!   It was not crowded and it was quiet.  Very comfy and casual.
