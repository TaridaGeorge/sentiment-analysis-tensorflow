I love Big 5 for shoes & buy almost all of mine here.  This location in particular is one of the real good ones (some stores are smaller), & my most recent purchase was a backup pair of their "Rugged Exposure Journey Plus" shoes.  I've been buying these here at Big 5 (sometimes with Velcro straps, sometimes with laces), for a number of years, & always for $19.99 on sale.  The regular price is $54.95.

These shoes are comfortable right out of the box & last me a couple of years, wearing them pretty much every day.  Most of the men's shoes here run about $55, but are on sale about one week out of three for as little as $17!  Jeromy H. joined me here today, & bought himself a pair of killer $50+ work boots for $20.

Great place here!     :-))
