No matter what event you come to AWA or US Airways (whatever) for, you're going to have fun.  There's just something about this place...you really can't have a bad time.  I'm with Jake about the opening for the Suns, it's awesome and just really pumps up the fans.

You do have a ton of food choices, but they're mainly of the fast food variety.  You can get Pizza Hut, Burger King, Starbucks and more- they're all there in their artery clogging glory.  Beer is never more than a few feet away and peddlers even come to you with it when you're sitting in your seat.
Perfection.
