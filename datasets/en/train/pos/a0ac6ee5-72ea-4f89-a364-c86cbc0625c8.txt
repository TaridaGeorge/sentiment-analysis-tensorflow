This place is a fantastic nursery.  The people there are always very helpful and knowledgeable.  Berridge Nurseries isn't exactly the cheapest place to get things like soil and fertilizer, but the prices on roses and veggies are competitive and I feel like the overall quality is much better than you could find at a place like Home Depot.

It's also just a great place to wander around with the kids.  The extensive selection of roses in particular, is wonderful.
