Kazimierz is a pretty amazing place that makes you feel like you've traveled back in time to the Prohibition.  The front door is actually in the back; look for a conspicuous wooden sign over a wooden door, step inside the dimly lit building, and you'll be there!

They have a pretty fantastic wine list (and other libations), and some great food items to pair with the wines.  They have a few couches that are mostly used for table reservations, and a decent number of chairs and smaller tables scattered throughout the place (on a busy night, it might be a little hard to find seating).

Whether you're looking for the perfect way to kick off or cap an evening out, it's a pretty safe bet that Kazimierz will be what you are looking for.  After all..."the truth is inside".
