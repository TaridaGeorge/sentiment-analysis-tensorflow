This is my favorite starbucks probably because I go here about 3 times a week. The staff are also super friendly and know me by name. You can tell they make a point to remember your name and your drink if you are a regular. And they always have a smile on your face and ask about your day. Now parking.. probably isnt the best for this location (wouldnt know because I always walk). There is plenty of seating and the bar is off to the side so you dont have to get your extras around a crowd of people. Keep it up!!
