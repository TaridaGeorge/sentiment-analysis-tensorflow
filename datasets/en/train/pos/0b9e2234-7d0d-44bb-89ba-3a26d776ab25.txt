I have never given a pizza a 5 star rating except in Italy.  This place is so wonderful we went back twice on our weeks vacation for the Giants spring training. The pizza is just  the best we ever had.  We ordered a small size with tomatoes and basil and it was big enough for the two of us with a piece left over. We each ordered a small salad ($5.) and they were big, we should have listened to our waitress who said they were big enough for two.  If you love real Italian pizza with fresh mozzarella and incredible home made sauce cooked in a brick oven like they do in Italy, go here and enjoy!  The only problem is we can't get anything this good in California.
