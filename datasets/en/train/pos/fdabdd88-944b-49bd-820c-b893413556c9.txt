The staff here is the friendliest of any record store I've been to in a long time. They helped my friend pick out a record player and gave us great recommendations of other cool shops to check out while we were visiting phoenix.

The store is pretty big and has a great selection of records. 

Check out the David Hasselholf calendar in their office!
