One of the most impressive spots in town. 

Lunch here is a luxury experience - the grounds are amazingly beautiful, and the menu surprisingly affordable. Try this for an inexpensive way to really impress a business client.

For dinner they will take your shorts, though it is certainly worth it if you desire a truly memorable, elegant evening. Life is too short - try this restaurant soon!

I have yet to stay here (Royal Palms hotel) - but it is definitely on my list of 1001 things to do before I expire.
