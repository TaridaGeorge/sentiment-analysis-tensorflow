My gf and I just tried the Oggie bc we werent super hungry.  Even with that, the food was super yummy.  I wonder what would happen to us if we are actually starving.  the sauce that came with the Oggie was excellent too, so I suggested that you shouldnt eat the pasty without the sauce.  The decoration in the store is quite unique: church pews and wall and table deocrations.  It's a must go if you are around the area.
