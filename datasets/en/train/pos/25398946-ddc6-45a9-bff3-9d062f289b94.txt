I can't get enough of this place! I heart the spinach and goat cheese chicken sandwich! Oh my delicious.  I've had their burgers before and they are okay.  But boy do they have kick ass chicken burgers.  The other day I also tried their seasonal salted caramel milkshake! I died and gone to Haagen Daaz heaven.  I highly recommend this place and don't forget to get on their email list.  They have great deals sent to your email!
