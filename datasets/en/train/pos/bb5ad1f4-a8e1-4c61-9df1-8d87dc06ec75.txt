Food awsome! My boyfriend and I ended up having 7 different plates. Oy Vay we were stuffed but very happy. Favorite was a sashimi with roasted garlic oil. least favorite had a ton of wonderful mushrooms. 

Everything was wonderful from the service to the food. The portions for tappas is fairly large and the food is protein heavy so it really does fill you up. I would recomend this place to anyone with more refined tastes. I can't say enough about it!
