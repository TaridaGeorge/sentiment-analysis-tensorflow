Weekends in March at scottsdale stadium is close to heaven on earth. ok, well its not that good.
Even though the lawn seats are the priciest in the cactus league, they are the best.  Trees provide some shade in the grass.  people watching here is the best.

Great location in old town so there is plenty of great eats and bars for pre/post game celebrations (salty's is extremely popular and the patio is full even at 10 am, they do have a free shuttle to the game, although its very walkable)  
Be prepared, while it is one of the biggest stadiums in the league, it sells out every weekend, and while there are scalpers, its definitely a sellers market, be prepared to pay
