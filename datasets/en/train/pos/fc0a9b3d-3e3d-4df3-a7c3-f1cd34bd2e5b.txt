Oh my oh my!

Ok after my first experience with Korean style FroYo was with the original PinkBerry in LA. It was great, it lived up to the hype and more. But it changed my life. I wanted to have it here in AZ. 

It's been years since PinkBerry opened and yet still no sign of them here in the Valley. I have been searching and trying all that come here and I have found the one!

This place is just as or better than PinkBerry. I love the price, the toppings and flavors. In fact writing this is making me want to get some. The mochi toppings, chocolate chips and strawberries with original flavor is absolute perfection. 

I recommend this to any person old or new. By far the best and they have multiple locations.
