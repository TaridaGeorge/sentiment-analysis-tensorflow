Went on a Saturday night for dinner. My server told me it was still happy hour till 6pm. I was able to get a wonderful glass of wine for $5 and ordered my starter and pizza. The food was amazing and the staff was really nice and professional. I was also able to enjoy life music which they have every Saturday night.  What a great evening !!
