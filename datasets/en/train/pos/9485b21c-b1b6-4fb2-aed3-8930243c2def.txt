Let me be very clear on this. AJ's is the best chain supermarket you will ever go to. The food quality is second to none. The fresh meat/seafood selections most notably the Kobe beef burger, sirloin beef burger, beef/chicken kabobs, and Chicago hot dogs can make anyone look like they can grill. AJ's equally excels in their deli. They make some of the best sandwiches and their chutney chicken salad is exceptional. I'm not even going to get into their hot prepared meals or their sushi as I could go on and on.

AJ's has no weaknesses (except for their high prices) and many strengths. AJ's makes the Central Market (DFW area) or Whole Foods (anywhere) look like a soup kitchen. If you want quality from a chain supermarket and are willing to pay the price AJ's is your one stop shop.
