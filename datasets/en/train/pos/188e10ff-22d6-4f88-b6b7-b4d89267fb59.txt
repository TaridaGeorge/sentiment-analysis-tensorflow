For some reason, I prefer dining here for lunch more than dinner.  I love their salads and the daily specials are typically creative and delicious.  I typically get the beef tenderloin salad, and my husband opts for anything seafood.  I really enjoy sitting outside and find their indoor area rather stuffy.   Be sure to try the raspberry ice tea and save room for dessert.  This place never disappoints!
