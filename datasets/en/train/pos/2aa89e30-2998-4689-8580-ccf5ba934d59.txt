Hailing from Chicago and New York, my boyfriend and I thought there was no way pizza in the middle of Arizona could even compare. Well, insert foot into mouth. Or rather, just insert some more of Oregano's pizza into my mouth! 

Mmm mmm! Get the guac-a-tony. I know what you're thinking. Italians? Pizza? Guacamole? Really? Yes, really. They serve typical guacamole, but instead of tortilla chips you get a 14-inch pizza crust topped with a thin layer of parmasean cheese to scoop up all of the avocado-y goodness. Salivating yet? You should be. Beware! It's a HUGE portion. Made more for four than for two, but we held our own. Pizza itself was phenom. Thin, crispy, great flavor in the sauce. My only regret was that we ate so much guac-a-tony that we couldn't eat more pizza. Hopefully there's a next time if I'm ever back in Scottsdale!
