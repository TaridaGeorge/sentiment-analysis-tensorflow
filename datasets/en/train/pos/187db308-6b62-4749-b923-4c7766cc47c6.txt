Still great, and I still get drunk here occasionally. This is the only place I can go, and feel completely comfortable eating and drinking by myself. Because I have Masa, and/or James, or Jun, or Eddie to talk to. And if Yoshie isn't busy, she will come say hi and see how I am.

Tonight was exceptionally busy, but everyone still remembers me here and treated me thusly. Beers were poured and it was, as the cooler kids say (i try to learn these new phrases and coming out of my mouth it just sounds weird), "thats wassup". 

The Aji was still available tonight (normally gone on Friday night!), and sold out shortly after I ordered it. Happy to have eaten, happy to have gotten buzzed off of copious amounts of plum wine, while watching baseball on tv. Can't get any better than that...you just can't.
