It's called Bunky, which rhymes with funky, which is a great description of this, off the beaten path, semi-new downtown fashion, jewelry, all around cool shop.

Housed in the alley behind its address, if you take the time to find it, it will likely pay off.

Rachel (sp?) the owner, ultra cute, and full of charm, much like her shop.

Great place for cool gifts and cool fashions.
