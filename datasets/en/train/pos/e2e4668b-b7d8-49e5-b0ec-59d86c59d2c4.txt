Divaz is the perfect place to find something cute to wear out.  I have gone in there several times in a pinch and always find what I am looking for.  The owners stock their stores with cute, trendy but wearable items.  They do a great job selling the latest styles but they sell brands that aren't crazy expensive.  I like the Tempe Marketplace location because its easy to park at that end of the mall and get in and out.  Plus their staff is actually nice and super helpful.
