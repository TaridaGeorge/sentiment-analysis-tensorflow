I have been a patient at Warner Family Practice for 10+ years bouncing from doctor to doctor, as their turnover rate is high.   All that has changed since I started seeing Dr. Crandall. She is a compassionate doctor who listens to me and does not come across as in a rush to see her other patients. I would highly recommend Dr. Crandall as she is a great asset to Warner Family Practice!
