YAY, BOBA!  I lived in the Korea Town area of Los Angeles for 2.5 years and loved it.  While there I developed a serious Boba addiction, thanks in part to the fact there was a great Boba spot on every corner.... literally.  Phoenix area.... not so much.  In fact, after moving here and seeing how things were as far as diversity, I figured my Boba days were over.

Enter Eba.  My life is changed.  Not only are their teas great, the price is right... $2.97 for a 24oz, plus staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  I recommend the Thai tea w/ Boba or the Red Bean with Boba.

Ok, here's the best part which separates this place from every other Boba spot in the East side.... SOY MILK.  Yes, they have soy milk and don't charge extra for it!  Awesome.
