I've always heard about Sprinkles but never had the chance to eat a cupcake here until now. Sprinkles is considered a cupcake pioneer, so I wanted to find out if it deserves the hype. It totally does!

The decorations are fairly simple and they offer at least 8-10 different flavors. The store is super clean and they have cute disposable wooden-looking forks/knives and spoons. 

I order the chocolate marshmallow cupcake and the Strawberry. The cake was moist and the frosting wasn't overwhelmingly sweet or heavy.

Average cupcake price is around $3.
