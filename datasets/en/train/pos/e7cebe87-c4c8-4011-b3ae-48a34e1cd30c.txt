We called this the Amoeba of liquor stores. 

The guy working really knew what he was talking about, we were able to get a keg and co2 on the spot, and the selection of beers was outstanding... In all price rages.

I didn't even venture to the tequila isle, but I could spend hours in here. Open a store in SF!
