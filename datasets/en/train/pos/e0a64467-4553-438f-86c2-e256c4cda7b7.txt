Me Likey Wingy!

I have not been to this new location yet. 

The old location was a pit. a hole, the ghetto of restaurants, this location was filthy funk nasty! But dammit the wings were outstanding! 

There were plenty o night I would travel down 7th ave to McDowell to retrieve a dozen of these delectable delights! The fries are good too! 

Now that they have moved I need to check out the new location. In it's place there has been erected yet another chain restaurant. Pei Wei and Starbucks together. WTF??? Can I get a Rice bowl and a Latte? : P
