First time at this spot just outside Gainey Ranch, but the food was amazing.  We shared an appetizer and then each chose an entree to split family style.  Everything surpassed our expectations (including the service).  We ordered 'Miang Kum' which are fresh cut mustard leaf wrap of roasted coconut, shrimp and sweet palm.  The main courses, though, were what is going to keep us coming back: 'Panang Neur'  which was panang red curry with beef short ribs;  'Kang Gari' the roasted chicken in yellow curry; and the pineapple fried rice.
