Just about as good as it gets for a fun day with the little ones. Expansive grassy areas to run around. A city playground with equipment for all ages. Nice little snacks shops with decent food and good ice cream. A fun carousel. Pleasant staff. Great little ramadas for picnics and birthday parties.

But most of all... chugga chugga chugga chugga WOO WOOOOO! TRAINS!

The under-construction Model Railroad Exhibit is super cool too, and free for the whole first year.

Weekends in this beautiful weather (November) are VERY busy. Weekdays are a breeze though.
