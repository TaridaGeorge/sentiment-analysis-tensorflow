Seriously, some of the best food I've ever had! Super great. The shrimp appetizer was to die for, I mean it. I ended up having the special of the night, which was lamp chops. OMG! I was so full, but couldn't stop eating it. I practically licked my plate! The prices are expensive, but so totally worth it, especially for a special occasion. I almost forgot...  the bread they give you as a starter thing, excuse my french... HOLY S*$T. I cannot explain to you how great this bread is. I mean seriously, we ended up being the white trash people who asked for one more dinner roll, because it was like 'last meal of your life' type good. (and gluten free for those with celiac - so everyone can try this little bit of heaven)!! Go here on an empty stomach and ENJOY!
