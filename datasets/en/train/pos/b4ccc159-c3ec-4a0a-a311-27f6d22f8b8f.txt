Well, now I get why my family is always stopping here for a treat.  The custard rocks and is amazing.  I was especially impressed that I saw that Rita's supports local PTA's in the area.  Keep up the community involvement, and keep up the great product!

Service was friendly too when I went in.  It is always great to see counter help that does not look like they would rather be somewhere else. Work should be fun right?
