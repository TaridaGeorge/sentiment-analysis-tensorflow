I was there for dinner, got there around 7:00 pm, and this place was packed. I sit at sushi bar right in front of a chief who I believe is the owner. I ordered Okinawa Soba, which I think not too many people order that, so it might take some time for them to cook. I was waiting for about 10 - 15 minutes, the chief gave me some beans to chew on to kill time. I was impressed.
I would suggest to make reservation or at least call to make sure that you don't need to wait for a table.
