GREAT burritos.

Favs is the place i go whenever i have that itch to satisfy my weekly burrito fix. I always get a bean burrito with rice and guac and hot carrots on the side. Their food is excellent and vegetarian friendly (i've been told,) the service is good and bilingual, and the place is always clean and smelling of fabuloso!
