My wife and I have been to Bliss several times and haven't had a bad experience- both brunch and dinner. Ive tried several different items on the menu. The grilled cheese with pears, pot roast, pork chops, sea bass (fish of the day), omelet, fried ravioli were all delicious. The pot roast is my favorite. For desert Ive had the cobbler and the brownie sundae. My least favorite was the skewers- while still good I didn't enjoy whatever the default sauce was they used- it was a bit heavy. I would recommend changing to one of the other sauces they offer. The few times Ive gotten mixed drinks they were always mixed well. Highly recommended!
