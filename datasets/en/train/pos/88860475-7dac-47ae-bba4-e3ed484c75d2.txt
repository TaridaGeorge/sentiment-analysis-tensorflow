I Love D. Frank Designs! Its one of my favorite stores ever. Debbie - the owner has a great eye for fantastic decor pieces. She buys mostly from LA- based designers...but the store has a great eclectic mix  to suit everyone's design tastes. There are big furniture pieces and smaller gifty items. I love going in there and just browsing and getting inspired. They have recently put in a dessert bar which I think is just genius! Debbie is an interior designer who does home consultations and since I just bought one I can't wait for our consultation. She only charges $75 an hour which I think is very resonable. Two thumbs up for D. Frank Designs :)
