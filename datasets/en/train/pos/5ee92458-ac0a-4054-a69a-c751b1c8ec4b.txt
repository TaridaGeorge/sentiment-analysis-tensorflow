If you're in the mood for froyo, do yourself a favor and check this family business out.

We've been here a few times and have been greeted by friendly staff with little sample cups so we can try out a new flavor or two before filling up our bowls.  So far the caramel is the family favorite. I also noticed they had a flavor of yogurt that sported even fewer calories than regular frozen yogurt. I had to check it out and I thought it tasted great!  Of course, I ended up restoring the missing calories by spooning some chocolate bar goodness into my bowl...  It was worth it.

They've got a multitude of toppings and run special discounts on certain days. On one day they'll cut you a discount if you ride or bike to the store. I thought that was pretty cool.

We'll be back!
