One of my fav's.. different from all the surrounding trendy clubs, Giligin's offers a more relaxed, fun environment surrounded by 80's music and other classic pop hits. So stop by and spin the drinking wheel and molest the wooden sea maiden on the wall by the bathroom.. everyone else does! oh, yeah, if your gonna put some beers away, just drink out of a pitcher - by far the best deal.
