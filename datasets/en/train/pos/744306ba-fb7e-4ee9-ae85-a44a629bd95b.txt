Gluttonous and completely delicious...we did the lunch buffet with with my sister & brother in law plus 3 kids (the restaurant was very kid friendly minus the walk past the cigarette smoking blue hair contingency in the slot machine area)....

For lunch, they had a nice selection of prime rib and roasted chicken at the carving station.  Loads of shrimp + salmon and sea bass and a Mexican buffet area.  The deserts were amazing (had to do 1 slice of coconut cream pie and 1 slice of banana cream pie because I couldn't decide).  They also have a very nice selection of gelato.  Overall, it was a Vegas quality buffet for a fraction of the cost ($12.95 per person).
