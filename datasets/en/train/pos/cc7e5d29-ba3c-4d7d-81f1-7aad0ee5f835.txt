Ok. I have to give a shout out to the guy working the ticket booth. Me and my friend Megan almost peed our pants we were laughing so hard. Plus, he gave us student prices without hesitation. BIG perk. He made us feel young. Plus, I think he had a man-crush on my boyfriend... that's a compliment, right?
