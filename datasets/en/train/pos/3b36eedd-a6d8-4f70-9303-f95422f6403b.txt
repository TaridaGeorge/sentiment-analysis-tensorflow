This is one of my favorite chain restaurants. It is always excellent. The sausage orzo soup is a great starter, lots of stuff in it. The Rigatoni D is one of the best pasta dishes outside italy! Great atmosphere, good drink selection. My mom had the chicken and spinach manicotti with red sauce instead of white and it was delicious as well.
