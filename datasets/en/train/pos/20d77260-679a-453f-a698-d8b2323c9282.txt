Love Flo's!  Good food, inexpensive and quick!  I have been going to Flo's for lunch for quite a while now.  They do indeed have a new menu, but still have all the lunch time favorites available, you may have to ask for them if you don't see them on the menu.  You can get salad, rice and an entree for lunch for around $7.  Their food is so delicious you will want to eat the entire meal in one sitting, but I always try to save some for leftovers.  I am really picky about Asian food, and this restaurant tops my list!
