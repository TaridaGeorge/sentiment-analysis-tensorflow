The absolute BEST cornbread... chicken fried steak... catfish... sweet potatoes... mac and cheese... and sweet tea in the ENTIRE VALLEY!

If you go in...... be sure to order the cornbread... chicken fried steak... catfish... sweet potatoes... mac and cheese... and sweet tea...

If you end up bringing a guest (which you SHOULD do)...... make sure they order the cornbread... chicken fried steak... catfish... sweet potatoes... mac and cheese... and sweet tea...

Next time I'm downtown, I think I'm gonna change it up and go for the cornbread... chicken fried steak... catfish... sweet potatoes... mac and cheese... sweet tea......... and dessert!

Cheers!
