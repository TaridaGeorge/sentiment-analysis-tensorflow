Seriously?!

I can go to a restaurant...... in ARIZONA......

... and get fried chicken... waffles... mac and cheese... cover the whole stinkin' thing with syrup... and wash it down with red Kool-Aid in a mason jar?!

Are you sure that's not just a dream I had once?!

Nope... it's REAL!

Head over to Lo-lo's...... just print out my review and order EXACTLY that and follow instructions with the syrup, okay?

No... the Kool-Aid isn't strawberry... it's not cherry... forget about watermelon...... it's just RED (true story).
