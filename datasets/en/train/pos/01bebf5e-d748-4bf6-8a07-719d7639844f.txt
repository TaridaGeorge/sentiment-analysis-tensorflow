I think this was the first place in AZ where I felt at home.  being from Oregon, great micro-breweries are a dime a dozen and my dad is an avid brewer.  Long story short, I was skeptical.  Me and My hubby LOVED it!  We felt right at home and tried every beer.  They have an AWESOME IPA and I really enjoyed the kilt-lifter.  To top it off the food was great too.  DO IT!
