Dinner last night had all the ingredients for misery if even one thing wasn't perfect.  The group I was with was full of picky eaters and loud complainers.  Zinc did everything right, service was amazing, and dinner was a huge success.  Put it this way - my son claimed his meal was "Like the second coming of Christ".  Uh - ok, at least he liked it!  

Every item we ordered was amazing, from the flat iron steak to the chateaubriand for two to the lamb shank, from the chocolate souffle to even the green beans which turned out to be a hit, "Mom, I would eat your green beans if they tasted like this."  Zinc is a great date spot, but is also good for older children because there's a good selection of "normal" food and staff are accommodating to kid-like requests such as sauce on the side.
