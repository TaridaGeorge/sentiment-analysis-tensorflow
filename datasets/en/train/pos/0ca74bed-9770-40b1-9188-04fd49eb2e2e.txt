Apparently, Yumminess is in the mouth of the beholder.  I LOVE Caketini and make a point to stop by every time I am at the mall.  I keep reading other posts comparing them to Sprinkles...me personally, I dont like Sprinkles.  I think that they are small, chinzy on frosting, dry and overpriced.  Caketini, on the other hand, has large, soft cupcakes with lots of great frosting which is not a buttercream or a whipped...its kind of in between so its not too sweet but very light.  My favorites are the Salted Caramel and the Coconut.  The Caramel cupcake has just enough salt that you get a little crunch.  I would say to try it for yourself and make up your own mind....

By the Way, there are 2 locations at the mall:  a kiosk by H&M and an actual store upstairs by the entrance to Nordy's.
