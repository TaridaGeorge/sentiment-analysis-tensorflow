Went to North with my family of 11, including the under 7 crowd. We had a good table near the kitchen, so the kids (and adults) could watch the pasta being made. Everything I tasted was really good, including:
o Raviolini, pork with lemon preserves tastes so fresh.
o Tortelinni
o roast pork
o beet salad, also,with a hint of lemon
o short ribs w/ gnocchi 
Save room for dessert! The budino, salted caramel and bombolini (essentially donuts) we're fabulous.
The wait staff was very attentive and good. The ambience was modern and not pretentious, with a good mix of families and others.
Definitely would go back.
