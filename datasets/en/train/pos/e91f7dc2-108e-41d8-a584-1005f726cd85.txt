Love this farm! It is wonderful to live so close to a farm that allows kids and adults alike to learn about a working dairy, pet/feed rescued farm animals, learn about eating locally, and have many classes and camps throughout the year. Selling milk, cheese, and ice cream. Wednesday chicken dinner is a-ma-zing. I can't wait for the new grill to open!
