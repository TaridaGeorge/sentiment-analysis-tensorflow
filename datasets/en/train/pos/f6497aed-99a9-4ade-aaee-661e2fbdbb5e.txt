It is hard to find a place that delivers late Downtown. Z Pizza saved my life! I was really sick at home and needed to eat but could not leave my bed. I didn't want just pizza. I noticed Z Pizza had salads, sandwiches, etc. I was able to order online.... adding/removing any ingredients I wanted. They delivered within 30 minutes and the food did NOT taste like take-out. My calzone was fresh and amazing...as was my salad. 

I highly recommend dining in or taking out from Z Pizza! They make life easy, and might I add, HEALTHY if you'd like. You can substitute veggie burger crumbles or wheat crust on pretty much anything. Last but not least: the staff was incredibly friendly.
