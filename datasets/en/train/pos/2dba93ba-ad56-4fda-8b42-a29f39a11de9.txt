This place just opened and what a nice treat, great BBQ !
I live in the Mill Ave area and have tried ALL the local eats in the area and this is some of the best BBQ I have had.  They redid the inside and they have about a dozen TVs in there now.

Nice place to have a beer and watch sports and the BBQ is AWESOME !
