Yupha's has the best drunken noodles ever!  I have been to multiple Thai restaurants around the Eawst Valley and they can't even compare to the flavor and spice that Yupha's has mastered!  The thing i love most is that this place focuses on flavor as much as the spice.  Too often I find other places do the opposite and all I can tatste is the peppers, which turns me off.

I try and branch out and try new places, but I always end up coming back here.  The satay is also worth the money, the chicken is excellent and the peanut sauce is just the right amount of sweetness.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality and I have no problem spending more money since I know it's the real deal.

I always recommend this place to my friends and it is a definite must in the East Valley.
