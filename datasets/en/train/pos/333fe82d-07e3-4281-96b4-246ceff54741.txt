Crossfit is a fantastic way to work out and it is hard to find anything that can provide such high yield workout in such short time, at that level of fun! And Crossfit 480 is a very unique place to work out - relaxed and welcoming atmosphere, superb equipment, good location. But more than anything else, the key value of Crossfit 480 is the level and quality of instruction one gets. And this is essential - i had no experience in weight lifting and the introductory sessions as well as ongoing input during every single workout is something that I have not seen anywhere else. The class size is also limited, which ensures high quality instruction and access to equipment. If you live in the area and have not tried Crossfit, check out this place - it is addictive.
