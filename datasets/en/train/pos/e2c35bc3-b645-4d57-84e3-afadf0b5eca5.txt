This is a great park.  The people I have met here are very good about picking up poop, taking care of their dogs, and very friendly.  This is independent of the hours I have gone.  I have my 3 Labs that love this place.  It's like Disneyland to them.  If you want to find a place to help a dog with socializing this is the place to do it.
