We had a problem with a kitchen outlet that the technician from Dodge was able to quickly diagnose and fix.  I found Dodge here on Yelp and called around noon.  My phone call was returned promptly and a technician arrived later in the afternoon.  He found a bad connection in one of our outlets and replaced our GFCI outlet.  I felt the price was very reasonable.

Electric work is something I wish I could do myself, but I know my limitations.  That's just stuff that needs to be done right.  I was impressed with the work I would definitely use Dodge again if we have an electrical problem.
