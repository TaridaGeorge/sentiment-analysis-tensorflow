This place was great.  My sister & I were in town for the weekend from Cali...and we wanted to find a fun happy place to eat.

This place had food that melted in your mouth...I got the prime rib.
We sat on the patio which was wonderful.  The waitress was great. She knew her stuff & kept an eye on us while taking care of other people.  

Great memories...thanks!
