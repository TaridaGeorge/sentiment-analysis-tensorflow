If I could afford it, I would live here. They've got everything!

Gourmet bakery (cases and cases of handmade pastries), local gelato (yum), espresso bar, sushi bar, fine alcohols, outdoor seating next to the BBQ lunch bar, nice produce, lots of meat choices (sadly, no buffalo though) nice people! 

Don't get up here very often, but last summer I spent a lot of time outside in their bistro tables, working on my microbiology homework. The outside area was the perfect setting for an iced latte, a muffin, and some hardcore learnin' about microbes.
