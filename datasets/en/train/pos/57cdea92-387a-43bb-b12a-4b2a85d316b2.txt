This quaint hidden bar/ cafe (not too sure what you would call it) is very welcoming. You order at the bar then you can decide to sit indoors or out. The inside is fitted with several retro cafe type tables. The outdoors is a garden of patio tables. The many trees and patio tables set an  intimate and romantic atmosphere to enjoy a glass or three of wine. (My boyfriend says they have the best Pims but who drinks that anyways). Perfect date place or for an after dinner cocktail to seal the deal ;) can't wait for winter to truly enjoy the patio and I still need to try the food it looks amazing.
