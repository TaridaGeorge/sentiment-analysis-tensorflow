Mu Shu is a great place for a fast pace lunch, and low key quiet dinner. 

The food is fresh, service is fast and friendly, and the restaurant is extremely clean.

I got the Stir Fry and it was a bowl of hot fresh veggies and your choice of meat. Its a great place to eat healthy food, but be careful you don't over eat cause the portions of food is incredible.

I heard the Mu Shu Wraps are awesome, and I'm gonna try it next time. Also, if you like spicy chinese food, you can always request for them to add spice to anything!
