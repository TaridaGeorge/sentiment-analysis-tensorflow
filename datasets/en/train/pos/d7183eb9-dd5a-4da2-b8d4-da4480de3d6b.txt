I made it out there by my lonesome yesterday. WICKED COOL! The drumming was amazing, the swordsmanship was cool, and the guy sculpting with wax was pretty neat. There was a large contingent of anime cos-players out, and it was fun to see all the costumes. And check out the Buddhist Temple's stand for some of the best yakisoba in town.
