Probably the best experience I've ever had with a company in the auto body/car business.  Jeremy gives honest and fair estimates and actually tries to save you money.  When I dropped my car off a few days later he remembered me by name and agreed to remove another small dent for free.  Then, there ended up being more body work than expected, but instead of charging me extra, he took care of the extra costs and kept to the original amount.  And finally, the work that was done was very very high quality. If you're looking for paint or body work don't go anywhere but here.
