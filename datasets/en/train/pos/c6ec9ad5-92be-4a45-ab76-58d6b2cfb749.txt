I always prefer to stay at a Holiday in Express any time possible because I love the rooms and the complementary buffet is very nice.  

I was introduced to this location because I needed to room in the area for a few hours for a Job Interview.  Called the front desk and they set me up with a room and a great rate.  Stayed long enough to take a quick nap, shower and was back out the door.

Was so pleased that when I got the job, I came back for a few days while searching for a place to live in the area. 

The staff is most wonderful and the owner is quite involved with the community.  We recommend that all of our guests stay here.  Thanks!
