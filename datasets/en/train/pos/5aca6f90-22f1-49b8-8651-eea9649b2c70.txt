I have been following the Diamondbacks since day one. I love going to the games and since the Allstar Game, the updated stadium is great. The food at the park lacks local flavor, but how exactly to you define local Phoenix cultural junk food? Just eat, drink, and enjoy the game. I still love it when the roof opens. I wish they would still play the roof opening music but there is something so peaceful about the slow quiet sliding of this huge machine. GO DBACKS! No stopping now!
