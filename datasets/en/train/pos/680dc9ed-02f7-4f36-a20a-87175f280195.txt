Love this place as a special weekend morning treat. My 6 year old would go there every weekend and the owner is always super nice to us.  Always pick something up when guests are in town.  The sticky buns, cinn rolls are a must.  The salty sweet combo is perfect.  Loaf of white bread is great too!  Go try it.  You'll be glad you did!
