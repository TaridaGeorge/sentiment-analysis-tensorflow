We needed some lactobacillus reiteri drops for my two month old grandson who was crying constantly from tummy pains.  The doctor had said they could be found at health food stores.  After wasted trips and numerous phone calls to every health food, vitamin store and pharmacy around we were unable to fnd any drops, just tablets and capsules.  Thanks to a Yelp thread I started in this area I was referred to this store where I found the powder form, and for less than half the price of the drops.  The clerks were knowledgeable and helpful, obviously knew their stock and health information.  They advised me on the proper dose and made suggestions.  I left very happy.  Now cross your fingers this product alleviates the poor little guy's discomfort!
