This place is wonderful. The good was so delicious and so cheap! My friend and I thought the prices could at least be double. She had scrambled eggs, toast and hash browns with coffee. I had the veggie hash with turkey sausage. There was fruit on both of our plates. Our bill was $10.93! I could not believe it! The service was friendly and you have the local downtown Phoenix feel to it. I am going to go back-more cool stuff on the menu like the pancakes!
