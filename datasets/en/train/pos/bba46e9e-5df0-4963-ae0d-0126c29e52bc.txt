My six year old daughter and I enjoyed a fun and memorable date night at Melting Pot last night. It was her first exposure to fondue and we had a blast eating great food and talking about her first three days of first grade. We starteed with a fantastic spinach and artichoke fontina & butterk√§se cheese fondue, then shared the "Land & Sea" (filet mignon, chicken and shrimp). Of course, when the dessert menu came out so did a bit more enthusiasm. She had never dreamed of seeing a pot of melted chocolate before. The looks on her face were priceless. She chose the "Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream" and it was crazy good. I'm looking forward to taking the whole family and to making this a more common stop on our date night calendar.
