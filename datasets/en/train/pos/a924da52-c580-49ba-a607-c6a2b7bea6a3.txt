This was the aboslute BEST breakfast I have ever had. Every single ingredient is so fresh and tasty. I ordered a cheese omlet with a side of pancakes. My sis and I shared it. We also got orange juice and coffee. We were in heaven! We did not have 1 single complaint. From the service to cleanliness to the food it was a 10!! If you are looking for a delicious breakfast experience THIS IS THE PLACE!! 

I plan on going back asap!
