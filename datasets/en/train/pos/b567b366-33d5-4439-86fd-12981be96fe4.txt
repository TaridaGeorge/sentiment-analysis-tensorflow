Lived in this place almost 3 years.  I love this place, the prices are reasonable for the sizes.  The office staff were wonderful, and friendly.  Whenever something needed to be fixed it was done efficient and correctly compared to other places I lived.  If I moved back to az, and rented this would be the place I would live.
