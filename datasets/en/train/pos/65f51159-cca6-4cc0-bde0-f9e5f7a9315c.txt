I heard about Valentina through a friend.  I will just say she is AMAZING!  She is reasonably priced, very friendly, and will have your garment ready by the time of your event-no problem.  She has altered several of my friends bridal gowns and bridesmaid dresses, and she has personally altered two of my bridesmaid dresses.  Valentina fixed a problem that I thought could not be fixed-she was very professional and made me feel confident that I would feel totally comfortable in what I was taking out the door with me.  Knowing someone like Valentina takes a huge weight off of my shoulders when it comes to having my bustline altered on more than one occasion for a special event.  I would highly recommend Valentina's altering services.  I will be back to give her more business and happily send my friends and fellow yelpers her way!!!
