Took someone out on a date here as per recommendation from a friend and was completely blown away! Their pizza is the best I've had in a long LONG time, accompanied by fantastic wine and some great company =) The service was boast-worthy and the establishment is a quaint little atmosphere that can cater to your needs; giving you a great place if you look dress-casual for a nice night of drinks or shorts and a t-shirt if you're just looking for some good eats and a relaxing night off. Cibo is really a gem!
