AMAZING FOOD!! I actually worked here at this exact location for 6 years. I have eaten every item on the menu. Everything that Islands servers is prepared and made with perfection! The service is friendly and pleasant and best of all its FAST! Islands is a great place for a nice lunch or fun dinner. The lively and tropical atmosphere really sets this restaurant apart from any other. i could strongly urge anyone with a appetite!
