Our office found this on Yelp today and popped over for a quick lunch.  The owner was at the register and named the Gyro, Italian Beef and Philly Steak as their top choices.

We all were craving gyros and got the Gyro Meal.  French Fries were crispy and fluffy and the onion rings were the right kind of greasy and crunchy.

The gyros were fantastic.  Among the best any of us have ever had.  Lots of real meat, just enough sauce and a little messy.

We took a menu back and will be returning soon.

Service, Cleanliness, Quantity & Quality all earned top marks!
