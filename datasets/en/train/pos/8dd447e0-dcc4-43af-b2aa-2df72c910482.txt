I have now purchased my chicken feed from this group three different times and I could not be happier!  The quality is incredible!  You can really see a difference in the feed we purchase from our local feed store and the feed purchased from this co-op.  This feed smells fresh, you can see actual pieces of real food, and it's organic.  It makes me feel good to know that my chickens are getting a great quality feed and I do not have to spend a fortune to provide it for them.  The pickup location is not the most convenient for my family, but we do not mind driving a little out of the way for the quality and cost savings.  If you have chickens, I would definitely recommend giving this co-op a try.
