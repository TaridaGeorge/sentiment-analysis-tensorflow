If you're here for lunch, do the lunch combo: mixed tempura and fried oysters!

Sushi is great here is well. The atmosphere is kinda tight and noisy but during lunch hours on weekdays it is to be expected with all the business people who come here for feeding time. The lunch menu is decently priced and the food is great and the service is awesome.
