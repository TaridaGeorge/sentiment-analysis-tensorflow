TASTY DOGS!!!!!! One of the best hot dogs I have ever had!! It's a mom and pop own food stand. But well designed and friendly service. The price isn't to bad just make sure to bring cash though. But the way Brad and Kat make their gourmet hot dogs makes them stand out from the rest of those hot dog restaurants. Now if everyone can just convince them to open a store up and have more hours that would be AWESOME!!!
