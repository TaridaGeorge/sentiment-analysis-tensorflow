I switched my lawn service six months ago to Palms Away from the corporate lawn company I was using previously. It is great to have a local, family owned company who actually cares about my yard and keeps my yard looking top notch. They take care of all regular maintenance, fertilizing, and tree trimming. 

Marcy and her team pay attention to detail and go above and beyond. It is normal business for them to pull weeds by hand, do a final walk through each week, and tidy up my patio when they are done. 

It is great to come home on a Friday to a perfect lawn and see that the pool toys are picked up, the grill cover was put on the grill, and that the patio furniture is neatly arranged. 

Finally, a lawn company that cares!
