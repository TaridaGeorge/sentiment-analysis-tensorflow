I visited Arizona for vacation this summer and I came to MK Nova Salon to get a hair cut. I loved the staff that works there, they are very friendly and professional. I received the best hair cut ever. The owner of the salon is very friendly and nice. She brought be a cup of coffee and kept me entertained. When you go to the salon, you will receive the best service and they are very professional.
