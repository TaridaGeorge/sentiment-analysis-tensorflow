patrick b. asked and answered a great question....phx and history? hah!
to those naysayers, az was once crawling with native americans. we discovered to some depth last night at the Yelp event held here. 

it was such a wonderful night and we signed up for a behind the scenes tour of the archives. it's a really neat place, just like something you'd think indiana jones would be perusing. our docent was so friendly, funny, and informative. 

there are on-site ruins which we didn't see because it was dark, but some of their scale models are very cool! 

if you think phx has no history, stop by the museum and i'm sure they'd be happy to change your mind!
