I love this place! Good food great service.  I've eaten here about six times now. Every dish has its own flavor.so far everything we tried is delicious.  The mix drinks are so good and good ount of alcohol in it.  My favorite is the Mai Tai and scorpion.  Desert jade chowmein is the best. U have to order it. ... so far one of my favorite Chinese restaurant!
