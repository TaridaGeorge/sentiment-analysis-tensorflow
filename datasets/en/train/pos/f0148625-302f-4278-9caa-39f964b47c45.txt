The best Whole Foods in the Valley!! The store is gorgeous, the staff are hot, crunchy, sexy, granola types (totally worth the trip). The whole staff will BS with you and joke around, yet they are extremely knowledged on the food they sell. Some things can be a bit spendy ($25/lb for prosciutto)...but the cheese, the fruit, omg...And you can buy some vegan shoes while you're at it!!!
