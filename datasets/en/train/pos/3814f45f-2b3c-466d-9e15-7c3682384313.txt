Big thanks to Yelp for giving away free tickets to a friend who invited me to see Fiddler on the Roof. FANTASTIC!! I have never before been into musicals, but this was fabulous. Have I said how fantastic it was?! I truly enjoyed myself. Thanks Robyn! 

Gammage Auditorium is a great place. Easy to get to and I don't think there is a bad spot to sit. If you have to go to the bathroom, wait till after the show.
