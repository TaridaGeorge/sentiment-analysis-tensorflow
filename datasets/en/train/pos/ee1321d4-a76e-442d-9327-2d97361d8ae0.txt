every time i've come here, it has been a wonderful experience. the grounds are so, so, so beautiful. all the cactus gardens and walking paths and interpretive trails...it's all amazing. 

we've done the Luminaries, a Yelp Party, sent the parents here, and I've done 2 of their annual plant sales. which by the way are extremely well laid out and absolutely full of DBG experts that can answer any and all questions regarding the plants they are selling. like, did you know it's best to plant that new saguaro in the same facing direction as it was dug up from the garden? i did not know that! 

very cool place to check out, take out of town visitors, really anything!
