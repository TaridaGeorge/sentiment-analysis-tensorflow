Hands down the best Sichuan-style food in the Valley.  I've been to them all, I've been to Chongqing, Chengdu (many times), I know my Sichuan food.  This place nails it.  If you like Panda Express, this is not your kind of place.  If you like Yunan Garden in San Gabriel or Spicy City in Irvine, this is your kind of place.  My compliments to the chef.  It's been a long time since I felt this good about paying a dinner check.  I live 35 miles away and can't wait to go back.
