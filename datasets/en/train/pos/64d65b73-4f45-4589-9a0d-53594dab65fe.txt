Picazzo's is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in Tempe. They're located in a nice location, on the corner of Kyrene and Warner, and the decor reminds me of a cute European cafe. 

I love the pizza. They make several different varieties to choose from, and the slices are always large and fresh. The salads are also very delicious... instead of the bland iceberg lettuce version you often see, Picazzo's salads are so much better. The best is the pear and gorgonzola salad, which also has honey roasted walnuts and is sooo yummy. 

I first decided to go to Picazzo's when I heard of their lunch specials, where you can get a slice of pizza with a salad for a great price. The wait staff is always quick and friendly. Even if the restaurant is busy, they are polite and get people in and out in a timely manner.
