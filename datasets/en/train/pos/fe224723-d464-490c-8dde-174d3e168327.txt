I am a pretty good judge of Indian food and this is probably the best Indian food in the valley.  I really like the restaurant decor which is unusual as Indian restaurants usually have awful looks to them.  The food is delish.  They even served Mango chutney without charge-love.  I personally get the butter chicken and lamb biriani and really really liked it.  The service is great when we go on a Sunday night.
