I had a very nice dinner here recently with a large group of people.  The waiter clearly knew his stuff, had a charming accent, and made excellent recommendations.  I wasn't very hungy, so he suggested the beet salad with goat cheese.  It was excellent, as was the bread they served with olive oil.  The cocktails and wine were reasonable and delicious, and the owner served us all complimentary guapa after dinner and came over to thank us for coming in.  We had a conversation on the patio afterwards, and he was clearly passionate about good food and scottsdale, and I'm thankful that he has moved into the neighborhood.  Will definitely return for dinner with the BF.
