Simply the best Persian food in town! I used to live in Los Angeles and frequented the many lovely Persian establishments in Westwood. My favorite dish has always been tahdig (crispy rice) with fesenjan (pomegranate stew). I tried tahdig at another Persian restaurant in town and it didn't meet my expectations. And then I found Tasty Kabob. The tahdig is absolutely legit and I regularly get take out (worth a 15 minute drive from another city, holla). The family that owns the restaurant are lovely and treat their regulars like family, as well. Support a great family-owned business and try their fabulous food and hospitality.
