Last night my friend came over to watch the Dexter season finale and we decided to pick up food from Defalco's.  We decided to each pick something and share.  

I got the cheesesteak- brilliant.

He got an egg salad sandwich- idiot.

I was pissed I had to share with him.

Seriously, never agree to share your cheesesteak.  It is just too good.   

On a side note, their egg salad is just fine.  It's just not that good when you have all these flavors from a cheesesteak dancing around in your mouth.  Also, their sandwiches are larger than my head.  I have a big head, so that is saying a lot.
