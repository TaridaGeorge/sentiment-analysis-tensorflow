I've been into this Ace Hardware twice, and I have been treated well both times.  I was immediately greeted and asked if I needed help finding anything.  Sometimes this annoys me, but I was very appreciative both times.  During my visit today, I simply needed a stir stick for paint.  I looked around but couldn't find one on my own.  I asked the cashier, and she went behind the paint counter and retrieved me one.  I told her that I'd meet her at the counter to pay, but she said that it was free!  I was dumbfounded!  I'll definitely return to this store because of their excellent service.
