Please hurry up and go get some sweet sweet cupcakes from this great place. I don't want to lose them!! I can't believe that we finally have a delightful little bakery in our own backyard making delicious and original cupcakes. The size of the cupcake is perfect, the cake is moist, the frosting is creamy and decorative. I love that there are so many different flavors and colors. This place is clean and the staff is most helpful and very friendly. I think the price of $3 is just right compared to other cupcake places around the valley. Yippee!!
