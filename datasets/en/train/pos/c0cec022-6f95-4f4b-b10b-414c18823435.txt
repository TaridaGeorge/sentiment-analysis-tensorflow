Lens Crafters.....Sweet Tomatoes.....Target.....AMC theatre......Island Burgers.....Kohl's.....Just Sports.....Marshall's......Albertson's....Blockbuster....Sprint Store.....Gamestop.....you get my point. I have visited all these locations at Desert Ridge and this is by far is my favorite mall in the valley....not to mention it is only about 10 minutes from my apt....and 12 minutes from my job. Parking is good....but if you must go do it in the afternoon if you want to get in and out....because at night it gets real crowded there and traffic is a nightmare. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!
