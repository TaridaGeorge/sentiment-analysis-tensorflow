Stumbled across Zoes on our way out of town, we're touring musicians so fresh, fast, inexpensive food is super important to us on the road. We got excited as soon as we walked in the door. You could smell the freshness!

We had a hard time deciding, but I had the spinach wrap with chicken and Greg had the turkey reuben. Both were fabulous, and the fresh slaw with feta side was fantastic as well. We so wish we had a place like this at home!
