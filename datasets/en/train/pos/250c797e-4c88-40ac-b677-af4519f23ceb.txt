Timos is a hidden gem in North Phx. It's beautifully decorated, with a welcoming atmosphere and a terrific staff. The food is outstanding. Every tapas dish and entree I've tried has been scrumptious and they have a good selection of wine and beer. Or you can have Amy, the best bartender in Phoenix, whip you up a cocktail. Timos gets an unqualified 5 stars from me.
