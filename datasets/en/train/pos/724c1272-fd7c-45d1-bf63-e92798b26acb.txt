I thought I was going to have to go have horseshoes made for my hooves until I met Vicky!  I have been going to see her for over a year and she performs magic on my feet!  By far the best pedicure I have ever had.  She has a great selection of colors to choose from.  Bonus, does a great job waxing my eyebrows too... Can't wait for my first facial with her!
