Excellent food! I love love love it! Beautiful ambiance- tall bamboos, colorful walls - it is such a  positive place that just dining there refreshes my mind.
Now for the food, great selection of drinks, very nice lend of both chinese and thai menu, Love the taste of their crispy fried rice soup-sizzling sound too :). My favs are a lot of their spicy sauces and curries. Must try if you like asian food!

If they are too busy, service gets slow given that there ain't too many servers, but I go there to sit and dine at ease so no complaints. They have a small patio seating available as well and live music sometimes over the weekend.
