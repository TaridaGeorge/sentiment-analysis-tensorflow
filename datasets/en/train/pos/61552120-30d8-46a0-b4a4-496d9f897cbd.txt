When I'm not buying bargain-priced INC dresses at the Macy's at Fiesta Mall, I am buying bargain-priced dresses at the Dillards at Chandler Fashion Square.  They have a huge dress department with a great variety of designers.  And, of course, the best part is that they are always on sale and will probably have your size, even on the clearance racks. I'm not sure if that speaks to low sales volume, but it works for me.  A well-constructed Calvin Klein dress for under $30?  I'll take it.
