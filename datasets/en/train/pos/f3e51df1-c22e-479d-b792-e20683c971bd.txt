I had an employee that was looking to get an exam because he was having some serious difficulty with depth perception, so much so that it was making it challenging for him to drive. I wanted to help him out and pay for his exam and new glasses. Dr. Hostetler was able to help him out by finding the right prescription to get things back to good. My employee was extremely satisfied with his new glasses saying, "I feel like a new man now that I can see again! Thank you." All I did was pay for the services, the real thanks goes to Dr. Hostetler.
