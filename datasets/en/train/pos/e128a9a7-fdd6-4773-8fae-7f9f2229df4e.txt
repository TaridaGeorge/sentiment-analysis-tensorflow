Wow!!

Whipped over to this Lo-Lo's today for lunch with Robyn N. & Mike C.  Having been to their Phoenix location a while back I knew to expect an expensive but delicious meal, & they didn't disappoint!

My order was for the 3-Piece Chicken Meal with corn & home fried potatoes for sides, plus they also give you a big cornbread muffin & a ball of soft, whipped butter to put on it.

This was genuinely an all-you-can-eat feast & every bite of it was SOOOOOO good!!  The table service was friendly and attentive too.     :-))
