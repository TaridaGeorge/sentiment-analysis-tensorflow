I should put a disclaimer from the start that this was my first chicken and waffle experience, but that aside, this was the best fried chicken I have ever had regardless of delicious waffle and syrup additions!  I am in love, I don't know why I ever ate waffles without chicken!  Seriously, if you doubt at all, go try them!  We also ordered the wings, the hot sauce here is amazing with a strong vinegar flavor. The red beans and rice side is also fab. The service was incredibly nice, my iced tea and water mason jars were constantly refilled.
