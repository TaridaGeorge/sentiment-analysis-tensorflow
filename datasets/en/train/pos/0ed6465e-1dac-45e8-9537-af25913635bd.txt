Git yer cowboy/cowgirl on here !  
 

Had extended family visiting and this is one of the places we took them.
This is a great family place, so much to do and see.
Decent steak and a good kids menu.

We all enjoyed a mixed app of shroom's, zuke's, pepper poppers, onion strips with a nice buttermilk dip sauce. (Was good)
I had a NY strip smothered in shroom's, Cesar salad and loaded baked potato. (Pretty good) cooked to order and steak was juicy.

Everyone else had steaks as well, with no complaints .ribs were pretty good too.
The small kids had Sloppy Joes and mac and cheese, pretty much cleaned their plates. And the kiddies also enjoyed root beer floats.
