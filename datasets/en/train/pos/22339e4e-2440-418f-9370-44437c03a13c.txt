I am a fan of Ice Cream! There is really no other place near me (that I know of) that is a good place to go and just get Ice Cream (yogurt aside), so that is why I am reviewing a Cold Stone!  I really do like their Ice Cream too!  I always get the cheesecake fantasy or whatever its called, but it is by far my favorite!  We come here and it is always good, service is always the same, the place is clean and there is never a wait (or a long wait)  I love the creations they have and my kids love em too.
