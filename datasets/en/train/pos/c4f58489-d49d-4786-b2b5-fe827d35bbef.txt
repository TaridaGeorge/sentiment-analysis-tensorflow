Probably one of the most romantic restaurants in the entire Valley is tucked away in Tempe right down the street from ASU.  I have had countless lunches and dinners here.  The restaurant is a little cottage tucked behind some trees with a gorgeous patio complete with outdoor fireplace, bar, and twinkling lights in the trees.  You can sit inside the cottage or outside under the canopy of trees. Eclectic and sophisticated menu...  might be considered Cal-French?  Great food/wine pairings.  Lovely service.  Perfect for a romantic meal or a nightcap at the outdoor bar.  Great for dinner parties as well.  Small enough to book the entire place for a wedding reception.
