I finally made it out to this place, and I'm so glad I did. I heard it was a good restaurant, but it surpassed my expectations. Very hip and energetic atmosphere. All of the servers were friendly and I felt very comfortable there. The soft pretzels and cheese fondue are a Must Have. So delicious! And their drink menu is ridiculously awesome. So many unique drinks.
