The ambience is unforgettable. You actually go underground to get to the bar/restaurant. This is a must in the summer when the sun is scorching your skin. It is so cool and relaxing! The margaritas are very well made and the seafood is divine! This is such a cool place to impress out of towners or first timers, but don't tell them they're going underground before hand. The look of surprise on their faces is worth the wait. This restaurant/bar is one of the desert's best surprises! The food isn't cheap but isn't ridiculously priced either. Happy Hour Hurrah! My margarita lime vote for Salt Cellar is 10 Limes as the margaritas are so yummy!
