The one in North Scottsdale sucks (off of FLW and the 101) but the one in old town is the original and the one you must go to.  It has the never ending parking garage in back that I can never seem to get out of!!!!  Who the #$^% designed that thing?

On good nights, the bar ceiling opens up.  The ambiance is great and the food is old style Mexican.  Upon my first visit to AZ over 20 years ago, we visited this place and have always gone back.  You won't be disappointed.  Great for kids too.
