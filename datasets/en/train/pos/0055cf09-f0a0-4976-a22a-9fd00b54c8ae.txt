Just went back for my one year anniversary and what else can be said other than Durant's is a gem in a lackluster city like Phoenix.  This place is about great detail and experience finished off with some great food.

I cannot tell you about it, you have to come in for yourself. Yes you will break the piggy bank if you are not used to ordering a 40 dollar steak but hey that's life.
