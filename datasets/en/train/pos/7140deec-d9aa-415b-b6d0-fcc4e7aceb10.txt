Heather is truly an artist.   She's helped provide some symmetry and permanent shape to my difficult eyebrows!   As well her attention to detail and technique for lash extensions is fabulous.    I LOVE walking out of there with gorgeous long eyelashes which make it easy look fabulous and not have to bother w/ everyday makeup application.   Ideal for beach vacations, busy moms like myself or a special event.  The easy access of the salon is great also right off the freeway.
