I have taken two people here over the last few years, one to get their _____'s pierced and and the other one got her ____ pierced, (twice actually they had to re-do it over because it migrated).

Very professional, and very helpful answering questions and walk you through the process of putting a needle through your skin without anesthesia.

Yes the staff may be full of holes, stretched out, and tattooed from head to toe they still do a wonderful job so don't be scared.

Who knows maybe someday I'll get a piercing for myself.
