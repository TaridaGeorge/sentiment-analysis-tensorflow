If you are planning on spending 8 dollars for lunch at a fast food joint, all the while wishing you could have ANYTHING else but that, take your 8 dollars and head over to Thai Basil. I love love love this place! 
Recently had the masaman curry with tofu, at a medium spicy level, and was so pleased that I vowed to return again the next day! The lunch combos come  with your main dish, a spring roll and rice. Next time, I will have to try the Thai Iced tea. 
Fast and friendly service, clean restrooms, a really sweet Thai mom at the counter all make Thai Basil well deserving of 5 stars.
