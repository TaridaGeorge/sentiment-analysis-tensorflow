Mercy me, this place is deep-fried Heaven! We had very friendly service, the place was very clean, and sweet tea in a mason jar?? Perfection. Husband and I got your standard chicken and waffles, and added collard greens and (to die for) mac n' cheese. It was all superb. The greens were tender, not too bitter, not too salty, and the chicken was crisp, flavorful, and very high quality. Not too fatty, or greasy. Not to mention, as an interracial couple, we felt very at home here, no gawkers for a change lol, Must have been half the couples were of mixed ethnicity, and nobody asked to touch my daughter's hair, love it!
