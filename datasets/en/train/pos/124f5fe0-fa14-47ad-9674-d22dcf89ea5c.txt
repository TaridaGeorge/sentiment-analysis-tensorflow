The service and food was top notch. We were handed a specialty juice from the bartender when we entered and our car was waiting with chocolates and waters when we left. The food was amazing. Most of it was locally raised and grown. I am a pregnant pescatarian and they accommodated me, taking out beef broth and ham hocks when necessary. The decor was authentic and locally made as well. The beautiful views were also a plus. This is a splurge that is worth the money.
