Americanized Mediterranean food... and delicious!!!! So healthy, too. I've been going to PJ for over 10 years and have tried almost everything on the menu but love the jalapeno hummos, chicken shwarma lavosh wrap, the honey mustard chicken pizza... 

The servers are kindda strange... they're mostly hippies or grungy people with a bit of an attitude but always professional and polite! Still, they coooould appear a little neater but I guess this has become part of the PJ experience. The one on Apache is where I have frequented most but the one off Ray Rd is right on the water so it's a nice place to sit out on the evenings or for a late lunch!

Service is usually quick and everything is tasty.. I haven't had a bad experience at this place :-)
