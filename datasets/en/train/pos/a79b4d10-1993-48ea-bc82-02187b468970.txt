An Amazing venue!  It is a must see.  Beautiful brick with high ceilings and a gorgeous 2rd story over looking it.  They are a one stop shop with the owner also having a catering company, bar, wedding business.  They are so nice and caring there.  

I was an activities planner for 6 years and this would have been my dream location.  You can utilize so many parts of it separately or all together to make a massive event.  

Seriously, Yelp is for people to find good business, and if you pass this one up without giving it a chance, you will loose out.
