I love it every time yelp helps me find an amazing business. It happened again when I came to Valentina's. She is as skilled and helpful as all of her glowing yelp reviews make her out to be. I too am so happy to have found her and will continue to use her from now on. I bought my wedding dress off the rack and the bottom half needed to be taken in quite a bit to fit my hips and she did it absolutely perfectly! Now my dress fits like a glove and I can't wait to wear it later this month! Thanks to yelp for introducing me to Valentina, her tailoring skills are magical!
