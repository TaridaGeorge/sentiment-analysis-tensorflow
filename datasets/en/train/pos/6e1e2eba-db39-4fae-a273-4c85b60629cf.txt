I prefer to sit at the hi-tops by the bar instead of the dining room tables here during the day, and on the patio on a nice night.
I always order the same thing and love it -the Enchiladas VeraCruz, with a side of sour cream (adds to the taste.) Love the complimentary chips & their warm salsa as well.
This is not typical Mexican food, it's more of a fresh-mex.
