I will drive out of my way to go back to Liberty Market.  The staff was incredible.  When they realized we hadn't been there before, they suggested what to get (insisted really) and wow were they right.  The food is fabulous.  There were 4 of us and all agreed, will go back soon.  It was on our way to a hike in the Superstitions, so it gave us a great start to a beautiful hike.  I highly recommend the pancakes with bacon inside.  Don't crinkle your nose until you try it !!
