Loved this movie theater! It was very clean and service super friendly. Also, it has been a dream of mine for awhile to be able to drink at the movies. It is totally worth the few extra dollars for a clean, comfortable seat with full service drinks and food!

We had purchased a Living Social deal, which made it an even better deal and threw in a large popcorn. The cheddar popcorn is ridiculously good! And no one treated us oddly or added any random charges because of the deal (I hate when places do that!).
