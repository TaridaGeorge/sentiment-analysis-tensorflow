Went on a team lunch last week, and service was a pretty good.. I had the Hawaiian Ribeye, which was delicious.. I saw the burgers some other teammates had, very tempting.. We ordered dessert and I took the carrot cake.. This "slice" was about the same size as about 2/3 or more of a cake you can get at Fry's or Safeway, very massive "slice"!!
