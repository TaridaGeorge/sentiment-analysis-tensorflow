(Full disclosure: Proprietor Steve Belt is a friend of mine, but trust me, if he'd goofed this up, I'd say so...)

Here I sit, sucking up the free wifi at Scottsdale's newest independently owned coffee shop, Echo Coffee.

Over by the comfy couches and chairs, there's a coffee roaster cooking away as I type (TV is on the way). Steve is serious about his coffee and is watching over that thing like a mother hen. 

Some delightful looking fresh-baked cookies and pastries and a basket of fresh fruit are available if you're hungry. (Steve & company are fleshing out the menu).

The atmosphere is great, and there's been a steady stream of customers coming in.

Oh, and the coffee is spectacular. 

My only beef is it's not in Gilbert and closer to home. I could hang out in a place like this all day....
