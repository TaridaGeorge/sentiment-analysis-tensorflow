best outlet I've ever been too...

I give it 5 stars for the store selections from being out of town and believe it or not the bathrooms!!!

They're clean!! and smell like vanilla when you walk in.  Even the family rooms had a lowered toilet for the little one with a flower shaped toilet seat.  Now that's taking shopping to a whole new level...hahaha
