I love this place!  Gets very busy during lunch, and the wait for your food is long, but so worth it!  I had a green smoothie which was great, and the raw tacos.  OMG.....sooooo good!  I can't believe something raw could be so good!  I wish it was closer to my house.  There are a dozen more menu items I'm dying to try!
