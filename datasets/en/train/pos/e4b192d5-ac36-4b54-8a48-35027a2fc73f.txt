This is my favorite Thai place in the Phoenix valley. Never had a bad experience here.

Every dish I've tried has been great,  the prices are reasonable and the portions are generous. I always have leftovers to take home.

My recommendations are the Mussaman curry, the Phad Thai and wash it all down with a Thai tea. For desert? The mango sticky rice.

I think I'm going to have to go here for lunch today.
