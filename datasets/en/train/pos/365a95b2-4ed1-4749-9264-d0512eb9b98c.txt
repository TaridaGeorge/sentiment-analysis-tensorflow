Ever hear your mom tell you not to judge a book by its cover? Man I'm glad I took that advice! This place looks divey on the outside, almost to the point of being a turn off. But I went anyway, and found that it is the epitome of a diamond in the rough. The best gyro I've had in years! Tender, flavorful meat STUFFED in a pita with fresh veggies. The kicker however was their loaded cheese fries with cheddar and feta. I made my wife a believer in feta by giving her a bite of these fries. They are the real deal! Do not let the exterior fool you! The best in greek fast food IN THE VALLEY!
