i have been coming to this location over 15 years and i have never in my life had a problem with this place. long wongs on 28th st and thomas is probably the only place i will go to for wings. Ron the owner is just the sweetest guy you will know. and for decorations and painting and everything else, it has never bugged me, in fact i like looking at them because they are so old and antique. BEST WINGS EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
