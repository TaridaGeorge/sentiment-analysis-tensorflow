Uncle Josh does tremendous work.  I met with him five years ago (at another shop) had some work done, and met with him again this December past.  Uncle Josh updated the work he had done previously and hooked me up with some really great new art.  All four came out looking great.  I would recommend Uncle Josh to anyone interested in skin art.
