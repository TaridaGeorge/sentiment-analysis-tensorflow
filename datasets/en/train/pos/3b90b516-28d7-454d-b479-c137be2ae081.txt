2 of us shared the Chopped Salad and the 2 Brothers Pizza. Both were great, and plenty for both of us. We got the tarts comp, i guess to spread the word, and they were pretty special. Great patio and fires. I could recommend the Hop Knot beer and the Sauv Blanc. Both were great and hit the spot. Will definitely return to try again.
