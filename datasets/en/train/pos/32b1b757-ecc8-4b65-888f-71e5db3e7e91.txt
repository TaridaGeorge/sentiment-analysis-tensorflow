Postinos is one of my favorite restaurants in Arcadia!  The actual building itself is an old converted post office, complete with a closing garage door.  Great wine selection and the staff is extremely helpful if you have any questions or need a recommendation.  

As for the food, it is phenomenal!  I've had the roast beef sandwich, turkey and brie, bruschetta, salads, you name it.  I have never once been disappointed with my meal here.

I usually opt to split both a plate of bruschetta and a salad with a friend which is always more than enough.  My favorite salad is the raspberry chicken and for the bruschetta the brie/apple, salmon, pesto/salami, and fig/proscuitto are by far my faves.

This place is great for a first date, birthday, or dinner with a small group of friends :-) Looooove it!
