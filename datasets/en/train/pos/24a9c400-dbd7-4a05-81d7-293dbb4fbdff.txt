My baby had 2,255 miles of dirt, grime, and salt on her from our cross-country trek from North Carolina. The guys at Hot Shots got her back looking like MY car -- shiny, sparkling, black, gleaming. Their menu has car wash options for every budget. I chose one of the middle options, which included a soapy handwash, wiping down, removing excess water with an air hose and subsequently wiping it down, vacumming, window cleaning, car fragrance, and Armor All inside and out. 

It takes a little longer than at some other places, maybe, but totally worth it.
