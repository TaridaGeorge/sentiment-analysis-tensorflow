Where does one go to escape the working man's district and the monotonous 9-5? Crackers. The menu is fan. Friggin. Tastic. I always get the Roma tomato melt sandwhich. But everything is always good. The soup. The breakfast is good too. very popular at lunch time though. 

You come with a hearty appetite and you leave with a hearty-full tummy!
