This is one of the coolest guitar shops I've been to. The dudes at the store are very knowledgable and are great about sharing knowledge when it comes to guitars and amps. They also have a Fender Authorized guitar tech on staff. I highly recommend this great Scottsdale guitar shop for buying guitars for on-going maintenance. They also give guitar lessons.
