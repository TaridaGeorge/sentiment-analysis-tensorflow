One of my absolute favorite spring training ballparks! I'm attempting to get to all of the ballparks here in the valley and that's kinda hard to do with ballparks like this one that make you wanna return again and again!

The concessions wrap nearly all the around the small and intimate field. They have a good selection of food and beer. The craft brew bombers are definitely the way to go for value and quality!

And bonus: you can park nearly anywhere around old town and catch the free trolley to the ballpark. After the game you can wander around and check out some of the nearby bars / restaurants.

How can you not have a good time at this ballpark?!
