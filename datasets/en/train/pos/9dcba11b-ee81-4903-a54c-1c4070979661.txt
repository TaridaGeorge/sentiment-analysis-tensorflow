OM NOM NOM! College students all over the place-duh! It's open late and it's freakin' delicious! I looooove mochi in my ice cream. I used to love gummi bears until they got hard/frozen since I didn't eat them quick enough. You serve yourself-so can't complain about that. The workers that are there keep the toppings section clean-always wiping and filling. The only thing to complain about it waiting in line when it's busy.
