This weekend I took my girlfriend to Citizen Public House.  Before we were even done with our meal we were already discussing what we wanted to try on our next visit.

We started with two cocktails.  She had the Bellentini and I had the 1884 Manhattan.  I love Manhattans and this was one of the best that I have had--it was incredibly smooth and flavorful.

For our appetizer, we split the gorgonzola-emmental mac-n-cheese., and for our main courses we had the Grilled Cheese of the Day and the Fair Trade Coffee Charred Short Ribs.  Everything was incredible--including the service--and we wished we had room for an Irish Coffee and one of the many tempting desserts.
