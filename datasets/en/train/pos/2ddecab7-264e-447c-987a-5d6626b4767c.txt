EAT AT D'LISH!

Food is great. You can have a healthy breakfast/lunch or cure your hangover with fritatas and breakfast burritos. The coffee is the upper echelon as well.

The atmosphere is great - friendly, hip, personal - the likes of which i haven't seen since I left Manhattan (with the exception of a couple vacations to San Francisco and Amsterdam).

BIG PLUS: d'lish is staffed by pretty good looking people and the clientele is as friendly as they are. 

STOP DRIVING UP AND DOWN SCOTTSDALE RD. WONDERING "how that place d'lish is." I finally stopped in and have been back every Sat & Sun since.
