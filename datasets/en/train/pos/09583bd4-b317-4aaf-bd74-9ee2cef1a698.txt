After consistently crappy experiences at Williams Sonoma, I came here. I dropped a considerable chunk of money on a Breville machine, accessories and a few other items.

Needless to say, I was informed throughout the entire purchase and felt my money was appreciated. I was greeted with a smile and no one even mentioned I was there after closing. I love this place.

Every weird gadget you could imagine plus every vanity item you could ever crave.

I will be back. Enough with those snotty competitors.
