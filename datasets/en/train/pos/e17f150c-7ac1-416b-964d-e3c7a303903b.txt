I visited this course due to an only promotion that gave us a round for 4, range balls for each of us, 2 carts, and 12 brand new Callaway Tour i(s) golf balls, all this for only $59. It was too good a deal to pass up and the course was in amazing condition. Especially considering it's the middle of the summer in AZ. The course was long and wide allowing you to "grip it and rip it." The only downside is it's in Maricopa so it's a bit of a drive for someone in Tempe. After we finished I felt it was definitely worth the drive, even if we wouldn't have purchased the package.
