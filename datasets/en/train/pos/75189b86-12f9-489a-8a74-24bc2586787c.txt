Pizzeria Bianco ~ watch your back!
Finally my prayers have been answered. The pizza I have been searching for since I moved from NJ, without a two hour wait. The Parlor is the BEST PIZZA IN THE WORLD. Hope I have not "oversold" it to anyone reading this. But if you were a fan of Chris Bianco's pizza, then you will LOVE, LOVE, LOVE The Parlor! They make life so easy, with comfortable seating, and even a cozy outdoor fire to cozy up to while enjoying a glass of wine and a custom pizza, does life get any better than this? I think not.
