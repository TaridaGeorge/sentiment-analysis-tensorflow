Finally made it over to this place after hearing it was the shiznit. Yeah, I said shiznit. Nice and quiet in here, kinda dark but very relaxing. Service was good and food was amazing! A great place to get a good burger or something a little fancier. There menu has a little bit of everything. I will be back!
