Yogurtini is a smash-hit.  I love the flavors (partial to Chelsea's Cheesecake, pumpkin, and chocolate), I love the concept - pay by weight, and DIY toppings are very cool.  I love the atmosphere - it's kinda fresh & hip without being off-putting.  There are always people there, which is nice.  It can also be relaxing too in the late afternoon.  They've got a few tables outside and you can just relax with your monumental cup of frozen yogurt and watch the sun set.  Great place.  I go here all the time.
