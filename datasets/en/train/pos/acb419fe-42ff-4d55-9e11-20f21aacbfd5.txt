Alright, I have been visiting Dr. Coury's office for years now.  I have to say is that I am a medical snob.  I'm originally from Boston which is hospital capital of the world.  Only the best of the best work in Boston.  With that being said I am always skeptical about any other Dr. who have ever treated me outside of Boston, but I will say this, the Physicians Assistants and Dr. Coury himself, I am actually very impressed with.  They are knowledagble and very courteous to me the patient.  I have never had a single complaint while attending this practice, and if interactions continue the way that they do, I do not thing I will ever have a complaint.  I will totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a Primary Care Physician!
