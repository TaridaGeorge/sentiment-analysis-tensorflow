The landlords beer is robust and malty with a profile that looks like it might rip my tongue out. 

Today I am enjoying the rusty red double IPA seasonal beer named Count Hopula. It is showing off a white head with beautiful lacing that clings to the glass and really is a sight to behold.

My little hiatus from San Tan has not stopped my love of local handcrafted beer in the slightest. On the 16 the seasonal changes to Warm Winter. Sounds like an intoxicating craft.
