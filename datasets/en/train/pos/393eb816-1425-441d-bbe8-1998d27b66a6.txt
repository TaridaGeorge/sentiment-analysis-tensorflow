These people do excellent work.  Used them for car body damage thru my insurance company about 18 months ago, then went in due to a dent/scratch this week that I chose NOT to turn into my insurance.  It was going to be around $1,000.  When I told them that I did not want to spend the money right now, the woman actually came out to my car again, took rubbing compound and scrubbed out the black marks around the dent, did not charge me a penny and I think I can get by for now without getting it fixed.
