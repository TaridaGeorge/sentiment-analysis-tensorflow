Giddy up boys and girls!

This is a fun, casual evening spot to grab drinks (& food) with your friends. From hanging out at the bar, the spacious patio with stone fire pit, or at any of the oversized wooden tables... you will recieve prompt and friendly service.  Drinks are well poured. Had a few too many drinks and want to ride the bull? It makes for great entertainment for those like me who love people watching anyways.

This place is definitely a 'high energy, rock-western experience'.

*please note, this is a review of Saddle Ranch as a spot to hang out, the food has not been tested by yours truley*
