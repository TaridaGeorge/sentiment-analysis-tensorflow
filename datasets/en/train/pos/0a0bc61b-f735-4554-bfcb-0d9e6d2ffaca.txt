Wonderful! Hailing from the Midwest, I've always loved desert flora and fauna because it's so radically different from what I grew up with. A few hours at the Desert Botanical Garden really indulged my fascination. Grab a sunhat, a camera and set aside a few hours to wander the trails here. It's truly a delightful experience. Besides all the amazing plantlife, I saw myriad birds, a lizard, a jackrabbit and some other kind of tree rodent thing, though I sadly did not catch a glimpse of desert tortoise. I guess I'll just have to go back!
