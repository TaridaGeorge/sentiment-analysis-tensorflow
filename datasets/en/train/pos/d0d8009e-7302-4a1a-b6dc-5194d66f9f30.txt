Great place the staff are all warm and I am greeted by everyone even the valet guys.  The rooms are clean and the cleaners are meticulous.  I have stayed at this place for 8 nights so far and I am now a happy Marriott member.  I can care less about all the amenities, they are nice though, and more about the reception you get and the feeling of importance (yeah, I admit it's nice!) when you arrive and are walking about the lobby.  I recommend a stay here for any business traveler looking to be treated right!
