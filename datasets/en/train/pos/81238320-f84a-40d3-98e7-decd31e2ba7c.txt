Boba tea is my favorite addiction, and this is by far my favorite place in AZ to get it. I travel from downtown Phoenix regularly just to get my fix, and on my way I pass several other options that don't even compare. 

There are a lot of great flavors to choose from at The Boba Tea House, but I would suggest the standard "boba tea with boba". Don't be freaked out by the tapioca at the bottom. It's sort of an acquired taste, but once you get into it, it's a beautiful and obsession.
