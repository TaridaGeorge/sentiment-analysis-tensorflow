Stayed there for a corporate offsite for 3 nights.  Lovely hotel with beautiful landscaping throughout.  Didn't have time to enjoy the incredible pools or the golf course, but hoping to do so in the future ; ) 

Rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and bathrooms are particularly roomy.  

Great service throughout our stay.
