Gluten Free Pizza!  For those that need/want it, Barro's has it.  

I have discovered a new taste treat for my pizza.  Pepperoni, Pinapple, and......wait for it......BACON!  Yes, it is soooo yummy!  And Barro's makes a killer pizza.  I have gone to dine in a few times now and the first time I went in I was suprised at how big it is.  There is a large back room and a great little "kid's korner" with a long table and chairs and a flat screen TV on the wall.  The kids sit and eat their pizza and they can watch Nick or the Disney Channel.  My daughter loves it!  
This is a great place to hang out, have a pizza and relax.
