I adore Miele's and am fortunate to live right in the neighborhood.  Super friendly owners.  It's like a real life experience of the film "Big Night" when you dine there.  Great food, lots of nice little touches, warm atmosphere.

I said I just wanted some plain-ish spaghetti with sausage and they made it to order for me...perfect! Have had to go pizza which was super good too.

Love love love this place...*****!
