Visited Firebirds this evening and were delighted.  We were a party of four.  Three ordered prime rib and one the crab cakes.  All of our prime ribs were ordered medium rare and all came to our table in clones of perfection.  I was allowed a taste of the crab cake and it was delicious.  Service was attentive and staff well trained.  Simply perfect.
would have liked more options as sides.  What you get is perfect prime rib and a baked potato.  Would have liked to have had the option of ordering perhaps a salad instead of the potato.  Baked potato was 3 stars.
