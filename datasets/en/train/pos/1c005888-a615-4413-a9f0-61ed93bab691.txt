After hearing about this place from a friend then finding it on Yelp, had to give it a try. I had the steamed dumplings and the flat tofu with green peppers. Very good and clean. I will definitely be going back since this is the best Chinese food I have had in a while. Lunch price wasn't bad either. The ladies working there were very friendly and attentive. I was with a some friends visiting from China and they said that it was some of the best Chinese food they have had in the south east valley area.

Give this place a try, I don't want to see this one going away like many of the others. I will definitely be going back often.
