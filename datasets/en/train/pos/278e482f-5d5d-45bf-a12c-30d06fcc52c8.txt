It's been a while since I've had a good breakfast sandwich (NYC and London were the last places) so to discover The Farmhouse Restaurant in downtown Gilbert is great news for my weekend mornings. Yes you have to wait at the weekend, but believe me it's SO worth it. I like the breakfast at Liberty Market and a few Good Eggs around the valley but this place beats them all. 
P.S If you love bacon you will be VERY happy!
