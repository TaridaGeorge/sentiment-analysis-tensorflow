This is where the beautiful people converge on a Friday night to eat some amazing food and drink wine.  I am continually entertained by the people that frequent this establishment. 

I have sampled salad and pizza and have yet to be disappointed!  The service is friendly and attentive.  I prefer the outdoor seating so you can have a better vantage point while people watching.

You do have to get the dolce for dessert but split it with someone!  It's huge and you might be intimidated.  Either way you won't be disappointed.
