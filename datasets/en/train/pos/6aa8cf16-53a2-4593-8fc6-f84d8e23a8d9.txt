One of the better Whole Foods locations I've visited, especially for beer/wine.  The cheese selection isn't too bad, and that young man who is the "cheese guy" is always helpful.  Their frozen selection has a lot of offerings that I don't see at WF's other locations in the valley.

Parking is generous too, and the beer/wine bistro has a very good selection.
