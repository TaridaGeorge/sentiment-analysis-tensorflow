I love this place!  A few years back, I'd been to Cantaloop and Yogurt-tree in LA with a friend.  I was totally bummed that I couldn't get anything like that here at home.  So I was pleasantly surprised last December when I was strolling along at the Tempe Marketplace and saw Mojo.  I thought to myself, "Could it be?" I love their tart.  It's one of the best things I've ever tasted.  I like that I get to serve it myself and decide how much or how little I want.  I've gotten out of there with as little cost as $2.37 before. I get the same thing every time I go and it never disappoints. And with their loyalty card, I have a free mojo waiting for me.  Buy 9, get the 10th free!
