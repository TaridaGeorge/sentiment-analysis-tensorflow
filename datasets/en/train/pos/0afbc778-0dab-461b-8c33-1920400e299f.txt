I was recommend to Dana a few weeks ago by a fellow mom I met at the Scottsdale Fashion Square playground and it has been one of the best recommendations I have received since moving to Arizona. Dana is amazing with kids. She made my girls feel welcomed and made it a fun experience instead of a dreaded one. She has movies, games and toys to keep kids entertained. Her prices are very reasonable. I highly recommend that you check her out if you are looking for someone for your kids!
