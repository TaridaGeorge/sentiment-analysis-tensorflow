We've been to Zinburger numerous times and I thought I'd update my review. 

 I absolutely love their Kobe burger but finally forced myself to try something different.  One particular week,  I had my fair share of beef so I decided to try their turkey burger.  It wasn't the usual one on the menu but was a Thanksgiving special.  This burger was exactly the Thanksgiving turkey burger you would imagine - moist turkey burger, cranberry sauce, and stuffing - fantastic.  I was so disappointed they only serve it around Thanksgiving.  After delighting in my usual Kobe burger again for a while, I tried their regular turkey burger and it, too, is tasty (especially with mushrooms).  But the burger with the stuffing and cranberry sauce is something I'm going to indulge in again next Thanksgiving and, being a foodie, I can't wait.
