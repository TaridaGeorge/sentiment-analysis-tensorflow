We picked up our little rescue dog without any background information on her health, likes, dislikes etc. I called Goober the next day and Pat spent a long time on the phone with me asking me questions and walking me through all the different dog food choices available. Her patience and expertise confirmed all the great things that I had heard about Goober. Whenever I call to order, the staff is just as helpful and polite as they were that first day... and my dog food is delivered free of charge to my front door the next day (always accompanied by a handful of treats for my dog). By far the best service and quality available and they will forever have my business.
