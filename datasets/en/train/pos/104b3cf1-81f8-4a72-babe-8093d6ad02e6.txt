I completely prefer this Grimaldi's to the Old Town location....I don't know why, but I just do. The pizza is the same, but the atmosphere here is a little better. I always feel like I have a better overall dining experience at this location. The service is good (nothing over the top, but it is sufficient for a pizza joint), and the pizza is delicious.

We would always choose this location over the Old Town one both for its proximity to our apartment and the atmosphere - not like you can go wrong with Grimaldi's anyway, but this one is really fabulous.
