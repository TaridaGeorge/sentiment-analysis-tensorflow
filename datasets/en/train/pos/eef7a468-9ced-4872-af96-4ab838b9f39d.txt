This place is absolutely amazing. The set up is classy and comfortable and it's the kind of place you would go to for any occasion. The food is great and the drinks are well made and very reasonably priced. The bartenders are top notch and are super friendly no matter how busy it is. The owners Kevin and Jackson are great guys and they go out of their way to make you feel at home. I'm so glad that I found this place and I make a point to drop in every time I go to Phoenix.
