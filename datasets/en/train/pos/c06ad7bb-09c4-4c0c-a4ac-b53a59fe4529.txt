My favorite pizza place in Phoenix, bar none. Amazing, life changing pies. You must eat here. 

Other reasons why I like it:
- cheap, good bottles of wine
- dog friendly
- light rail accessible
- romantic vibe (but not too romantic, totally ok for just casual dining with friends)
- friendly staff
- free of Old Town Scottsdale douchery
- desserts with nutella
- fresh & often local ingredients
- no ridiculous wait times like Bianco (usually 30 min or less during peak times)

Highly recommended.
