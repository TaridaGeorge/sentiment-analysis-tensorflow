If you ever forget what customer service is, go to Royal Palms and  you will be re-reminded of exactly what it is.
I had a massage at their Alvadora spa.
This was their summer special for $99, a 50 minute massage.  Simply first class. 
I could have been tarred and rolled in feathers and would have still felt pampered.
They are  consummate professionals yet genuine and friendly.
