I have created the ULTIMATE pizza at this place and I am feeling generous enough to share my glorious toppings combination under one condition: you must refer to it as the 'King Sam' pizza....

Don't believe it's that good? Your crazy, try it and then thank me later...

The KING SAM:
Any Pizza with these Toppings:
-Pesto
-Chicken
-Garlic
-Onion
-Jalepeno

** if you like hot pizza, put a dash of Tabasco on it for the final touch... wow.

 You are welcome...
