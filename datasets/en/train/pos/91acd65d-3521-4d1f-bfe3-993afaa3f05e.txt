Now this a place to see downtown Phoenix culture.  A renovated bungalow house made into a bar.  I love their beer selection and they have chosen their wines carefully.  Great little spot to grab a drink late night and unwind.  Only negative, if it may be called a downfall, it can be very loud with the wood floors and structure.  So it's not really a date place...unless you don't really care what the other person has to say!
