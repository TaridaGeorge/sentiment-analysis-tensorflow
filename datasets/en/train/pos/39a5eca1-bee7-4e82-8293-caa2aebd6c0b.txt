I have been to 56 East Bar and Kitchen a handful of times and always have a very nice time.  Corey, the bartender, is very attentive to everyone.  He made great suggestions on menu selections.  Honestly, I never would have ordered what I did but he explained what the item was and I tried it.  It was a pizza with egg on top.   Sounds awful, I know,  BUT it was awesome.    We all loved the  food.   We could actually talk to each other and carry on a conversation.   So many places are too noisy.    I really like 56 when they can open the window behind the bar.   My only suggestion might be to find a way to have some plants behind the patio to block the view of the parking lot.

This is a real review of a place I have actually been to!
