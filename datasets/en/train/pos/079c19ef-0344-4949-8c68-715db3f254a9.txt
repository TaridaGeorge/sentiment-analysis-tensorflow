Monday & Tuesday for $20 a bottle of wine & a board of bruschetta!  What more can I say -- but don't you cry for me Ari...zo...na!!!  I'll take advantage of this special as much as I can :)  Yeah I love this place.  It's definitely a lot better than the one in Arcadia.  It's more open plus there's generally more parking space.  The service here is real good and always entertaining.  Ambience is smooth and low key.  I dig....however is there live music here or am I attending during the wrong nights? hmmm - enjoy!
