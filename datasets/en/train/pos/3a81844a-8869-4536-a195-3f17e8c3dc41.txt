Once you have dined at Hana, the experience will prompt you to return sooner then you thought. Hana is well established mom-n-pop place which serves the fresh sushi items, friendly and attentively services, and BYOB as you please. The price is most reasonable. Sushi dining can be a great experience, especially when you dine at Hana's. I have been enjoying sushi dining for many years, in-and-out of phoenix, but I can always count on this place. Thumbs up!
