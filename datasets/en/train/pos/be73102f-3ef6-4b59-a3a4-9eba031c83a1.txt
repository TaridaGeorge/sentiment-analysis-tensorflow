just golf course alone gives this place 5 stars....27 holes....3 nines holes to mix and match....(sorry for all the stuck balls in the cactus..oops)...if you don't want to lug around your golf clubs...the loaner clubs are the top-end callaways....everything is provided...callway ball bag and phoenician logo callaway balls....

okay...my rating might be also biased...all complimentary....iadmit the food was typical..nothing spectacular...enjoyed a nice long massage after golf....and the spa was nice....hmm....mostly old folks and some families...felt little out of place...but oh well..still treated like a king by the resort staff....
