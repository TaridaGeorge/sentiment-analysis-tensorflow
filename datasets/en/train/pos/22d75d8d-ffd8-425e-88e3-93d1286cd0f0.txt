Postino's has been one of my favorite restaurants for several years now, and even though I know in the big scheme of things one more 5 star review won't matter, I still feel the need to add my praise. 
I love the ambiance. Though it can get a bit loud and crowded, that's what happens when a place is popular. Both the inside and outside decor are both modern, yet extremely comfortable. The menu is simple but tastefully done. I love the bruschettas, the paninis, the salads, the desserts.... This is one of my favorite places for brunch, and I have even used them to cater one of my parties with great success. As a matter of fact, now that I am writing this, I think I will go back tomorrow. It already has been too long.
