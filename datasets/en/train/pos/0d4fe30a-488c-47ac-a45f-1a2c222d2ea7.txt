First trip to Forefathers.  Very satisfied with the entire experience.  Friday at lunchtime.  Fast service.  I took several reviewers advice and ordered the number 1.  I made the mistake of ordering a large and could not finish the entire sandwich, but it was so good I almost made it through.  I don't know what other yelpers are talking about using pre-cooked meat.  They were grilling up fresh Porterhouse steaks while I watched.  Fry sauce is great. The food was great and the atmosphere was great.  The place was clean, including the bathrooms.  I will be back for more as soon as I recover from this food coma...
