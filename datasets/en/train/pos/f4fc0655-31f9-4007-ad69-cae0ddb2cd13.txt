Where to start???

The owners are very kind... say hi to Benny in the kitchen!!!

My wife and I found this place while living in the culinary-void NW Valley of Phoenix, and we have eaten here probably 50 times over a 3-year period.  Everything is good:

Gryos
Chicken Pita
Souvlaki
Greek Salads are probably one of the best salads that we have ever eaten
Fries are always fresh
Zatsiki sauce is stellar

The atmosphere is a bit void, but people don't come to 35th and Thunderbird for the atmosphere...  they come for great food at a great price.
