Wonderful Thrift store that raises money for Halo Animal Rescue.  The prices are very reasonable and the store is tidy - no weird smells or old, worn items. All this year (2012) I have found really beautiful cocktail and fancy dresses.  Scored a new pair of designer sandals for $20.  I don't always find something, but I am looking for things I will use, not just shopping to buy "stuff".
They also have great pet things - I have purchases a bunch of brand new dog collars for a $1 (my sister uses them), cat toys and a really nice cat carrier!
