I finally had an opportunity to visit this place... Knowing the relationship with the LGO prior to visit, I already had some understanding and expectations from this restaurant.
Great atmosphere and design; we had a chance to sit upstairs which was unique.  
I tried the prime hanger steak, medium-rare and sweet corn polenta on the side.  The polenta is absolutely amazing; consistency of grits and the mixture of butter and cheese flavors are perfectly balanced.
(..and yes, it was that good) and steak was cooked to satisfaction, no complaints.
Service has some room for improvement, not enough to loose a star though.
Tried this place once more and they did not let me down.... The basil lime Caipirinha, is mind blowing... a MUST
I wish they were open late on the weekends...
