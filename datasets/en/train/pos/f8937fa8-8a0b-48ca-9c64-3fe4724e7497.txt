i'm no hot dog expert so bear with me.

i liked the boston & chili dog.  the meat was good & tasty.  the bun was grilled and buttered which also was goo.  the fries were better than average.

i love the free refills.  the place is small but clean.  the have a tv with sports on all the time.

i still need to try the doggie style fries, reuben, mac & cheese and onion rings.

the only time we go to this place is during the summer when not very students are on campus.
