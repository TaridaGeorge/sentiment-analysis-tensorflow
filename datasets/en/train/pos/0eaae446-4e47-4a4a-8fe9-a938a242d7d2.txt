I have to give it 5 stars even though I am sometimes frustrated by the seating (not stadium style, so if you're watching a subtitled film and you're stuck behind someone tall... it sucks). They show excellent movies and the crowd is generally a little less obnoxious than other theaters (depending on the flick). 

And just for the sake of mentioning it... the women's bathroom is a little weird. I can't really describe it, except that I feel like cattle being herded around in a circle in the post-movie bathroom rush.
