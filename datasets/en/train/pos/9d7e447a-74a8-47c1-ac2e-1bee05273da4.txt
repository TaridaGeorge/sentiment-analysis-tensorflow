I LOVE cornish pasty!! The ambience is really neat but the place itself is a little small. Everytime I go, I try a new pasty and every one I have tried, I have liked. Good selection of beers (import and domestic). I personally like sitting up at the bar because staff is really friendly and chatty (if you want them to be).

If you're looking for a new place to try that's casual, this place is great!
