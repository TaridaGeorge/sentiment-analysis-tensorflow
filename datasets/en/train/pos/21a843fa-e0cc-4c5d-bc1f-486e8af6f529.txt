I've been here dozens and DOZENS of times over the last 25 years.  5 stars without a doubt.

Standouts are the Italian beef with "lots o hot".  Their cheese fries are absolute perfection...  here's why.  Put fries in a basket, smother them with cheese sauce, put another hand full of fries in basket, SMOTHER AGAIN WITH CHEESE SAUCE.

When you are done with these cheese fries you are looking for more fries for the cheese, not more cheese for the fries.

Then, when you walk out, school girls and boys break into song and birds start chirping.

Oh, I have to mention the cheese steak.  I don't like the standard way they do it (beef, onions, cheese) BUT if you ask for it "Philly Style" they do it with their cheese sauce that they add extra cheddar cheese to.

Yum yum yum.
