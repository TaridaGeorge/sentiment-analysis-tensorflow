I went to Arizona with some friends over the weekend, and a local recommended Cornish Pasty. It was so good that we went back the next day. 

The servings are HUGE. Across the weekend I sampled the Pilgrim (thanksgiving in a pasty), the salmon one, the apple/caramel dessert, and pesto chicken. Everything was mindblowingly amazing. I really liked the dill sauce in the salmon, and the cranberry on the Pilgrim. I had the leek/potato/stilton soup as well, which was creamy and delicious as well.

I liked it so much that I started looking up the history of cornish pasties on Wikipedia. They're really good. I want to make my own, now.

The location is fairly tiny, so it's not good for groups.
