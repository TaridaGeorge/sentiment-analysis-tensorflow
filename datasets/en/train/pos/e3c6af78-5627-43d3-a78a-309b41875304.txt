This is not only the best bagel place in the area, but possibly the best in the state. I come from New York where we believe we invented all good food, but especially the bagel (and pizza, but that's another story).

I have to admit that after living in Chicago for 30 years I never found a place there (that's still open) that makes a bagel as good as these are.

All varieties (even the fruity ones), a smoked salmon spread that they didn't just wave the lox over, and a bagel and lox plate reminiscent of the good old days.

Service is outstanding, and yes, I've never been there when it's not crowded, but there are almost always tables available outside, and even inside, the crowd is friendly.

I would say that if you enjoy a good bagel, you don't want to miss this place.
