This company is great.  They know how to really make a steak and there food is well priced.  I have been to other steak houses in Scottsdale and steaks cost around $50.  Here you will get the same thing for around $20 to $25.  The service is usually great too.  I have been to this restaurant 10 to 15 times over the last couple years and will continue to go.
