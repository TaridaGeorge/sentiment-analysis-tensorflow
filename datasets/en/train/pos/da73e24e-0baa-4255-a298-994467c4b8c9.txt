This property has come a long way since the Caleo Resort and the Sunburst Resort - the former names. The current iteration doesn't have the problems you'd read in other reviews of the place - it is clean, modern, and has a great "pool life." It's also close to the Scottsdale shops, and close to all of the Scottsdale golf. It really is a gem.
