This spa is a hidden gem in the West Valley. Their customer service is out of this world amazing and they really understand the spa experience. They encourage you to stay and enjoy the amenities regardless of how much cash you spend on service. You could come in for a polish change and the treat you no differently than if you spend $500 in spa services. (which I totally recommend because their staff is AMAZING) Make the trip to the West Valley and give this spa a try. You'll LOVE it!
