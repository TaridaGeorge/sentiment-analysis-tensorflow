I've been to this bar many of times and I totally thought it was nameless and that made me like it that much more.  You walk in and it's pretty dim in there.  The room is just basically lit by candlelight.  They have a superb wine list and wines by the glass.  Grab yourself a table or a sofa and get comfy for the night.  There is no other place that you need to visit! This is the place to be!
