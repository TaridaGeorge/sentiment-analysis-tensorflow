It is as good as it gets. 

For me, I want a good cup of black coffee. Nothing fancy. That is what my wife and I ordered. The coffee was hot and the dark roast had a great flavor. 

Even though we were here on vacation and "not a local," Cabin Coffee didn't discriminate.  The service was very friendly and the seats comfortable.  The free wifi was an added bonus.  My wife fired up her work computer and checked her email.  While she was working (aren't we supposed to be on vacation ?) I ordered a cranberry muffin. Wow!  It was really good.

Thank you for a good start to our morning!
