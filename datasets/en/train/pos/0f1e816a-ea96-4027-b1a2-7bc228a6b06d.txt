I've been going to Choices hair salon for almost 15 years now. They are polite, pleasant, and reasonably priced. Of all their stylists I recommend "Just Doug" In these uncertain times most stylists are raising their prices and slashing their services. Doug hasn't raised his prices in years and states he wont. He's usually the first in the salon and the last to leave in the evening. He does a terrific job of styling hair and as long as he's there I will always wait to sit in his chair.
