Quaint and lively Italian bistro! Great atmosphere and energy!!  Refreshing to see such vitality in Sun City!   Enjoy fresh baked bread,  authentic lasagna and traditional Italian cassata cake!  My personal fave is the Chicken Piccata..tender chicken topped with light fresh lemon butter and capers compliments the pasta and homemade tomato sauce.  You can then dance the night away to live entertainment Wednesday,  Fridays and Saturdays!  Friendly and welcoming locals and a great house band.
