I recently stopped here for an eye exam and new glasses per the recommendation of a coworker (he said Target, not this one specifically). This location was close to my home and has hours until 8pm. The doctor I had was extremely friendsly and performed the eye exam well. He was honest in what my choices were and what it meant for the future. 

I ordered two pair of classes and was told to expect 7-14 business days. My visit was on a Wednesday and I was surprised when they called me the following Tuesday to say they arrived. The fit was good and the price reasonable. Not only was the doctor friendly and knowledgable, but the staff was also. With hours until 8pm I will definitely come back here in the future.
