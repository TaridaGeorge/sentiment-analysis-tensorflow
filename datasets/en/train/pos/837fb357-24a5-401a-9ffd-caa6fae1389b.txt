If you need to have a sleep study done this is the place to have it done. With 5 sleep centers throughout the valley there was a sleep center not far from where we were staying. The facility is absolutely beautiful.The rooms are like a resort with the staff as nice as can be and very knowledgeable.  My daughter had the best experience here.
