This Goodwill is much better than many I've been to, in fact it may be my favorite one, and I really know my way around the Valley's second hand stores...  The store is clean and bright, the employees are very friendly, the aisles are organized and it doesn't smell like grandma's underwear drawer.  

A big bonus for me is their $1 Thursdays: Everything with that day's colored tag is $1.  You can find some AWESOME stuff for just a buck.  SCORE!
