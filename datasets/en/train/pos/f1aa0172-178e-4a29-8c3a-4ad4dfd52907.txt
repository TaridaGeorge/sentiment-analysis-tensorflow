As close as it gets to a real Italian pizza here in Phoenix. I am an Italian and I have only been here for a few years, and let me tell you, it is refreshing to finally get a taste of home. The crust is just the consistency that it should be. It's not an American pizza, it's much lighter and not as greasy. I will most definitely return on a regular basis.
