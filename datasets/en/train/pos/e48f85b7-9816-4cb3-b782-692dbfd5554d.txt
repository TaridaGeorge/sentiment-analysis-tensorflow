This place is DELICIOUS!  They always have a huge variety of flavors that were made fresh that day.  They can include up to three flavors per cup.  My husband always wants different kinds of chocolate.  They usually have 4+ options in just chocolate based flavors alone.  I personally prefer the fruity flavors which they always have a ton of different ones.  There is always close parking.  The only downside: not much seating.  

Be aware: the cups may LOOK small, but they can be deceiving.  Always get a smaller size than what you think you want because you fill up fast.  If you can finish it, not to worry, they have lids to make it to go to eat as leftovers later.
