Great food and atmosphere. Live music on Saturday night was perfect. Acoustic guitarist lots of familar songs.

All four meals were perfect and I liked that you could split a hambuger basket for $2.50 and get seperate sides. Server was very friendly and refilled coffee 3-4 times at least. 

Highly recommend.
