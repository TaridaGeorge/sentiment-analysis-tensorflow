I've been to Malee's three or four times, and each time I left full, satisfied, and feeling a lovely burn in my mouth.  Being in love with the Chicken Panang, it is the only dish I have ordered, but I have had bites of the Drunken Dragon Noodles, Crispy Basil Chicken, and Tamarind Chicken, and they are all exceptional - especially when made Very Hot or Thai Hot.  Service has always been efficient and friendly and the atmosphere is nice.  If I lived closer I would visit more often, but the trek to Scottsdale and the higher-than-average price make it easy for me to save Malee's for a monthly trip.  If you haven't been yet, you should.  Your mouth will thank me!
