Our first visit to the Roaring Fork, and an amazing experience and food.  Our server, Jesse was wonderful, personable, and just playful enough to keep us entertained. My date had duck, best he's ever eaten, I has bacon wrapped shrimp, fabulous!  and the heated pecan pie with gelato,  to die for!  Reasonably prices. Several management figures stopped by to chat.  They truly seem interested in the local patrons, and offering a wonderful experience.  Thank you for a wonderful evening!  and yes, yes, yes,  the Green Chili Mac was the best!
