We stayed here for 3 nights and it was great! After reading the reviews, I knew to ask for an updated room - which they accommodated. The bed was comfy, the jacuzzi was relaxing, and the outdoor patio was a great place to read a book in the morning. Our room was right near the parking lot so we had easy access to our car - I will definitely ask for a similar location next time.  
This resort is in a residential area which makes it nice and quiet and it is close to restaurants and shopping. There is a full size fridge which is really nice to keep leftovers and bottles of water.
You can't beat the price - $50/ night, no parking fee, and no resort fee.... We will definitely stay here again!
