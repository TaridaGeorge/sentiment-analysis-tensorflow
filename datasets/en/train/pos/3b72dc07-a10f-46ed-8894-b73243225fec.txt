I love this place!  I have been eating here for (holy cow) 20 years.  There used to be 2 other locations but this is the only one left.  Just a normal sub shop but the people are friendly and the menu is cheap.  Took the whole family, wife and 2 kids, here for lunch and it was only like 15 bucks.  Can't beat that in this economy.  The inside is covered in bumperstickers and the tables have 1980's high school pictures lacquered into the table so it keeps the kids entertained.
