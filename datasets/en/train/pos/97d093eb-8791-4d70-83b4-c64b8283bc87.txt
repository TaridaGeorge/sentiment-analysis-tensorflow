Amazing place. I took my sweet old dog here when it was her time, since she was uncomfortable and this was so close to my house and had been recommended by a friend. Dr. Kanarish and his staff were so sympathetic and understanding, especially considering I was in tears for the entire visit. I was especially moved when the doctor put a large and comfy blanket on the floor of the exam room so I could lay  and comfort my dog until she passed. This is an incredible office of warm and caring people. They made a terribly painful experience much easier for me.
