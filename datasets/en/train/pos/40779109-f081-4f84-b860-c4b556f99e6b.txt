Hidden Treasure!  Fun atmosphere and huge menu.  There are different rooms that have themes like movies, music, and sports.  There is this really cool room that is kind of set up like a living room with a huge big screen.  The bugers and hot wings are the best.  They even have a Hot Wing challenge that I am considering.  They have their own signature microbrew - Hoot &  Howl Ale, which is fantastic.  Great spot for Happy Hour & Dinner.
