Went here for lunch ordered the Pecan Smoked Salmon with Avocado Puree, Red Onion, Lemon-Caper Crema, and Olive Tapenade. It was only $10. I would have paid $20. It was spectacular! I also got the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak and Asadero Cheese Stuffed Tortillas with Roasted Ancho Guajillo Sauce,
Avocado Puree and Cilantro Rice   It was $13. It was tremendous. My friend got Grilled Salmon and Baby Lettuce with Sweet Roasted Peppers, Cherry Tomatoes, Fresh Avocado, 
Chive Risotto Cake, Tortilla Strips and Chipotle-Grapefruit Vinaigrette.    It was only $12. I think this restaurant is the best in Scottsdale. This comes from a real foodie. The service was 5 star! Off course the outdoor patio was stunning but mesquite leaves kept falling in the food. It was super windy that day. Make sure you are seated under an umbrella!
