I love this bar. It has a calm atmosphere that is great for a first date scenario or meeting someone for a cozy chat.  It is rather small and can get pretty packed on busy nights though.  I recommend getting there early and securing a seat.

The first time I was there about a year ago, I met Ernie the owner. She was so pleasant and friendly!  Now every time I go in she welcomes me by name and gives me a hug!

Good people!  Great place to meet a friend and have a brew.
