On a recent business trip, we were directed to Baratin when we couldn't secure a table at FnB.  Eric made the night a fantastic experience, making us feel at home and guiding us through the menu.  We shared the beet salad, trout rillettes, and cheese plate.  Everything was absolutely delicious and plated beautifully.  I appreciated the reasonably priced wine list that included half bottles.  The attached market is very cute, and I wish I had something similar near me.  I would highly recommend Baratin for a lovely, laid back dining experience.
