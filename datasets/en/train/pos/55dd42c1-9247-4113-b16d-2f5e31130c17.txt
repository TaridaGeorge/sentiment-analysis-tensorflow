Oh! My! Gosh! This is the best place ever for dogs! Connie is SO nice. She sends pictures of your happy dogs. She's flexible, she's affordable, she's so personable. When we leave our small farm of animals behind, we want to know they are loved. With Connie, that has never been a worry. I know my dogs like going to her. I don't want to recommend her to too many people because I'm afraid she will run out of space for us! Thank you Connie!
