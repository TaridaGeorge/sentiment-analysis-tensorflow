I found this place after one of those midnight cravings. I googled late night donuts and Bosa came up as being open 24 hours. I was so surprised a 24 hour donut shop existed. I was not going to complain. I made the 5 mile drive and was extremely pleased with what I received. I LOVE maple bars and that is exactly what I got, along with an old fashion devil foods cake chocolate cake donut. Yum, Yum, Yum =) I couldn't be happier. I've come here many times after that late night excursion and introduced a number of friends. None have been disappointed. This is a fluffy, delicious, and inexpensive donut that you'll never forget.
