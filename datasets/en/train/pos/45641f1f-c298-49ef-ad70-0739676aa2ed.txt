Unfortunately, I had an insurance change and Dr. Choules' office no longer accepts my insurance...when they called to remind me it was time to schedule an appointment, I let them know of the change.  They told me they were sorry to lose me as a patient, but to please be sure to get my dental records from them when I had time so I could bring them to my new dentist. 
It's nice when an establishment still stays classy even when they lose your business. I wish circumstances were different and I was able to still see Dr. Choules. I will definitely return if my carrier changes again!
