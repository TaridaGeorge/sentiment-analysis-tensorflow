Recently Eastside announced that they will be closing their doors on the first of January unless they are bought in the mean time.  I don't think any news could've saddened me more.  Though this didn't come as surprise it still felt like I got punched.  Eastside has been my favorite record store for close to 6 years.   I've pretty much grown up there.

Without being totally sappy Eastside charges reasonable prices, has a really kind and helpful staff and have served the Tempe music community for almost 25 years now.   It's a real shame to see them go.
