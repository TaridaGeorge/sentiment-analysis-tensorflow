Best Italian food I have experienced in Arizona and I was surprised because it's a chain. My guy and I were ooing and ahhing throughout the meal. I had the Lobster and Shrimp Ravioli with Crab insalata and it was a perfect portion, perfect flavoring and al dente! AMAZING. The only thing this place needs is Spumoni (minus the candied fruit)!!! Our server didn't even know what it was! What? i know!
