What a cool comic book shop. The store is seriously just one big room with rows of comic books, old school style. That makes me happy on the inside! When I was in Phoenix for business I was drawn in from afar because we were waiting on a ride back to the hotel anyway. 

Guy that was working there was super nice and knew a ton about comics so he was able to help a friend of mine who was not well versed buy something for her boyfriend. 

I don't know what else to tell you except it's a great store!
