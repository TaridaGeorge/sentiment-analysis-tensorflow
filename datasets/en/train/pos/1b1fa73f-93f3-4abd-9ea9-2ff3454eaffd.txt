WOW!  Awesome breakfast!  This place is a gem.  The breakfast Burrito- specialty of the house, was sensational; filled with eggs, bacon, potatoes, cheese, avocado & chipolte sauce. The baked goods are all made in house.  The Cinnamon buns are a must try!  The service and staff are very friendly and accommodating.  It is truly an all American breakfast spot; a place that you will want to go back to over & over again.  Will have to try lunch next time.  Menu looks fabulous!
