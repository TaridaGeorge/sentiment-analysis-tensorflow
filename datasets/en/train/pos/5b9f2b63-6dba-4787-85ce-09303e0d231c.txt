I LOVE this place.  I'm Mexican & my favorite things to eat here are their posole (red chile, hominy & pork soup). I'm known for mine and I think theirs is better.  Their fry bread with red or green chile is simple and amazing.  Their tamales are expensive in my opinion 4.75 for one, but they're worth it.  My favorite tamale is just the veggie green chile & corn...I have not found a better tamale at a restaurant.

I don't know about their normal stuff like tacos, burritos or tostadas, since I prefer to  go for what reminds me of authentic dishes but I'm sure they're good as well.  

The restaurant is super clean and service was good.  My only complaint is that they're closed on Sunday, but then I remind myself that it's a family place.
