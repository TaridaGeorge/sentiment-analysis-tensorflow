I love the Blooze! Thursday rockabilly nights are awesome! There's a great checkered dance floor to dance the night away! The owner is the nicest guy you will ever meet. There's hardly ever a cover and drinks are cheap! If you're looking for fun on a budget, this is the place!


P.s. If you sit at one of the tables check out the awesome pictures on them! My favorite is the prohibition table.

P.p.s. Girls... You have to look in the bathroom... There's pictures of hunky guys on the inside of the stalls... There's even pictures of Tumbleweed (the owner)!
