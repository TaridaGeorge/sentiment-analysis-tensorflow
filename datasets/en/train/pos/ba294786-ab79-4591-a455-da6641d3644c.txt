I love breweries and I love Four Peaks. One of e best breweries in Az. We came here on a Friday night but had no trouble getting a table. This place is huge and packed but still room to move around. We ordered the Hopshot IPA which is a great beer!  I've been here a few time and always had a good experience. I can't wait till the pumpkin porter coming Oct 1st!!!
