This place is the awsome! Delicious and unique hot dogs that you can't find anywhere else in AZ. Everything is fresh and made in house which is what sets this place above the competition. Also the owner is extemely nice and you couldn't ask for better service. Everything Ive had at this place has been great but my favorite if def the Hana Dog! So if your having a craving for a great hot dog, Maui Dog is definately the place to go!
