Day 1: Excellent, personable service! The waiter, upon discovering it was my first time in, actually sat down at my table and told me about the establishment and their wonderful array of drinks and eats. Americano was made with fab espresso! Yum!

Day 2: Yes, I actually came back the VERY NEXT DAY! Had another Americano, and after an hour or so of studying, tried the egg creme (Note:does not actually contain egg).  This smooth, chocolaty goodness left me wanting more, so......

Day 3: Well, you get the idea. I have been here everyday to study since my first day over a week ago and still look forward to my few hours of studying, accompanied by "rewards." Cozy atmosphere, great staff and peaceful place to study!
