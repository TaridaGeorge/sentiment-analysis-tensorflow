We went here this week to celebrate our first anniversary and were totally impressed with the food, service and experience. This was such an overall fantastic dining experience, that exceeded my expectations. 

We arrive to a table covered in rose petals with custom printed anniversary menus. We had absolutely delicious food and drinks and a customized anniversary dessert. Service was perfect as well.

The property is beautiful and quiet and doesn't have a 'big resort feel' which was nice.

I fully back my 5-star rating!
