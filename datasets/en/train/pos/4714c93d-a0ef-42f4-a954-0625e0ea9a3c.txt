OMG...this place it's amazingly good!  Every pieces of sashimi it's just melt in our mouth. This place is very cozy not fancy but the foods are out of this world.   Besides serving fresh fishes, the chef is very knowledgeable of his products, and the waitresses are outstanding.  Thank you for the delicious meal Hiro Sushi you really deserved the five stars from me! For dinner of two adults and one kid the meal come to $181.42 plus tips.  All of us were stuffed and happy!
