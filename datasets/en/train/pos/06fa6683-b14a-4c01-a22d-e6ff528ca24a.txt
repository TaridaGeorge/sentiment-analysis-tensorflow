Excellent Trailhead into the Superstition Wildernesss if you want to get away from people quickly. After 3 miles we saw no other people until the next morning, 9 miles away.

Showers at the marina public restroom are not the highest quality, but after a few days in the wilderness it was like a spa. March to Mid-April and October to November are most recommended for having water sources available.
