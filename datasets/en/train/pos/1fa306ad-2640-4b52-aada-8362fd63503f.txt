BEST FALAFELS EVER!  My parents and I have had falafels all around the world and I think these here are actually the best I've ever had.  They're not just your typical lettuce, falafel, and tahini sauce.  The falafels weren't dry and made fresh to order, there was great flavorful homemade sauces and relishes, and even the salad inside was full of lettuce, tomato, and homemade pickled vegetables.  Amazing!!!  Flavorful, spicy, and an amazing deal - they were huge and only 3.99!

The market has a great selection of Middle Eastern groceries and is very clean.  The owners treat you like you are their personal guests in their house and love to talk to you about the food, culture, and everything else...very sweet people!

It's definitely not the fanciest place but delicious, authentic, flavorful, loving food and this place will definitely become a regular for us!
