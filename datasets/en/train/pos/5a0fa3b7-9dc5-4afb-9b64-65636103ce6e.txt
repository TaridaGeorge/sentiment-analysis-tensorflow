I'm still full after eating here. The food is really good and the service is wonderful. We ordered the bruschetta to start and then ordered a pizza and their alfredo pasta. The bill wasn't ridiculous and we had a ton of leftover food. 

I agree that the parking lot sucks, but that's Oregano's for you.
