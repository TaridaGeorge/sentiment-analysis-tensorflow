This was a great place to spend an afternoon on the patio after sharing a sampler of the brews. Decided on the Hop Knot and the Hefeweizen as our favorites of the day.

The wait staff was knowledgeable about the brew selections.  Thank you! 

We shared a platter of walleye that was very good also.

Definitely a must try if you find yourself in the area and want a dose of off campus life.
