This place is great for several reasons.  First and foremost, the gelatos are great.  Second, the quality of service is excellent.  The owners are extremely nice and affable as are the employees.  I've never had a bad experience in there.  Third, the environment is awesome.  The music, the dining areas, the views of Old Town, and the seating make a really interesting experience.  I throughly enjoy visiting the G-Spot whenever I can.
