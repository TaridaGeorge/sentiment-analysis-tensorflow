Best General Tso chicken in the valley!! Hands down! This place used to be called Yie's cafe or something like that and I ate here when it was called that but whoever took it over, I'm glad they did. I mean, don't get me wrong. The food was still good back then but now it just seems to have that something extra. 
Another good item is the crab puffs. I like how they're shaped like triangles instead of fried wontons like some places do. 
Everytime I come here the place is empty...which I just don't understand cause the food is reasonably priced and seriously amazing!
Come eat here people!  You won't regret it!
