The Chuck Box will always have a spot in my heart. As an ASU student in the late '90's it was my go to burger joint on the edge of campus. On a recent visit to Tempe, I was delighted to learn that the place has not changed one bit. It is my all-time favorite burger. These are large fire grilled burgers or chicken, choice of cheese, just stand and watch as your burger grills right in front of you. The dressings come on the bar so you make it to your own taste. It doesn't get any better than this for me. My must visit spot in Tempe, AZ. Love, love, love the Chuck Box. Don't change a thing.
