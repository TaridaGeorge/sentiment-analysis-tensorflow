Love being healthy and eating here is easy to be healthy. I just recently started going here regularly. I didn't see the old menu but the new one is fantastic. Brown rice wraps are really good and you can put whatever you want in them. You do have to park underground and walk up but, hey adds to being healthy so don't mind the little walk. The sweet potato fries are cooked in air but are crispy like they were fried. Comes with a sauce i normally would not even try but works deliciously with it!
