I can't believe I'm giving 5 stars to a BBQ place, but this place is damn good.  I normally don't get excited about BBQ.

I had the pulled pork sandwich, macaroni salad and baked beans.  Everything was excellent, the meat, the sauce, the bun, the mac salad, and definitely the beans.  Seriously, this place was tasty.  It was even reasonably priced.  

One guy at my table got this crazy sausage-on-a-bun with pork and sweet potato fires on it.  Seriously, don't eat this on a first date, but it looked like an adventure.  His waffle fries looked great, too.

To finish things off, I left my cellphone on the table and the girl behind the counter chased me down in the parking lot and gave it to me.

I'm excited to try something else, but I wouldn't be surprised if my usual order is exactly what I had today.
