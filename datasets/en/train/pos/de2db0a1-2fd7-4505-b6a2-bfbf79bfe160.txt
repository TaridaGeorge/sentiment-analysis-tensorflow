The mall of malls, for sure! So many designer boutiques, so little time! On this trip, I was given the utmost in attention from the fabulous women at the Fossil store....what fun they were! I enjoyed a smoked chicken & black bean salad @ Z Tejas next and the service was excellent. I then perused the new styles at Aqua before finding a great pair of shades at Solstice = shopper's bliss :)
This review is a bit late; I visited the center on 1/27/12 - and I'll be back :)
