I have been coming here for years!  The prices are great and the owner is a gem!  (The rest of the staff is great too!)  Even though I haven't been in at least a year (I was flying on the east coast) she knew my name and remembered what I do and whatnot. ( I was never a regularly tanning person. I am generally very pale and usually just tan when I have a special occasion. Last time I was going often was my friends wedding 3 years ago....

Anyway. She is amazing the prices are great and Its very hygienic.  According to previous reviews the beds are older. But I dont mind...  its not worth paying a lot more and going somewhere snooty....
