My Doctor recommended this place. You want a great chinese place ? THIS IS IT !
It is in a strip mall that is not the most popular but they turned the inside into a bistro you take your friends to for bragging rights. Awesome tile, the best furnishings and bar.
And the food is next to none. We recommend the Honey Walnut Prawns but every thing we tried was flavorful, melt in your mouth delicious. It is so hard to find awesome chinese food I sure hope we can keep this place around. Oh yeah the utensils are top of the line too which adds so much to the ambience.
