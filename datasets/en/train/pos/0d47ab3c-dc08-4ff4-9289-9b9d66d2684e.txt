Dr. Stephen Cohen and his staff at Dr. My Eyes provide exceptional eye care.  Him and his staff are always very welcoming and make you feel like family.  

I was highly recommended to Dr. Cohen and his team when I was new to the area and they did not dissapoint.  Dr. Cohen takes his time with each patient and makes you feel extremely comfortable with putting your vision in his hands.  Dr. Cohen and his staff have years of experience that put you at ease right away.  The staff is always helpful and the eyewear selection is excellent.  Dr. Cohen is always readily available to his patients should something come up.  I would highly recommend Dr. Cohen and his staff to any of my friends and family.
