We had Robert's do the entire catering package for our outdoor wedding.  Food, tables, chairs, linens, cake, bartender...

I couldn't have dreamed of a better experience.  The food was FANTASTIC.  (Chicken in hunter sauce and the pork loin.)  The cake was the best I've ever had.  Of 46 adults at the wedding, about 10 of them have come up to me and said it was the best wedding food and cake they've ever had.  Taste and presentation was outstanding.  

Robert was personally in charge from the time we sat down with him to make selections to the end of the event, and was always accessible for questions in between.  He is a perfectionist, and has one heck of a knack for detail.

I couldn't recommend Robert's any more highly.
