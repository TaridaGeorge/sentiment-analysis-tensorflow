Hey vegans, they've got a menu guide just for you (ask for it), showing exactly what dishes are vegan and which are not. They'll also happily substitute ingredients in and out of any dish to make them vegan for you. 

I recommend: the potato garlic dip, the hummus (get the regular pitas, the greek ones have dairy in them), thousand beans, the macro platter and there are a few more good ones as well.
