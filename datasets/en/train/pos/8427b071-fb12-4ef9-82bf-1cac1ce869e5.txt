I've eaten at Wy-Knot a handful of times now and I have yet to have a bad experience there. The food is awesome, with a pleasant selection of vegetarian (and even vegan) fare for those folks conscious of animal harm, the menu changes fairly regularly to incorporate new specials (which is a huge plus for anyone with an adventurous palate), and the service has always been cheerful and attentive on the occasions that I have visited.

I also appreciate that Jackie makes an effort to have a seasonal option on the menu at all times and prices all the food at what seems to be a very fair value considering the quality of the food. Oh and the beet salad! Beets are good for more than just making sugar, try the beet salad here and I'm sure you'll agree.
