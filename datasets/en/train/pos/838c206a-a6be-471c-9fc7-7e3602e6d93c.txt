Great friendly staff, wonderful food!  Gets busy quickly.  LOVED the Ravioli's with Meat Sauce!  Will definitely make this place a regular on my stops to Scottsdale! Generous portions so no one could try the desserts but I hear they are fabulous too!  CASH ONLY so don't forget to bring some of the green stuff!
