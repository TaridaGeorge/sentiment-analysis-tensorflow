I. Love. Korean. Tofu. Soup. A lot. And obviously, I've eaten a ton of it in my lifetime. I hate admitting this (because I live so far away from here), but I think this place might beat them all.

I think my love for this place started when I saw that you can adjust the spice level of your tofu soup. Only a select few tofu places I've been to have let me do this, which is unfortunate because I am an avid spice enthusiast. Obviously, I got the max level, and it blew my mind. I'm kind of salivating at the thought of it right now, actually.

I miss this place too much :( I will be sure to return when I'm in Arizona next, whenever that is!
