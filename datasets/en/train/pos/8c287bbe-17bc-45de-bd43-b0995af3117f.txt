I love brunch. I love protein. This wonderful restaurant has eggs galore! The omelets are delicious. So are the potatoes. My last experience with a brunch omelette was not very pleasant (at Original Pancake House), so getting an omelette at TC Eggington's more than made up for it. I love eggs again thanks to TC! 

The decor can be described as quaint country. It was cute! The service was good. I was there on Friday for lunch, so it wasn't too crowded. It seems pretty popular with the elderly (I think there's a Leisure World nearby).
