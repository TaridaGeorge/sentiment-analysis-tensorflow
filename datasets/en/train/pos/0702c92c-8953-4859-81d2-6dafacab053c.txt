FIVE starts to this delicious little boutique bridal shop at gainey village. My BFF is getting married and purchased her GORGEOUS dress from there. They have a great selection plus periodic trunk shows... sales associates are SO super sweet and kind they always make her (and her party) feel at home and comfortable. The process was so easy and beautiful. They are really great there. They even let her borrow a veil to take some engagement photos with...they are amazing!! (she's not a yelper so I'm doing the honors :)

I recommend them to any blushing bride-to-be!
