This was the first time here, and I was very impressed.  They got me right in with Lisa who was very sweet and thorough.  She did my pedicure and manicure, which only came to $27.00 which was very resonable.  Everything was clean, and it was obvious that she took pride in her work.  She also does alterations (hems jeans for only $4.00!).  I will definitely be back.
