Born and raised here, got smart and leave for the summers.  I LOVE Phoenix in the winter!  Green grass, cool weather flowers, glorious sun, resort wear, swimming, cocktails by an outdoor fire vs snow boots, scraping the windshield of ice, wearing tons of clothes and sitting in front of a "sad" light.  Lets see, thats a tough one!   One nice cashmere sweater will fix this little bit of cold we are experiencing.
