This is my #1 work lunch destination. Simple sandwiches on delicious bread... Every day there is a lunch special - so sandwich plus a bag of chips and a drink for ((((drum roll)))) 3.99$. Yeah, you heard me right. With tax, the total is 4.31$ but that's still REALLY good, pretty unheard of.

In addition to the awesome sandwiches there are GREAT pastries and desserts. Honestly, they remind me of home (Seattle) - that had a great International District.

Five stars, Donna's Bakery, keep on being awesome!
