I wanted to bring my family out to an interesting culinary experience, and FnB was decidedly up to the challenge. They have a smaller menu of items that they change out semi-regularly, with about four choices for appetizer, sides and mains. We managed to end up having about one of everything on the menu, and I must say: fantastic. Great combinations of ingredients, both expected and unexpected, but quite the tastebud paradise. Of particular note was the roasted cajun chickpeas, and the duck with merguez and rice.

They have a few decent craft beers to go along with it all, as well as wines by the glass. Dessert was quite a treat as well; I had an interesting twist on butterscotch pudding that was delectable.
