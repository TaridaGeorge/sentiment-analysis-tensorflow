As someone who knows Phoenix bookstores said to me, "they have great books.' That's the bottom line -- obviously excellent collections of rare antiquarian books find their way here. 

My only complaint is that the balance between the "secured area" of rare books in cases, and general used books on shelves, is tilted too far against access and towards security. It makes browsing a lot of work.

Prices are very fair for the kinds of books they have.
