I remember going into Forefathers the first day they were open. The owner still recognizes me when I go in. Gotta love a family owned business turning out the best product n the city and doing well. This place sells itself but in case you are in doubt about the best Philly Cheese Steak in the city, take the Pepsi challenge you will become a believer.
