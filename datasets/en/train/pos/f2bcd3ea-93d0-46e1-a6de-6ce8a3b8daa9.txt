Definately original, I overheard my fianc√©es step-mother talking about this place before, and today we needed to get a Christmas gift for her so went to check it out. The owner was very helpful, she knows her product. She sold us a custom gift box with a fantastic selection of both sweet and savory balsamic and olive oils.

Some of the olive oils we tried were chipotle, basil and picual, some of the vinegars were tangerine, raspberry and pear. Really a fun experience, I will be back for myself soon!
