My favorite sushi in ALL of Scottsdale.  The pricing is excellent.  The sushi is of incredible quality.  I have been here hundreds of times and have never had anything that I didn't like and I have tried almost the whole menu!  
The service is excellent.  The cocktails are unique and tasty.  I have never had to wait for a table.  
Excellent rating across the board.
