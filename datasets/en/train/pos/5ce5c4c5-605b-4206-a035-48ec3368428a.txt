Pretty sweet.  I stayed here during a business trip, when I was bumped from the main resort into a villa due to an overbooking of the hotel.

I stayed in building 4, room 101 (sorry if this is your time share!  I took good care of it...), which is essentially a 1 bedroom apartment.  There is a tiny kitchen with dishes and everything else you'd need to have a meal for a small group, plus a stacked washer and dryer (which I used a lot!) at no extra cost.

The whirlpool tub is wonderful, and as always Westin's Heavenly Beds deliver.  It's nice to have a private patio to enjoy the weather on, as well as a separate pool area for kids and adults away from the main resort.  Would love to go back!  The service was great as well.
