My Gawd! Why don't more people come to this place? The wraps are incredible. Just had the Mediterranean that was served hot and just melted into ecstacy as my meaty jaw sank into that great fusion of olive feta and chicken with that delicious dressing. The room is cute too with some art pieces for sale. BTW you can park in the back behind the strip mall if it gets to busy in the front at Thomas. I hope this place stays there a long time.
