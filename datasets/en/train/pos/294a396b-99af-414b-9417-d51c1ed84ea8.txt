these guys normally close at 4pm on saturday, but my brakes wuza squeeling and making this awful grinding noise. 

i dropped my car around 3pm on friday and said i would pick it up saturday. time goes and goes and goes and it's getting close to 4pm when one of the service guys, khaled, calls and says "almost done, we'll have it finished for you today.

anything related to cars these days gets a bad rap. sure, there's some shady shenanigans going on, but today, not for me. he calls again at 4:30 (when they're supposed to be closed) and says my truck is ready!
thanks khaled for not making me ride my bike 20 miles to work on monday...in the rain!
