Amazing, perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, quality steaks! I went here with a party of five to try out this new location. I didn't think this place would be that great and thought it would be comparable to like black angus or outback and let me tell you how wrong I was!  I'm pretty picky when it comes to steak, I don't like sawing off pieces of meat and I order my steaks medium rare and they never come out that way or it's just bleeding everywhere and still raw. we ordered the lobster stuffed filet and the ribeye and omg we were in heaven and could not believe how effortless it was to cut off a piece of steak and chew it. it melted in my mouth and was so flavorful and well seasoned. the service was great and attentive. I will most definitely come back again!
