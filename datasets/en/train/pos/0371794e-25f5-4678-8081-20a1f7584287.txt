Have been looking for a new dog to join our family and was really impressed by how friendly everyone there is. Ended up volunteering at the shelter as well and WOW they are highly organized and all the volunteers are so nice and the fundraisers and adoption events are all so fun. Will be taking Cayenne and Pepper back there for shots for sure, and hopefully foster a pooch soon. Have never fostered or adopted but the staff has made me feel really comfortable about the process and learning the dogs' personalities. Stop in and say hi to the pooches and cats!
