I was walking down Mill with my mother when she saw the sign for Cookiez on Mill she turned into the cookie monster and said "Me want cookie". Neither of us have never been to Cookiez on Mill and were pleasantly surprised when we walked in this tiny cookie-ice cream shop. Right away we were offered samples of their delicious cookies and the best thing is that they will make you a homemade ice cream sandwich with any cookie and ice cream combo you can think of. The end result is the closest thing to heaven.
