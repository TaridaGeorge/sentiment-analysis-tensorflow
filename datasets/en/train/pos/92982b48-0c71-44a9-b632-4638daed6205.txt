Where everybody knows your name.  Very refreshing to be waited on by Wally himself, I'll come back for the we serve mostly "regulars" feeling you get.  I don't think enough people know about this place but those that do come back for more.  The Cuban is my lunch of choice and the beer selection is perfect for happy hour.
