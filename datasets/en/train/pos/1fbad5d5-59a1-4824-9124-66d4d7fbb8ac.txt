I don't understand the low rating for this restaurant. 

- Great ambiance relative to the numerous other Indian restaurants I have been to.

- Good service, water was refilled 3 times, naan was replaced immediately upon decimation. 

- PRICE. With the yelp deal its incredibly cost effective to get full off of good indian food. 

- The food was good, not great, not bad, but good. 

Of course I always compare a meal relative to how much I paid. I paid $5 dollars for AYCE indian food that had a decent selection of food, all of which was delicious. For 5 bucks this place is as good as it gets. 

Always review relative to how much you paid. If you rate this place any less than 3 stars you are truly a snob.
