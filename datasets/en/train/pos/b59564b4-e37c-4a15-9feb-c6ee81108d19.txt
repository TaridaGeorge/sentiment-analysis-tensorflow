I've visited four or five times now, and each time have been glad that I did. Yes, it's loud. It's dark. The lights flicker. And the claustrophobic should think twice. Combined with consistently phenomenal food, these are all aesthetically compelling reasons to absolutely love this place. I generally stick to the vegetarian menu; last night I tried the eggplant parmesan, which was incredibly satisfying. And they do have some rather decent beer on tap. The staff are friendly and accommodating: even the bus-boy was upbeat and helpful as we navigated their dense menu.

It's a pain in the ass to get a table (as it should be), so choose your one best friend and sit at the bar.

Do it.
