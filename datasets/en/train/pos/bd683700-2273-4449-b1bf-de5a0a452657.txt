Great family owned coffee spot.  I work in the building so I visit regularly.  The owner is usually there running around making drinks or making fun.  Him and the staff dressed up on Halloween and I thought it was great.  I appreciate that the staff recognizes regular patrons and they know my drink before I order.  Sometimes I bring my laptop and work in the coffee shop.  The music selections are always perfect for work/study.  They also have a stamp card that rewards regular customers with a free drink.  Starbucks who???
