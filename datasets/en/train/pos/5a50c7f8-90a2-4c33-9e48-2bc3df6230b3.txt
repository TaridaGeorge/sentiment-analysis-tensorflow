First time to Scottsdale Stadium to watch a spring training game.  (My actual first time at the stadium was in 2006 to see the USA vs South Africa in the World Baseball Classic)

SO MUCH FUN!!  First of all there is nothing better then on a sunny warm day to be outside having a hot dog and beer watching a ball game!  The stadium is a nice venue.  I am not a fan of the SF Giants, but it was fun watching Barry Zito get killed in the first by his former team!!  

Can't wait for more games this month!! Here comes the spring!
