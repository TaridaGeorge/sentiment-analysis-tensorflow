I used to live by this place.  I quite miss it.  The 5* is for their hummus alone!  SO GOOD.  Three different kinds: cilantro jalapeno, red pepper, and regular.  I've not had anything bad here and have never left here hungry.  Staff is always friendly and speedy and the atmosphere is trendy/casual/relaxed/come as you are.  This place is super popular with the veggie/vegan set and for good reason: there are lots of options for those wanting their grub sans animalia.  Hard to criticize a place that combines great food, great value, and great fun!
