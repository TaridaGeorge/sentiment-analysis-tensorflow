After being dashed around Tempe like a lost sheep who strayed from the herd, I was eventually ushered into Casey Moore's. The colors are the gaudy southwest type and the building is rather large and unassuming. Must be a converted house smack in the University District, right? Yes. That it may be, but it's so much more than that. Inside tends to get crowded but where the real action is at is on the ginormous patio they house. There is a separate bar outside for all the action and plenty of people flock to it's calling. There are drinks a plenty, people watching a plenty, food a plenty and oysters. Oysters? 
In the desert? Sure, why not? Shuck em down!

Bonus: for the guys, the Blarney Stone is not to be missed!
