I wash my own cars at home.

I usually come here to use their industrial grade vacuum.  Four quarters for four minutes of use.  You really can't beat that.

Make sure you clean out all of the garbage first, and prepare your floors and seats to be vacuumed.  If you do it right, all you will need is four minutes.  (That's NOT what she said...)
