Favorite place in Scottsdale to go for an afternoon of great wine and socializing.  Low noise level making it easy to carry on conversations with more than the person sitting next to you.  A young man, Shawn, makes our outings special by catering to our group of "senior" women.  It is a 50 minute drive here but well worth the time.  Appetizers and food are great.  Many choice wines to choose from at a super happy hour price.  Have been there many times and will go back many more.
