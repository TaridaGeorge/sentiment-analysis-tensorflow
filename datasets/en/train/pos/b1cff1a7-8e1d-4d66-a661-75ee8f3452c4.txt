Wow!

I'll keep this short since there are over 100 great reviews on on Yelp for the Cornish Pasty:

1.  I didn't know what a pasty was until today.  It was truly amazing.

2.  Red wine gravy.  I've never tasted a red wine gravy like it.  Compelling.

3.  Excellent beer and cider selection.

4.  Small place, great environment.
