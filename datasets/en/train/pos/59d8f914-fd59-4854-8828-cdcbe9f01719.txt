Since my initial review, I've been back to Cafe Zuzu many times. This is definitely one of my favorite places to go. 

I recently discovered their potato gnocchi. Holy cow, this stuff is amazing!! I'm not a mushroom fan, so I had them sub in heirloom tomatoes, and what a great decision that was! The sauce that they're served in is so sweet and creamy and the parmesan cheese shavings on top are the perfect accent. You've got to try this dish before they take it off the menu (think it's seasonal).

I also recently discovered their fantastic happy hour! It goes until 7, so there's plenty of time to take advantage of the specials. They have a whole menu of specialty drinks that are only $3, in addition to a great appetizer menu. We're planning on going this Friday to take advantage again!
