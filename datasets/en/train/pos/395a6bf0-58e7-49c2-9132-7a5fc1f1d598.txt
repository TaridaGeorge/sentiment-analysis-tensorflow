Great pizza! The best in Phoenix. This pizzeria is perfection. Immaculate. Nice decor. Good service. The only drawback about this restaurant is the wait to get in. If you don't arrive early you could wait more than an hour to be seated. But I must say that it's worth the wait. The pizza is that good.
