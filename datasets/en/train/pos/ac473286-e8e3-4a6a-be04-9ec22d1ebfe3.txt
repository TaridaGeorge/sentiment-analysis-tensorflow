Simply put this place is AWESOME.  If you're looking to start a business or already own a business but need some of the details on a particular area, this is the place to be.  So far I've only attended a Brown bag lunch but I was thoroughly impressed by the people who were there. However, don't show up with out being ready to put in your two cents, its needed to keep the ball going, I thought it was really good.  I can't wait to go back!
