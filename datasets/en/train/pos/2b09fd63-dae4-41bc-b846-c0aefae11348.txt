Went for lunch on a weekday.  The decor is great, I love the colors and the relaxing atmosphere.  The fresh bread with three flavored butters is awesome, especially the pretzel bread - yum!  I tried the entree of the day, which was a shrimp and scallop risotto.  My fiance had the basil-crusted chicken breast with gnocchi and asparagus.  Both dishes were incredible, perfectly cooked and well seasoned, with appropriate portion sizes.  We both loved it and will definitely go back again.
