This place is awesome! The popsicles are amazing, and there are always non-dairy options for us poor lactose-intolerant types! Plus, if you put the sticker from the bag on your wallet or phone, you get a free secret thing when you flash it...I got a free lemonade type drink the other day, which was awesome. Plus there is an indoor and outdoor seating area.

Also, they have stuff for dogs! And dog bowls! If I had a dog I'd probably like this place even better haha.
