I have visited Miracle Mile a few times and found that they deserve review after having a pleasant experience every time! First off, large sitting area! I never feel cramped or in other peoples business! This place is super clean and their employees are always smiling and friendly! 

My favorite: Best Pastrami EVER!! I LOVE getting the New Yorker! Their French fries were fresh and tasty!! Their bread is fresh every day!! This is great quality food!! The Mac N Cheese is creamy and is my boyfriends favorite side dish! Their carrot cake is exquisite and a must have to every meal!! 

You will not be disappointed with Miracle Mile! Fast and Friendly service with high quality food!
