Fucking BENTO BOX!!!!  Oh man,  getting diabetes has never been so delicious.  These boxes are massive to the point where you can barely close the thing.  It's as if the food is fighting imprisonment so it can raid your taste buds for all they're worth.  These babies have dumplings, rice, fried pork, teriyaki chicken, and a small salad so you don't feel so bad about it afterwards.   Which you won't. 
Now if you don't want to look like a total slob you can get the Teryiaki Chicken bowl.  (Spicy is my thing but hey, you can puss out if you want)
One massive bowl of rice and meat later and nothing seems so bad anymore.  Not even the dead hooker in your trunk can steal anything from this afterglow.
