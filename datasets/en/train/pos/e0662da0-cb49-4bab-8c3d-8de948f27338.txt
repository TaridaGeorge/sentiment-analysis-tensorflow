Okay, so I just moved here two months ago from the Bay Area where we have a big Thai population thus resulting in a large Thai food restaurant population. Anyways, I'm a big fan of the stuff and figured here in burrito land there would be nothing decent from Asia. Wrong.
After reading some reviews I gave it a shot and was more than satisfied. Good food, good portions.... sums up the food. The service was marginal with my requesting for water and all, but the guy was nice and gave us some free rice upon my price inquiry. 
I will most certainly be returning, hopefully to more hospitable service, and hope to soon refer to this as "the place I always go". I definitely advise Thai Basil to anyone in question.
