When this place first opened for dim sum -- it was closed haha.  Yeah I know it doesn't make sense, but what I meant was they had to shut down to re-do some work.  Well, now back to present time, I must admit they doing a hell of a job!  Food was quick and yummy!  Chili oil? Well that had some kick -- kick me in the ass with my first bite!  Service was pretty good...our teapot kept full and our dishes were removed with ninja-like speed.  Though it is weird in the food court having dim sum, but what made it for me was the classic Chinese music playing -- wow that brought back some memories! - Enjoy
