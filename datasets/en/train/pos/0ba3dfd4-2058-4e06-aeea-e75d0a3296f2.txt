They service the entire valley, it's not just Tempe. They sent this really nice guy to fix the lock on my trunk. Not only did he have the right part on him, he did all the work fairly quickly and really didn't charge too much. He also gave me some tips on signs people are trying to steal your tires (like trying to break into your trunk). Decent people.
