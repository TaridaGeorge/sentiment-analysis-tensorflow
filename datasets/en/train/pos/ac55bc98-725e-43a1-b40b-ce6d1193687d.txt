Incredible beer! Best I've had from local Arizona brewery, hands down. I like 4 Peaks, but this is better. I've not had there food, so this is solely based on beer and service. The wait staff has been very knowledgeable and pleasant every time I've been, only 3 times, and don't ever act snobby about the beer.
