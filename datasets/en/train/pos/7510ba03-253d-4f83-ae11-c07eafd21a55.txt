I love this store! 

I've never had a problem with rude employees like a previous reviewer did, and I've been there probably 8-10 times.

I always find cute outfits, at a very good price. They don't offer many sizes, but it's a boutique, and that is how boutique shopping is. Their accessories are to die for, and reasonably priced.

I've never had a problem with the quality of the garments. They hold up well in the wash, and last pretty long.
