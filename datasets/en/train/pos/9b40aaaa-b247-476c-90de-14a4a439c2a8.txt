I have been a long time customer and if I ever move out of the neighborhood I will still drive back to go to this salon! Everyone is courteous and caring. it can be EXTREMELY busy on Saturdays so I suggest if you are going for the first time to either make an appointment or go during the week. All the techs are amazing :)
