Everything from the fancy pool to the hipster rooftop is a must do in Phoenix. The staff their is very helpful and so sweet. Also if you're from out of town; here's a FYI: The sunsets in Phoenix are stunning... the Clarendon Rooftop is definitely the place to be when capturing the gorgeous sunset while sipping on a martini.
