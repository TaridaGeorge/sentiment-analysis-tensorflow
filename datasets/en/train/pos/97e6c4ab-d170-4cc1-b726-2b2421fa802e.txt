My husband and I come here on a weekly basis. The crepes are delicious (especially the nutella and banana) and the ingredients are always fresh.  Coffee is good and the staff (that consists of mother, son and daughter) are always friendly and welcoming. Sometimes service takes a while when they are busy but they are worth the wait! We love this place and will continue to go there as long as we live in Arizona. We also voted them the best cafe on bestofphoenix2012.com
Good luck Cupz nd Crepes!
