I went for happy hour in the bar and it was great! It was so busy, but the server was able to still be really nice and get us everything we needed. We had the chicken egg rolls on the happy hour and they were so good! We also got the banana cream pie, it was so amazing! It melted in your mouth! I cannot wait to go back!
