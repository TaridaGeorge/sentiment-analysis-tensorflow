I decided to try this place while I was visiting Phoenix since all the Yelp reviews gave them 5 stars! I can see why!!!! I had asked the cashier to recommend me a flavor for their T'soynami, as I have never heard of anything like this before. She suggested the vegan nami. I was unsure at first because I am by far not even close to a vegan... more like a carnivore! I went with her suggestion anyway. The vegan nami is so delicious! I would go back there again and again if I am ever in town again! Vacationing and decided to stop here to kill time because of the rave reviews! I'm so glad I did!!!
