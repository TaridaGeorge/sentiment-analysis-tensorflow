Like all Fox eateries you can expect the best. Grilled cheese to DIE for! Cheap coffee, great food, great service, great environment. Formerly know as "the counter," Mr Fox renamed it after the birth of his daughter Chloe. You can feel the family vibe when you sit at the counter and order your "counter chopped" salad or "hot roast beef" sandwich.
