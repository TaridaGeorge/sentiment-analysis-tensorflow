I have been here a few times.  The food is always great and fresh.  Prices are reasonable for a seafood place.  I usually go during happy hour and sit at the bar - Brian is a great bartender, very attentive and loves to talk sports.  Happy hour prices are amazing.  The resturant is big and open with high ceilings and its not too dark or loud.
