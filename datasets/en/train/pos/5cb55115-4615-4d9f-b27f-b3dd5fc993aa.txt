My only experience is Mother's Day Brunch, but it rocked! Probably the best BBQ buffet I've ever had. Very Vegas like! The filet medallions were probably the best meat I've ever had at a buffet. The kids loved the live country band. I just wish it was open earlier before the sun started beating down. I'd definitely go there again if passing through Phoenix.
