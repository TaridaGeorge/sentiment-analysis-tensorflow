I found Cornish Pasty via yelp about 2 years ago while visiting Phoenix area for work.  It made such an impression on me,I keep hoping i get to go back to try more variations on the pasties.  We had so much fun with beer and music also last time that i hope the expansion didn't get rid of the hole in the wall feeling.  Anyway my coworkers are placing orders for me to bring back pasties for them.  I don't know how i'm gonna fly with those, but we'll see.   It's probably gonna be  110 plus or minus, but the fact that with of all the great places in phoenix im still drooling about this one means i gotta give it a 5.
