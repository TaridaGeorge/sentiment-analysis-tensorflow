I die!

I am so excited to have this gem of a place here in Phoenix.  From the eclectic vibe, fresh food choices, and delicious chai tea lattes, this place is my favorite wind down spot.  Love the extended hours and it makes a great late night hang out spot, when almost everything in Phoenix is closed.

I had the special mac and cheese smothered with cheese, jalapenos and slices of crispy bacon.  delicious!
