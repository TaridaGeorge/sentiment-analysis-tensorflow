I have been here too many times to count.  My family and I come here for every special occasion... graduation, Christmas, birthdays.  The food is excellent and the service is always superb.   What I love about the Royal Palms and T Cooks is the outdoor seating areas.  In the winter time it is great because they have these nooks with fireplaces and seating so you can have drinks by the fire.
