Mikado is my favorite sushi place in the Chandler/Gilbert area.  The fish is AMAZING and they often have really great stuff in, like blue fin, etc.  The chefs are really good and often make me special things that aren't on the menu.  The nigiri portions are very generous. 
This is one of the two or three places where I try the specialty rolls, the albacore and garlic roll is awesome.  Also they have specialty sashimi that you should really try if you go.  Another winner is the tempura and garlic app, the deep fried garlic is actually sweet and mellow, very nice.
The atmosphere is nice and the staff is VERY friendly, and the prices are totally reasonable.  Like I said before, my favorite sushi spot anywhere near me.
