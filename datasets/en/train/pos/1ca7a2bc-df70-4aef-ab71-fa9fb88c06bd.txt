This is without a doubt the best place to get a slice in the Downtown area.

While it is nothing like the slices in NYC (from what I remember when I lived there that is), it's as best as Phoenix can get.

The employees are incredibly kind and everytime I've gone someone has been outside cleaning. 

They offer an ASU discount which amounts to $5.44 for 2 slices + fountain drink (with tax).

Also, their happy hour ($1 slices) has been moved to the hours of 3-5 instead of 2-5.

It's worth a shot -- they offer vegan as well as gluten free. And, they tell me they do deliever -- within a 3 mile radius from the hours of 11-1, M-F -- so get your lunch delivered!
