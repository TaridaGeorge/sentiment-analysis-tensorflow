This is where I started doing Bikram yoga.  I've tried other studios for their 30 day deals, but always come back here.  This is by FAR the best bikram studio in the valley.  Its got the best vibe, the best staff, and the best environment.  Other places I've tried were super crowded.  I walked away more stressed than when I walked in.  While lying in savasana at the end of a class in Scottsdale people were hurdling over me and vying for spots for the next class.  Not fun.   If you want an awesome, relaxing, fulfilling experience this is the spot.

I'm not a connoisseur of other people's technique  . . . ahem, but from what I've seen and experienced, the teachers are knowledgeable and friendly and the other practitioners seem happy and healthy and hey, isn't that the point?
