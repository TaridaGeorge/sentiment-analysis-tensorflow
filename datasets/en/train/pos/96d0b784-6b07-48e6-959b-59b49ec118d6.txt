What an amazing hotel!

Brand new hotel with an amazing staff. Truly one of the best experiences I've had. 

A wonderful bar and restaurant downstairs, and room service well into the night. 

As a singer, I asked for a humidifier and they offered it complimentary. 

Wonderful location, lots of bars and restaurants nearby.
