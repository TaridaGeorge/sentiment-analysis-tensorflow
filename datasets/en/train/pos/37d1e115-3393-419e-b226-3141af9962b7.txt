There's only a handful in Phoenix that I crave.  The Herb Box is one of them.  Every time I go, I strive to try new item to taste test.  NEVER disappointed.  Trout, Short Ribs, Thai Ribs, Smoked Gouda Mac, The Beets!  I mean this place makes you crave the sides.  The sides?  Not to mention an amazing wine list.  The service is always personal and engaging.  Looking forward to their new PV location!  Now if they will just come downtown!
