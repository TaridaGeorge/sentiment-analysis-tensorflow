Nice waiters. Great food. You really due pay for the atmosphere and the ambiance, in my view..its worth it.  I dont see to many places with the feel this place has. I just was on my way from Portland and was lead to this place unknowingly..and it was just what I needed.

Waiters are nice.
One of the bartenders... kind of an "one uper," ...but over all nice people to talk to. 

Soon to be a duke.
