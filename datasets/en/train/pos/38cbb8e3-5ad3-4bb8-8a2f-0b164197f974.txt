I was so pleasantly surprised with dinner here, I figure this place should be the first 5 star rating I give in Phoenix. Looking back, I can't really fault them for anything. Good food, service, large variety of food  & drinks. 

This place is found in the end of a very nondescript plaza. But inside, the setting is romantic with dim lights and Michael Buble music. Service was very friendly and inviting, just as others have mentioned. We ordered crab cakes for appetizer and I had the veal ala cordon bleu, both of which I highly recommend. In our group of 5, everyone was pleased and stuffed that most of us came out with lunch for tomorrow.
