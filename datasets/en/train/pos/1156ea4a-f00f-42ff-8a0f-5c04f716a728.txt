most authentic japanese i've had made by real japanese people.  (if u don't know, most sushi restaurants and japanese restaurants are actually owned by koreans lols).  

the guy is an old-skool asian guy, not grumpy, but not nice.  he does what he does.  atmosphere needs some music, but food makes up 4 it.  

if u order a dinner, u get a yakitori skewer and OMFG it makes the meal.  lightly crunchy outside, juicy flavorful chicken on the inside.... srsly.

the only thing i don't like is how sweet some of the japanese sauces are.... but that's my own personal preference.
