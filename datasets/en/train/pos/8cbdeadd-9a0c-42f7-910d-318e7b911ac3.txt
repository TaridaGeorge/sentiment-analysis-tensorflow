Well, anyplace that gives me reason to shovel food into my face until I feel like I'm going to explode is worthy of 5 stars. 

Brisket: nice mix of fatty/crispy.
Ribs: Hubby-approved.
Smoked chicken: moist, meaty, rich.
Fried okra: Oh, YUM. Loved the crunchy cornbread coating. And the fact that it turned the paper bag transparent on the drive home...that just means it's good for me, right?
Mac/Cheese: Never would have thought to slather the stuff in butter, but boy oh boy that made it yummy. 
Greens: nice and salty.

Not too expensive for a BBQ place...looking forward to trying the rest of the menu. I'm so glad I tried this place!
