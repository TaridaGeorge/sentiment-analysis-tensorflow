i came after hours for drinks at the bar here after a biz party in the area. located in the Hotel Clarendon, which has been around for a very long time but has def gotten in a cool baby face lift recently.

the bar is uber chic but fun every once in a while for that scene. as an added note, the hotel is an important part of AZ history, as an Arizona Republic reporter was murdered in the parking lot, by car bomb, for his work covering the mob in phoenix (yes, phoenix in the 70s was run by a serious network of greedy officials with mob ties). he was the first American reporter to be killed on U.S. soil in retaliiation for his work. 
that is your AZ history lesson for the day. camus kicks ass, that is all.
