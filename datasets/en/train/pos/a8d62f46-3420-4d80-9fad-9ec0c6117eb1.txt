I had a featured chef menu item the other night; salmon tacos.  Very flavorful!  They are also now serving a really great Pinot Noir (Daedalus)...which I was very excited about.  Now that I'm living back in the area I will also be able to take advantage of their "After 9" Lounge bites for $5 and sips for $6.  Which is exactly what Grayhawk needs....  Not many great little lounge spots are open late on Thurs...and Jasper's is now open late on Thurs, Fri's, and Saturdays until midnight.  The bartender "Eddie" is awesome.  He's definitely passionate about his cocktails.  The one I enjoy most right now is his version of the Pimms Cup.  He's got a funny dry sense of humor...  Pretentious does not define him.  He does a great job of giving the restaurant that lounge feel..more like a San Francisco lounge.
