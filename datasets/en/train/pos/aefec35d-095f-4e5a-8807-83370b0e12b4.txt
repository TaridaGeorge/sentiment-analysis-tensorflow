Delicious!  Joe's is the best BBQ that I tried in AZ.  I loved all their selections because they have something for everyone, from ribs to giant baked potatoes.

There is really not much I can say that the other reviewers have't said though so I'll just leave it with a 2 thumbs up! 

Oh, and I love the old tractor that's inside. haha  It's a classic... a 1948 A Series tractor.  Tad, the owner told me so! :)

See ya there!
