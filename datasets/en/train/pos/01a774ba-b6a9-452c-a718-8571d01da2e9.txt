I admit to not having tried their other menu items, yet, but for pizza, they really can't be beat. The menu has those few common choices, though also a few signatures. I've had both the meat and vegetarian varieties, which have the same fresh ingredients, homemade crust, and brick oven deliciousness that hasn't resulted in that greasy, heavy, super bloated feeling one can get with chain restaurant offerings. In addition, there are some good and cheap beer choices you can throw in if you're in the mood for a cold one.

Overall, I'm most certainly a five-star satisfied customer so far.
