My aunt and Grandma suggested we take the lightrail to tempe for some lunch. So guess what we did. We walked down Milland we chose to come here. Glad we did! I ordered the Boca pizza with 3 meats. It was definilty a 5star pizza. My wife and aunt both ordered the Italiano sandwich and it was to spicy for both of them. I ate  alittle bit of it. It did have a kick but it was pretty good also. I would definitly come back here for the pizza.
