This place is great! I can't complain about a single thing. I order the salad nicoise and my boyfriend ordered the Chev Vous crepe. Both were delectable! We also ordered the half and half crepe (half orange syrup, half nutella) for dessert, and talk about delicious. Seriously, these are the best crepes I have ever had!
