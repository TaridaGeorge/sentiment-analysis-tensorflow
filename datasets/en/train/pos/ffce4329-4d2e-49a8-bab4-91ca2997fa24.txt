Went on a Friday afternoon and had the "Natie Bomb".  This was THE BEST sandwich I have ever had!  My wife had pancakes; which were absolutely amazing, as well.  I almost ordered another one to go.  If you plan on going on a weekend morning, you're going to be waiting for about 45 minutes.  It's the best breakfast in town!
I just wish I could give this place 6 stars...
