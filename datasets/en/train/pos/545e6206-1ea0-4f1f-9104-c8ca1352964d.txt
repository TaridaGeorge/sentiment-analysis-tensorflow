Don't see anything to complain about here. The yogurt is 30 cents an ounce, including as much toppings as you want. You can have as much or as little as you want, and it will generally be under $3 unless you're pretty hungry. I'm not a huge frozen yogurt guy, but I could learn to like it. Sure beats Cold Stone, where the ice cream is expensive (and fatty). Plus, Cold Stone charges an arm and a leg for toppings.

I mixed and matched peppermint with peanut butter, pistachio, and blackberry yogurts. Then on top I had Cap'n Crunch, crushed Oreo's, Resse's pieces, nuts. It was great, self-serve is the way to go.
