First time I ever visited Scottsdale and to be honest I loved this place.  The people here are extremely friendly and excellent service.  My room was cleaned on time and the breakfast was great.  They had excellent cantalope and grapefruit.  Coffee was better than the hotel next doors too.  Plus, the hotel was situated in a great area of Scottsdale.  Would come back to this place for sure.  

BTW, thanks for great service guys!
