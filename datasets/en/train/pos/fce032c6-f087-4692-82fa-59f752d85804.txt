Excellent coffee. I wish it was just a little closer to my house.. But I guess that's a good thing because otherwise I would be there everyday. The coffee has a good flavor.. DB seems to be the only one to actually understand that coffee flavoring is supposed to be subtle. I usually order the Caramelizer.. But everything is very tasty. The customer service is great too... My husband and I went there for the first time last month and the super friendly barista gave us a punch card for a free drink on our next purchase. Love it!
