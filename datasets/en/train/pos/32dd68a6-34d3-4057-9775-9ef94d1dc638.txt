UH-MAY-ZING! Their cookies are sooooo good. I bought two -- the Urban and the Urban Tropic. I ate the Urban first and was going to take the Tropic home. After finishing the the first one, I stared at the second one for a minute before thinking "Who am I kidding?!" and proceeding to devour that one as well. Friendly owner, cute shop, awesome cookies! I'll be going back to try the cupcakes, for sure!
