When it comes to bagels in Scottsdale it doesn't get much better than lox.  My family and I have probably been going here for the past 14 years.  I am IN LOVE with the veggie cream cheese, nothing else compares!  

The staff is all so friendly, and they start to learn your name if there there enough!  The bagels are always fresh and delicious!  They even have really cute holiday baskets around the store!  

Wonderful place! I would recommend it to ANYONE!
