I participated in this years Phx 10k and was very impressed. I loved how when racers turned around you can see them on the other side of the light rail. I was able to see my friends as they raced which really helped to keep me going. They also when "green" this year which is awesome! We received a virtual race bag that had all of our coupons and goodies online. I will be participating in this race next year for sure. Might even have to do the doubleheader!
