Lux remains, hands down, the best coffee shop I've found in Phoenix.  The coffee is great, the service is quick and unpretentious, music is (almost) always good, and there is just no better place to settle in with a book or laptop for an hour or two.  

They also always have the most delicious pies/cakes/muffins.  The only complaint I have is that it would be nice if they carried some "savories"... breads, rolls, pasta salads, or maybe even sandwiches.
