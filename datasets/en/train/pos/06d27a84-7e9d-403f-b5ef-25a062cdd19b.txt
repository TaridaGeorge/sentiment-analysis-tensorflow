After making the rookie mistake of going to traditional dealerships, we were recommended to come here by my fiance's father. Boy, do I wish we had known of this place before starting the arduous journey of car shopping. 

Todd is super friendly, accommodating, no haggle, polite, tells personal stories, etc. Big fan! We bought a car the same day and are picking it up tomorrow morning! 

I am so pleased with shopping here and will purchase my next car here too. YAY Centennial!
