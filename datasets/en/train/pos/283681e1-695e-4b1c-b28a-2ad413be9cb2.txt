Rosson House was a wonderful and reasonably priced venue for our event. It was a beautiful outdoor space and accommodated our vision perfectly. Tom and Brittany were wonderful; they communicated promptly with me in email as we were considering the venue, ensured that all paperwork was filled out, and were on site and present for the event. Their contract and procedures were clearly stated and they worked with us to make sure we had everything we needed. We would love to host events there in the future, but it's an exceptional venue for a wedding, and the photo opportunities are unbelievable!
