I went to this place because of the positive reviews. A Fellow yelper recommended the Potato Cream Cheese soup- so i got it.. and it was awesome and i was definitely doubting it at first..

I also got the roasted turkey brie sandwich (half sandwich with soup), also awesome.. thick slice of BRIE for a brie cheese lover is the way to go!

They have samples of bread and butter at one of the entrances.. we all know what bread tastes like but this was a bonus for me to nimble on while i waited to pick up my order.

:) they had pumpkin cheesecake in the display case!! I haven't tried it but i know its so good.. I'm gonna buy this tomorrow and bring it to thanksgiving dinner! (and act like i made it! just kidding) nom nom nom nom!
