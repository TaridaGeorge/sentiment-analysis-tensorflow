The sushi is amazing.  It is made daily in the store by an authentic sushi chef.  The rolls are more beautiful and delictable than in most actual sushi restaurants.  Pricing is good too, 12 piece brown rice spicy tuna for $7.99 beats most happy hour pricing and the really fancy rolls are typically $8-$10.  

The produce selection is broad as well including an all organic section.

They also match competitor coupons.  I use the $3 of off $30 from Fresh and Easy when I go there.

They also have good prices on wine (larger selection than some wine stores)
