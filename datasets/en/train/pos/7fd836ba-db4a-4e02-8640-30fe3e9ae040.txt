Amazing food. My husband and I ordered a pizza, it was completely fresh and all homemade. The owner Sal came out and personally greeted us and was more than willing to answer any questions. The pride Sal has for his restaurant is evident through the quality of the food, friendliness of the service, and cleanliness of the restaurant. The restaurant is casual enough that you can grab a quick bite in jeans and a tee shirt but good enough you feel like you are eating at a black tie restaurant. It's a refreshing change from the traditional bland food you get at chain restaurants. Will be back with friends!
