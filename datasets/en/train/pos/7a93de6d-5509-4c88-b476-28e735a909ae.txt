I have come here religiously for the past 4 years (every 2 weeks) and have never been disappointed.  Every nail artist in the salon is amazing and they have the best service.  The prices for N. Scottsdale are very decent.  I love the spa pedicure (with the sea salt and the french).  Super clean with new tools on each client.  They recently expanded so they have twice the space - their massage chairs are amazing.  And even down to the spa owner's little daughter who helps take your money on occasion.  It's definitely a family atmosphere here.  I bring my mom, girlfriends, sisters here whenever they are in town.  A nice treat for such a great price!
