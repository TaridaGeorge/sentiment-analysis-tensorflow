This is the only pizza place I will dine in or order take out from. I'm very picky about what I eat; a total food snob. I love their pizza! I always order their pepperoni and mushroom deep dish pizza!! The servers are always friendly and the prices are very reasonable. You can't go wrong here, everything is good!
