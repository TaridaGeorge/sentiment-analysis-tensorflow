We went there on Tuesday in the afternoon. The place is empty. It was happy hour. We got a saut√© calamari with tomato sauce and garlic to start. It was amazing! A little bit spicy. We finish all the bread with the sauce left. The bread is good, too. Spaghetti Bolognese is perfect, just the way I like. The spaghetti is perfectly cooked. Risotto with Artichokes is wonderful, too.
