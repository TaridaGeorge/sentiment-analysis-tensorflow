Came back again and this time brought some friends to help us eat the Hog Heaven meal and we still had a ton of yummy left overs. Our waitress (I think her name was Megan, sorry I can't remember now) was super patient with us. She was always on top of things. Jason, the manager, came by and said hi to all the patrons. What a nice guy!  Look forward to coming back here again and again. Sign up for their newsletter!  I just got an offer for a free appetizer.
