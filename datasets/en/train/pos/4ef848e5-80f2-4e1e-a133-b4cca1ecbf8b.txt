Had a wonderful dinner here Saturday night for my husbands birthday.  The service and food were excellent.  I got the filet which was cooked a perfect medium and had a brandy peppercorn sauce with it, it was fantastic.  My husband had the roasted chicken and it just melted in your mouth.  Absolutely loved the sticky buns they brought to the table.  It was like having dessert first.  Our server Stuart was one of the best waiters we have ever had.  Can't wait to return and sit outside when it's cooler, their outdoor seating area is beautiful with great views!
