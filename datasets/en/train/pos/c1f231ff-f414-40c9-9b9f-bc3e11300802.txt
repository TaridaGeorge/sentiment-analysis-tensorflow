I've been looking for an old-school barber shop for a long time. I've tried a couple of places around the valley and never really felt completely satisfied until today when I walked into Nash's. 

These guys are pros. A warm, welcoming atmosphere, great conversation, and highly skilled and experienced barbers here. The shave was fantastic, and Al really paid attention to what I wanted. 

I highly recommend this place, I'm not sure I'll ever go anywhere else again.
