First let me say the portions this place serves are HUGE. My first visit here was with my boss for a lunch meeting. I ordered the pesto pasta bowl. YUMMY. I ate as much as I could and still had enough for lunch again the next day. My kids loved the bread bowl. I had the happy ending infamous cookie dough ice cream. Loved it all. I will have to bring my kids with me next time I visit because I see that they give the kids pizza dough to play with while they wait for their food.
