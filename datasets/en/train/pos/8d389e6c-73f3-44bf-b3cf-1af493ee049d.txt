My boyfriend has been hyping up this restaurant since last time he came out to Phoenix and I have to give him credit, it did not disappoint. I've never been to an Asian fusion tapas bar quite like this but what a concept! They have a huge sake and Asian beer menu too, I've never seen anything like it.

We had a large party which is perfect for ordering tapas style like this. I think we tried pretty much everything on the menu and I loved every last thing I ate. Among the standouts were the bacon wrapped lychee, chicken lollipops, Hong Kong wontons, volcano flamed beef, red curry tofu, and my favorite: the spicy basil fish. We ordered a couple more of those as well as the lollipops. Just go and order anything off their menu, it's truly amazing.
