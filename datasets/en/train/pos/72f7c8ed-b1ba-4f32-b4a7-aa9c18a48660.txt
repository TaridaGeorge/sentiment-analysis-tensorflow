Fantastic on all accounts! I highly recommend Rex and his team to do your upholstery work. After a terrible experience with contractor we found on Craigslist, I was a bit hesitant to go with someone I hadn't worked with before or referred by someone I knew but I didn't want to ship my items out of state either, so Rex met up at our store and helped us same money since we got taken by another contractor on other items, anyways, he showed us how to do some of our own legwork and the final product came out wonderfully!. Thanks Rex! I will be sure to come back for all our future upholstery needs. You have a customer here for life!
