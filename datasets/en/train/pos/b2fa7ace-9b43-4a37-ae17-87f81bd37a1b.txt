I went there yesterday for the first time and had the Eggs Benedict.  OUTSTANDING.  Hash Browns were perfectly seasoned and very tasty.  The hollandaise sauce was to die for and I wish I had toast to sop up every last drop. 

My sister thought every thing was a bit salty but she seasoned before tasting so my advice is to taste first then season as we get used to the chain restaurants to under season everything. 

This is a place that I have to come back so I can try everything on the menu.
