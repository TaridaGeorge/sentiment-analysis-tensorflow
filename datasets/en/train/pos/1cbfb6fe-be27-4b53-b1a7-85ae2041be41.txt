I visit a lot of Home Depots. They  do carry a lot of things made in China, which is not always good when you are trying to build things. They won't last.
So the solution to that is you must read the labels.
 I do purchase a lot of Items here though. So they must be doing something right!
 The very best thing about Home Depot is the great return policy.  If something breaks, or you bought too many, or it is just not right they take it back. WIthout a lot of drama. I really like them for that, and that is why I really like to shop here. 
Lots of parking in the lot. The staff is very helpful and friendly.
