You have to try happy hour in the bar...$2.95 for everything on the menu It's madness. I've successfully tried every food item on the happy hour menu, and it's all been amazing. The brio burger is great. The spicy shrimp and eggplant must be laced with crack, or some other addictive substance. I could eat it all day, every day. The bruschetta is amazing; everything is amazing. Happy hour is an amazing deal. Have I said amazing enough times yet? 

I've also eaten dinner here, just for a point of reference, and it was excellent as well. Service is attentive, the food is great. Try this place. You can thank me later.
