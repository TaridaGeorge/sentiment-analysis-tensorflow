AMAZING Chinese food! Moved to Queen Creek two years ago and tried this out after getting a 15% off coupon. It definitely did not disappoint one bit. The orange chicken is superb. It has a crispy outside with nice pieces of white chicken. The sauce on the chicken is gooey and delicious. I recently tried PF Chang's but wish I wouldn't have. PF's orange chicken (and everything else) was in no was close to the flavor and great taste of Golden Harvest. This place is really a gem. It may not look too great from the outside especially when compared to PF but you will NOT be disappointed by going here! The crab puffs with the sweet n sour sauce is so crispy and delicious. You should definitely give this place a try, it will be your new favorite!
