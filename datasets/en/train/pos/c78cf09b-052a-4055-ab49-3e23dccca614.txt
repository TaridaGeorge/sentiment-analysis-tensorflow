I had my visit to Chase Field a couple of weeks ago.  I loved it!  Of course, I was about 100 feet from home base in a corporate seat, so who wouldn't!?  Seriously though, they offer a great selection of food and drinks and you can get massive beers.  I had no idea they came in bottles that big without a brown bag.  I highly recommend the massive hotdogs.  Yum!  

It is a bit expensive for what you get but then again, they do need to pay for that stadium.  Now if only the Diamondbacks played a little better...then it would be perfect.  You can't have everything, though.
