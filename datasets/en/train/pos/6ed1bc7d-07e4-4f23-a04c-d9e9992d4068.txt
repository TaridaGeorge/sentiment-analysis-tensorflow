This is our go to spot. The young staff here is great and we seldom notice turnover. The food is always excellent and the quality is consistent.  The menu offers great variety with healthy and unique choices. Even if the restaurant is busy with a line hanging out the door, it's still worth the wait (and it's usually a reasonable wait). I love that when the place is busy they'll ensure you have a spot to sit before they take your order. Nice patio seating on the east side of the building.  This is our fave Pei Wei in the area.
