This was my second time visiting WBC and a few of my coworkers went here for lunch today. My first time I was about 95% pleased with my meal, realizing that I just didn't like what I got. This time I had the chicken parmesan which was delicious. Perfectly seasoned, perfect serving, it was bomb. I'll def be back
