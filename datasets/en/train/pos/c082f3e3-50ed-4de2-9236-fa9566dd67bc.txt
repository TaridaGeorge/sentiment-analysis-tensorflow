It seemed like every time I walked by YC's Mongolian grill it smelled delicious. So I finally gave it a try and the food was amazing. It was a some what expensive ($12.50 a bowl per person) but I can't seem to find a combination of ingredients that doesn't taste great. I've been there a few times since.
