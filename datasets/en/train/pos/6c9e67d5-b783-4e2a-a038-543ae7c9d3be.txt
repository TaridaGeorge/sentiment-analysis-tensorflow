I love Nello's.  I miss it so much, as I moved from Scottsdale a couple years back.  My favorite meal there was to start with an Individual Dinner Salad with their house dressing, followed up by the 7-inch Margherita Pizza.  I love their Margherita so much more than just about any other restaurant I've tried.  They use a really nice San Marzano tomato, rather than just slices of roma tomatoes.  Just the right amount of cheese and basil, all on a chewy yet crispy crust.  So tasty, so simple.
