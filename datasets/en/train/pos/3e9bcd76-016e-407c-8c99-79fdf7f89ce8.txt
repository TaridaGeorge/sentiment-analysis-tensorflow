I have a lot of Middle Eastern meals - at restaurants and home cooked. Everything from Haji Baba to fancy Los Angeles Persian restaurants.  But at SAHARA, i had one of the BEST dishes I've ever had - Feta Chicken (which actually has no feta).

Family owned and operated, friendly service, and some of the most delicious food i have ever had.  I've been dreaming of the Chicken Feta and babaganoush ever since!
