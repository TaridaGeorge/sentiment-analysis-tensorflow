I once went to a movie with Alice Cooper here. I mean, grant it we weren't together but he was in the theater with us.

BSadly this is Phoenix's only multi-screen Art House theater.

They always have great movies. 

I guess this place doesn't really deserve this rating but it is our ONLY choice. With that in mind, even the fact that it's in Scottsdale and the theaters themselves are just "okay" I'll give them props for the quality of films they bring to the Valley.
