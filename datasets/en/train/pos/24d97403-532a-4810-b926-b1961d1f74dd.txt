This place should be called Magic OMFG Noodle because it was soooooooo gooooooood!  

I had the regular noodles with the Beef/Oyster sauce and it did not disappoint.  My friend got a larger size of noodle and said that it was a little too much noodle and she would go with regular next time but the food was still very good.  I ordered the egg rolls which were very "meh" but the noodles more than made up for it.  

Wish they carried beer or wine but by the time I finished my plate, there wasn't room in my stomach for anything else.
