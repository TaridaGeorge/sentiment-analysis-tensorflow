We were referred to Phoenix Body Works by our insurance company, and now we know why.  We literally had a fender bender that required a new tail light and bumper.

After PBW was finished, our car looked better then when we bought it new.  Chris and Scott provided outstanding customer service.  The technicians did an excellent job as well.  You can tell those guys take pride in their work.  They went above and beyond.  The car was cleaned inside and out, wheels dressed and carpets vacuumed.

This is the best customer service I have experienced with a boy shop.    The quality of the work was the best as well.
