I'm an adult and I would love to come here! My 7 year old needed a yearly cleaning and X-rays. They were so nice and enjoyable, tv's, video games, toys!! Great service and they did a awesome job on my sons teeth.

After they took great care of my son, we ended up having to have oral surgery there. It was also a great experience! They were so nice and careful with my little dude. He was back on his feet the next day. Thank you so much for being cool. We will be back.
