The BEST nursery I have discovered so far and I drive from Fountain Hills because of their amazing assortment of plants and excellent customer service !  If are on a budget, get the 4 inch plants for $2.99 because most of them will be a one gallon size in a few months time like I do.  I LOVE their fern leaf lavender as well as their ornamental grasses (pink muhly, mexican thread grass, etc).  Happy Gardening !
