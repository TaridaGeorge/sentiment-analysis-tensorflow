I went with a group of 5 and luckily we were able to sit in back.  The place is small and bad for groups.

Aside from that the food is awesome and the beer is cheap!  

I grew up on pastys in Wisconsin, my Dad's would be called a beef stew pasty.  The variations this place has is awesome.  Good stuff!

Go!
