This is a fantastic library and a great spot in Phoenix. One of the few places in Phoenix that actually makes me feel like I'm in a city.  I love the building, the staff and the selection.  There is always something going on whether it be people watching either inside or in the parking lot, classes, book sales, etc.  I'm glad that I live so close to this library as I'm here almost weekly.
