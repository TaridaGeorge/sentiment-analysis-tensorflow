My parents live right by this place and recommended it. I'm so glad I finally went here! We went around 5pm on a Saturday and it was already packed, but the line moved pretty fast. I got the ahi tuna sandwich which was very tasty, although I wasn't crazy about the wasabi on it. I also tried the chicken sandwich, fries, blueberry cheesecake and vanilla milkshake and all were fantastic! 

All the food was so fresh and reasonably priced too. I wish there were more places like this in the valley. I loved the outside area, surrounded with flowers, trees, and the farm. Can't wait to come back here!
