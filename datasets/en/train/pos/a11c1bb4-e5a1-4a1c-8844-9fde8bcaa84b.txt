This place is seriously awesome. My boyfriend and i have been staying down the street for a wedding so we tried the food for the first time on friday. The prices are super fair and the quantities are huge! We haven't had time to dine in and enjoy but we got take out and ate on our hotel room balcony. We have eaten at Yoli's three days in a row now!!! Breakfast and lunch! There was nothing we didn't love. If your in this area you gotta try it. WARNING...place is addicting so you won't just order one time, we didn't even consider giving another place a try
