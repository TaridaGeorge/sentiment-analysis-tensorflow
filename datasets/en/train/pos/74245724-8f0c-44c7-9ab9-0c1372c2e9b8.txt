I loved the service here! I took a friend to this place to try out Shabu Shabu (the only restaurant in arizona to serve this style food) for the first time and the server went through great lengths to give us the best experience. Towards the end of the meal the server actually made some mixed eggs which did not come from the meal but as some sort of appreciation for coming into their restaurant and i thought that was amazing! She strictly said that "this is special and we do not offer it" and for her to do that  is a plus in my book. The Shabu shabu was great and I definitely recommend it!
