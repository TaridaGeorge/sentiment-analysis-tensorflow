SO happy I found this place!  Thanks fellow Yelpers!

I had a strap break on one of my fave pair of shoes, and I desperately tried finding a similar replacement pair for weeks before giving in to the fact that I wouldn't be able to replace them.  I had to try to get them fixed instead.

Thanks to Best Shoe Repair they fixed them BETTER THAN NEW, and I am one happy girl.  It only cost me $15 and they had it ready for me in about 3 days.  I LOVE this place & will be bringing them any of my shoes, bags, belts, etc that need repair!
