I had heard about this place for years but never went. Tragic I know! Just recently I discovered that it was literally walking distance from Jester'Z Improv where I work. Oh, how i must now make up for lost time!

Pop the Soda Shop is a true place of brilliants. They have a fantastic selection and a very knowledgeable staff. When you come to pops that is what you are looking for, product. And they have the best selection in town. 

A couple of recommendations. Doctor Eli's Blueberry, Jackson Hole Huckelberry, or really any thing in the Birch Beer section!
