I can also vouch for this incredible veterinarian office, they saved the life of my cat and my dog who had parvo.  The price to service ratio is incredible.  Not sure if Dr. Jimmy Alexander is still there, but he was the best,  most comforting veterinarian.  I would never take my pets anywhere else.
