This place is one of my favorites EVER. Come here all the time. Awesome, friendly service always. 

My favorites to eat are: Alfredo the Dark, Sweet potato fries (w/ the aioli, it's BOMB), boom dip, big-rig pasta, pesto penne, and their garlic bread. OH and OF COURSE the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pizza cookies are a must. Seriously. You can't come here and not try one.
