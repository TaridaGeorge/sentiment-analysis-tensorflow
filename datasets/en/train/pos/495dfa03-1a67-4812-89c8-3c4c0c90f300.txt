I dont like to give 5 stars, but I think its about time that they finally made it out here! I grew up in Illinois and whether it was in my hometown, or when I was working in downtown Chicago, JJ's always hit the spot.

The pricing is on par with many other places, but the food is tasier and there is more of it. Service is good, by the time I had filled my drink my sandwhich was done and ready to go. 

It may not be the end all be all of sandwhichery, but it is definately worth the trip in.
