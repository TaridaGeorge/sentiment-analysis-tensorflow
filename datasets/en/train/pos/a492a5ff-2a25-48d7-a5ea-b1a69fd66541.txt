This place is a total hole in the wall you walk in and it seems like your in the middle of Juarez. the roof is covered in bean sacks, tables are made of crates, the place doesn't take credit cards cash only but the food makes up for it! Awesome fresh burgers cooked in front of you also a good local beer selection which is served to you in a mason jar. Gotta love it.
