This place is as good as it gets when it comes to pizza!!! Everyone complains about the wait, but if you get their later rather than earlier, you will get in quicker rather than later.  (have fun with that!) We got there for a late diner at 8:30pm.

We had their tomato, basil and homemade mozzarella salad for starters.  It was awesome! Then we had a "sonny boy" pizza which was excellent with the right amount of meat to sauce and cheese ratios. I've also had their "wise guy" with sausage, caramelized onions and loads of cheese.  They place is awesome!
