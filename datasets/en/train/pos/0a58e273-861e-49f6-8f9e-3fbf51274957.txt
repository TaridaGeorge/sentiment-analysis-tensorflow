WOW! This extensive remodel of this Bashas is eyepopping! The new store is twice as big as the store was before the remodel. Where to start?
*COVERED parking!!!
*Expanded natural food aisles and freezer case.
*The produce area is huge.
*Plentiful checkouts and staffing (it was a Grand Opening after all).
*Entire aisle of just spices.
*Largest fresh meat selection I have seen in AZ.
*Expanded pharmacy and wellness area.
*Expanded Deli and Bakery and the pizza smelled terrific (drool factor +10)

They had mailed me a coupon for FREE bread, milk and eggs as part of the Grand Opening announcement and I noticed a lot of other folks picking up these staples as well. Additionally, today was Senior Discount Day, so I got an additional 10% off of my order. I WILL be back!!!
