At your service.  That's the motto I would use to describe the Fairmont.  The entire staff is there to help you at anytime for anything.  

The pool is probably the best place to be in this entire hotel.  It's large and the staff is there to make sure you are enjoying yourself.  The rooms all have views of some sort, and they are spacious.  My second favorite part of the hotel were the rooms bathrooms.  WOW.  The large walk in showers and huge tubs were a welcome treat after a long day of traveling on delayed and canceled flights.
