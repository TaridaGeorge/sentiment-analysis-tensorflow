From NYC and I am kind of a harsh critic to restaurants outside my home town, but munchies has the best chicken shwarma in Arizona... Maybe the world!  Something special about this place, from the small business feel to the owners making you feel at home. 

5.95 daily special! I'm talking delicious food and the best deal in town. Really want them to bring their delicious meals to NY. 

Best restaurant in Tempe hands down. Sit down, order the daily special, and enjoy the Munchies experience.
