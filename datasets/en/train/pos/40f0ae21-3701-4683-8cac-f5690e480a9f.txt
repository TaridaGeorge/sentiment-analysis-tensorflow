The Sweet n' Spicy Burger is the best burger I have ever had in my life.  It's not so much the actual burger patty that is delicious, but the combination of toppings that make it so unbelievable.  The fried ratatouille gives it a little crunch.  The candied jalepenos provide just enough sweet to balance out the spice factor.  As you're chewing it just kind of melts together in your mouth.  I could eat one every day for the rest of my life.  Simply amazing.

The Mac n' Cheese with ham is stellar.  Super creamy and smooth.  Probably not low in calories.  The fries are crispy and seasoned just right.  And don't forget the mini doughnuts!  They're the perfect sweet after your meal and the salty caramel dipping sauce is pretty much orgasmic.  If there's any left over, you'll be eating it with a spoon.

Highly recommend.  Great neighborhood gem.
