I went for lunch today for the first time. The food was exemplary. The decor is really cool too, swanky but organic. The service was very good. Lots of brick, steel and iron. I had the executive special lunch, which consisted of a citrus salad with dates and goat cheese, a vegetable risotto with spinach, cauliflower and creme fraiche and a bag of five (actually seven) cookies. The citrus salad was fresh and light, just what you'd want. The risotto was creamy and rich. The cookies were unbelievable. Three chocolate chip and two peanut butter sandwiches with peanut butter cream. All homemade, all delicious. I will be going back.
