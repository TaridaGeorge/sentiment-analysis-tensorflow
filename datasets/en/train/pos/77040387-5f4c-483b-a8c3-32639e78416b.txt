Jeff could not be more awesome!  He arrives when he says he will, doesn't overcharge, goes WAY above and beyond the call of duty, fixing every switchplate that he notices is out of alignment or improperly installed.  His prices are extremely reasonable, and he didn't even charge us for a second visit when one job took a long time and he needed a special part for our doorframe.  What a professional!  I've already recommended him to one friend who needed a locksmith for a new house, and will for anyone else who asks.
