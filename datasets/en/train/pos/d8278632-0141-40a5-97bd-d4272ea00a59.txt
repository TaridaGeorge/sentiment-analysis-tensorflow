I love this gym. Its too bad I don't live near one anymore.  Lifetime is the Cadillac of gyms in AZ.  It was hard going back to my ghetto LA Fitness location.  Lifetime has a number of perks for its members.  There is an on the spot salon for you ladies (and some of you guys too).  Their caf√© makes all sorts of healthy meals and protein shakes. What sets Lifetime apart is the option to get some rock climbing in while you have your clothes dry cleaned. This is a one spot stop for all your fitness needs.  My membership ran about $50.  Which is literally double my LA membership, but has double the benefits.
