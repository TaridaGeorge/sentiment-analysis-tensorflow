I just came back from the candle lighting ceremony at my church for my Greek Orthodox Easter. So Xristos Anesti to all the Orthodox Christians out there. Right before midnight, the church goes black and we all have our candles ready. Then each of our candles gets lit from the person next to us until everyone has a lit candle. The ceremony is so beautiful that I started crying. At that moment when we celebrate Christ rising, I feel so spiritual and close to him. I felt something pass through my body. Another year, another Easter, another beautiful ceremony. Xristos Anesti kai Xronia Polla.
