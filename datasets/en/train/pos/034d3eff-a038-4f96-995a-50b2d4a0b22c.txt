So the boyfriend and I were an hour early for the Coytoes vs. Blackhaws yesterday, so we figured we'd get some food. We had planned on going to the BBQ place, which ended up having a 45-50 minute wait, as did Johnny Rockets, so we walked BACK to Which Wich. 

I was delightfully surprised! The little bags you mark your sandwich fixings on are charming, and super efficient. The folks behind the counter were cheerful, and the sandwich was delish!!

Perhaps one of the BEST sandwiches I've ever eaten!
