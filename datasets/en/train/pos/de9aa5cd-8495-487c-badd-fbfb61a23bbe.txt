Sharing some love for the Agency AZ... I've worked with this boutique model and talent agency since day 1. Their talent and team is stellar. As a photographer and makeup artist, I work with their new and seasoned talent on a regular basis. Whether it be a test shoot or client booking.Terri, Margaret and the team have always taken care of each booking professionally and with care to detail. Because of this fact, I refer clients and new talent too them often. They have built a strong community of talent for fashion and commercial work in Arizona. It has been a pleasure to see the agency grow to where they are today...on TOP. So if you are in need for professional talent of all ages, this is the place.
