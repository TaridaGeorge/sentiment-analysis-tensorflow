Just got back from a lunch with a girlfriend, neither one of us had been to Zinc before but I chose it and now it's our new favorite lunch restaurant.

Go for the food. 
Go for the multiple atmospheres to choose from; patio, indoor or garden cafe.

Go for the frites.

We had chicken sandwiches and every bite was the best. The chicken itself tasted fabulous.

This is the perfect place if you are eating alone or with a small group. Can't wait to return for dinner and cocktails soon.
