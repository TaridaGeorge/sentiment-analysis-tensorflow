Living in Wisconsin has changed my eating habits forever. I never knew what deliciousness cheese curds were and how amazingly awesome it was when someone fried them. I had never tasted the creamy goodness of frozen custard until living there. The delight of having a beer on a nice spring day sitting by a lake surrounded by friends is nirvana. 

I definitely get food nostalgia and Culver's has come to the rescue. It's fast food, yes. But I put it in a category above McDoo and BK, with Chik-Fil-A and In 'N Out. Classy fast good. The restaurants are clean and the kids are friendly. The food is where it's at though. Nothing beats a butterburger, fried cheese curds, and a frozen custard. Just make sure to not eat for a week to be able to afford the calories in your diet.
