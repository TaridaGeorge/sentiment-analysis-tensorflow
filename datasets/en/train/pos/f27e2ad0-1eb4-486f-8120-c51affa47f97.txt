I went to Scottsdale Healthcare Shea for the many support groups and classes they offer. Most events are free to the public and are in place to serve the community.

When I went to my first support group, it was run by a licensed psychologist (a big plus for support groups, as sometimes they can go a negative way and need someone there that can handle the sensitive topics). The group was warm and embracing! I felt at home and comfortable sharing my thoughts and ideas, all of which were received nicely. The group offered continued resources, tips, and ideas.
