Stay far away.  I don't need to be sharing a lap lane with another swimmer while I'm trying to get my mile on.

This place is perfect.  Perfect location (I can bike to here, and then bike to work), perfect amount of swim lanes (usually will be two to a lane, but I've seen a trio working one), perfect price when you buy a punch card, great lifeguards, and they have showers.
