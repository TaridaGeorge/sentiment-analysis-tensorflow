The owners or their people will cook your pizza any way you like it. Our family (with children) can relax and  the kids play with the games in a separate room. I gave it 5 stars because I really can get a family meal cooked and prepared the way I want it, half made for the kids and half for my wife and I. Their wings are baked not fried, so they are not too greasey. This place is family owned and operated and the dad knows our names and usually has quarters for our kids to play some games. Former U.S. Marines show up each Friday meet, eat, drink and play cards or dominoes. I mention this because two of our kids sit down and the Marines let them play with them. It cracks me up. Oh, the salad bar is pretty good too.
