Love love love it! I had the half combo, which is a sandwich on sourdough w/Salami, Mortadella, Pepperoni, Provolone and I asked them to hold the ham- comes with their house italian, lettuce, mayo and mustard. Absolutely delicious! After I finished the 1/2 sandwich I decided to be daring and grab a piece of the cheesecake, which was to die for. I haven't had a slice of homemade cheesecake in a long time. 

The staff was so nice and friendly and the locale was very clean and tidy. I think I found a new fave spot.
