This is the best library in the Valley and one of my favorite places to study.  The interior design, water fall, glass elevators and many other features make this the perfect metropolitan library for our downtown. 

The top level is pretty quiet and has beautiful views of the city.  Quick Tip: It seems that the southern part of the building is hotter because of the sun so I always sit on the north part of the building.
