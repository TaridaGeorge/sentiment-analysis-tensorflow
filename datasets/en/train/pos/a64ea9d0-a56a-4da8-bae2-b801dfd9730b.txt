I went in on a whim, out shopping, saw sign, & "fish" sounded good. A Monday, late afternoon, I was recommended that the bar had Monday specials. Ordered house Chardonnay, expected "ok", it was delicious! Unexpectedly sour dough bread appeared & I took a taste & it was exquisite! I told the bartender I felt I was in San Francisco, & she said it is flown in DAILY for them! The fish tacos were a great choice, they were delicious & even though I was really hungry, I couldn't finish them!  I can't understand the negative postings here, surely having everything much better than I even expected can't be just an accident!  I am a picky eater and only expected to "grab a bite to eat" & was very pleasantly surprised!
