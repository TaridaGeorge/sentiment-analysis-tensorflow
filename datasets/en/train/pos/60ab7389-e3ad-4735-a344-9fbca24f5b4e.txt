Excellent, excellent, excellent! Seems strange to me to have to search for a good hamburger yet this is what where reduced to. Went to 5 Guys today (first time) on the way back from a hike in Tonto Ntl Forrest. It was just like back home (Michigan) when I was a kid and good burgers were plentiful! Reasonably priced, very fresh and fast. Johnny Rocket, In N' out ish but better quality meat. Delicious.
