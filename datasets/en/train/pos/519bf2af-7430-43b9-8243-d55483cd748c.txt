One of the best restaurants in town if not THE BEST. Everything on the menu is wonderful. There is a very large menu selection and you can't go wrong with anything. Try the Green Chili Macaroni and Cheese. It's very unique, nothing that you would make at home. The decor is just beautiful. The window coverings are real raw hides with a map of the Roaring Fork River. The wood floor is Brazilian Hazel wood. Also, it's very rare when you dine out that a manager visits your table to see how everything is. The managers at the Roaring Fork always stop by the tables to follow up on your needs. They have two outdoor patios. Their happy hour is also second to none with the "Big Ass" burger the star. You won't be disappointed.
