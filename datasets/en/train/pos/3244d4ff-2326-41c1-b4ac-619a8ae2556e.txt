First of all, Scottsdale, AZ is BEAUTIFUL. If you're thinking of coming to Arizona, visit this city and take a peek at this hotel! Check in on foursquare at the hotel bar and receive a free CD. Make sure to check out the gondola boat rides for a fun and unique experience. Don't miss "Wine Me, Dine Me" at SWB. Lobo Fitness is one of the best hotel gyms I have seen. Spend an afternoon/evening sitting out by the pool for a relaxing and satisfying end to the day. Don't forget to enjoy the fantastic hotel restaurants!
