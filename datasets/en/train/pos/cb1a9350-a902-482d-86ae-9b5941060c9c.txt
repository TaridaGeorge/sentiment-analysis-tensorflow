I don't like sweets for breakfast, no pancakes, no french toast, no cinnamon rolls. All the sugar just makes me feel sick the rest of the day.

Then I met the Bosa buttermilk bar. For a breakfast made of those bad boys sign me up for a day of two root canals, pass a kidney stone, and give birth to triplets. It'll be worth it!
