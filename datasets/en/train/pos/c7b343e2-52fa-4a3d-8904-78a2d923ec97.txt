This is by far my favorite sushi place in the valley. You get to grub on DELICIOUS sushi while also people watching (mostly middle-aged folk, cougars mostly, going through what seems to be a mid-life crisis). 

The service is always superb. I never need to ask for a refill or have someone clear the plates. They got their shit together there. 

The Yummy Yummy Roll is my absolute fave ($12). It's basically a shrimp tempura roll topped with spicy tuna, spicy mayo, and a dab of siracha. Try it and you'll be addicted.

The teppanyaki rocks too! Be sure to go during happy hour. You get reduced pricing at the teppanyaki tables and you still get a ton of food.
