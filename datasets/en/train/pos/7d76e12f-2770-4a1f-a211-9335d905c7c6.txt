I love this place!  They have great sales on super fabulous awesome steaks!  I bought some Ribeyes that were seriously much better than AJ's and 75% less!  The chicken is organic and seriously it does taste better...and it was super reasonable as well.  The market has great vegies and odd stuff that is difficult to find other places.  The help is really helpful and friendly.  All in all it's a great experience!
