LOVE this place! I've been here a few times and every time the service is great.. they are there to help you but not too pushy. The food is delicious (especially the cheeses and the garlic fries). They have good daily deals and I love that they ive you popcorn and ginger snaps at the bar! 
Every time I have been here I have had a wonderful experience. I definitely recommend this place!
