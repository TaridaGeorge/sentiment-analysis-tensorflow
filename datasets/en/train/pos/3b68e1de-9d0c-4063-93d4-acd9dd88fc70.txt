Finally. Finally!!! A solid British pub. Service was great (more than I can say for some actual pubs in London) and food was absoflippinlutely stellar. We shared the Shepard's Pie, Bangers and Mash, and the broccoli cauliflower cheese bake (yes, there were leftovers). It was impossible to pick a favorite and this will definitely be on my go-to list when in Tempe. The beer list is superb and I had a hard time choosing as there were so many of my favorites from overseas travel. My only wish? Murphy's on tap.
