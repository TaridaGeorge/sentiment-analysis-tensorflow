Love Costco... Shop there 2 or 3 times a month.  Love that they try to keep costs low to give value, without sacrificing quality, for customers for merchandise and gas.  Great rotisserie chicken, meats and veggies.  I don't get lots of fruit there, better prices at grocery store can usually be found.
