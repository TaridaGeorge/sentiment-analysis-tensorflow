Dr. Ito and all of his staff are the best. They are very sincere caring people. They never try to make me pay for any extras, I had a root canal done and was terrified, but they made me comfortable, the procedure was painless. I was in really bad pain from putting it off then one day it was unbearable and I got in the next day for it. I just went in today for a cleaning and I've been going here for 2 years now and said "I should review them as much as I like them." Dr. Ito is very well rounded man and has great taste in music as well.
