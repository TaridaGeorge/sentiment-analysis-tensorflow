Due to business in Phoenix, I came across this place through a yelp search (what else), and was so happy after my first visit that I came back a second time on my departure day, grabbed dinner and had them pack me something as an in-flight meal.

They offer a great selection of vegan and raw vegan food, and while the vegan choices do offer a few comfort food items for the meat-eating-boyfriend-types, most of the menu is fairly healthy. As a mostly raw vegan, I did appreciate their raw selections, although I admit I went weak and had to try their daily burger, which was absolutely delicious!

They also have an eclectic dessert selection, which I resisted, but looked splendid.

I am sure that I will return here anytime I am in Phoenix.
