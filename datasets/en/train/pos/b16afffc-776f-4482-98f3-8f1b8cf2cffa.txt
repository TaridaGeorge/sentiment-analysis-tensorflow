I've been to Chelsea's about 5 times now and the experience has always been great. The staff, from the valet to the hosts and wait staff are always friendly and knowledgable. The shrimp ceviche is fantastic. I've tried various taco platters, including the tuna, short rib, and rib-eye and all have been great. I think they have a fairly good mix of price and food quality/quantity. Definitely a place you want to go to if you're near the Biltmore or Fashion Square area.
