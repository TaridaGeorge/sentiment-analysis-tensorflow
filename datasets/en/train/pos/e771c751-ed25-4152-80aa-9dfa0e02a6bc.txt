The Kool-Aid hit the spot; nice and cold in a mason jar.  We were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes today when we arrived at 11:45 am (It's a Thursday.)  The wait ended up being only 10 minutes, but, after having eaten there, I would have waited the full 45.  My macaroni and cheese was great.  The cornbread, although a bit dry, totally hit the spot with the Kool-Aid.  The waffles and eggs (I ordered the "Lil Jay") were both hot and fresh and delicious.  Amazing!  I can't imagine a better place to eat in Phoenix.  Very inexpensive, and I took home my left-overs for later, because I won't waste a crumb of this delicious-ness!
