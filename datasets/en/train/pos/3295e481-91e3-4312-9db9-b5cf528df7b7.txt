The service is always great.  Everyone is friendly.  The food is amazing.  I love the spicy tuna roll and california roll.  My husband had the chow mein with beef, which I tasted and I started eating that too.  I couldn't get enough of any of it.  They have indoor and outdoor seating and they offer take-out.  I know a lot of people speak highly of the sushi restaurants in Old Town, but if you just don't want to go all that way, definitely go to Moto.  You'll love it.

And for those Spicy food lovers, Moto offers all levels of spice.  Just be careful what you ask for.  If you know what I mean.  The name of the menu item will say it all.
