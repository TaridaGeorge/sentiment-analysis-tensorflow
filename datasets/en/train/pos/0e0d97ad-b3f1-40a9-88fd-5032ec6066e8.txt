This museum is fantastic. We recently visited it on vacation. I have a 8 year old and an almost 5-year old. They have a pretend area for younger kids.  It is a bit young for my kids, but of course they still loved it. The exhibits in the museum were well thought out with opportunities for children to experiment in all different mediums. For example, one of the two exhibits was called Table Manners. We could read books about table manners, experiment with chopsticks and play food, make table scapes and then draw them, and much more. And then of course, there was the art. They had a nice selection, again in different mediums. Museum was clean, staff was friendly and overall, we will visit again if in town.
