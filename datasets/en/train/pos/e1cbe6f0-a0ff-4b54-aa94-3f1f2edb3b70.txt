First time trying Cuoco Pazzo... Fianc√© and I had crispy ribs, Caesar salad, crab cakes, tagliolini ( black handmade pasta with mussels, clams, calamari and shrimp), a cheese mixture and the TO DIE FOR Apple sauce cake!!! Everything was fantastic! The presentation, the taste, the ambience ! Was a very pleasant surprise! Will definitely be back!  And I love that it is within walking distance!!
