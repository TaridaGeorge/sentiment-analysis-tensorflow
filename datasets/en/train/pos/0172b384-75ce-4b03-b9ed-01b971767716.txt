Wow!  I loved this place.  We went for happy hour (5:00) before we went to the Phx Art Museum.  Amazing bar food.  I had the Slopy Joe and a big fat pretzel.  Carbs anyone?!?  The beer selection was great.  Our waitress was super friendly and informed.  I also loved the decor.  I would have stayed longer but our little guy Evan was a bit too excited - I think the really loud music was a bit too much for him, and to be honest even though we loved what they were playing, it was a bit too loud for us too.  I can't wait to go back but we will leave the little guy at home so we can really dig in and stay a while!
