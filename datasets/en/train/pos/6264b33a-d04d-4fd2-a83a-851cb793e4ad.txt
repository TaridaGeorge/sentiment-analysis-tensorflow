Had brunch here this morning (Sunday), and there was exactly one other table of diners there the whole time we were there. I don't understand why this place was so empty when Matt's Big Breakfast has lines out the door. Oh well, better for me. 

Once again, Cheuvront did not disappoint. The blueberry muffins that come to the table, piping hot, were lovely. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Cheuvront, which consists of lightly poached eggs, black forest ham, and a delicious poblano hollandaise over a toasted baguette. The potatoes on the side were spiked with rosemary and so tasty dragged through the hollandaise (but then, what isn't?).

My friends ordered the egg white omelet and the fritatta, and both cleaned their plates.
