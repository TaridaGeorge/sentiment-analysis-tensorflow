This place is a hidden gem.  Scottsdale's hidden secret; not for long!  From beginning to end was an absolute delight.  Great breakfast choices, not to mention; wonderfully delicious! The breakfast sandwich was an excellent choice, eggs cooked to perfection with your choice of cheese and meat.  If you prefer a lighter fare, the fruit, yogurt and granola is another wonderful choice.  Granola and yogurt infused with honey are homemade.  Spectacular service and awesome ambiance  makes The Orange Table a destination place for breakfast or lunch!  Don't miss out on this gem!!!!
