On a whim my husband and I decided to stop in for brunch. I'd heard good things about Fez but as a Chicago foodie I have a ridiculously high standard for brunch. I have to say I was quite impressed. I had an omelet with gyro and feta which was delicious and surprisingly light considering all of the heavy and spicy ingredients. The bloody mary was also nice and spicy. I went back the other day for dinner and had the marrakech salad with salmon. Even the half salad is a good-size portion and the salmon was delicious. Everyone else with me ordered different burgers and they all loved them. There's something for everyone at Fez whether you're an adventurous eater or you crave something more traditional. The staff was really helpful, too and gave us great drink recommendations. Go on a thursday for a cheap G-spot!
