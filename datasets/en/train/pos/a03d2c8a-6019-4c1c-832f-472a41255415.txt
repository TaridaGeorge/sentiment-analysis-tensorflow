Seriously guys, if you haven't been to Wholefoods you have to hit this place up! They recently updated their BAR area - yes I said BAR area in a grocery store!! What? I know it's crazy but they have over 29 beers just on tap and the biggest beer wall I've ever seen - they say the wall has over 600 different types of beers....... Wowie Zowie! The coolest part was they let me take a beer from the wall and enjoy it with the wonderful pizza! Which by the way is 10.00 on SUNDAY  ---- DEAL DEAL DEAL! Check out the picture someone posted - these pizza's rock!
