I am not a native, nor a resident of Arizona.
I'm from Southern California, where the weather is mild.
So take this into account when I say, that I would sit outside in the 100+ degree stinging dry heat for 30 minutes plus to get a table at Harlow's to have the pancakes.  Oh My God.   The pancakes.  Each one is just a little piece of heaven.   I often wonder if next time I go, that I might get something else.....But then I remember how amazing these pancakes are.  And that if one day my best friend in the world moves away from the greater phoenix area, I will still try to find a reason to visit.....for the pancakes.
