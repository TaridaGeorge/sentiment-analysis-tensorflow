Costco is THE shopping place.  Clothing, food, household items, furniture, medicine, gasoline and a car wash....a one stop shopping extravaganza.  I spend way too much money, but they have the highest quality at the most reasonable prices.  Get the American Express Card and you can earn anywhere from 1 - 3% back up to $500.00. 
The BEST thing about Costco is their return policy.
