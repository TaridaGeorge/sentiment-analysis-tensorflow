I travel to Philly on business quite often, this is as good as any cheese steak I have had in Philly,  and is the best I have found in Phoenix.   Get the #1 "Wit Wiz" to be the most authentic.   Also, try the sweet potato fries..

On a side note, my friend wanted soup, and got the tomato basil bisque, and he said it was delicious (I had not even noticed they served soup).
