I had a great time at the Aloha festival. It was a lot bigger than I expected it to be. I went on the 2nd day. I went on a trip to Maui a year ago and have been missing the islands ever since, and this was a fun way to bring that experience back home. I shared some delicious teryaki chicken and rice with my friend, had a shaved ice, and walked around looking at all of the booths. Saw a lot of orchids, coconut candles, ukuleles, and shell necklaces. There was different music and entertainment on different stages. I liked it a lot.
