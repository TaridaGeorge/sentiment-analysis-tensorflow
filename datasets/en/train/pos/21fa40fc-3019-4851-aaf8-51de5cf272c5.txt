These people are amazingly honest!!! I have taken both my cars there with brake problems, they diagnosed the problems quickly, and, expecting the worst, was very pleased that the problems turned out to be minor. They could have told me anything and I would have believed them. My one car was leaking brake fluid and the pedal barely worked. They could have told me the master cylinder needed replacement, but, instead they told me a simple line was leaking and needed replacement, this was a fraction of the cost I was prepared for...Thank Doug at the Shea/Scottsdale road location...
