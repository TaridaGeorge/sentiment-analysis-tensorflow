We had an outstanding experience last evening with the Herb Box Catering!  The catering manager, Kelli Burton,  is efficient, professional and knows her business.  She presented us with a delightlful and creative menu from appetizers, salad, entrees and dessert.  Kelli was the first to arrive the night of our event and she was the last to pull out of the driveway.  She and her crew are amazing.  Everyone raved about the quality and presentation of food served.  I am still receiving e-mails thanking us for a wonderful evening.  Our party was a sit down, outside gathering for 48.  The Herb Box handled it with ease and perfection.  I would recommend the Herb Box, 100%.
