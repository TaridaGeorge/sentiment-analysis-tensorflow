I've been to Frashers a few times. Each time the service has been great and the food wonderful! 

The steaks are great and I've never had a better pork chop then here. The pork chop is also thick and juicy. A real delight!

The roasted corn as a side is outstanding. If you like corn, that is a must side. I believe the corn is only offered seasonally though.

You can choose to eat in the dining room or in a little more casual setting in the bar area. Be warned there is TV on there with sports and ESPN. Needless to say, I don't get to sit in this area!

This is a perfect place for a nice dinner with friends/family or a romantic dinner with your significant other.
