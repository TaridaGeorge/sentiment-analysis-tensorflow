I read Mona's review from the Yelp app on my iPhone while lounging by the pool in Scottsdale on Sunday and our group of 6 booked a reservation for that night. Mona hit it spot on. This place has it together; service and food. I recommend the Sweet Potato casserole with pecan crust for a side. Everything was perfect, our waiter was on the dorky side, but, the fireworks we watched out the window from somewhere nearby kinda sealed the deal as the best dinner I've had in the last year
