What a fantastic find!  Drove cross country, and this was the last overnight destination.  I think we saved the best for last, as it was such a great hotel and experience, and for $95.  Again, any special request was honored, all of the staff we encountered were lovely, the room was divine, and a fantastic bathroom.  I would go to Phoenix again, if only to spend a weekend at this hotel!
