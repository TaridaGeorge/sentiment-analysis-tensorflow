I was referred to Todd at Alcatraz from A 1 Key Service.  He was very friendly, professional, and courteous.  He came out and made me a new chip key for HALF the price of what my insurance quoted me.  He also cut me a 2nd non-chipped key for free in case I lock my other keys in my car.   The entire job took him less than 30 minutes.  I will definitely be recommending Alcatraz to friends in need of a locksmith.
