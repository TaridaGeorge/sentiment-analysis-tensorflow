I love this bar. Over 100 beers and free art and music nightly, umm . Me likes. They also do this art drawing night once a month. Peeps are chill, bartenders are hot and sweet. Nice patio for smoking. No food but they are adding it soon. Great coffee next door. 5th street is a trip, but it is the center of 1st friday, so go on another night, unless you're up for the crowds. This is where I'll call home for awhile.
