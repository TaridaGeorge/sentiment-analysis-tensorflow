I have never had fry bread. It's hard to describe: perhaps a cross between puri and fried dough a fair. But better than both. This place is operated by Tohono O'odham Nation. It was recently named a James Beard American Classic. No frills, simple digs, this place let's the food stand out. And it does by far. The red chili stew was finger-licking good. Which is impressive since stews are eaten with spoons and typically don't involve licking fingers. I ordered the fry bread with beans, lettuce, and cheese. These are deceptively large and perhaps could fit an infant. I recommend buying a blanket for your infant, so you can eat the fry bread. Places like this make me sad that I don't live in the area. How I yearn to try the rest of that menu!
