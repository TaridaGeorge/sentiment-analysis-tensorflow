i used to frequent the salad bar that used to be in this spot before they closed so i had a chip on my shoulder the first time i walked in. lucky for them i absolutely love greek food. and now lucky for me that this place exists. the food is amazing! i absolutely love the gyros, great salads and very good dolmades. if mediterranean food is what does it for you, give this place a try.
