I took one TED flight to Portland, OR and a United flight to return.  

They make flying as painless as possible.  The staff is friendly.  They are prompt with snacks and drinks.  There is a wide selection of radio stations to listen to.  For flights 1.5 to 3 hours they screen a selection of TV shows, over 3 hours and you get a movie.  What makes time go faster than watching a classic episode of the Simpsons or clips from SNL?

If I get a choice of what to fly, I'll go with United anytime.
