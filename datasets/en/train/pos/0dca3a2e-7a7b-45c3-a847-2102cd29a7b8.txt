I took my 1988 Mercedes 560 SEC into DynoComp today to get a baseline dyno run with Air/Fuel evaluation.

The guys at DynoComp could not have been nicer.  They were all enthusiastic, professional and obviously motorheads.

They spent an hour with me doing some basic tuning on my ancient CIS-E fuel injection and allowed me to make some tweaks.

Its pretty easy to get snotty when you work on REALLY high end cars.  But there was not a hint of snotty at  this place.  Or else they were on their best behavior.

This is a shop I can see coming back to for other services besides dyno tune.  Their techs had all the good equipment and they seemed to be having fun.

Thanks guys.
