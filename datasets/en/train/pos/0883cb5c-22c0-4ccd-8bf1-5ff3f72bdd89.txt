I loved this place and the double-soy-cappuccino was one of the best I have ever tasted.  The Cap was made perfectly... awesome thick foam, tasty coffee, great cup (haha, srsly, the cup is great).  The inside is filled with art and has a cool vibe.  $2.50 for a double-soy-cap, not bad.  I just wish this place was closer to me, I'd be a regular.
