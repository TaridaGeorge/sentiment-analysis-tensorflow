As far as a fast Burger and shake goes, this place is tops. The fries are thin and crispy but not overdone and their frozen custard is a dream. You'll know why the shake straws are half an inch thick right away, they work perfectly for the thickness of their custard shakes.

The prices aren't too high either, for the quality you get over your average fast-food place a buck or two goes a long way here.

If only they had more locations, I honestly just keep forgetting this place is around because every time I go I am immediately glad I did. 

Their hot dogs are pretty "meh" but it is a burger place afterall, so you should be having one of those.
