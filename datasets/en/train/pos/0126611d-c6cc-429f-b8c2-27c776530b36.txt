WHY did I not order a Stetson Chopped Salad for myself instead of opting to share it with my girl?! BAD BAD choice, on my part. Once again, after 2+ years of not having one, it blew my boots off.

We made reservations and they seated us as we walked in the door at our appointed time.

Our server, Gabe, was extraordinary- attentive and on the ball.

We split the Stetson Chopped, had an order of "Crispy Mac N Cheese" and the BBQ ribs with the cherry BBQ sauce. The mac n cheeze was okay, a little dry, though they did provide a nice salsa thingy to moisten it up. The ribs n cherry sauce, OMG!!!

Wish they would sell the Stetson Chopped and ship it to me in San Diego... I am sure they would for a price, eh? I'll let you know how that day goes.
