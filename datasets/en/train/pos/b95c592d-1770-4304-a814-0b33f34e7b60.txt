Just about as good as a steak house can get, this place would be right at home in NY, Chicago or even DC.  First and foremost, excellent meat.  All the other goodies that go into making a good steak into a great steak house experience were there too.  Nice decor, open an dinviting.  Great service.  Huge wine list with options from budget to Bill Gates.  Creamed spinach and chocolate lava cake.  All good things.  Suprisingly, its a chain.  There is another in Tucson that is just as good.
