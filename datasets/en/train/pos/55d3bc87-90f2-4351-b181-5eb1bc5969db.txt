I was getting tired of going to a sports bar so i was looking for a good bar to go to with great drink specials. I stumbled upon this bar and decided to go in and check it out. The bar seemed like a bar that had a lot of regulars because the bartender knew everybody there. I really enjoyed that about this place. The bartender was extremely friendly and talked to you as if you were best friends. He even bought us a round of shots! The drinks were reasonably priced and were always promptly brought when ordered. I didn't eat any of the food because I was on a strict liquid diet for the night. I would definitely recommend this place.
