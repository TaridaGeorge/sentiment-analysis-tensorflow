went in for happy hour last week great drink specials and a friendly staff one bartender especially, Danny. he took great care of us and when the kitchen got behind with our order, it was packed so understandable, Danny wet above and beyond to make sure we still had a pleasant experience. we will definitely be back thanks Danny!
