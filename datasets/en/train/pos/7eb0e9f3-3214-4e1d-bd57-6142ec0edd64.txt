La Bocca has definitely improved their service in the past few months. The last time I was here, I personally called over the manager and told him what a great job our waiter was doing and that I've consistently noticed an improvement in service over my last few visits. I come here a lot and love the Bruschetta, reverse happy hour, ambiance, and the pizza. We also went here for New Years Eve and that was a great deal - we sat on the couch and watched all the Mill Ave madness from a safe distance. I highly recommend this place and whenever I have visitors in town that want to see Mill, I usually take them here. It also makes a great date spot. By far my favorite spot on Mill!
