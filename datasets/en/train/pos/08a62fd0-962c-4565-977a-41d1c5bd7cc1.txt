Andrea is absolutely wonderful. She's pet-sit for me several times over the past several years and I've never had a single issue. On her first visit she stopped by to meet the animals and go over details with me. Now I just call her to let her know the days I'll be away and she arrives without any problems. 

She's very responsible and trustworthy - her copy of my house key broke off in the lock and she called me right away and we figured out a solution. She even came by on a day she didn't have to in order to get it fixed - all of this while I was gone.  On another occasion my travel plans changed suddenly and she was able to continue watching my animals. 

I highly recommend Andrea as a professional house-sitter. She can't be beat.
