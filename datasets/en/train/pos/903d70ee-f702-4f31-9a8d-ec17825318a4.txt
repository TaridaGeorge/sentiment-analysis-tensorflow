We had dinner there, the place is always packed. Once you eat there you will know why. The food was amazing. We ordered this "The natural" drink, ohh the flavors I loved them. Then came the Mediterranean salad, very good, then the Kale something pizza, which was totally completely unique... We ordered cheese ravioli from the kids menu for my son. My son just loved it, i mean i know my son, he is so picky and fussy about his food and it was just 6 o clock and he ate his meal very nicely, that means it was sure was delicious.

We are vegans so great for us. The food was so healthy and fresh, we just loved it
