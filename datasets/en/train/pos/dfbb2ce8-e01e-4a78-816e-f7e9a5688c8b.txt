What would I do without this place?  They pretty much anything you need to make any Asian home cooked meals.  Very clean.  Fresh produce, fresh seafood, fresh meat.  I love how they have pre sliced meats.  This is definitely one of the largest Asian supermarkets in the valley.  Avoid the the 2 asian restaurants in the market though.  They're not very good.
