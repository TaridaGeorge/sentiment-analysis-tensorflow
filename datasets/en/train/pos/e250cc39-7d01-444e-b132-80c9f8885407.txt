This facility is a no brainer if your close enough to one! I've done other gyms but this is the best. Always clean, always equipment available. Plenty of yoga and fitness classes of all types. They have the best tennis courts in the area with lessons, competitions, and ball machines as well as multiple pools inside and out, dry and steam saunas, fresh towel service, subscription to Experience Life magazine which happens to be the best fitness and healthy lifestyle magazine I' can remember reading. They should call it Lifetime Fitness & Resort. I'm very happy to pay the extra .50/day or so above other gyms!
