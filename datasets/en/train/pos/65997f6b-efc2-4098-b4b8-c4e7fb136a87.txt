WOW......
Over the past summer, my family toke a road trip and drove from Houston to San Jose CA.  On our way back to Houston, we stop by Joe's Farm Grill; we found this restaurant in Guy from food network show called Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. You can't almost go wrong with that. Guy does have good taste for food. The foods are excellent and the portion is great. I am a big eater and I can't finish the BBQ. My daughters can't finish their sandwiches. We have so much food left that we ate them for dinner at Las Cruces, NM. The price is great. It is so worth the money. We will eat there again when we in Phoenix, AZ.
