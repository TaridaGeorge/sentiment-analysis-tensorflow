I'm not sure what else can be said about Lo-Lo's, but I have to put in my small two cents anyway. Four words:

GO FOR THE WAFFLES.

Sure, the chicken is wonderful and juicy and you'll definitely leave feeling you need a bypass....but seriously, you could skip the chicken and go with a stack of waffles and you'll be just as satisfied. 

Next time, this is all I'm ordering. One heaping stack of waffle goodness.
