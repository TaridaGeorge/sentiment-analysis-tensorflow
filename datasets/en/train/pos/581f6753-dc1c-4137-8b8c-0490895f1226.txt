I've been here a few times while bar hopping with the Rage Cycles folk. We tend to be dressed ridiculously but there are all kinds at ZuZu. It has the kind of atmosphere where you can get dressed up just because or walk in casually. The bar always has a delicious drink specials and the prices are comparable to other places around town. ZuZu is actually inexpensive compared to other "fancy" looking restaurants/bars. 

In all honesty, I have never eaten here but I've nibbled off of peoples' plates and the food is great if you're looking for bar food with a little flare. 

ZuZu is a great spot to meet a small group or date. Highly recommended! And it's close to old town, which makes it easy to hop around to other desirable spots.
