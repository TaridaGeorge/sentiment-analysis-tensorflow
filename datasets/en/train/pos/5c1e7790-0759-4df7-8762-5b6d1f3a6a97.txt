WooHoo is right!!! 
This place features locally sourced items on the menu and you can taste the difference in the food. 
I went in for breakfast. You order at the counter then, good luck finding a seat... 
I had the Quiche Loraine with fresh fruit. AMAZING! I absolutely loved it. It was the perfect amount of food without weighing you down for the rest of the day. 
I had the chance to taste their Hollandaise sauce from the eggs Benedict special and it was the best I have ever had pass my lips (sorry mom). 
If you need a big greasy hangover breakfast (we all do sometimes) this is not the place to go. 
If you are looking for a healthy lighter breakfast option this is the spot!
