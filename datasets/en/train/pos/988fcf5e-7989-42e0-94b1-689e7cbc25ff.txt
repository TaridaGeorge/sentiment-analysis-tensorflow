I spent 6 years in Germany and my buddy who was with me Friday night is German.
We absolutely loved the food. I had the lamb shank with the j√§ger (mushroom) gravy with the fried potatoes and red cabbage. A little Asbach to wash it down. Delicious.
My buddy had the Bauernschmaus which he loved. Made him a little homesick. 
The owner, Werner came out and said Guten Aben to everyone and asked how the food was. Just, a great experience.
