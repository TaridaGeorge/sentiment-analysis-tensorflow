Was brought here by my friend who lived in Scottsdale for 5 years before leaving for Chicago. Two years later he still craved the Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato pizza. Not sure how I felt about potato on my pizza, I went along for the ride. Holy Holy Holy! I eat plenty of amazing pizza in Chicago, but I am now in love with one more.  And in Scottsdale of all places. We went for lunch so we avoided the crowds and were so pleased. The other thin crust pizza we had was equally as delicious and so were the salads.
