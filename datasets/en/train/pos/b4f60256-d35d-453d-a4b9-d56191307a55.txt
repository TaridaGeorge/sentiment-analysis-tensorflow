I have only been here once and cant wait to return. The decor is industrial/modern. The crowd here is eclectic. We started with the goat cheese appetizer. It was tangy, smidge sweet and acidic from the tomatos...absolutely delish. I ordered an almond margarita out of curiosity...you must try! It is hard to describe...but it totally works. We had the hanger steak and salmon. Hanger steak was sooo flavorful, tender...exactly what i wanted. The salmon is spectacular! I cant wait to return and try everything else! It all looked good.
