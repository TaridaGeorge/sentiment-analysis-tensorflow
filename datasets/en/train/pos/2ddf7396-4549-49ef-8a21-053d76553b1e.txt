OMG!  OMG!  OMG!  I could not believe how delicious my meal was.  I had the Kale salad and Eggplant burger.  YUM, YUM, YUM!!!  Then I had the Papaya pie. It has a coconut base.  OMG!  OMG!  OMG!  YUM, YUM, YUM!!!
I mean, ya ever watch Check Please where they do the close ups of the food and it looks sooo delicious and the reviews the people give are so enticing...?  Well, that's EXACTLY what my meal tasted like.   I wish I was being filmed so someone else could do the drooling!
