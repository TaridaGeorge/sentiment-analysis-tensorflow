I have been trying to get here for years and we finally made it!!! They hype is absolutely true.  It is fantastic pizza.   My tip is go when it opens on a weekday so you don't have to wait.  I know i wouldn't want to wait in the hot summer heat.  The next time i am back in town, i'll be there, at 11 am :)
