I don't know what to say that hasn't already been said. I don't think there is anything from Short Leash that isn't amazing. Even my vegetarian friends can walk away happy. My favorite is the Aiko with sriracha. Even if you don't want a specialty dog, there are so many FREE toppings to choose from, you can make your own concoction. Definitely visit their Sit-N-Stay location Friday nights at Central & Camelback. The menu is different, but still delicious!

Bottom line... if you don't like Short Leash you are probably the kind of person who hates puppies and love.
