No reason to shop anywhere else.  I started going here when I lived up the street due to convenience and a desire to eat healthy while supporting local sustainable markets.  Relying on the adhoc farmers markets at various parks only open in the mornings on the weekends  is nice, but not exactly convenient and when they run out of food, they shut down.  This place operated like a regular grocery store, open 7 days a week, extended hours and receiving inventory regularly from local sustainable food sources!
It's absolutely amazing to have a grocery store that's not whole foods provide local fresh organic fair at reasonable prices 7 days a week.  If you live anywhere in the east valley, this should be your first stop for all your grocery needs!
