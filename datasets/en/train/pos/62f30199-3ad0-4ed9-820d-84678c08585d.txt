Went on a Thursday night before a comedy show. Felt very welcome as soon as we walked in.  Had a great waitress who was very friendly and made excellent menu suggestions. My friend and I wanted something light; we ordered Drunken Cheesy bread to start. Delicious. (Ladies Night half prices were a bonus.) The frozen margaritas were also tasty. We shared a chicken parm pizza, which was one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  Between the service and the food, can't wait to go back.
