You MUST try this place. It is wonderful! We shared the zeljanica (spinach spankopita thingy) and the sausage sandwich. Both were amazing. We also had turkish coffee... it blew my mind. I was so pleased by the way it was served. THAT'S how it should be done! I keep meaning to get back soon and savor another turkish coffee and a zeljanica all by myself. Because I don't want to have to share!
