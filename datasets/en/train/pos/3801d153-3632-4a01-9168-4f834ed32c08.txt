Went back for more! I can't say that I've changed my order much (still the Tofu Pho). Also got an order of spring rolls on the side, and yes, I did eat everything. So delicious! The owner yelp-mailed me and said that they do offer crispy tofu in their Pho. I tried it this evening and was thankful that I did. Loved it. Pho Thanh has become my go-to place for a quick, delicious and wallet-friendly meal!
