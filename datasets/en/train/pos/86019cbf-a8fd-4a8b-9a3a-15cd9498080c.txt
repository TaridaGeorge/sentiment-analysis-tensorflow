My fianc√© was totally skeptical when I said I wanted to eat BBQ in a gas station called Tom thumbs.

We walked in and it's like being in a cute little market. 

They have BEER and wine. 

The menu is chili meat, pulled pork, BBQ brisket, flatbreads, salads, grilled corn. It seems to be BBQ with a bit of southwest flair.


I got the pulled pork, brisket, macaroni salad, baked beans and slaw. Everything was amazing!! So so good, brisket is tender. Beans are perfectly spiced and the habanero sauce is amazing! Perfect best BBQ sauce ever. 
We had a taste of the chili beans it was okay. 

Server was a little lost- she didn't know the menu well, but she went and asked when she didn't know something. 

You can also get to go..

YOU NEED to check this place out.
