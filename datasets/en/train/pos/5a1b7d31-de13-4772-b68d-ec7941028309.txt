Best college radio station Phoenix never got and the closest we'll ever get to KXCI in Tucson. Italian-language specialty shows, Beatles show, Democracy Now and other public affairs programs on the weekends... TMI weekday mornings with Beef Vegan and Shorty... Dani's Diner at lunch playing 70's/80's stuff... musically, it's akin the old KUKQ (before it was a sports station) and even plays Jonathan L's show from Berlin. All the great indie stuff you can't/won't ever hear on X103.9 (what a joke), you'll hear it on KWSS-LP - and it is "LP" (Low Power), which means stronger reception in Glendale, North Phoenix, Scottsdale, Fountain Hills, weaker reception in the East Valley - so, you'll need to listen from a smart phone app if you live Mesa or Glendale.
