For Del Taco, a fast food establishment selling high volume, quickly prepared food at low prices, YES it's as good as it gets.  

I go here every so often for their 39 cent tacos or 49 cent burritos for a cheap meal.  They will substitute meat filling with beans at no extra charge too.  The tacos/burros are always fresh, I've never received the wrong item, the staff is always friendly and smiling, and the place is clean.   

I have minimum expectations from fast food places, and this one far exceeds them.   That's my 2 cents.  37 more and I get another taco!
