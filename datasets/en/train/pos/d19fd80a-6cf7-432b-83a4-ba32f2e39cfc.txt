Fleming's is definitely a special occasion place but well worth it. The service was very professional and attentive. The food was very well prepared, just the way we ordered it. I felt that everyone made the effort to make the experience the best that it could be. My husband ordered the peppercorn steak which was cooked just right while I had the small plate of lamb chops. They were wonderful. The Fleming's potatoes are hot to the table and so yummy. A great evening out.
