I was visiting Arizona this past weekend, and had been told to check out Marcella's.  I love Italian food, so decided to go.  I ordered basic spaghetti and was shocked at the amount of food I got!  Let me tell you, the food was amazing!!  You could tell it was authentic.  The manager Brady came by to be sure that we were happy.  I left and didn't take my left overs because I was on a flight home that day, but I am wishing there was one here in the Bay Area.
