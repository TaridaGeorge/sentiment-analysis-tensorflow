I love the Italian Picnic Salad and Vegetarian Panni!  I've had most of the menu - multiple foodgasms - and have been going since 2005.  I have others hooked too - My parents love it, friends, co-workers, people I meet on the street... it's great.  

They have fantastic happy hour specials.  The staff is really friendly.  They play good music. I would say Postino is one my favorite restaurants of all time. Top five for sure!
