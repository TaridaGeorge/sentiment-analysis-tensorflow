Definitely a great stop especially at lunch to snag a multitude of $5 wines by the glass. Fill up on some create your own bruschetta like Tuscan white bean with proscuttio while knocking back Crazy Aunt Edna's favorite rose'.  I prefer the lounge chairs to the high top tables the same way Chuck Taylor lo tops are way cooler than some scuffed up Uggs.  Kick back and enjoy the quick, attentive and rather attractive service. Of course, look out for wine snobs,haters,cougars, and wanna be hipsters that will harsh your giggly wine buzz. Better ride your skateboard though, parking's tight and time-consuming.
