This place is great!  One of my all time favorites! The decor is so nice, romantic, and relaxing.  I love how the restaurant is open to the outside making it a great place to sit wherever you may be seated! The patio is great with small tables and flowers.  This place is good for a date, happy hour, or just hanging with friends.

My favorite food to eat here is the bruschetta.  I highly recommend the bruschetta! 

My favorites are: 
Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone
Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese
Burrata, Bacon, and Arugula with tomatoes
Goat cheese and jam  

Some specials they offer are wine by the glass or a pitcher of beer is $5 before 5pm everyday and Mondays and Tuesdays have specials with bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20, but it will be busy.   You will LOVE this place!!!
