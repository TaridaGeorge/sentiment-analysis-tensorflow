I don't wear a lot of make-up, but it seems Saks has become my go-to place in town when I do need a little somethin-somethin to make me feel pretty.

I met my mom and Aunt Marcy at the Biltmore Fashion Park over the weekend and we ended up wandering into SFA since they had a Laura Mercier counter.  Aunt Marcy is obsessed with a special tinted Laura Mercier moisturizer with SPF 20... my Cousin Megan turned her on to it.  And now, my mom and I are both hooked too!

Lillian at the NARS counter walked over to help us and couldn't have been nicer or more knowledgeable about all of the make-up lines that Saks carries.  She sold us all a little something and I guarantee that the next time I'm in need of some make-up, moisturizer, etc... I'll head right over to see Lillian!
