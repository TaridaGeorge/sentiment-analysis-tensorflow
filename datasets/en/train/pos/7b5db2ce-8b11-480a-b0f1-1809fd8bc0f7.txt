I wrote a review on another location, so I won't start all over, but I do have to comment on this particular location.

The burger is amazing. Every time I eat here, it is literally the best burger I've ever had. The quality of the meat and ingredients is just sooo darn good. So much better than In N Out Burger, but the same concept.

This location is close to work, so we go here a few times a month. I love love love their easy online ordering and the fact that my order is correct every time. The staff is friendly every time I've picked it up and the wait is minimal with the pre-ordering.

I don't know what else to say, but I love this place and I will be back again and again and again....
