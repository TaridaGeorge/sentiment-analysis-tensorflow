A small mom and pop Greek joint, with excellent food, which is made to order, and excellent prices. A great place for lunch that I have been going to for several years. It is frequented by the local ambulance crews in the area because it is fast and cheap. The staff is friendly, and quick to remember you if you come in more than once. The gyros are great, with hot, fresh fries on the side. The falafel is also good, though they do not always have it. I will continue eating here for a long time to come, and hope you come try it!
