LoLo... what can I say, that hasn't already been said, other than WHEN ARE YOU COMING TO THE EAST SIDE!!!! We love chicken over here too. Ive only been to the Phoenix location, ha vent made it to their new spot. When I plan a trip to LoLo's, the sky turns extra blue, the freeway clears me a un hindered path, my hands are clean, willing and able to grab me some LoLo Chicken..... ahhhhh just sitting hear thinking about it...... makes me mouth waterrrrrrrrr 

I cant seem to get to any of the other menu items, past the Betty Boop. Will do so next time........... maybe
