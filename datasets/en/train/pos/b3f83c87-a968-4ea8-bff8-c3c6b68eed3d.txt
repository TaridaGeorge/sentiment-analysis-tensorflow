Personally discovered this place a couple months ago and I am trying to eat here as often as possible before I move this summer. I have tried 5-6 different bowls and have licked every one clean. Fresh ingredients, all together delicious. My favorite so far: Drunken Noodle.

Kind of weird entry behind the Party City, but very cool vibe inside and amazing food. Try it. Thank me later.
