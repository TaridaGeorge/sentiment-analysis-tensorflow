We had a sick cat and had to find a vet near our house. Shea Animal hospital was down the street so we decided to take him there. They were so nice and friendly and loved Atticus immediately. That was in November 2011.

 A couple days ago I noticed our cat having a hard time breathing so I called them. Dr. Organek treated him before and she called me back and also scheduled the appointment for me for the next day. Unfortunately we ended up having to put our sweet kitty to sleep but Dr. Organek spent almost 3 hours with us and talked to my husband on the phone and answered all of our questions. She was also very sympathetic. This was 4/5/12. On 4/7/12 we received a sympathy card from her. 

We are very happy with their services and would bring our pets to them again.
