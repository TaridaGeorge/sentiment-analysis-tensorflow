I am a big fan of gastropubs, espcially when they are as elevated as the Citizen is.

We requested to sit next to the open window that faces the street.  It was a beautiful November evening, so a slight breeze was welcomed while we enjoyed our meal.

Our server Clark was absolutely charming.  He gave excellent recommendations when we needed some advice and he was able to joke around with us as we inhaled everything brought to our table!  Our cobb salad, our pork belly, the cocktails, dessert, EVERYTHING!  

We will have to visit the Citizen Pulic House next time we're in town!
