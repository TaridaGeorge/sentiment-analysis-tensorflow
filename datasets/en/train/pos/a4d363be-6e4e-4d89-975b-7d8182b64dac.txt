Hair products, makeup and fragrances, oh my! As a woman, it's hard not to get caught up in the beauty-licious fun that is Ulta. It's a one-stop shop for women and is my favorite place to get the bigger name hair products at a discounted price (compared to the salons!).  

Redken, Bed Head, Frederic Fekkai -- practically all the names are here. And there's also a salon if you want to stop in for some new highlights and/or a trim. 

The store also offers an Ulta card where if you shop as much as I do, you can earn rewards and save money on future visits.
