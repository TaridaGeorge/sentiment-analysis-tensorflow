I've lived my life off of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. I knew no one who can do it better. Well now the king has just lost its crown. In fact I can't even go back to Roscoe's now that my taste buds have touched that of Lolo's.

The service - Nice and fun people
The chicken - Bigger and juicier
The waffles - Bigger and tastier
The mac & cheese - tastier and cheesier
The "stupid fries" - Stupid Good and Roscoe's doesn't have it.
The Kool Aid in a jar - Roscoe's doesn't know the meaning of DRANK!!!

Cons - Closest one is in Arizona which would mean I would have to drive 6 hours to get there... but it is worth it!!!
