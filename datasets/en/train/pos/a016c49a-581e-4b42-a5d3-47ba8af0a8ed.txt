Oh AJ's....... GREAT seafood dept, meat dept, fresh flowers, salad bar, brunch, pizza by the slice, sandwiches, sushi, bakery, wine and beer selection. AJ's is perfect and I don't know what more I can say. I am there several times a week, it is perfect for us single gals that don't enjoy cooking for one. Eh so it's a little pricey. I don't mind paying more for the superior quality of products and the amazing staff. Try the lemon bar from the bakery.
