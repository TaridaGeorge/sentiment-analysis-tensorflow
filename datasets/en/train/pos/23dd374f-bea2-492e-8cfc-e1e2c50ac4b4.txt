Definitely one of the nicer Whole Foods that I've been to!

They have just about everything your looking for- fresh fruit and veggies, huge dairy selection, fresh seafood and meats! They have just about everything-- a gelato and desert corner, sandwiches made fresh to order, asian bistro, bbq made to order, a wine and tapas bar + fruit/salad bar!! 

This was my favorite place when I worked nearby- stop for lunch get a sammich and pick up some fruits or veggies for dinner! Some items are certainly much more expensive than elsewhere so do your homework, you'll know when your getting a bargain or if its something you really cant find elsewhere, might be worth the splurge! Manuka Honey, Wild Scallops, Blood Oranges, Organic Peaches, Fresh Artisan Breads- they got it :)
