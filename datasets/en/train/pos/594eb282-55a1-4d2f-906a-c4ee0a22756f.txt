We drive from Shea and Via Linda passing 2 or 3 other places to get to That's Amore.  Most of the ingredients come straight from Italy and with the exchange rates and such in is not cheep but more then worth it. Love the coffee, hazelnut, and tartufu (sp) flavors.  This is a must stop for all of our out of town visitors and one of the first things they ask about when they get back.  It as close to the look and feel of the gelato places we enjoyed when we were in Italy.  A good place for a cup of espresso as well.
