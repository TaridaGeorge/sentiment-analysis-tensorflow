This is a awesome little funky spot!

It seems to house a bar/restaurant, a boxing club and some other space that was having some kind of yoga thing the morning we went.

The food and service were both outstanding. I ordered a skillet scramble with mushrooms, bacon and gruyere. My gf ordered the cinnamon pecan french toast with bacon.

This place is great, try it if you haven't!
