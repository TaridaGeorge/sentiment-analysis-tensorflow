True story of the American dream!

The family got on a waiting list for America... and waited ELEVEN YEARS to finally get selected to come!  They sold everything they owned (besides what would fit in two suitcases each) and headed for New York!

After 9/11, they felt unsafe living in New York... so they made their way to the Valley (lots of open space and fantastic weather) and opened this cafe coming up on 8 years ago now.

Along with the great story comes GREAT food and PHENOMENAL service from the family themselves (who JOINED us for part of our meal at our request)!

If you live West of the Mississippi and haven't tried this place yet... shame on you!  Make a reservation because it's small and fills fast... and BRING your alcohol which is ENCOURAGED!
