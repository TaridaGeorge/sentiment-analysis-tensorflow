On my quest to visit every micro brewery in Arizona this was a must stop... I have been here a few times now and have enjoyed each stop. For food I went with the Thai Chicken Pizza - Thai peanut sauce, white meat chicken, fresh cilantro, red onions and mozzarella cheese... For beer I went with an Orange Blossom I normally do not enjoy this style of beer but it's really good... I rate the experience as followed.

Thai Chicken Pizza - A+
Staff - A+
Beer - A +++

They have a huge section of beers on tap as well as bottled... It's really impressive if you're looking for a place to go to try new beers this is a one stop shop.
