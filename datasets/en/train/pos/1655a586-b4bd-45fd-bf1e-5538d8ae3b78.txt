I've been going to Banfield for my pets for 8 years. I used to go to the Banfield at Spectrum Mall & thought the vet & techs there were great, until I went to the South Mtn location. 

It's not as busy as the Spectrum Mall location which allows the vet & techs to give you more personalized time. The vet Dr. Agnew always seems to remember my pets & me, despite months between visits. They are super nice to my animals, and for my one cat that absolutely hates the vet, they are very gentle with her and she seems more calm there than any other vet in the past. 

The facility is always very clean and doesn't smell.

These techs & vet are very thorough and caring. You can tell they love animals! I appreciate the way they treat me and the "kids."
