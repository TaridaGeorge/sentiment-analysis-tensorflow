I walk in for a volleyball and I walk out with a few golf clubs, a basketball and tennis balls!  Sports Chalet has everything and anything a sports nut would need and want!  I love walking around the store and seeing what I could possibly play with.  I have made a number of purchases at the Sports Chalet in the past and I continue to go back.  Yes the staff isn't always the most knowledgeable, this could be that most are in high school, but you can get everything!  What I also think is fantastic is that they offer Scuba instruction...and they have there very own pool in the back!
