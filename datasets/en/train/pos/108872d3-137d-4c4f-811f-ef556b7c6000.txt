I was in Phoenix last week and our group went here for dinner.  It was fantastic.  This is a very good steakhouse.  My only problem is that Arizona does not allow corkage in their restaurants.  Arizona state law.  I had brought with me as luggage a case of mixed California killer cabernets and showed up at the restaurant with 6 of them.  Well that got shot down pretty quick but very professionally.  I ended up ordering off their wine list which was not bad.  Food and service are top notch here.  Highly recommend this place.
