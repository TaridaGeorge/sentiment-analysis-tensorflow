I would eat here daily if I could afford it and the heart attack that would soon follow. 
The food is absolutely worth going and waiting for.
I'm giving this 5* in spite of the long wait because our service was perfect. Friendly, not pushy, helpful with the menu, and made this a great place to take our young kids. 
We will be back many times.
