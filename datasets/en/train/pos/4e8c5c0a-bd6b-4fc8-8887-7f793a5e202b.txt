I introduced my friend to the wonders of In-N-Out today and felt the need to Yelp about it.  Their hamburgers are works of art.  Would I love some more toppings like bacon or guacamole or fried onions?  Maybe, but there is so much taste happening in the simplicity of the In-N-Out Double Double.  

The best part is you can wolf down a burger and fries and not feel like you just swallowed a rock, the feeling exhibited when you go to almost any other burger fast food joint.

And always, ask for it Animal Style.
