5 stars!

I have tried all 3 Carolina's & they all have wonderful food.  However, this one is my favorite. 

The food is great, the prices are good, the employees are nice, and the restaurant is clean.  Plus, you don't have to tip a waiter. 

Carolina's is my favorite mexican food restaurant by far and I have tried most.  

Enjoy!
