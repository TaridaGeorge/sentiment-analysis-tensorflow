I seem to be going to Tom's Restaurant & Tavern about every two weeks. where  I meet my friend for lunch.  I love this place and our main waiter, Frank, Jr.  not only is he so professional, courteous and funny, but  becomes your friend right away.  You would think you have known him forever.  Their food is delicious and they have a huge menu.  It's very nice because you can either choose to sit outside on the patio like a cafe' setting, or sit inside the restaurant.  They are reasonably priced and most of the people that eat there are on their lunch hour, so they do hurry to get your food out.  I highly suggest you try Tom's Restaurant and Tavern the next time you are down on Central Ave.
