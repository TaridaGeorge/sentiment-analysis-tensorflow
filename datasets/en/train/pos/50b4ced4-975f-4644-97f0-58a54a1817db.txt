Best chinese food in phoenix i think.. I have been going here for the past 15-20years and i dont think i have ever gone wrong with it.. The ambiance is so beautiful and chinese. Location is not so great but once you get in, its totally worth it.. 

My favorites: Ken's Special Salad, Hot & Sour Soup, Mu-Shu, Fried Banana, and the Tea. 

Everyone i have ever taken here always begs to go back cause the food is just so amzing. 
its a family owned restaurant and the owners are just great sweet people!
