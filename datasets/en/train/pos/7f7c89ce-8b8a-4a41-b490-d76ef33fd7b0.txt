absolute hole in the wall but by far the most tasty subs around.  Forget subway!  You drive up to this tent-like circus building and you can't prepare for the interior decor :)  You find something new to read every time you're there!!  They have a good variety of hot & cold subs and very tasty!! I would definitely recommend for a fast lunch spot!
