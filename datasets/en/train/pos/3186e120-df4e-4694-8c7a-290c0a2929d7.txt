Thank you Yelpers for leading me to Hegel Yoga. I love this friendly, down-to-earth yoga studio filled with amazing yoga instructors who want to help you achieve your best yoga practice each time. I've been to three classes so far with three different instructors and thought they were all great. The last class I was at, Monica even stayed afterward to show me poses to help me with my back problem since she noticed I wasn't quite comfortable when laying in shivasana. Talk about personalized attention!
