Carefully prepared dishes made with extraordinary ingredients.  I particularly enjoyed the marscapone polenta and beet salad.  The first time i went, they served table-bread with a delicious oil-based dip. On the second visit, it wasn't present (I wish they'd bring that back).  Artfully  presented without being pretentious.  I really hope this place keeps the intimate, crafty vibe and isn't changed into something that would appeal to trendy clubbers...there are plenty of spots for those types in Old Town.
