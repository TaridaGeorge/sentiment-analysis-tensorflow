Ted's Hot Dogs are the best I have ever had, anywhere.

The burn factor... Ted's has a toasty bed of coals over which they turn your hot-dog bratwurst or white-hot into the ugly blackened sausage of your dreams. 
Don't order fries or rings unless you have some help. The dogs themselves are the main event! I can't finish the foot long! Be warned they are HUGE!

This is one of my favorite places for a date. I'm a weirdo I guess, but nothing says "I love you," like a good as they come fuss-free meal at rock bottom prices. If your date is too high maintenance to stand in line for a hot-dog -maybe it wouldn't work out anyway?
