Just saw The Black Keys there.. everyone who bitches about any line..get to the venue alittle earlier.. we had no lines... walked right in... bought our Tshirts, poster, no line. grabbed beers, walked around. Best sound is in the middle, on the first curb closest to the stage. Liked the fact that people let you have your space... beautiful warm night...nice concert venue...
