Only zoo I've been too so may be a bit biased in my rating... BUT I do know that I get everything I want from this zoo so I've never seeked out a different zoo. :)

Last time my son and I went, one of the zookeepers was out answering questions about the tortoises. It was really cool, my son enjoyed it. She was really knowledgeable and friendly. The staff has always been great every time we have gone here.
