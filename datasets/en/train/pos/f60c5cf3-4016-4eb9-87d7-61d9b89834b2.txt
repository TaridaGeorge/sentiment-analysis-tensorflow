Had an amazing dinner (7 course tasting menu with the enhanced wine paring).  Went with the tuna but my date substituted for the venison, both of which were excellent. The sommelier really knew what he was doing.  I think aside from the food being beyond wonderful, the best part was at the end my car was pulled up front, keys in the ignition with a thank you note on the dash and two bottles of water.   Really nice touch.  I don't think I'll ever go somewhere as delicious!
