My co-workers and I hit Picazzo's at least once a week and have done so for over a year.  We LOVE their pizza of the day special with a specialty salad of your choice.

The pastas are very tasty and the specialty pizza combinations are wonderful.  My favorite is the Classico!   We've even ordered a dozen pizza's to feed our entire office for lunch meetings. 

The restaurant itself is small, but it's VERY clean and tastefully decorated. 

The staff there is amazingly friendly-- especially Jenny-- who remembers our names and our drink preferences.   The service is very quick which is great when you have a limited amount of time for lunch.
