Chick-Fil-A has my most favorist (it's a word) fries! I love the waffle fries they serve...yum! 

Chick-Fil-A has bar none the best service of any fast food chain that I know of! They serve the food to your table, they will come clean up your sloppy mess after your meal, and even offer to get you a drink refill! 

I love the chicken sandwiches.

Another hidden gem is the "handspun" milkshakes... SO GOOD!

I wish they were open on Sundays.
