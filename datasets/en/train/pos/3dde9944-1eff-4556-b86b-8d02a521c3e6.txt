Bookmans is AWESOME! 

The staff is really friendly and knowledgeable about their inventory. The store went through some renovations and looks great! Even better, they are adding a cafe inside. 

My favorite part about Bookmans is that they allow dogs. My dog loves taking trips there! 

P.S. And they have free wi-fi!
