I am not much of a hiker but this can be fun when you are with the right people (I've done it a few times). It can be a challenging hike depending on the path you take.  Some helpful hints: definitely take some good hiking shoes, water, snacks and don't try this in the summer.  When you get to the top, you will have an amazing view of Phoenix.  You might want to bring a camera.  Be careful coming down.  You might slip a bit.
