This restaurant makes a rather dull downtown building worth a visit.  The open floor plan will, I'm sure, make it easy to facilitate the big groups that should come with the 1000 room hotel.  I was pleased to see that beers were very affordable, not typical from my past experience with restaurants and not to mention restaurants in hotels.  The food was great ,salmon came on cedar planks and the calamari was fantastic as well.
