Both Patti Hastings and Dr. Dairiki are amazing.  My first visit was very informative and fun for a first time mom-to-be.  I wasn't one of the lucky women as I lost my pregnancy at 8 weeks.  I wanted to write this review complimenting their professionalism, sympathy and sense of urgency in this matter. 

I found out on Wednesday that I lost my pregnancy and Dr. Dairiki was able to perform my D and C on that Friday.  She was extremely helpful in my post-op appointment and understood my emotional reaction.  She and I spoke and she recommended I see counselor as most women do not take the time to grieve their loss. 

I took her advise and am doing great!  I can't wail to conceive again to make visiting her office more frequent.
