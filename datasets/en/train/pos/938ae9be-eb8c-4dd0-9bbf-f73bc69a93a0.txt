i love sakana's!

this place is so good! i've never ordered a thing i didn't like here!!  their rolls are superbly delicious! and quite large! their prices on their happy hour menu are mad cheap and are available sun-thurs.  make sure you check out their specialty rolls cause they're incredible! 

some of my favorite rolls include:
chimi chimi roll
alaskan roll
baked scallop roll
scs roll

also a must try is their calamari tempura salad. yummy veggies along with really tender and crunchy pieces of calamari in their own homemade dressing--WOW!  also try out their sashimi! the slices are great cuts and thick! 

the service is awesome! they're fast, efficient and friendly. even when they're busy, the service is still top notch. 

you gotta check it out! you won't be disappointed!
