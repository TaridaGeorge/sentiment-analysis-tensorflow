Went here whilst on vacation for some good ol Angel's spring training.  We went here with a hankering for some good sushi.  Our sushi chef, um, I don't remember his name, was awesome.  Instead of ordering off some menu, we had him serve his specialties.  I didn't ask what they were or what was in them, but they were great, from what I remember.  I am going to have to defer all other questions to Ash who went with me, she can answer better than I can.  The service was good, my hunny's Kirin and my Asahi's were cold and the lily sake or something like that, does the trick.  Boy oh boy does it.  One bad thing, the sushi chefs aren't allowed to drink with you.  Ni modos, it was still a great time.  I enjoyed it very mucho.
