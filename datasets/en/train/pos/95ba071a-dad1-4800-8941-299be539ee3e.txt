This is the only urgent care center that I trust at this point. I have now been here three or four times and while I've always driven over with a slight sense of dread wondering about the wait and how attentive the care will be, I always leave lighthearted knowing I made a good choice. The front desk employees are kind and welcoming and all of the doctors I've seen so far have been incredibly knowledgeable and more than ready to answer my questions. I've been to urgent care places all over Tempe and I confidently hang my hat on this one.
