This is a great place to meet up with friends to enjoy some cocktails and fondue. In fact it is the ONLY establishment I know of that offers a full menu of nothing BUT fondue! 

The menu boasts a wide variety of options for starters, main courses and deserts.  EVERYTHING is delicious. I always choose broth over oil to cook my main course in but I've done it both ways and they are equally good. 

The Melting Pot requires at least two hours of your time AND is definitely on the pricey side so bring your Benjamin's and let loose! You are in for a really fun, interactive experience!
