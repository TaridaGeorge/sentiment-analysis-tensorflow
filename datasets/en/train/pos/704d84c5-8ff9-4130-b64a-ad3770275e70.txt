Cafe Bink, the younger sister of Binkleys, is one little gem of a French/Italian inspired bistro.   Expect European sized portions of beautifully crafted dishes such as braised rabbit, crispy duck breast and the unbelivably delicious bolognese.  The staff are always warm and friendly.    We are committed to making weekly visits to Cafe Bink to show our support.
