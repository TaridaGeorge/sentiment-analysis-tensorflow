REI has s different vibe compared to all the other sport places. It has a sense of authenticity and worthiness. It's difficult to explain but it's just :). And I don't have a REI membership, my sister does and she says it's amazing - shrugs.

Anywho, I came here to try on some shoes. The shoe lady was terrific, helped me find my sizing! Very helpful :] 

Then I decided to look for bite valves for camelback (if someone owes a camelback, hopefully you know what that is!). I looked completely lost and the guy was so helpful in helping me look for bite valves. 

I like REI and this one is amazing. They are knowledgeable and nice. REI things are a little overpriced I feel but it's a great place to find something you can't find anywhere else (bitevalves!).
