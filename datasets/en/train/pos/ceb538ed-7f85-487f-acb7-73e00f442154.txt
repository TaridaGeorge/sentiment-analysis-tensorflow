A church that preaches an unadulterated Gospel... meaning that the message that was good enough for the disciples of Christ are good enough for Redemption Church! 

The worship music varies from a more subdued Adult Contemporary in the chapel at 8am, to a more upbeat Adult Contemporary in the chapel and conference center (video feed for the teaching) at 10am, the 4pm and 6pm.

The Commons bookstore and coffee shop are an excellent place for fellowship.
