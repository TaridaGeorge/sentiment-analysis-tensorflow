I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE sandwiches and this is by far my favorite sandwich place!!!  There is enough meat on one sandwich for at least 4 Footlong sandwiches at subway!  Fresh bread, veggies and an overall pleasant experience.  The people are always friendly.  I wish there was one in the East Valley!!!!
