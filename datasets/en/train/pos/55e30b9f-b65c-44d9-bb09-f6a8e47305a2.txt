Well oddly enough (it seems) I like Urban Outfitters. Yes, I will admit they are overpriced. But hell, it seems like ALL clothes are these days unless you are shopping vintage. 

The other reason I like this store is that I haven't been able to find a vintage store here yet worth visiting. It all seems to be that new wave of kind of modern/kind of cheap clothes goodwill has, rather than good old vintage. 

UO clothes are creative. They are cute. I would be happy if I had all the money in the world to spend on them. Nice apartment things, funny books and gift items. I mean, if you like the catalog why not go to the store?
