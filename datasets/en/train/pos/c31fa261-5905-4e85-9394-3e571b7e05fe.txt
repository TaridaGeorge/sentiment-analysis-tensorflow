My friend has recommended Dr. Stephanie to me many times.  After a couple of weeks ignoring my lower back issues (consistently sore, not sleeping, etc) I woke up today and couldn't move at all.  After taking Aleve, rubbing some BioFreeze on it, I could get out of bed, but was mostly immobile.  I called and Dr. Stephanie wasn't in today, but Dr. Larsen could see me within an hour. 
I first was treated with the cold laser to reduce inflammation.  She then gently helped me onto the table and applied Traumeel cream to the area to help calm inflammation further.  The treatment she did was nothing like any chiropractor I've been to before!  She was incredibly gentle and was very aware of my pain.  
I feel this is a place to go to heal.  I can't believe the relief I felt after one visit.  Thank you Dr. Larson!!!
