The flowers arrived so beautiful and fresh yesterday.  My brother, daughter,even my equine DVM  have sent me flowers from this florist..  I have always  felt like I was receiving a bit more than expected.  You will either be sending or receiving an arrangement that you would have expected from a small town florist, years back.  I highly recommend them. Flowers are expensive and they deliver, the beauty and fragrance that you paid for.
