I'm really surprised that this place doesn't have that many good reviews... we love it!

Well, we love the prices at Happy Hour! And Happy Hour til 6:30pm... awesome! And then a reverse Happy Hour for later folks. Why wouldn't you like that? 

Everytime we've been here we've had good to great service. The sushi has always tasted awesome!

One time a friend from Chicago was visiting, and I brought her here for lunch. She loved it! Plus we had some awesome, awesome low carb rolls (soy paper, no rice). 

There's a large patio area outside (for when the weather's cooler). And plenty of seats inside. Yes, the bar area is in the back... which does seem odd. But they still have your traditional sushi bar to sit at as well. 

We'll keep going and going.... and going!
