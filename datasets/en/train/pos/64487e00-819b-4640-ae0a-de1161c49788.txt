Oh, Sprinkles...you have won my cupcake heart. I first went to Sprinkles in Newport (I think?) a few years ago...and from that day on I was hooked. Then I was  stoked when they opened in Scottsdale! Sometimes I go visit the husband at work just to stop by Sprinkles. I also had Sprinkles cupcakes at my wedding instead of a traditional cake and I couldnt be happier. I just love these cupcakes. I dont know what else to say. I have had A LOT of flavors but I really really love the Black and White. That is my most favorite/ go to cupcake. I have tried other cupcakes place and they are just...imposters.
