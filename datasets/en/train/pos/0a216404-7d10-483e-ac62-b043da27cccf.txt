Fab-u-lous! 

The architecture is amazing and the hotel and grounds are decorated perfectly for the holidays. The food is elegant, sophisticated, and perfectly done. The brunch buffet is beautiful and flavorful with a nice variety of cold items.

The brunch is pricey starting at at least $28 depending on which entree you select. The buffet is included in the price of your selected entree. The buffet on it's own is $30. Expensive, but well worth the price. 

It was a lovely treat for the holidays!
