they now definitely have FRESH fruits- kiwi, strawberry, raspberries, blueberries!  AND, they offer sorbets which are both gluten-free and dairy-free.  this is one of the FEW frozen yogurt places that my son (who's allergic to dairy, wheat, eggs and peanuts) can go to and enjoy "yogurt" with the whole family!!!
