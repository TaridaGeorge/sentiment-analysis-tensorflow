This place is huge, I wouldn't want to be there if a natural disaster struck - no one would be able to find an exit! I went yesterday to get hardware for my bed (which they give you for free!) and I used the bathroom...has anyone used their bathrooms lately? They have the COOLEST hand dryers!! I washed my hands twice...just so I could dry them again...Yes, I know: weird. But you have to try out the Ikea bathrooms if you are in the neighborhood! 

These are by far the best hand dryers I have ever used! Kudos to Ikea for their innovation and inspiring (yet cheap) furniture! Oh and their free hardware. :)
