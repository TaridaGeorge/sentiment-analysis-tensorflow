I went here this afternoon for underarm waxing.  I had never had it done before, so I was a bit nervous.  The woman at the front desk was very helpful and Laurie who did the waxing was great.  Very calming and friendly.  The place was clean and professional.  

It was a good experience, and I will definitely go back!
