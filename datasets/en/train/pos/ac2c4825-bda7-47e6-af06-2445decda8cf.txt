Another big thanks to Yelp & Groupon, which both lead us to Roka Akor for an early dinner last week. 

First off, the service was impeccable. The entire menu was explained perfectly & there was never a minute our waters were even close to being empty. 

Secondly, the food. The grilled pork belly is a fabulous starter. The dynamite scallop roll is hands-down the best sushi roll I've ever had in my life.  The yuzu miso marinated black cod was a fantastic piece of fish with great flavor. Essentially, we ordered everything marked with the 'Roka Akor' signature and didn't have one bite that wasn't delicious.

Pretty pricey, but totally worth it.
