My Sister and I were driving by hungry on a weeknight, saw this little booth filled place and went in.  The service was friendly, beautiful and efficient.  They make seriously delicious Thai tea, spring rolls and pumpkin curry.  The food came out with cloth bird of paradise fold napkins on fork stems and fun different coloured plates.  The dining room sported Asian style carved wood decor and an Asian song & dance show on the TV.  I'd recommend this place for take-out, casual meal or an intimate date.
