There's an Irish pub in California that used to be the home of my favorite burger.  That's no longer the case.  The BBQ Burger (upgrade to the organic, grass fed beef) with cheddar cheese, fresh coleslaw, and bbq sauce is the best burger I've ever eaten.  I split an order of fries with my hubs and they were fantastic.  The fries are cooked in a rice bran oil and turned out very crispy.  I can't wait to go back to this place.
