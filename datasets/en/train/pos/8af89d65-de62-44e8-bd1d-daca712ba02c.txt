You might see from my other reviews that I have long thought BoSa has the best donuts in the valley.  Well, I have tried Lamar's, and I think their donuts might be a little better.

The donuts at Lamar's are fresh and light and tasty.  The reviews indicated the selection is limited late morning,  but at 11:00 a.m. on a Wednesday they appeared to have just about everything in stock.  They keep primarily to the standards, for good reason.  They just make really good donuts.

Their one location in the NW valley isn't as convenient for me as BoSa's two locations, and they might be just a little more expensive.  But I vote their taste and selection just a little better.

So they get a 5-start rating, the same as BoSa.  If you go to either of these donut shops you won't be disappointed.
