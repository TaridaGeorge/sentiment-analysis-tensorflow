I love dogs. Kimpton loves dogs. I love Kimpton.

Great prices, fabulous style, pet-friendly, complimentary wine and coffee. Oh, and the water pressure doesn't suck either! :)

My question is, what is there NOT to love?

This is a great resort. I'd stay here whenever I am in AZ (which I hope to be a lot more -- especially in winter!)
