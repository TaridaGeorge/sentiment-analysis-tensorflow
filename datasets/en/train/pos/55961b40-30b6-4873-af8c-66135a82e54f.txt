I met Monsieur here for lunch today and I was so impressed with the new look.  I've always loved Houston's (now known as Hillstone's) and the food, service and decor have always been impeccable.

The only drawback with the new location is that you can easily pass it up and the lack of parking but otherwise, it is still a winner with the best filet mignon ever!!
