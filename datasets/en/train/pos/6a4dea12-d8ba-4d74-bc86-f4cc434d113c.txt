*UPDATE*
They got a new pastry chef in there that makes the most awesome cupcakes! Oh yeah, do yourself a favor and try the Red Velvet Cupcake.. killer, seriously! 

The first time I tried Willo many years back I was unimpressed as the bread was to doughy and heavy for my tastes. Well I recently tried Willo after having a horrible "funky monkey" and cibatta from another local bakery. This place has SO improved! I bought an olive loaf and was blown away by the open soft airy crumb to the chewy slightly crisp crust. Oh they have won me over!!!
