I come here to talk shit in Italian with Sal the owner.
And, get a haircut.
And, watch the ever liberal CNN news.

[CNN reporter]  "Apparently, the captain was the first off the ship as it began sinking, now back to you Wolf."

Me: What kind of a chicken shit puddle of piss is this guy....who does that? 

Sal:  Whatdyou meana  who doesa that? He wasa goin fora helpa. He goana coma righta backa.

Me: Ok, Sal, he was going for help. Rigggghhht. [office space]

Sal: Ahh..va fancoola

Me: mangia merde e morte

This place is one of the last bastions of Italian manhood I know.
I love Sal.
I hope he lives to a hundred.
I look like shit with these bangs.
