I love this place... I can't think of a better place to eat pizza in the valley... take that Pizzeria Bianco!!!!  

All of the pizza is great and the place has a great vibe.  If you are a fan of LGO and the Vig this is your place.  Try the mushroom or pepperoni pizza... 

I do have a word of warning... be careful when you make your own pizza since before i knew it i had made a $25 12 inch pizza... but that was because i misread the menu... opps
