My home away from home....seriously!  I used to eat here three times a week when I lived in AZ.  The owner/service is grrrrreat!!  They treat everyone like family :).   Definitely come here if you love sushi!  For larger parties and events, they also have Teppanyaki in the back room.  

Their menu is soooo reasonably priced and absolutely delcious!! My friends and I would come here before going out as well....can't pass up the $4 saki bomber specials...!!!!
