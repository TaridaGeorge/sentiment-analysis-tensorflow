Michael Mina's Scottsdale enterprise, order anything and you will be pleased.  The tuna, salmon, snapper, and steak are amazing.  The creamed corn side dish, is no ordinary creamed corn, and is not creamed at all.  The beignets come with Tongan vanilla crème brulée, Macallan 18 year butterscotch pudding and Valrhona dark chocolate pot de crème - unbelievable.
