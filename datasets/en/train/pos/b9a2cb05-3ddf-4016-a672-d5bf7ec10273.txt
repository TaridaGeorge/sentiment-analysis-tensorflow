OMG this place never fails to amaze me and tonight was no different.  Husband had beef medallions and shrimp scampi and 3 hours later is still talking about it.  I had the penne diavolo with chicken - yowza.  Unbelievable.  Everything, from the moment you sit down in this gorgeous place until you leave feeling oh so satisfied is an incredible experience.

I've been there several times and every time has been amazing.  Happy hour is incredible - $2.95 for shrimp and eggplant which is usually $12 and the most incredible dish that I actually had a dream about it.

Go.  You won't regret it!!!
