We stopped by here after a meeting with a business client:

What I liked:
- great teriyaki chicken sandwich!!! had it with a cherry Coke and seasoned fries!
-coworker had a sandwich, easily substituted with veggie patty, very helpful.
-great server, very friendly, she referred to us as "big wigs", probably cuz I was wearing a sportcoat.

Reminds me of Mel's or Ruby's, but larger menu. Would definitely come back here, the fries are addictive!!!
