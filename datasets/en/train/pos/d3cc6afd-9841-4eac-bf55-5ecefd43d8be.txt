The only thing I can rate is the frozen custard.. I don't know anything about the other food they serve here.  It started with one scoop of vanilla custard in a dish everyday for a week.  Then, I started to crave it more and got 2 scoops... this stuff is so tasty.  I like vanilla better than chocolate and I am not interested in the flavor of the day.  I have been trying to "break the habit" of eating this stuff so finally one day I asked for a nutrition guide... turns out 1 scoop of this bliss has 308 calories (more than haagen daas).. so 2 scoops is equivalent to a one hour run... just to put it in perspective.. If you don't care about calories, this  stuff is sweet bliss in a dish!!!
