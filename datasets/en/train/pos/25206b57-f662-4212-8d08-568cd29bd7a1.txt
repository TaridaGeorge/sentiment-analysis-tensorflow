This restaurant is absolutely amazing!  You can't get any more authentic italian than this.  All the ingredients are fresh and the pasta is made in house.  The wines, which are imported directly from Italy, pair perfectly with the chef's delectible dishes.  The sea food is prepared with superiority.  I have only had the dishes with clams or shrimp, but all were equally excellent.  The decor is sharp and elegant, and the lighting is soft and romantic.  A great date place!
