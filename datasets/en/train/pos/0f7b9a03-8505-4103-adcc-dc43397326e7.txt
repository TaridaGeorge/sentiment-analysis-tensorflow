Please note that they are now at 425 Western Avenue in Avondale (between central & litchfield next to the post office)  We stopped by right before they had to move out of the Buckeye location and learned they were moving closer to our Goodyear home.  It was also mentioned in the WV View - but it would be easy to miss the move and it would be no fun to drive out to buckeye and see an empty building.

Very enjoyable place.  The owners/workers are friendly and the food is worth craving.

I love the Arizona with their hotter sauce.  I agree the samplers & deserts are a great way to try it out.  Don't sleep on their soups either which are solid.

Haven't tried their quesadillas yet though.

Glad they are a little closer - although my wallet & arteries may not appreciate it.
