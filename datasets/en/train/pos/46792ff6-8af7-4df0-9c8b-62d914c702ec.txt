I loved this place! It was a little dead but we did go on a Monday night. Their selection of red wines was great. They have one of the best sangrias I've ever had. My sandwich was great & my husband loved his spicy pepperoni pizza. Great service & cute atmopshere w/ couches & paintings. Stop by & give them a try :)
