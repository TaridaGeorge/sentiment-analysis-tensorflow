From my initial contact with this company they were so responsive and answered all of my questions. Kyle came out and gave an estimate, of course I wanted to check pricing at other places and everything was right around the same price, I found some that would have saved me $100 but it wasn't worth it, because they couldn't even tell me where they get their grass from. 

So needless to say we loved the service and our grass looks great! This is a company that will be around for a long time because they treat their customers great! I never once felt that my job was too small for them, it was a wonderful experience and just to think I never have to cut grass ever again is all worth it!
