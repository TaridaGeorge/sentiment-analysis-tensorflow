A rare treat . . . the new weekend only breakfast at Boulders On Broadway . . . 9am-Noon.  A small menu, but interestingly thought out.  They need to get it up on their website and highlight it!

I'll be back to try the others . . . the Chuck Norris looks good, and I've heard evangelical things about something involving a hot dog . . .  but I've had the Arizona French Toast. Longboards of french toast baugette with candied jalepenos, powdered sugar.  Comes with AZ honey, but I got syrup instead, and added a side of bacon.  Add Four Peaks Brewery's Hop Knot IPA in a frozen glass. Fantastic. The candied jalepenos . . . sweet with plenty of heat, seems wrong but it was SO right . . . I believe I'm ruined for any other french toast
