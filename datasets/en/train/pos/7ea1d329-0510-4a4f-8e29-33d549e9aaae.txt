This is a fantastic coffee shop.  There are tons of comfy couches and chairs, as well as tables to choose from.   The live music on Friday and Saturday nights is great.  The staff is very friendly and super accommodating.  Plus, they have worked out a deal with Harkins to allow patrons to take their Elevate beverage into the theater!
