Just what the doctor ordered: Tom Ka Gai and Drunken Dragon Noodles (both Thai hot). I ordered take-out since I've been home sick with a cold. My food was ready in 15 minutes flat. Both dishes were yummy, and my taste buds (as well as my sinuses) are thanking me. I've also tried the Crispy Basil Chicken and the Chicken Panang, which were good, but the Tom Ka Gai and Drunken Dragon Noodles will be my go-to order from now on.
