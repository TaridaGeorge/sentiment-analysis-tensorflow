Wow! This place is great, and in such an unexpected location.  I work over here, and I am thrilled to find a great place to each lunch.  Working on the West side means not many lunch choices for sure.  I called in my order of a pepperoni pizza.  When I arrived, I was greeted with smiles, hellos, offered water and tea.  I actually got to watch them make my pizza.  I was concerned at first thinking, I called this in, why isn't it done, but it only took five minutes to make.  They use fresh dough, fresh homemade sauce, and using the pizza oven took no more than five minutes.
I will be back here many times for sure....totally impressed.
