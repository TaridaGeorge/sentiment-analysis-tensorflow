Best Happy Hour in town! $6 burgers (cooked the way YOU order them, I prefer med rare) seared ahi salad, carpaccio, bbq shrimp etc. AND $6 cocktails and wine! You cannot beat the quality for the price for happy hour, must sit in the bar or patio however. Steak and sides are all delicious! LOVE this place!!!
