"A Beauty Apothecary": Luxury Cosmetics, Skin Care, Bath + Body, Makeup Services, Brows, Eyelash extensions...

I ventured into this tiny Beauty Apothecary some time ago, and fell in love with this small boutique.  It is a one of a kind here in Scottsdale and carries lines such as Kevin Aucoin...I like going there because I have finally found a GREAT aesthetician...her name is Leah Alvarez and I highly recommend her for any waxing services (especially the brow!) she also provides facials and other services. 

The Glam Lounge as provides makeup services buy Andrea...she is genius when doing makeup!

I highly recommend this Beauty Apothecary boutique for any of the ladies out there!
