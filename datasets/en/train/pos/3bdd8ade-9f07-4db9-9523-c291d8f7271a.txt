I love Thai food and this place serves the best that I've had in The Valley. It's in an unassuming strip mall in Mesa and doesn't look like much from the exterior. Even the decor on the inside is something to be desired, but the food is amazing. I highly recommend the Hawaiian Delight or the Egg Plant Basil, and my friend says the yellow curry dish is the best of the curry selections. I always go with a level 2 spiciness, which gives the food great flavor and enough spice to give you the sniffles. Their iced tea is really spectacular as well. I'm not sure what they do to it but it's great. If you're in the mood for some authentic, delicious, and flavorful Thai food this is a can't miss.
