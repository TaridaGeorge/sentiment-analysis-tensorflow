Excellent, excellent beers, food, and service.  Great location.  Great crowd.  We had just a snack(wings) and the beer sampler.  I liked the Stout the best, but the Kiltlifter was pretty good as well.  Good for people watching and just wasting away a lazy afternoon.  I hope to be able to go back soon.
