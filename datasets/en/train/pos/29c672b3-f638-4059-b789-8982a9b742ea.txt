Wonderful! Love this place! The food was great; we had skewered chicken with rice. I had the greek salad and B had the greek fries; both were super tasty! The service was mediocre, but they were nice and the food made up for it. The prices were low, and that was a surprise considering that the portions were huge! We will go back as many times as we can!
