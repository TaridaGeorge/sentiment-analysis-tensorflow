This is my kind of restaurant. I love everything about Buca di Beppo!

I am fascinated by how this place was decorated. All the walls and various trinkets make this a fun dining experience. 

One thing to note is that it can be kind of expensive to eat here, although I am always finding coupons for this restaurant so that helps!

Beyond that the food is awesome! I go with my fiance and we love the calamari and the garlic bread, which we always get as appetizers. We switch up the main course when we go, but each time has had great results. We had dessert here once too and that was also good! We usually end up with leftovers, because they give huge portions, which we love. I can't wait to come again!
