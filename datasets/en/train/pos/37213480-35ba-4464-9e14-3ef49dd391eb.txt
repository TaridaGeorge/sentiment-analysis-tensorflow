Truly great customer service- from an auto parts store! I came in looking for a new battery, and I was in and out in less than twenty minutes. Michael even put the battery in my car for me!! He was very nice, and genuine- I will go back just to support honest people like him. They were very organized at this location in general. I will be back.
