We find ourselves here most Saturdays for a big bowl of teriyaki chicken with brown rice and all white chicken meat. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly, and the food is delicious.  The restroom could use some updating but it's in an older strip mall so sort of expected. They take phone orders as well.
