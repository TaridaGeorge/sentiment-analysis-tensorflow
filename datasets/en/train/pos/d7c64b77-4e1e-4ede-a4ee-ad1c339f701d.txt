The most Amazing Croissants I've had outside of Paris. My husband and enjoyed omlettes with croissants.  We shared a Chocolate Croissant with coffee and savored every bite. I bought 2 more Chocolate Croissants to bring home for my daughters. Authentic French pastries and the staff is very kind. The best part, no wait or noisy crowds on a Saturday morning. This place is definitely a treasure worth every penny. We'll be back for more yummy French cuisine. Come and taste for yourself!
