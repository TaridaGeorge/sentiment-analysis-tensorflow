We had the most amazing dinner and the staff was friendly, helpful and attentive.  They recommended their favorite dishes and did not dissapoint.  The butterfish appetizer was delicious.  Try something off the Robata grill and you definitely have to try to the grilled sweet corn with butter and soy.
