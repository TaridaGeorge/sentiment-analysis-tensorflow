LOVE THIS PLACE!  ...Excellent food & even better...excellent service!  ...On 10/18/2010, Mon night, we had dinner here. I ordered the Grilled Salmon with Brown Rice.  It was only lukewarm, and I like my food hot.  I told the waiter & his apologized & they cooked me a brand,new one that was fresh & hot. He gave me another salad on the House to eat while I was waiting for the 2nd one. ...But wait, it gets better... He totally took it off the bill!  ...I didn't have to pay for my dinner!  How cool is that?  This is one of our favorite places to eat for sure!  This is a quint little place to eat, decorated very nicely. It can get somewhat noisy in there, but the food & service makes it worth it!   :)
