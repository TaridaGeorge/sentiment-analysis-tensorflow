Stopped in for breakfast on a Tuesday. Regina the owner greeted us with a smile. I ordered chicken and waffles and my buddy had biscuits and gravy. They were both awesome. Regina's partner chatted with us about college football for a while. I would def go back. Food was great and the atmosphere was excellent.
