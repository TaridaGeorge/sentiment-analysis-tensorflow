closest location to my home unfortunately but Port of Sub's is the best out of the fast food sub shops.  The inexpedience is everything and you can tell they're fresh.  I love the peppered pastrami and swiss on wheat with crack (mayo mustard mixed), lettuce, tomato, onion, & jalapenos, Oh my!  You cant ever go wrong here with any of the sandwiches.  This location gets super busy at lunch FYI, since it is near the air park.
