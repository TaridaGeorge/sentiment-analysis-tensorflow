Great vibe! I was there on a Tuesday--- the first time I have been since the bar has changed owners. First of all, it was packed on both sides-- a good sign that this spot will make it. 

Posh crowd in the typical downtown Phoenix fashion. Food took a little while to come out but the meals were great! I had grilled chicken and veggies on skewers-- amazing flavor! I will definitely be back. 

++Great beer selection as well.
