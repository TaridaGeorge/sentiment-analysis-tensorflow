Chicken + Waffles = food coma.

I ordered the Lo Los which is 2 waffles and 3 pieces of fried chicken. It's really unhealthy but this is some good comfort food. The fried chicken here is the best fried chicken I've ever tasted. The waffles are good and everything wasn't that greasy and I skipped the butter. Those SNL guys should have said "Fried Chicken + waffles = crazy delicious." 

I did order the mac and cheese but to me it's the same everywhere else. I must say it should be recommend you burn 5000 calories before and after going.
