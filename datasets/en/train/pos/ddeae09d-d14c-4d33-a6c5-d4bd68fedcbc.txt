Jessica is the best aesthetician you will ever meet. She cares about your skin, and how you are treating yourself. If she makes sure it is as important to you as it is to her. All my facials or eyebrow appointments are so professional. Jess will work with you to make sure you are getting the kind of care and service you want. I have not tried a massage at Glow, but I would love to. I would start with an organic facial. They are so relaxing and refreshing.
