I was staying at Sheraton during the summer and it was scorching outside. One day I went for drinks during happy hour and got a couple of sangrias $5/ea and BBQ pork sliders $4. Sangria was made on the spot and it was good and refreshing. Sliders were also good with a thin apple slice in them which made it interesting but good.

Another day I went for lunch and got the $16 ny steak with fries. Steak was 3-in thick petite cut, medium rare, topped with grilled onions and sauce. The steak hit the spot.

So, I enjoyed my dining exPerience at this classy yet comfy place. I was in shorts and t-shirts since I was here for volleyball festival.
