I Tell EVERYONE to go here.  I've never had a bad massage, facial or bikini wax here.  The people here are always super nice and polite and the services never lack in anything.  It's so convenient if you have to be at the mall and run errands and then make some down time too...I don't go anywhere else for my massages or facials and recommend this place to anyone who enjoys relaxing.
