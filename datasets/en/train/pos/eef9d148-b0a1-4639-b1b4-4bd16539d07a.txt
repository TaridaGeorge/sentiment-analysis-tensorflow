It was Friday and we didn't feel like going out.  Pizza you say?  Great, let's either fly to Chicago or get it delivered.  Been searching for good pizza since we moved to midtown.  We decided to try something new ... Pino's came to mind because of all the great reviews on Yelp.  I called and they told me they don't deliver after 2:00 p.m.  : (
So I folded and said OK we'll pick it up.  In a nutshell OUR PIZZA WAS AWESOME!  Now I know why they don't deliver after 2:00 p.m. (they don't have to).  We ordered sausage and mushroom pizza.  So good.  Crust was incredible.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers.  Parking can be an issue but it wasn't that bad once you know the drill.  I'll be seeing you again soon Pino.  You're my new best friend.
