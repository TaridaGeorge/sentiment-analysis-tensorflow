Lenny's: A little hole in the wall in Old Town Glendale that serves awesome burgers, fries and shakes.  There's a reason why walls are covered with "best of" awards, it's because their burgers are that good.  They have probably one of the best burgers around and on top of that the meals are cheap, menu plentiful and the food is all-around good.  

I HIGHLY recommend this place.
