I needed 750 college graduation programs printed at the last minute and was shocked by what the other companies were quoting. In addition, many other companies would not take the project due to the time constraints.

After sending the proof, I noticed I had made a spelling error!! I was panicked to say the least.  I called and spoke with them and it was easy to correct.  

Short Run not only was able to complete my project ON TIME, but it was also beautiful and at a fraction of the cost other printers quoted us.  My programs were printed, trimmed, folded and saddle stitched in ONE DAY!

Thank you Jerod for your hard work and patience with us :-)

You are lifesavers Short Run Printing!
