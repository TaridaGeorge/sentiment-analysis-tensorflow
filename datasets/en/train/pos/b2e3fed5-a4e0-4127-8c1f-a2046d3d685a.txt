The listing in YELP for this great business is wrong.  They are currently at 26224 N Tatum Blvd Ste 1, Phoenix, AZ 85050.

Excellent and empathetic staff that understands how children react to illness as well as the needs of working families on the go.  They have great hours and are open on SATURDAY too.  Dr. Horlick is a great doc and I'm thrilled with her.
