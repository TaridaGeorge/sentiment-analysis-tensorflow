I have really enjoyed getting to know Stephen and Getz Better Acupuncture! I am an active runner and about a year ago I was having pain in my IT band and knees, so much so that I had to stop running altogether. I was very disheartened but did no wan to visit a "traditional" doctor because I knew they would either tell me to stop running or medicate me; neither those were acceptable options for me. So I did some research and found Stephen; what a blessing, within in a few weeks he had cleared up all my problems and I was back running, even competing in 3 half marathons in the last year! Getz Better is a great place to heal both your body and mind!
