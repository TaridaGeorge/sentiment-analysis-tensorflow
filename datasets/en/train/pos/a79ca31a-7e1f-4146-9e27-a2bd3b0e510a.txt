We moved into the neighborhood about 1.5 years ago and part of the reason I loved it was because of the dog park, even though we didn't have a dog. Now we do and we love going there when it's not too hot outside! The people I've met are friendly and my dog has made a lot of dog friends there. I've never noticed it being dirty, I feel like everyone I've seen has picked up after their pets. There's also a fenced in area which is nice. The park is large, I like to run around with my dog there too!
