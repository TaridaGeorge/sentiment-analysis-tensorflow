I love this Farmer's Market, the vendors are nice, the produce is fresh, they have a variety of things, fruits, salts, vegetables, meat, seafood, cheese, tea, bread, pita's, desserts, popsicles, food trucks, a farm, face painters. I go often and I LOVE it.

I used to live in the SF Bay Area, and then in Boston, MA, this market is not like those markets, it's really, really small, but is good for its size and has lots of potential to grow, as more people start coming to this market.
