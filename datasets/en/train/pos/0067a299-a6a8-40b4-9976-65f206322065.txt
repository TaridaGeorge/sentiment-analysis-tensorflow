If you cant get down with fresh made Italian bread, hand cut meat, evoo, creamy mozzarella, and some spices then stay away from Calabria because that means more for me. 
Owned by a very sweet Italian couple this is a lowkey downtown lunch spot that has never disappointed me. They are by no means a full service grocery but do have sparse but unique grocery items that you wont find at your neighborhood Fry's.  I have mainly stuck with the Caprese sandwich in the past but sometimes i get crazy and add salami or prosciutto.  Can't vouch for the pasta other than that it is made on site, seriously though who needs pasta for lunch anyways, it is a deli, nuff said.
