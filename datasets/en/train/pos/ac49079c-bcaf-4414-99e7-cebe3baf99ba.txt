I took my Acura TL to this Firestone store for a tire rotation and oil change. The tires were in need of replacement, largely due to worn struts. They gave me an estimate to replace 4 struts and 4 new tires. When replacing the struts it would also need a alignment. I told them to do only the oil change, and, I would get back to them about the additional work. I found coupons on Firestone.com for $10.00 off on the oil change, and, 20% off repairs. After bidding the struts/tires and alignment out with several other repair shops...Firestone was the BEST price. I found their work to be professional and complete. I dealt with store manager Tim Hurst who was extremely knowledgeable and professional. I would definitely recommend this location, and, certainly will return...Thanks Firestone. Art M
