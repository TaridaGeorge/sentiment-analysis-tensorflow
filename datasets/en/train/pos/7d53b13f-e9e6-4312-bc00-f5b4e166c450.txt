Wow wow wow! I was waiting for a movie at Camelview with a friend and we wanted a place to hang out for a while, so I found this place on Yelp about a week after it had opened. I am personally a sucker for fancy designs in my latte foam, but the coffee at Echo is delicious as well as pretty. Even better is the ambience. The music is perfect-- mellow indie tunes at just the right volume for studying or socializing (so many coffee shops don't get this right!). The staff were all very friendly and my barista was eager to help me select the perfect drink. Anyway, if I lived closer I'm sure I would patronize this place at least a few times a week. As it is, I try to stop by whenever I'm in the area.
