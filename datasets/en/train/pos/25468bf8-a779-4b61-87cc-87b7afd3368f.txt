I love you Cheba, I want to make love to you like when Kumar made love to that giant ass bag of weed in Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle. Anyway to get away from that, I love my Griefo with its pepper jack, hemp cream cheese, guacamole, sprouts, lettuce, black olives, onions, mushrooms, cucumbers, pickles, & tomatoes. You can really taste that tasty hemp. Bonus to some of the cute, white guys working there. However, the guy working the register was irritatingly slow. Like snail slow, taking forever to complete an order. It made me wonder what was making him so relaxed...
