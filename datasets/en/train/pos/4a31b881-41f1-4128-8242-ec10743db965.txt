Been here for Pavillion's car show before.  GREAT Mongolian.  Love the recipes feature, love the atmosphere, cleanliness, the workers, the food is amazing and so filling, you always take home leftovers which are always great.  Definately a great place to eat.  Be sure to try the wheat noodles and the brown rice.  Their sauces are SO good whether you follow the recipes or not.   It's nice to have the wheat-based options too.
