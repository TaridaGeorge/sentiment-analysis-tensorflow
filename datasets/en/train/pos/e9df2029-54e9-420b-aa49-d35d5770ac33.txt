My husband and I came for the Sushi Master class on Saturday afternoon and left not only knowledgeable, but fat and happy. Class started with mojitos and continued with sake and Japanese beer as we snacked on edamame and calamari and we learned about fileting fish, different types of sushi and sashimi and eventually made our own. We prepared our own butterfish tetaki and California rolls and were served various other sushi and sashimi prepared by the chefs throughout the afternoon. When taking this class DO NOT plan on making dinner plans after because you will be to stuffed to move, let alone eat anything else. Not only is the class a great value for the money but it's a lot of fun and you really learn something new and unique. Roka Akor, you've done it again.
