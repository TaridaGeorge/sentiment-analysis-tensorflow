Let's see:  I've been here two days in a row and I really really like it!! 

Pho with brisket is super yummy AND the eggrolls are delicious!  The broth is just the way I like it:  mild and not too pungent because I like to add the hot & hoisin sauce to my liking.  It's a perfect lunch especially on a cold rainy day.      

What a treat to have Saigon Nites in north Scottsdale.  It's truly a gem hidden in one of the most obscure centers, the food is good, and the service is excellent.  They took a chance to offer exotic cuisine in NoSco and I hope people try it out b/c it was pretty much empty when I was there both times.  I highly recommend it!!
