The Film Bar is a one-of-a-kind venue here in Phoenix. The atmosphere is low-key and layout is perfect for happy hour, parties, and for seeing great independent and foreign films. I'm so glad I found this place. It is always an enjoyable experience. I love the ambiance they've created in their space.
