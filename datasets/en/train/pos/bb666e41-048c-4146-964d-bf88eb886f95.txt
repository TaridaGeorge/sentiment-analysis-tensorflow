We try to get to Durant's every couple of months...and needless to say have NEVER been disappointed.  Tonight was the 12 oz Filet and Crab Cakes (which we shared) and of course several Manhattans.  Finished the evening off with the a cappuccino and  the chocolate brownie pie...delicous.

So, if you live in the Phoenix area or are visitilng and want a fantastic steak and old world charm...check it out, you will not be disappointed.

Don't forget...park out back and enter through the kitchen.
