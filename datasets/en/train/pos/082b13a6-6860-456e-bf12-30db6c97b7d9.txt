i love this place based on their outstanding tea lattes, especially the tropical passion tea latte. i've never had the coffee, so i can't speak about it but their tea lattes are absolutely delicious. they have tons of flavors, and the teas are definitely better than tazo. each and every tea can be made over ice, whereas starbucks can only do a few specific teas over ice unless you want to wait for them to brew one specifically for you.

they are extremely friendly and welcoming, and they've never gotten my drink wrong. not once. i'm so glad they have a location in chandler and at tempe marketplace, but i wish the ones out east were still open. :(
