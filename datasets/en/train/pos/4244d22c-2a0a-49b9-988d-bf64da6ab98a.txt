This place is EXACTLY what we were looking for.  Great ambiance, friendly service, and delicious food!!  We shared the baked goat cheese appetizer, which was soooo decadent.  My husband had the cioppino stew and said it had incredible flavor.  I had the forbidden (but not tonight) rice, a really exotic and fresh dish.  (Lots of vegetarian options here.)  We usually skip dessert, but since we were having such a great time we splurged for the turtle of amazingness.  
Loved it, and we'll definitely be back, hopefully during happy hour to try out some of the specialty drinks that seemed a little spendy at full price ($9).
