Love this spot - it's pretty close to the convention center so Natalie and I went here to check it out. The bacon is awesome here!

Their philosophy is great too - local, organic, etc. etc.  The place is tiny and quaint too and as always it's great to support a local independent business.  

Best breakfast in Phoenix that i've had and definitely one of my fave spots - went there the next day too - got the special and it was delish - check my photos to see what we got!
