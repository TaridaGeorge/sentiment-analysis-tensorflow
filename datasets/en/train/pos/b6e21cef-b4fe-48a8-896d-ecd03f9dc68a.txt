Scandalesque is definitely as good as it gets for burlesque in AZ!  I've seen these women progress their talent for the past 6 years and they never cease to impress me.  Been following them from every venue since Paper Heart Gallery in 05'.  I recommend this show to all of my friends and family who are wanting something lavishly exciting to watch.  Are you looking for an awesome quality show? Want to see incredible synchronized trapeze performers, hear beautifully talented singers, and watch sexy feather fan dancers?  Check out Scandalesque folks---they are what's best in the entertainment biz and will not disappoint you!  See you at the next show!
