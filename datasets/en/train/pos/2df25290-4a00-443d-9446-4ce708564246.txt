This place is to burgers what chipotle is to burritos, a little bit better than their true fast food counterparts. The staff I encountered was very nice and they bring the food out to you, clean up after you, and are very very friendly. 

I tried their new Buffalo Smashchicken with Sweet Potato Smashfries. Both were excellent and I would return here before I ran off to Arbys, Five Guys, etc. Pricing was very fair at $8.75 for a sandwich and fries.
