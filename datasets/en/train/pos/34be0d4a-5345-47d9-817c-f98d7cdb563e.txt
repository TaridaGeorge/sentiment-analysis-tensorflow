I walked about 2 1/2  miles to the Cartel Coffee Lab for my morning exercise, based upon the high ratings. And I found the high ratings are well deserved. Coffee was great, staff was pleasant, and there seemed to be a group of friendly regulars stopping by and staying to study.

The barista asked, when I ordered my black drip coffee, if I liked a lemon aftertaste. I took a chance and said yes; I think she chose my beans based upon that question. The coffee was great.
