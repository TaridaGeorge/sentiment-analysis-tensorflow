DE-LICIOUS! 
SOOOOO worth the trouble of finding a parking spot. The parking is a bit tight. But one you're in, you may not want to leave. It's hard to find truly tasty healthy vegan food. I had the most tasty Thai Peanut veggies w/mock chicken. SOOOO good. And 
I had to try the crab puffs.....an acquired taste...but still pretty good. $15 with drink left me happy to know I ate super yummy "greens". 
Then after wards, I had to go next door to Nami and try a vegan cupcake....and take one or two home to my daughter. So nice to find a place that uses alt to dairy. Blah! 

Go try out Green. You'll become addicted.
