i love me some pita jungle!! love that there is also a location downtown by my place of lovely employment :)

you will find everything you would at all the other locations, the jalapeno hummus is awesome !

just a tip *** if you are ordering and you only have an hr for lunch i HIGHLY suggest calling in and ordering for pick up. this location being downtown is always hectic!

p.s met the Mayor of Phoenix here on a lunch time run.. good to know he enjoys a good plate of hummus ;)
