Body Beloved was the best facial I ever had. The atmosphere was warm and welcoming. My skin feels like it got the best detox ever!!!. I left there feeling more relaxed than I have in a long time. My face was glowing. I went directly out since my skin looked so amazing. Cara is kind and professional and will treat you like a queen or king!! It is a must for anyone looking to spoil themselves for a day.
