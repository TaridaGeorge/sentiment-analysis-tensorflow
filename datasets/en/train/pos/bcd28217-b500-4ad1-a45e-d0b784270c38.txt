I have been stopping by this establishment every week for the last 3 months. They are very kind and helpful. They are perfectly attentive to your needs and the food is wonderful.

If you go at lunch you will be pleasantly surprised. They offer a lunch combo that starts you off with either egg drop soup or hot & sour. If you ask for wonton its available for a small upcharge. Then on to the wonton chips with spicy mustard and sweet sauce. Then you plate arrives with just the right sized entree, rice, egg roll and crab puff stuffed with actual crab! What a concept!

Treat yourself, I do!!!!!!  By the way, all of that for under 10 bucks....
