Sick of standing in line for an hour to check your bag and get your ticket?  Tired of the super long lines at security, or having to park 3 miles away and take a shuttle to the terminal?  The old Williamsfield Airport might be for you.  Although they don't fly *everywhere* they do have a pretty solid lineup of destinations, many to smaller airports that require connecting flights from most other airports (like sky harbor!)
Check them out, if you are going to rent a car anyway, if they fly within an hour drive time of your destination you will be time (and probably money) ahead to fly with them.  Don't plan on free... well anything... from this airline.  They are based out of Vegas, so that should give you some idea--they'll make a buck anywhere they can.  Try to carry on, and bring snacks with you!
