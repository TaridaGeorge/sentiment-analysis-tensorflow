I am updating my previous review after recently attending the Farm Sanctuary charity event. Inside the Bungalow generously donated their beautiful backyard facilities and yoga studio for this benefit. There appeared to be more than ~100 people there and the staff remained incredibly laid back and warm while having two functions going on at once (Oktoberfest out front and Farm Sanctuary benefit in the back).  I am a fan of the shop for food, yoga, and massage and now I can see why people come here for events. It is charming and the people are wonderful to work with!
