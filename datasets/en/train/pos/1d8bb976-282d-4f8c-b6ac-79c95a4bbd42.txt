This place is amazing.  We've enjoyed everything we've ever ordered from here.  Great ribs and hot links!  Their homemade french fries are very good and the catfish (they just added to the menu) is the best I've ever had.  They do have a couple of tables but the seating isn't very inviting.  The employees are friendly and the food is addictive.  On the pricey side, considering the low rent district & the fact that they are predominantly take out, but worth every penny.
