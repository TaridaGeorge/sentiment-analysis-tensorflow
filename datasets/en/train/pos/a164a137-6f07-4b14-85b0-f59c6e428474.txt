I love this place, i've gotten a lot of people who aren't vegetarian to come here and they love it too.

The soy chicken delight and kung pao chicken are my favorite. Their desserts are extremely yummy and their drinks are really great too. Try the mint lemonade or the thai ice tea. 

It can be hard being vegetarian and having the option to eat anything but veggie sandwiches and burgers, pasta or pizza when going out. This place is consistent with their food and the owners are extremely friendly.

Even if you aren't vegan or vegetarian the food tastes great and is definitely worth trying out.
