I've been at this location since it was opened and I must say this past weekend, I think I experienced the best service!  The Asian Chicken Salad -awesome!  Two people can eat this salad it's so BIG!  I was there twice this weekend, I also had a chicken sandwich which was great and fullfilling.  The waitress remembered what we drank so that was great.  I was with a large group of people and the staff at Majerle's took care of everyone really well.    The Strawberry Fields Salad looks really good as well, yumm!!!
