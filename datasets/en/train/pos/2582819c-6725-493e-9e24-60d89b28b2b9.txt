I'm always afraid that a restaurant like this won't live up to the hype, but Cork exceeded my expectations. Three of us had the five-course tasting menu, and we loved every course. The bruleed foie gras was amazing, as was the coconut-carrot soup, gnocchi with mushroom sauce, salmon, mussels, scallops, pork belly, beef, a deconstructed BLT, all of them delicious and beautifully presented. Not to mention the creamiest creme brulee ever. The kitchen responded carefully to our likes and dislikes. Service and timing were perfect. The experience was a real treat, can't wait to pay another visit.
