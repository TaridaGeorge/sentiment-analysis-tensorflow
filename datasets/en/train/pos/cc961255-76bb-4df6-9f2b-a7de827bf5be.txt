This place is everything you'd ever want from a mom-and-pop eatery. My husband and I are HUGE fans of the gluten-free pitas, and I buy their fresh blocks of feta when I'm doing my own Mediterranean home-cookin'. The food is TO DIE FOR (I always indulge in a rice pudding on my way out!) and the people are so sweet and nice! This place has easily become one of my favorite spots. Don't forget to try the lemonade!
