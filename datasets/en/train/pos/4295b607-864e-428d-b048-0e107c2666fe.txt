Wonderful service, wonderful atmosphere, wonderful food.

I've seen the sign so many times but never had a reason to go. It's so close to my apartment so my neighbor and I went on a random Wednesday night. Classic Italian Pizza is tucked away in the back of an old shopping center. It's cozy inside with huge amoirs of wine in the corner, a large brick backdrop behind the bar and plenty of intimate seating for all sizes of groups. The patio is vacant so we sat there.

Orded the Reisling (so good!), the asparugous & prosuctoo and the Greek pizza. Our watiress was so kind and gave us lots of suggestions. She checked up on us and seemed genuinely interested in making sure we were enjoying ourselves.

Everything we ate was MAGICAL. It was orgasmic good.

I cannot wait to go back here.
