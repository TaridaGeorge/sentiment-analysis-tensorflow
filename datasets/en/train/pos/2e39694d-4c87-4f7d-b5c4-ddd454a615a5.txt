This bar is straight up awesome. I've been coming here (exclusively nights) for the past two years, and it's always a good time. The drink specials are great almost any day of the week, bar food is good (best wings around, get them on Tuesdays for $2 off), and the service staff is full of funny and professional people. This location is also by far better than the one by campus; it's populated by tons of cool regulars rather than unruly college students. Come by tonight!
