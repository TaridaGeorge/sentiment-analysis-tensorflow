The food at Yellowtail is great! I love that they serve not only sushi but also Chinese food, tepenyaki, and even American food.  They also have a great kids menu. Basically the whole family can go there even if some aren't sushi lovers.  Everything we've tried is delicious! The service there is friendly and helpful. The food comes out fast and they always make sure you are doing okay.  They also have a good Happy Hour menu with a lot of variety and $2 draft beer.   My whole family definitely recommends Yellowtail!
