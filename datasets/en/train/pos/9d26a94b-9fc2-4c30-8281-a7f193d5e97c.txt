I love this place!! I eat right next door to it about once a week and always stop by and pick up a new book. I love the racks they have outside and randomly selecting a book by an author I've never heard of and giving it a whirl. Sometimes you win, sometimes you don't but it is fun. One time, I gave my snake some beer; he was slithering this way and that MAN!!
