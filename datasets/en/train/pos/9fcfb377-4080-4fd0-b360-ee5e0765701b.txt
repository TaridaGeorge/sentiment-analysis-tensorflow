Since a friend of mine took me there a couple weeks ago, I've gone back 4 times. The atmosphere is unique, with outdoor picnic-style seating. I didn't have difficulty in finding a place to sit down during their crowded lunch time (11-3), and everyone is cordial enough.
I agree with everyone here about the Mozzarella/tomato/basil sandwich being the best. As a meat lover, I also like their Soppressata sandwich (with aged provolone and roasted peppers).
And there's Lux cafe right next door. Top notch sandwich place!
