The Valley Ho is such an awesome place to hang out and people watch.  My favorite spot is by the fireplace in the lobby...check out the flaming crystal rocks...cool.  It's fine to throw ice on them (i was not even drunk).  

The drinks are great and the service is also excellent...a little slow but to be expected when it's super busy.  

They have the best mac and cheese, so be sure order it if you want true comfort food.  My favorite drink is the Stardust.  

I have not been to the spa yet but I am familiar with the products they use and they rock.  I can't wait to try it!
