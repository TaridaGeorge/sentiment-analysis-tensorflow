I love the University location. It's nice and snug and always full.  They have great variety of food and it always tastes great!  I crave i pretty often.  I will miss it when i move to California.  My favorite dish is the beef Thai Basil signature dish.  They have great lunch specials and everyone that works there is always very nice.  Never any complaints from me.
