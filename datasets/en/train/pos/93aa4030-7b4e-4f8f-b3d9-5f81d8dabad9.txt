Baked and Steamed Manapua!!!  My wife and I have made it a habit of going for Pho at Unphogettable, and stopping by here for dessert.  She usually gets the Peanut butter Chocolate roll, and I get the honey bbq pork Manapua.  It's funny how the little things in life turn in to some of the most pleasurable.  These guys are doing it right, and in my mind are leading the baked goods charge in AZ.
