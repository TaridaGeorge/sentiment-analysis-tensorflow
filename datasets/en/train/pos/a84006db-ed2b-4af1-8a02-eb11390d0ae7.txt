I love Hug N Pups! I had taken my lil 3 lb Maltese here for about 2 years but then we moved so I had to find a new place to get her groomed. I went to about 4 other places & none of them even compared. Thankfully we moved again & were closer to Hug N Pups! These are different owners from the last time I brought Angel in but they are just as great! 

BTW, they have moved as well, not too far though just across the street. The new address is: 1609 E Bell Rd Suite B9 Phoenix, AZ 85022. Their phone # is still the same.

Even if we do have to move again I will still bring my babygirl here because they are amazing at what they do, LOVE HUG N PUPS!!
