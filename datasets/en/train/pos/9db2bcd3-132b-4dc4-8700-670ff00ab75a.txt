I say my shoes are too narrow in the toes. He says he can stretch them over 2 days, $7 a pair. I tell him I don't have 2 days, he says I can buy a shoe stretcher and do it at home, $23.99 each. I tell him the top edge of the heel also digs in - he reaches over and hands me a little plastic baggy, charges me $5.99 and *poof*! No more heel pain, no more tight toes. WTF. Shoe whisperer, I'm TELLING you!
