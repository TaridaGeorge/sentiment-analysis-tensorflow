This place is great, too bad it's so far from me.  The restaurant is very english pub like.  With cool bench seating, a big patio, and a big counter to sit down and enjoy your pasty.  They are always playing an eclectic mix of music that I think adds to the charm.  The staff are really nice and check on you to make sure you have enough to drink and are enjoying yourself.  They get extra bonus points for having a huge selection of vegetarian and vegan pasty. Who doesn't want a savory turnover with delicious fillings? I have really enjoyed lunch here the few times I have gone.  I'll be bringing some friends with me next time.  Keep up the good work.
