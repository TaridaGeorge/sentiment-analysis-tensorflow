Wow! Very cool concept and execution. We had a wonderful sushi dinner at Biltmore Fashion Park Tuesday night and was pleasantly surprised when we walked by the Union. The shops were unique and very, very interesting. But even better the owners and staff were friendly and welcoming. It's a very cool and hip environment. If you haven't been you absolutely must go!!!
