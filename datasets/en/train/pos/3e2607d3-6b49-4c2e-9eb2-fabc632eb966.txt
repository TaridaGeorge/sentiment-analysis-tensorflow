LOVE this place. Great bargains, but only if you have a keen eye. 

You have to be careful. Look at each item before purchasing because they have a strict NO return or exchange policy.

I got my TOMS there for $20, Michael Kors shoes for around $40, and great jeans for around $30. Also, sometimes they have specials like tanks and solid T-shirts for $1. 

I also get great Toddler's clothes and shoes from there. Especially kids Ugg boots for $20. 

Best time to get awesome deals are usually early mornings and weekdays. Otherwise, weekends are always full of people and majority of the "good" stuff are already gone.
