Best Arabic/Middle Eastern food in the valley!!!  The portions are also HUGE and price very fair.  Everything is great, and I am picky so that says something about this place.  

The atmosphere is VERY casual, used to be a 5 and diner - obviously.

The service is great.  Even if it weren't, I wouldn't care because the food is great ;)
