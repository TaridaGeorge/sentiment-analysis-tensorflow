What a wonderful yoga studio. This is the only one I've been to but I've been so happy  here...so there's no reason to go anywhere else! The instructors are wonderful and each one brings something different to the studio. Everyone I've met here has been kind and inviting. As a yoga newbie, this place has become completely addictive.
