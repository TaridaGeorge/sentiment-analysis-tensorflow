One place in Old Town that I never get sick of due to their phenomenal service. Every bartender/barback/security employee there are top notch, friendly, generous, and in control. 

I used to live in old town and frequent many places, I now live in North Scottsdale and frequent only one: the OTT. It lacks the strong scent of douchebaggery that plagues old town so severly. 

Even the dbags that come here (believe me you, they do) seem to take it down a notch due to the friendly, comfortable, and welcoming atmosphere this place radiates... 

Also, I love how the place is laid out, you're always a few steps away from being inside or outside or upstairs at the mini-patio thing.
