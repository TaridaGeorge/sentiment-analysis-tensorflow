This is my favorite restaurant and I am a major foodie!! I always get the Pescator w/ Jumbo Shrimp, Clams,Mussels and Calamari, served over Linguini   $18.95 and it is HUGE!  But I get it with the Lemon Wine sauce. I love the Seafood salad too!Desserts are fantastic, including the Bread Pudding and Creme Brule. Breakfast is really good too! I wish the staff would ask and then remember our names since we go there so often but they are very friendly. My mom and hubby LOVE their Pizza more than any other pizza they have ever had. Something about the cheese...
