It really annoys me when people complain about the service of a restaurant. Maybe because people expect perfection on a busy night. I rather think of it as my company sucked if I was too conscientious of wondering were my food was. My experience here was on a Monday and it was almost full. The host went way out of his way for us. The food came out fast. The drinks were delicious. Most importantly the food was very very good! I highly recommend this place!
