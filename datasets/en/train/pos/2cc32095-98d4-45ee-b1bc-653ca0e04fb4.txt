Came to AZ for vacationing and was told this was the spot to go to for really good pizza. The only downside was the wait in line. Lucky for me, I went on a thursday night and the wait was no more than 15 minutes. 
Walking outside of the building felt as if I was in some old western movie. Indoors however felt as a comfy warm home feeling with freshly baked pizza ready to devour into. 
Small and cramp yet spacious and comfortable.
Services was very friendly and the food was even better. You can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu.
