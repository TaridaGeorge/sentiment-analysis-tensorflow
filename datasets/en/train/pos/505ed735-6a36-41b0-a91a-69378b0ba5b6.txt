I would like to start by saying I'm absolutely crazy when in it comes to my hair. As a natural brunette it is hard to find a stylist that can get it the perfect blonde without damaging it at all. Amanda Banovac at Pure Elements does an outstanding job perfecting my color!! I have gone to the same lady for years in Scottsdale but decided to try something a bit closer... And I am so thankful I did! I have seen Amanda three different times now and LOVE it every single time! Trust me I know first hand how it is having your set stylist but I promise you can't go wrong by switching to Amanda!  And prices are very reasonable which you can't beat!
