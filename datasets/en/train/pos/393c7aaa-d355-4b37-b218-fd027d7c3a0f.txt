The combination of the food, and the great attitude of the owner are priceless.  Every time I walk in there I walk out with great food for a great price, and a smile on my face.  
I can feed my whole family for $20 and after a long, cold and dreary day at work I walk in and the owner says to me: "So vibrant despite the cold".  And then keeps referring to me as "oh, vibrant one".  I think I'm falling in love...
