Love me some Yogurtology! Great selection of flavors, most of which are Gluten-free for my darling Celiac boy. They also have the toppings segregated from each other and very clearly labeled. So my seven year old had no trouble distinguishing which ones were safe for him to pile on. We all got different flavors but the stand out was chocolate/coconut swirl. It was divine like a frozen Mounds bar. Worth every penny!
