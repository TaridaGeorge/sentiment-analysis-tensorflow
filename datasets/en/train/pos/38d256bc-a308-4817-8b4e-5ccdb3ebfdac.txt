We heard this was the best breakfast place in the Phoenix area so we had to check it out.

The long wait wasn't fun, but we figured if that many people were willing to wait almost an hour (10:30am on a Saturday, go figure), then it must be good.

It did not disappoint. The waffles were great, but my favorite was the homefries!

It was small and quaint and we had good service with a friendly staff.

Oh yeah, and they serve RC Cola, which made it even a better experience for me.
