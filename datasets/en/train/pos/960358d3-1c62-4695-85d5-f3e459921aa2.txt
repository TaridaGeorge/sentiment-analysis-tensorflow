HELLO CARB LOADERS!

This is your place to eat all the bagels you want.  What a yum-tastic bagel they serve.  I grew up on Chompie's bagels (this explains a lot).
There is something about the chewy moistness of the inside and the outside that feels and tastes toasted even though it's not. 

Grocery stories sell them now but they really are not nearly as good as the FRESH ones in the actual Chompie's establishment.
