Whenever I come back home and visit Phoenix, this is the number 1 restaurant I want to visit. A ton of healthy (actually healthy, not fake healthy like many 'organic' food restaurants), creative options that are extremely tasty. Always have great service; every, single time (out of a dozen or so visits). Servers have unique personalities.

A little expensive (not too bad), but worth it if you want tasty, healthy food that is a little special, but not so rich that you fill sick afterwards. (healthy, fresh food can be expensive, even if you cook your self)

I've enjoyed everything I've tried, but I especially recommend:

Edamame Dumplings (like edamame ravioli with truffle oil; so delightful and light)
Turkey Bolognese (filling entree if your hungry for brown rice pasta)
Crudites: Perfectly al dente veggies 
Salads: Liked all of the ones I've tried!

Enjoy!
