This place is the real deal.  The selection of foods available is amazing; even fresh food in refrigerators. I am a regular as they stock the full line of Origens food that I give my lab.

Bonnie sold out and went to school to become a veterinary dietician (no surprise there!), but the new owners are cool.  They have not changed the successful formula.  Very friendly.  Pets welcome on a leash.

If you care about what your pet eats, you owe it to them to pay a visit to Bonnie's Barkery.   It's a bit of a drive for most of us, so while in the shopping plaza try a cup of joe at Scooters - excellent coffee, or a slice of pizza at the Number 1 Brother's Pizza - old school pizza joint.
