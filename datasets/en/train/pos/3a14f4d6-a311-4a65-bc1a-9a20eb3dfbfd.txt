Dear Sierra Bonita, thanks so much for accommodating a mix up in our reservation size over the weekend!  Your wait staff was so helpful and pleasant, my brother (the "fiscally-conservative" one) was inspired to leave a 30 % tip!  I had the buttermilk chicken for the first time and it was just delish!  Everybody had a lovely time and enjoyed themselves immensely!

Now get back to work on that perfect Bloody Mary for me, OK?
