The location of the restaurant lays on the fine line between upscale Scottsdale and the old town Scottsdale. Literally, you can look across one street and see beautiful homes, turn around and look the other way and catch a glimpse of peopleofwalmart.com in person.

I give this OG a 5 star rating because of our waiter, Corey. He was the best waiter. Ever. He had a sense of humor (which is almost never seen in a waiter) and attentive but not overly so. Corey, if you are reading this, you deserve a raise! 

The food is standard OG. Endless salad and breadsticks. But if you are lucky, Corey will be your waiter. Be prepared for an OG experience like you've never had before.
