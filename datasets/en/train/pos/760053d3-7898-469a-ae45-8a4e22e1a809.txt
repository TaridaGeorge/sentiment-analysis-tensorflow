I spend probably half of my monthly paychecks here.

The theatre specializes in showing independent or foreign films, which are a nice change to the typical romantic comedies and cheesy slasher flicks being shown at mainstream theatres. 

My only complaint is that they offer free movies to senior citizens (which is a REALLY nice gesture) on certain days in the afternoon (Also, no offense, you senior citizens, I have mad respect for you) but sometimes this leads to a movie experience filled with the crinkling of smuggled snacks in ziplock baggies, mindless chit chat, the yelling of comments to characters on screen, and the overall smell of bengay. Besides this, my experience is always peachy.

If you want to see a movie that's playing here, make sure you catch it soon though. Since there's only five screens, they switch out films fairly rapidly!
