This place is classier than your typical BBQ joint, which of course means just a little pricier.  But with the extra money comes high quality food.

My most recent visit, I ordered the brisket sandwich with shoestring fries, and was quite satisfied.  Service was fast and friendly, and the food was excellent.

First up was the cornbread, which was very flavorful and full of buttery goodness.  The meat was tender, juicy, and went very well with the regular barbecue sauce.  The fries were also good - I couldn't figure out what was special about them, but whatever it is, it works.

Overall, a very good place, highly recommended.
