My wife and I stopped in despite the annoying gorilla on the street corner and we're glad we did. We were treated to outstanding service from the hostess, the greeter, our waiter (Chris), and the manager. The beer was delicious and the food was exactly what we were looking for (pub fare done well). We will definitely be back!
