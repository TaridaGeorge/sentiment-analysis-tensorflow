I went to Spatini today for a quick pedi and gelish mani and there is no doubt I will be back! Jeannie was right on time and did an awesome job on my hands and toes. She was so sweet and an expert is gel manicures. I can't wait to try a new design in a few weeks! I have already told my mom and sister that they must make appointments ASAP. Thank you Jeannie!
