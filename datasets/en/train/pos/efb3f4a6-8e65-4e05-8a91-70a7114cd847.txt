Since there is no other place like it - 5 stars. 
So freakin good, I wish there was one in Tucson.

I had the original pasty with meat, potatoes and gravy. Simply devine comfort food. The baked cauliflower and broccoli side was also excellent. I wished I would have tried everyone else's pasty, but I was on a mission to finish mine and that huge 32oz. beer. 

Love the old-time photos of miners and traditional pub decor. I can't wait to get back to this place.
