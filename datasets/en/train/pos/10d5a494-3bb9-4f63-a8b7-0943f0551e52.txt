Uh, Im almost hesitant to share my secret love/obsession, but its too good not to! Words cannot describe the swellegant environment that is Red Hot Robot. Just go to the store and see for yourself, you will thank me....or maybe you wont. You may become addicted to vinyl toys and then every paycheck you will find yourself buying freaking awesome goodies from the trinket peddler known as Jason who sits behind the counter with a candied grin recognizing he has hooked yet another sucker in for his sweet merchandise.....I love you Red Hot Robot (whispers) I love you.
