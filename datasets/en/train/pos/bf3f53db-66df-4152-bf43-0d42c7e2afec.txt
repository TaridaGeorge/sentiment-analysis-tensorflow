Wow! A 5 Star dentist? It can't be...  at least that's what I thought until I was lucky enough to stumble upon Chandler Dental Health. I have been going to them for several years now and have been attended to by both Dr Tom and Dr Grace. Take your pick, they are both great dentists. And kudos to all their dental hygienists too. I can't say enough good things about this place and that includes all the staff. Everyone is friendly, courteous, professional and very accommodating. Never a long wait for my appointment , never 'hustled' for work that was not necessary, never 'gouged' on my bill, never a problem period. And thanks to Kathy for keeping the place running smoothly. Two thumbs, way up!
