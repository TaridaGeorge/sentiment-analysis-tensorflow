I took the White Knight (my Rav4) here on a Wednesday and got the $8.99 wash and interior vacuum. My only complaint is that they neglected to clean the bottom edge (under the doors) all around. I got home and had to wipe off the tar myself. Everything else went smoothly...fast service, little waiting, car (most of it) clean and shiney.

Thursday night it rained and the White Knight was a mess again. I brought "him" back in and they rewashed and vacuumed at no charge because they have a 48 hour rain/rewash policy. I love that!

I'll be back.
