Can you say Schnitzel?  Every time I visit Arizona, I have to stop at this restaurant... very authentic,  I had the Wiener Schnitzel, for appetizer the potato pancakes with sour cream and applesauce and some strudel for dessert... Oh, and I had to have a german beer too so that my belly was extra full before I left..  I am german and think this place is very true to it recipes... Not a place to go for dieting...  I wish I lived closer!!
