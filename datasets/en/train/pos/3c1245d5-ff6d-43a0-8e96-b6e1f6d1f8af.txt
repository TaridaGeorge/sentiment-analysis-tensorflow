I have a pair of boots that I love and the heal got destroyed from walking around in the snow with all the salt.  I found tony's and went to get my boots repaired because I plan on wearing them over Christmas. I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to get them fixed in time. I went to tony's with my boots, asked how much and how long and the man said 12 dollars and 20 minutes!!!! Not only was the job very well done, but it ended up taking about 10 minutes!!! Definitely recommend this place! Quick shoe repair at a great price! Thanks Tony's!!!!
