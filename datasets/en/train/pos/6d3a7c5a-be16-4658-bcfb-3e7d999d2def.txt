Having lived in this hood for almost three years, THIS is my favorite pizza, period. I loved having a gin & tonic or their house red while sitting in the patio/courtyard; the dough they brought for my daughter to make a pizza out of while our delicious coal fired Italian black olive and mushroom pizza was getting blazen fire licks of love.  The rooms that line the courtyard are great for larger indoor/outdoor parties.
We can't wait to visit!
