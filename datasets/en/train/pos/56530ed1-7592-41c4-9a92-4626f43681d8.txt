This is a fun event! It only happens once every few months so it's ok to be a little decadent on one night. So I like to get gussied up, have drinks, laugh at good comedy and enjoy the expression of art! For those of you turned off by the idea of nudity, most of the evening everyone on stage is clothed, the third act you get to see pasties. So, you could ideally go for just the first two segments. I stay for the whole thing. Cool vendors to shop between shows. They even do charitable donations for good causes. Buy your tickets early though, they are getting more popular every day. :)
