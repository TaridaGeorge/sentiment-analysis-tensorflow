Art and thrift clothes, memorabilia and jewelry.  This place is so cool and a must see-stop if you're in Phoenix.  The owner was so knowledgeable about the local art scene and really helpful; gave us the best complementary jamaica drink ever.  You'll find some very cool threads and buy some sweet local art there.  I have been to many thrift stores yet I have never been to such a cool thrift art store like this before.  

And girls, the dresses looked really cool here.  Guys, sweet t-shirts (about $6) of all sorts.
