Best Pork tenderloin sandwich this side of the Midwest! Man, this lady can cook!

The place is small and quaint but the best places usally are. The food is really good and homestyle but better. I usally get my food to go and will comonly park next to mercedes', lexus', cop cars and even a ferrari or bentley every now and then. So you know it s a great place. You can't get this great port tenderloin sandwich anywhere else and be satisfied unless your back in Indiana.
