Not as challenging but boy you don't have to go far to get away from it all. I went up to the Taliesian lookout, which has a good view of the valley, and back and around the lost dog trail and I saw 8 people the entire time. Great markers, signs and facility at the trailhead with water, map and bathrooms. Not super challenging but you are sure to see wildlife, I saw a snake, chipmunk and hawks. If you want some zen time to yourself, and not kill yourself hiking up a huge mountain definitely hit this trail.
