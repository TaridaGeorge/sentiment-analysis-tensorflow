Frances is my go-to destination for unique gifts for my very favorite people. No matter if that person is a yoga guru, a traditionalist, or an engima, I can always stroll right in and find that perfect little something that I am proud to give. 

Customer service here has always been attentive to the point that it makes me very nearly bashful. As far as prices go, I feel their prices are reasonable for the product. For about $10-15 you can get some amazing stationery, for $20-$80 you can get some amazing jewelry finds, and for about $40-$120 you are squarely within their shoes/intimates/dress bracket. It isn't thrift store pricing, but this is a local business and the goods are limited and in many cases, handmade. Plus they won't bombard you with catalogues (cough cough, -anthro-). 

Frances, thank you for being a friend. :)
