what a wonderful restaurant, my wife and i ordered and shared the veggie combo every item on the plate was so flavorful, the injera (bread) was so fresh and tasty.  we both enjoyed it so much we went back the next day and ordered the same. i would recommend this this restaurant, if you are looking for flavorful, healthy and affordable food.
