Had to try to squeeze in one last fix before leaving town. And to see if the airport version could compare to the in town. Not a bit of disappointment here. Excellent macchiato. Staff is super friendly. Nice to see a REAL barista in the airport. One with skills... And cares about what she is doing. Great job again Cartel!!
