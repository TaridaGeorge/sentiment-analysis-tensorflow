Literally we woke up on a Saturday.. yelped for some way to get our new Airedale pup shiny and fluffed.. & Mark called to see if we could literally get him in on the whim.. Yep.. no prob. The ladies are so nice & accomodating..We dropped our sheisty Winston.. & felt free for the next few hours.. They called us when we were done.. & Winston smelled like a vanilla bean.. all fluffed and curly again.. I think he had a doggety time there too.. he loved the ladies.. got his snack& away we went..
