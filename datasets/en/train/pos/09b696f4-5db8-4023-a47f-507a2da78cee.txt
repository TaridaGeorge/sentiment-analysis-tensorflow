We heard about Marcellino from a hotel consierge and wondered if it would be as nice as it was described... punch line, it was and I recommend it for anyone who like great, authentic Italian cuisine - the food was terrific, the service was top notch, and Marcellino is a wonderful person. He doesn't pander to people; instead he understands the beauty of well-prepared food and hopes people will discover this for themselves
