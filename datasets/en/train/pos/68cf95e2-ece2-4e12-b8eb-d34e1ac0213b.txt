You know, as much as I do love Jamba Juice, I prefer Robek's choice of flavors. They taste more tropical and vibrant, if that even makes sense. I'd go to either one depending on what I'm feeling. If I want a more berry/banana flavor, then I'd go to Jamba. If I want a more guava and tangy sensation, Robeks it is. You can't go wrong with either one, but Robeks has the slight edge with the freshness and how their smoothies are made. I know I'll be a frequent customer here, especially during this summer!
