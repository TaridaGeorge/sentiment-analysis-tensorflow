I think Fleming's is the cat's meow! Great service!  Fantastic food! Interesting wine choices! I love that they offer wine flights. I don't know of any other steak houses in town do that (if anyone else does, please email me). 

Shhhh....don't tell, but Flemning's is my 2nd fave after Mastro's!!

Bon Appetite!
