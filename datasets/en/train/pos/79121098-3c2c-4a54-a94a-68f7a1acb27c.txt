Not a disappointment.  I remembered the 1st time I came here I didn't think it was awesome but I remember it being good.  If I had remembered it being this good, I would've come back here several times last week.  
We sat at the bar and shared a few things - 
I ordered the Moscow Mule at the bartender's suggestion and it was super tasty and the ginger root was fresh.  
Bread & olive oil - served warm & nicely seasoned
Chef's salad - nice balance of dressing 
Short rib pasta - another recommendation - I thought it was good but it didn't knock my socks off
Salted Caramel Custard - last recommendation - one well made!
