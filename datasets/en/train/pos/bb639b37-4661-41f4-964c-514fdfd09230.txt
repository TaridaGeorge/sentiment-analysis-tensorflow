This was a really good place that you could get your foot fall analyzed before you bought running shoes. The staff was always very knowledgeable and friendly. BUT unfortunately it is gone. Yes this store is OUT OF BUSINESS...or moved to Nevada anyway. There are still stores in Tucson if you feel like taking a drive :( Sad.
