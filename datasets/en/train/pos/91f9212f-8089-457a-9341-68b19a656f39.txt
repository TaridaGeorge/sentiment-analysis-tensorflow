I was dying to try this place after seeing such great reviews. Tried in October but they were closed so was really bummed. When friends came into for Spring Training I was so excited to see it open and busy. 

First off -- Holla for Challah French Toast! (a must order!!)
Second -- I love that they have a coffee bar, where you can wait for your table with a latte. 
Third--
It's a nice spacious place with patio seating right off of N. Scottsdale road.....and definitely a nice spot for people watching.
