Very few chain fast and quick food eateries deserve my attention.  But, Jersey Mike's is the big time exception.  Their sub sandwiches are the best by far, even over mom and pop delis.  My wife and I have eaten at several of their locations throughout the Phoenix area and they are equally excellent.   The fresh sliced meats just seem to be the difference.  The prices are right and the restaurants are kept clean.  Highly recommended.
