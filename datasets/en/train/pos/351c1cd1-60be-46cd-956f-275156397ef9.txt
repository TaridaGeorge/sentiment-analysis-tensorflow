This is my favorite local boutique! A great place to get gifts ranging from $5 to $100. Francis has everything from the real Dr. Pepper to vintage aprons. They hand pick everything and I never know what I might find when I step into this gem. They have new clothes as well as vintage.

I usually have a hard time leaving without purchasing something.

If you have the means I would suggest you check it out!
