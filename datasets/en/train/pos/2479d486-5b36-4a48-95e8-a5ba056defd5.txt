Unfortunately the store is a little out of the way for me since I don't often go through Guadalupe. Stopped off and did a little browsing and chatted with Loyola? the new owner. Very friendly lady who gave me a run down on the various local products she stocked.  Ended up with some great cherry butter - tasty salsa from O'doyles and locally made cheese from Gilbert. Also appeared to have a good selection of vegetables and friut and chilis etc.
Just a pity they are located a little bit out of the way
