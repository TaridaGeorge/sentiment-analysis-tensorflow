I have been here a couple of times, but I won't be going back.  The last time a young girl did my nails and after she used one of the items on my foot she passed it to the next person who was doing some old man's extra long toenails.  He kept trying to talk to me and I just wanted to get out of there.

There are usually kids hanging around in there, and I don't find that relaxing.  I would rather pay more and have a better experience.
