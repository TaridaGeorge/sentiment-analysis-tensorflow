I am surprized to see the great reviews for this establishment.  I have never seen the price for a simple pizza add up so fast. I went inside to order a pie to go ( with Jalepenos). I watched as the cook sniffed the container of Jalepenos , made a face and then dissapeared in the back with the container . I am not sure to this day what that was all about but it certainly put me off pizza for a while.
