I haven't actually stayed at this hotel, however, I was planning too stay there in April.  The problem....DOGS!  They do not have separate hotel rooms for people with pets.  So if you have athsma or allergies this probably isn't the place for you.  Deep cleaning a room doesn't rid the room of dander.  They should have select rooms for those with pets.  Not all people like to sleep where animals have slept or maybe a select number of rooms that animals are never allowed in.  So while my friends will be staying at the Wigwam I will have to stay elsewhere.
