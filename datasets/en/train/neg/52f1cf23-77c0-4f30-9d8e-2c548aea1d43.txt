This restaurant is the BIGGEST JOKE ...... The portion sizes are extremely small and you will leave hungry. After spending $200.00 my husband and I had to go somewhere else to get something to eat. A gentlemen in the restroom even commented to my husband that he didn't get much to eat and was still hungry. Trust us, go somewhere else. Biggest disappointment of our dining experiences.
