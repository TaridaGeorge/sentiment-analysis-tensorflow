So disappointed in this event. I'm grateful that people are so fond of food trucks but I'm super unhappy that I didn't get to participate in the way that I wanted.

The traffic was horrible. Did they not cap the ticket sales? For 25 food trucks, there were 13,000 people? That's 520 people per truck - no wonder it took several hours for people to wait in line and get food! No normal restaurant can serve that many people.

Planning was awful, parking was awful. Charging for parking, ticket entry, AND food? Wow.

Dear Salt River Fields, next time CAP THE TICKET SALES -- maybe a few thousand at most. Charge more if you have to (clearly people are interested). Invite more food trucks!
