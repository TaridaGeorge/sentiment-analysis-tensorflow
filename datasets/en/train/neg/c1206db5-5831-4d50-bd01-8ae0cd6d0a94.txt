I have never been more disappointent with a company in my life! It took me 4 months of calling Customer Service and going into the store to get my phone issues fixed. I'm talking about something as simple as being able to access my voicemail. I finally had to travel 30 miles away to a DSC store where finally after what seemed to be 27 employees later I am now able to retrieve my voicemail and send a text message! I would NEVER recogmend AT&T to anyone and I dream of the day my contract is up. I would rather pay a higher bill with Verizonthan deal with the incompetence of the employees and lack of Customer Service!
