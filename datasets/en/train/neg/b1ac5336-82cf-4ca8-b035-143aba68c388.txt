OllieCake and Urban Cookies are housed in the same building and come from the same till but since I got a cookie and a cupcake, I'll review them separately.

The cookie selection is housed in jars next to the till. There were plenty of flavours left despite us arriving later in the day. I went with the sea salt chocolate. Usually, when you get something with sea salt on it, it's just sprinkled on the top but this had the topping PLUS sea salt mixed in. It made for a ridiculously salty cookie, especially after having the heavy, sweet cupcake. It was also on the drier, and smaller, side. Definitely not worth over $2. Offer a larger, softer, fresher cookie and I wouldn't feel so ripped off. Also, stick to a simple sprinkling of sea salt and not a ton in the batter.
