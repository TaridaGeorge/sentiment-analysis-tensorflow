I am disappointed that they are closed without any signs on the door or message on their voicemail. I loved Picazzo's in Sedona and was excited about one opening here in Phoenix, so I planned an office lunch party for the holiday and was shocked when we went there and saw the lights out and doors locked. Not a good way to keep customers, no matter how good the food is...
