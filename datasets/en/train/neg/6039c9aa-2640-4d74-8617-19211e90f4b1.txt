My daughter and I went in for pedicures and gel sets... was incredibly surprised to hear the total was $120. even with a coupon!!! When I got home I noticed that my pedicure wasn't the best... I really don't mind paying top dollar for top dollar services but even with a 'coupon' it wasn't worth it. Won't be back...
