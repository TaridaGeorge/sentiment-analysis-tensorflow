By far the worst cupcake shop I have visited yet.

If you like duncan hines or betty crocker cupcakes and frosting, this is your place, that is exactly what the cupcakes look and taste like.  I didnt even finish mine and that is shocking for me, I adore pastries, I threw the rest of mine in the trash.

I dont see how they stay in business, sad but true.
