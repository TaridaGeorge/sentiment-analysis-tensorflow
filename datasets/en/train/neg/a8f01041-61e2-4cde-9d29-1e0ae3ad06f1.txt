If your Korean don't bother. If not it is a sad representation. There palate has long since expired, like their kimchee! OMG! How can a respectable Korean place serve a fellow Korean who spoke to them in their native tongue severely over the hill kimchee. OLD kimchee, our STAPLE in any Korean restaurant means crappy food.   Also horrible service. This hole in the wall should be walled up.
