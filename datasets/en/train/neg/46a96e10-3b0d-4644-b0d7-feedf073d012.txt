Seriously!! I have stayed in many 5 star resorts, this is a joke!! The complimentary breakfast tasted like leftovers from last nights dinner service!! While I agree with others, the hot tub  was way too hot and way too much chlorine, we did observe a family of 5 using the workout room at 10:30 p.m as well as roaming the hallways, I do not even think they were guest there! The first 90 degree day and there were not enough lawn chairs out by the pool!! Our room was cramped and in need of a serious make-over for what they charge. Stayed 2 nights, checked out, went to the Marriot in Tuscon, Now that was 5 stars!!
