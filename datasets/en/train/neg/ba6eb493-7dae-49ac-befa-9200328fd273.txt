Hate this Subway!! Pam has got to be the dumbest manager since she just does not know how to run a restaurant. The employees always overcharge, have to be corrected and some of them are as dumb as the manager about the regular pricing and the deals going on! Not the new deals that subway comes up with mind you, but the basic meal-time deals, etc. UGHHH!!! Did I mention that I hate and boycott this particular Subway?
