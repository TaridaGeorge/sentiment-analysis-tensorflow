awful place they were rude and a scam! they sold me an expired medicine and did not want to do anything about it. the owner and manager cussed at me and hung up the phone. i guess they were in a bad mood and did not want to deal with me since they didn't want to give me some un expired meds for my pet. i would never reccomand nor go to this place again.
