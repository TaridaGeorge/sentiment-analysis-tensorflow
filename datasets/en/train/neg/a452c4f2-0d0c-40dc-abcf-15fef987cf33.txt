Awful. They don't accept coupons or honor adverted rates on their own building. Pushy to sell you things you don't need by describing the horrific fantastical situations you will encounter if you drive off their lot without purchasing their repairs (and I only went in for an oil change on a 2009 haha). Oh, and you'll need a long shower and a tetanus shot after visiting their waiting room. Yuck.
