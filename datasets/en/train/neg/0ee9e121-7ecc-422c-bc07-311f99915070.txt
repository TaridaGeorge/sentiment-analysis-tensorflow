Seriously?! People are lining up to come here? Embarrassing...

At first I thought maybe I was just getting too old for this sh!t but no.. it's not me. This place is loud! (What?!) LOUD! (Huh?!) Don't even bother talking, just smile and shake your ass.

Bring your own drink because you WILL be old by the time you get served and then you'll be broke from $9 drinks. And the bartenders charge me something different each time. Come on now! As a member of the 30K-Milli club, you know I won't be able to fill up gas in my parents Benz now!

The only thing great about this place is that the girls are slutty. I like seeing flashes of their Lady Gagas and TaTas but its not worth the wait.
