This restaurant probably has to be the most overrated India eatery in Arizona! Went with my family for a weekend lunch buffet and was thoroughly disappointed. The food was stale and the service was really bad.

The fact that our waiter who waited on us had a frown on his face the whole time that we were there made the experience even more horrible.

Can't see how others keep going back to this place :-(

Have to agree with Elizabeth L. about getting some good Indian food in Phoenix!
