I never thought I was picky about my boba, until I ordered from here. 

My friend and I ordered the Taro and Almond Milk Tea with boba. It was awful. I couldn't drink more than 1/4 of my drink. The boba balls were so hard and tasted crunchy. Boba is supposed to be soft, sweet, and the kind that just melts in your mouth. It was as if they premade the boba balls put the drink in and then froze it, left it out to thaw and then served it. And yes it was more horrible than the 29 cent Quickly Boba found in San Francisco/Berkeley Area. 

You can't really mess up boba, but those two drinks did. Wasted $3.50/$4.00 on these drinks.
