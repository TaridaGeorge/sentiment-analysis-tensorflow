Moving from San Diego with one of the best pho places... This place and many other here in Arizona is a complete joke. It's always neither too salty or too sweet. Pho is not suppose to be sweet.   I also tried the rice plate another time and they were super cheap on the meat and veggies! 
We were so excited we found a new pho place to try and it was packed with people so we assumed  WE FOUND OUR NEW SPOT ... Boy was I disappointed. We ordered appetizer and it didn't come out til after we got our BILL! So we told the guy we no longer want it and they still made us take the spring rolls. I've never been to a place with such slow service. I'll never be coming back. Sorry avina u disappointed my Vietnamese family.
