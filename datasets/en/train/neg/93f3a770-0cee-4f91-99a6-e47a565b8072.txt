I've never liked going here, pretty terrible food and service. I actually know some of the people who used to work here, and they aren't exactly in a clear mind when they clock in. Once there were gnats flying around my food, pretty off-putting. I wouldn't go here again unless i had to. If you do like the food and get past all the bad things, try the mother load. Least terrible thing on the menu- they pretty much just throw everything they can into that sandwich.
