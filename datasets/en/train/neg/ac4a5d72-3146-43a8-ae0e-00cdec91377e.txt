Very negative feeling about this place. I heard an advertisement on the radio for $.40 wings on Tuesday's and a couple weeks later went in to try the place out. Unfortunately they stopped the promotion because it wasn't popular enough. There was no recovery to at least offer me the deal since that was why we came in the first place which really set me the wrong way. 

The server was kind enough to offer we go to Native New Yorker instead, great advice that I'm sure will keep me coming back. Just a very weird scenario all together.
