Yikes! We went last night and some drunk girl hit her car against a big truck and hit the truck in to another car. Then a guy was stabbed in the face in the parkng lot. Buyer beware! The plus side is, the bartender Ron, poured strong,original mixed drinks.  Update to a recent post by someone else, I was there when the police where in your parking lot after the man was stabbed. I was there when the ambulance took him away. I never said the was stabbed in your bar, just your parking lot. It was quite the scene and I felt bad for the guy.
