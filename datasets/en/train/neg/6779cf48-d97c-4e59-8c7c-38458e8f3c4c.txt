Our out-of-town guest wanted to try Red Robin for their "gourmet burgers". He ordered a bacon cheeseburger and another person ordered the barbecue burger. The server asked  them if they wanted the burgers cooked pink or not pink. They both requested pink but both burgers came out not-pink. The server said they could make another burger but as they went through a conveyor belt she couldn't guarantee they would be pink. The manager did comp the burgers - but the point is that a conveyor belt burger is not a handmade gourmet burger.
I did like the chicken tortilla soup.
