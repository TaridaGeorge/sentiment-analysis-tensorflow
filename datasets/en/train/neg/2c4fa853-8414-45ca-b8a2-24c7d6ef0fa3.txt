Been coming here 15 years. Spent my 21st and 30th birthday here, but honestly, Fuck them. Buy your own tubes. I'll never pay these guys another dollar. Thanks for ruining another trip. Poor service. Poor attitude. Split our group up, then didn't take them to launch 1 like the previous bus. There was nobody there. It wasn't packed like a usual weekend. I'd rather burn money than spend another cent with them. Shitty tubes, shitty policies. I hope you guys go out of business. I take back every good thing I've ever said about these motherfuckers. I've brought so many people from out of state. Good job fucking yourselves on first impressions. Assholes.
