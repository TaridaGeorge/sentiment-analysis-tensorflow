Man was I disappointed!  I ordered for delivery and was told it would take 20-30 minutes, it actually took an hour and 20 to arrive.  So first impression not the best but it got here and was hot and smelled really good. I got the food opened and started serving and when I scooped into the curry chicken I was disgusted.  The chicken was raw, very raw. It was so bad I was afraid to try any of the food. I called to tell them what happened and it didn't seem to matter much but they did give me my money back. I was really hoping it would be good because my husband and I have been looking for Chinese delivery place in the area. After that experience my search continues.
