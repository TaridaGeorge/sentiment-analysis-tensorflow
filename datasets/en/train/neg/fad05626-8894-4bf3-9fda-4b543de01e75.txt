I have to applaud this McDonalds for putting underachievers to work. Not every restaurant would take a chance on employees and managers who have no ability or desire to answer questions on menu items or read a list of ingredients to determine if allergens are included. Even when I asked the Shift Manager to read the packaging for the list of ingredients, she held tight to the values of the mediocre, and did nothing to help (well she flipped a placemat over a couple times and said she had calorie counts).  Gotta love that determination.
