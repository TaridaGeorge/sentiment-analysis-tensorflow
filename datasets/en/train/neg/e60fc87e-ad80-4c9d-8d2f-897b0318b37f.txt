They still fucking suck.  But I should say that I did get a whole whopping $150 back from United for the items I had to buy and have not used.  Oh, my friend just had her bag lost by United this past weekend also.  The people on the 1-800 in India were just as useless to her as well.  I don't even know why they have their systems there if they can't seem to tell you anything.

"I'm sorry for your inconvenience maam, but we do not have record stating whether or not your bag made it on the plane."  

They make you pay extra to check the bags, just so they can lose them.  Its total bullshit and there is nothing we can do about it.
