I so wanted to like this place because I lover breweries.

I can honestly say this might be THE WORST BAR FOOD I'VE HAD in my LIFE!!  I think dog food right from the bag would be better.  I had the roast beef and we split a pizza.  I've had better roast beef at subway.  The pizza was ok, at best.

I should have noticed because no one was eating.

It's good for beer only.  Save your money on the food.

It's not even in the same ball park as  4-peaks.  too bad.  It would be nice to have more brewpubs in our area.
