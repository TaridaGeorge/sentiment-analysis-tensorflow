Can not recommend at all.
  
The overall organization and punctuality of this office leaves much to be desired.  I have made several appointments and shown up on time--only to wait 30min or up to 1hour AFTER my scheduled appointment time until been seen.  This is unacceptable.  Even if you are a repeat client (which I was) and have all paperwork on file (which I did) you still have to deal with delays.  Lord only knows how long the newbies wait.

Once you are fortunate enough to see the doctor, I can't say it gets any better.  I once had a doctor complete my exam--tell me she was coming back to explain test results and have post exam talk... then never show up again!  Outrageous. 

Save yourself the headache and find a more professional team.
