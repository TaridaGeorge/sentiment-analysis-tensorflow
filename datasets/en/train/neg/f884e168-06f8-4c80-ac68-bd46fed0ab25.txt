If this was REAL BBQ I would never eat BBQ. 

I ordered a pound of Brisket to eat there. Got a plate of what looked like a mish mash of chopped and sliced brisket. Very dry and had little to no seasoning at all. Ended up taking it back to the counter and asking for our money back.

Head up the street and got some real Brisket. I gave it a try, oh well.

If you want good Brisket folks, don't go here. You go to Rynos, Pork Shop or even Porkopolis but you don't go here.
