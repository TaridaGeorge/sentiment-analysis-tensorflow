Horrendous.  It is near my house so I stop in ever once in a while and every time and I tell myself it is the last time.  The place is a mess all of the time, the shoppers are rude and let their kids run all over the store.  Some of the staff seem a little nicer than they used to be.  If I could find some good deals I might keep going back, but TJ Maxx's is getting all of my $$.
