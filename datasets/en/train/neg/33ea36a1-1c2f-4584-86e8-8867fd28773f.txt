In two words - Stay away.  

The management is non-exist. They run when you call them or try to see them about something. They locked a little girl out of her apartment and her little dog because her dad - who had pre-paid for the month - turned in his keys early thinking it was the right thing to do. They changed the locks and wouldn't let her in to get her belongings. In the Phoenix Heat. Can you imagine a more horrendous approach to customer service?

And the apartment manager, Rachel Moore, and the district manager Angie Schmidt - everybody ran when they were informed of their error.

Shameful.

There are too many options in this beautiful area. These people should be ashamed.
