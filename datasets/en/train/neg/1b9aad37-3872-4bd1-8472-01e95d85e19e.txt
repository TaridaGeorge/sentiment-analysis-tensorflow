Will never go back...
Straight to zero. I refuse to go to any more restaurants where I can see my server talking/texting on her cell phone while she/he is running my goddam credit card. When are you owners going to take control???!!!??? Sure, they may not be ripping ME off, but when I HAVE BEEN ripped off, this is how it happens... Take your head out of the sand and make policy... no cell phones at the POS machine... DUH - you own a restaurant. Straight to zero goes CB and CB... do not go here if if you hate risk
