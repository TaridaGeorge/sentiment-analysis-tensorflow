NOT IMPRESSED! First of all you DO NOT get rice and beans you have to choose between the two or be charged extra. Me and my daughter shared fajitas and they were not good. They weren't sizzling when we got them...and I saw someone trying to light them up with a lighter or something which is weird. 
My husbands chimichanga was NASTY! It tasted just like they took canned nacho sauce and mixed it with something and dumped it over the top! 
They charge us extra for 2 tiny tortillas for our fajitas. 
The service was mediocre and they weren't very clean. 
We will not return!
