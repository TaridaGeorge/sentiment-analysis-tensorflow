I visited the W Hotel Scottsdale over the holidays.  First, the positives:  The valet and welcome staff were great and helpful.  The facility had typical W style and appeared fun.  Unfortunately there was an incident with two Hispanic security guards at 2am.  The guard made wild accusations and extorted money from me.  I visit 5 Diamond properties often and have NEVER been treated so unprofessionally.  I will NEVER return, probably head to the Princess.
