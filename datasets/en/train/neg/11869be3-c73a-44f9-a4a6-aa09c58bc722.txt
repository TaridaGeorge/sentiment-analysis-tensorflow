Haven't been out to a restaurant in forever with the fam so I thought we'd give this one a try. My bistecca salad side was the highlight of the meal for everyone. My wife ordered a lobster bisque appetizer which was flat and salty. Her Mediterranean penne pasta was bland and over cooked. My fettucine "Alfredo" rustica was missing the creaminess desired in an Alfredo dish. I don't think they added any cheese. My 5 year old also said that the lemonade is better at McDonalds. Overall- $50 plus for bland, over cooked pasta. Sucky. Will never return.
