There was a bone in my meatball after they burned my sub the first go around. When I brought this up to the manager he said " well we do not make the meatballs here, they come in pre-made". I did not receive an apology or any effort to make it right, or keep us as a customer. We will not be going there again.

It is sad as Z Pizza looks great from the outside, however the food is average at best, barring any foreign items in your meal, and the service is unorganized, and lacking any courtesy.
