Don't waste your time or money. Ordered $18 ravioli that tasted average but EXTREMELY MISERLY portions. About 10-12 ravioli total. I was embarrassed when they brought me my food. Anyone who orders this dish is leaving hungry. Luckily there is a jackinthebox down the street. Wrote an email to Fox expressing my discontent and surprise, no response. I cannot recommend this overpriced, average taste, miserly portioned restaurant.
