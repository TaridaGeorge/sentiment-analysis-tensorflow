No seating. Concrete floor. Apersonal staff. Male bathroom attendant who looks homeless. $5 to park in the venue's lot. Announcing concert at 7:30 when that's the door time and the opener starts at 9:00. This place continues to find ways to disappoint. If this is the only place they are playing then you are stuck, otherwise pass.

In addition the volume is consistently way too loud (do your 40-year-old self a favor and wear hearing protection) and there are no acoustics to speak of. Too much noise + concrete walls and floor = exhausting combination.
