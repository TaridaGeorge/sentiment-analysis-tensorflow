Complete and utter rip off!  I bought tires from them, had a flat and they were going to charge my $25 to fix it!  I called Discount Tire and they fixed it for free.  Imagine that, a company that will fix another company's problem and for no charge!  

The other problem I had with this place was that they wanted to charge me $125 to read the fault codes off of my truck when your local auto parts dealer will do this for free!  

Everything about this place irks me and they prey on people who are not auto savvy and they have gotten away with it for so long.  Please stay away from this place as they are way too expensive and will probably be the place to sell you something you do not need if they have the chance.
