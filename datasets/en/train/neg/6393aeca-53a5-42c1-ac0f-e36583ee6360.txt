We only went here because it has been a traditional Father's Day event with friends.  We decided to join them for the 1st time......really...we will never go back. This place is a dump. Today was 110 degrees the air condition felt like a swamp cooler, the service was not great either. We did blow out a keg...so reconnecting the keg took awhile.  The service staff really tried to do their best, but it's The Shed I, and it has not changed over the years.  Unless your desparate for a beer....after a softball game at Kiwanis Park...keep on driving.
