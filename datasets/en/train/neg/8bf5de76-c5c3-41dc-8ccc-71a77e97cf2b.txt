This is the last straw...we've had numerous problems with this office before but i can't stand it anymore. The line is always long and only have 1 clerk working. The clerks there are the rudest I've ever encountered! First we go there saying that we could not use a certain box  of theirs because we were getting free shipping from Amazon so that was annoying. I called my dad who is a postal worker and said that ask if we can just "black out" the priority mail part on the box and we asked them and they said yes. So we left and came back with everything blacked out and they still said it was no good with an attitude. Needless to say, I just left just furious without letting her finish her bs. I'll stick with other USPS locations or for this particular shipment, UPS....
