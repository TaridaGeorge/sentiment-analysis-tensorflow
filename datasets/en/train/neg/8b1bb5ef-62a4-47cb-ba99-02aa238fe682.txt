I had lunch at this same location years ago, and it was really very good.  Today I was really, really, really disappointed. I ordered the lunch crawfish bisque and garden salad ~ $10.  The garden salad included iceburg lettuce, which is something I would expect at Denny's. The huge disappointment was that the crawfish in the crawfish bisque tasted like they had freezer burn. Ewww, ewww, ewww. I would have said something, but I was someone's guest.
