i'm not in love with this chain, and this location in particular is pretty bad.
usually dried up or slightly brown lettuce, dirty floors, etc. when you go out specifially for fresh salads, it's just the last thing you want to be surrounded by, i guess.
i lived in an apartment in the same complex as this one for a year and literally went there one time.
