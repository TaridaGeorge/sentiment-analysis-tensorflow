I read a lot of great reviews so we tried it. I was not impressed.

This is definitely an older crowd (50+) and it seems they cater to that crowd. The food was small portions for the high cost, and the flavors were not all that great. The sweet breads were chopped up and drowned in sauce so you could barely taste the breads. I did not even think they were what we ordered.

I would not spend my money here, especially at their prices.
