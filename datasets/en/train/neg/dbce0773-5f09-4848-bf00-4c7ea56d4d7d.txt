I've never really had any problems with the quality of the sound or any aspect regarding the shows I've been to at The Clubhouse. The place is fine to go to shows, I just can't stand their bar. Drinks are ridiculously overpriced. Bartenders in my experience have never been very friendly or useful. EVERY SINGLE TIME I've ordered something on tap it has tasted like piss. I kid you not. Something is just wrong. Go next door beforehand or in between to order beers. Place sucks.
