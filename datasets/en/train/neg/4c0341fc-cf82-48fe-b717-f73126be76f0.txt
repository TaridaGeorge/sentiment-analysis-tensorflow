Absolute horrible service and customer care. Who doesn't let a person know their food is ready for a to go order? This place. Then the manager has the nerve to tell me its my fault? Are you kidding me? I'm.glad I don't live here but if I did I'd never come back. 

Got a refund which the manager tried to argue about not refunding my check for non-existent food.  So I haven't had the food. It looked mediocre at best.
