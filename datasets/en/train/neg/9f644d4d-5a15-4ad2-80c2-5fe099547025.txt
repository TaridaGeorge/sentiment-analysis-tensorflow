Yikes!  This place is scary!  The service was horrible although the waitress's were cute to look at (think Coyote Ugly - The movie).  The food was plentiful but very average.  It was just creapy.  Too bad, the bull riding could have been cool.  Just not my thing.   Sunday afternoon seems to be the time to go.  Everyone was drinking and watching the game on flat screens.  Reminded me of a place you might see the girls from Rock of Love hanging out at!  Ha!
