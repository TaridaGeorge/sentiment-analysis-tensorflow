So dissapointing! I ordered the club that claims to be "piled high" with turkey ham lettuce mayo and cranberry sauce... Triple decker style.  I opened my sandwich and thought I had been given the wrong one. It was as tall as a sandwich with only 2 pieces of bread which was the first bad sign considering there was a 3rd piece of bread in there. The turkey was ok but the ham was minuscule and looked like Walmart pressed ham... Yuck! And the lettuce; one little sliver of iceberg. Waste of money!
