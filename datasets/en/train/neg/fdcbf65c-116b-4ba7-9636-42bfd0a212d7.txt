I have never stayed at Diamond Resorts International, but after watching a Undercover Boss episode on CBS I have decided I never will. The CEO of the company Stephen Cloobeck was not the most emphatic person (which is a polite way to say he treated a lot of his employees like a real jerk). In some instances, he was downright mean and abusive in his positional authority. I would not support an organization that does not support and treat its employees with dignity and respect. It would be great if he took he meaning of YES and applied it to his Diamond Resorts International employees and guests alike!
