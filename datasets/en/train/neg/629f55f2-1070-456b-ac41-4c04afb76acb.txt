I FUCKING LOVE PIZZA! The end.

I try things over and over, sometimes when they suck too. Same is the case here. I keep trying this pizza and eveytime I just don't like it. I don't know what it is. 

Sauce = Bland

Crust = Bland and did not pass the NY fold test, full on Tip Drip!!

Truly they're better places than this in AZ. I don't want to mention them in this article but 3 or 4 come to mind. 

 P.S. This time when I tried the pizza I was swimming laps outside.....in the heat..... That makes me soooo hungry. Our friends ordered it and thats why I had it again. As hungry as I was I still no likey!!!
