Unless you get Holly to cut your hair avoid this location at all cost. She seems to be the only person in the entire place that understands she is supposed to listen to what the customer wants. 

I recently got my haircut there from someone other than Holly and was absolutely butchered, easily the worst haircut of my life. Not only did the "stylist" not listen to what I wanted but she was borderline argumentative. 

In short, if you walk into this location looking to get a haircut and Holly isn't there, just turn around and walk out.
