Okay, so I haven't stayed here yet but I will be flying down to AZ tomorrow.  I did want to let other people know now, however, that if you are planning to stay here with kids who need a crib, you either better bring your own sleeping device or look somewhere else.
I called to confirm the crib in our room and the woman at the front desk told me that she would not let her own child sleep in one of their cribs... so, we are lugging our own travel crib down which was not part of the plan.  Just wanted other people to know as this is touted as a 'family' hotel.
