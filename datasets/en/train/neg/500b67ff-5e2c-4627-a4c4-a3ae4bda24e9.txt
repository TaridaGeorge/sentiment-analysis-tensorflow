I wish I could give it no stars. I had lunch there, and the service was terrible. I don't think I ever got a refill on my drink. Also, I went with 6 people and not one person liked their overprice food. The fish tasted like it had been soaked in grease and had no flavor, the soup tasted like someone just threw tomatoes in the blender and there was just nothing good about the place. Skip it, even if you have a free voucher from the hotel.
