It's too bad you can rate a store ZERO stars. Dillards is by far the worst store on the mall - especially the shoe department. Every time in the last 2 years I have walked through, not one person has even looked at me. I tried to get a pair of sale shoes the other day, but they didn't have my size, and the girl told me there was "no way" she could look to see if another store had them. We send people to the moon and you can't even LOOK for a pair of shoes.
