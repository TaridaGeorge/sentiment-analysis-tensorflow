Yuck!  I swear I used to love the grilled cheese sandwhich and tater tots.  The food has just been disgusting the last 3 times I went.  I will NOT be going back.  The grilled cheese has hardly any cheese in it.  Texas toast with a butter smearing amount of cheese between the two slices.  The tater tots taste cold and stale like they have been sitting around for hours.  Ick.
