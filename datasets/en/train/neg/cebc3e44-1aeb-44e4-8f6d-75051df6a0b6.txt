Warning to parents:  the wave pool is not safe for children under the age of eight. My five year old is a strong swimmer (Gold Medal Swim School in Chandler for 3 years) and almost drowned due to a current created by the waves. The lifeguard posted right above her made no move to rescue her until I told him she was drowning. She was crying for help but he didn't hear her.   I thought this would be a gentle pool as it was for a child's birthday party.  If I would have known the strength of the waves I would had my swimsuit on and my daughter in a life vest. I hope the lifeguard finds a different summer job- he almost lost a little girl literally under his nose.
