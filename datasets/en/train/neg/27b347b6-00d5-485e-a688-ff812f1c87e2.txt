I saw good review on yalp so I visited Dr. Dachs.
Instead of crown he filled my tooth. The pain last. I visited doctor again  and he took x-ray.he said it look fine but it was the big filling so I may feel pain foe a while to recover.
After 6 month I was in pain ,3rd visit to Dr.Dachs.
He took x-ray and it was fine.He asked me use SENSODYNE.

Well ,Dr. Dachs I' went to different dentist.
You've missed crack on my tooth.
I have to get root canal and new crown.

No wonder SENSODYNE won't work.

If you dentist can not fix tooth pain and ask you to use Sensodyne.
DO NOT TRUST YOUR DENTIST.
