The salespeople here need a serious lesson in manners. Just because you work where they sell nice clothes does not give you the right to act like a snob and look down on people. It doesn't matter if I am here to drop a few hundred bucks, the women here look at you like you're dirt. I have given this store multiple chances and the service is so awful I would not recommend coming here unless you're ready to throw back some dirty looks. I don't understand how these people got hired and why they haven't been fired but here's a piece of advice...SMILE. Offer help. Don't look and treat people like you're better than them. If you hate your job, quit. You're making people miserable when shopping is supposed to be enjoyable.
