We have tried this place twice.  Both times have been horrible.  We stopped in and stood at the counter for about 10 minutes while the girl ignored us.  Finally, after an excuse me, she helped us.  Maybe their other food is good, but the salads were horrible.  There was about a 1/2" of water in the bottom of the bowls, the large salad I ordered was the same size as the dinner salad at twice the price.  Whatever they put in it was awful tasting.  I would not recommend, at least the location at 40th St & Bell to anyone.
