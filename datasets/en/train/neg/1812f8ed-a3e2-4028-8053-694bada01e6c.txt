Ick!
Staff service was very good and that's about the only positive thing to say about this place.

Food is pretty horrible. Don't order the corned beef unless you want thin, flavorless, fatty meat severed with a side of mushy, greasy vegetables. The tables are gross, looks like they haven't been cleaned in days and not sure why the waitresses don't wipe them down before serving customers. Really icky.

Sure this is a decent place to grab a beer, but not if you want to eat, talk and enjoy.

Definitely won't be going back.
