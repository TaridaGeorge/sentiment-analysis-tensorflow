If you're in a hurry, or maybe even have a little time to kill before your flight, DO NOT come here. While the servers are somewhat friendly, the entire restaurant seems to be in some type of time warp where "slow" is the only kind of time there is. Many airport restaurants are geared to get you on your way pronto, but this isn't one of them

And the food, OMG, the food here is disgusting! We ordered the pulled pork sandwich and pot roast... I can honestly say that I've had frozen TV dinners that tasted far better than the slop it took the cook sooooo long to throw on that plate. Just awful, pathetic, and BLEH

The only redeeming quality about FNSB is that they serve Sam Adams beer
