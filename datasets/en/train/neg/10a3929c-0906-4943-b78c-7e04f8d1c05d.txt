I'm kind of surprised by the good reviews for this plase.  Y'all must love your $40 bottles of Ravenswood.  There is hardly anything on this wine list you can't find at Safeway and the prices are waaaay jacked up.  I'm the first to admit I can be a bit of a wine snob, my best friend in NOLA is a sommelier and she taught me a lot about wine AND what I should be paying for it.  This place fails on all counts.  Service is crappy, wine list is boring, and although everywhere of course has a markup from retail cost - this place takes it to the extreme.  This wines at Postinos, Sportsmans and our dearly departed Bomberos were much more interesting and reasonable.
