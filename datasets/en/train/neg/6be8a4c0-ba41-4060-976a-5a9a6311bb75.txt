My family insists on going to this Chipotle because they like the food.  I go next door to AJ's and buy my food because I would never eat in a place this FILTHY!  Every time I go, same thing.  I complained to management and they don't seem to care.  Doesn't matter what time we go - busy or not, tables are never cleaned, floor has food all over it.  And the bathroom?  Ugh - I won't even go there.  The health dept really needs to pay this place a visit!
