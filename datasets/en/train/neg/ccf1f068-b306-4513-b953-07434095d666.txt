This particular Harkins sucked the big one, when I used to go while living on the West side. After a few annoying experiences with the patrons and local gang bangers (one of the same in most cases), I quickly switched to the Harkins on Northern and the 101, until I escaped to the East side.

Yeah, two aggravating things come to mind when I think of this place, extremely loud in there every time and all the pot smoke clouds you get to walk through on your dangerous trek from your car to the front doors. Classy place...If you're a low life scum bag.
