Modern Steak is probably not the type of place you want to go to if you're "not white".. my experience at this place was sooooo horrible that I would never come back. Not only were their food bad but they made us wait 40 mins (that was with reservation) and there was plenty of seats that were available, they told us that there was no waiter in those empty section but once we were sat down outside in the patio, we saw them filling those empty seating with white patrons. This place is so racist that I was surprise that they didn't ask us to leave from the back door. I can't believe there are still places like this!!!
