This is the worst Chinese food you will ever eat. Then, you'll get to taste it again as it comes back up. I had the worst bout with food poisoning of my entire life after eating here. Perhaps it was just their almond chicken, but I won't be going back to eat any of their other dishes ever again. I warn everyone I can about this place when it comes up in conversation. If you want good Chinese, drive a little bit further southwest to Big Heng on 75th and Peoria. Far superior food for less money, and you won't throw it up.
