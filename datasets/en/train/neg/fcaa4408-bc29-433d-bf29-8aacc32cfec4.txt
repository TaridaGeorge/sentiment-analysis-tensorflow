Even though I booked the Tour through the internet submitted my credit card, At the end of the Tour they asked for the print out of our credit Card and they run though it old fashion way.  The Tour was ok, BUT the minute they got my CREDIT CARD number, there were 2 attempt to use my card in New York City while we were in Arizona ( one for $600- which was denied and another one for $501- from the Rite Aid in the Bronx, NY which was approved ). I do Not recommend them.
