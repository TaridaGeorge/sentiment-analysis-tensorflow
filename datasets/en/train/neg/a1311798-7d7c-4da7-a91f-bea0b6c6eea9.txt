This. Place. Was. FILTHY.  Oh my gosh.  It looked like the aftermath of a food fight - bagel chunks and crumbs all over the floor.  I won't get started on the bathroom, it was so disgusting.  

The owner, the Bagel Man himself, was too busy chatting with another employee to greet me or wait on me.  A nice lady from the kitchen had to come out and help.  Apparently though, nobody but the owner is allowed to handle the money so he finally broke off his conversation and rang up the sale.  I didn't like the way he treated the nice lady and I was troubled by the way she seemed overly deferential to him and almost frightened.  

Bagels are okay but nothing special.

Would NOT go back!  If the customer are is that dirty, what can the kitchen be like???
