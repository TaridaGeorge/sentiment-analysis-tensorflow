After working for someone who was on their VIP list and then planning my own trips, I've realized there are definitely two levels of customer service: those who arrive at the drop off in a Mercedes and those who get dropped off by the bus.  I personally try to avoid flying in general because big crowds, undetermined schedules, and confined spaces just scream potential chaos situation, but I definitely avoid US Airways because, as a member of the non-VIP crowd, I've always experienced horrible customer service.  It is common, in the travel sector, to deal with delays and schedule changes due to weather or other issues, however, it's completely unnecessary to remind me, by your tone of voice, that I do not provide the company with enough cashflow/year to be considered important.

Unless you fly first-class on a weekly basis, you won't get much customer service from them.
