This place is ok not somewhere would make a reservation at. A girl from my high school made a resveration for a class reunion event and they lost her reservation. They kept shifting us around and told us as the group grows we will move you to a different area that is bigger. On top of that the nachos were greasy and disgusting. I waited a long time before the waitress gave me a refill on my soda. The rest of the group seemed satisfied with their food. I probaly won't there again.
