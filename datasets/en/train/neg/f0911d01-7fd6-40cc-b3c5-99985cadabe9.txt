Horrible customer service.  Everyone is completely rude.  If you're a guy there to buy a gift, you'll get looked at like you're from Mars or some kind of pervert.  Elsa in particular is horrible.  She is condescending, obnoxious, and unhelpful, which may be why the rest of her subordinates are the same way.  I tried to address my bad experience with her and she tried to put it back on me.  Maybe the people working there are so brainwashed they don't realize how snotty they are to people.  I usually have a miserable experience at this store, with the passive-aggressive salespeople who ignore you, then are astounded that you want help, then rush to help you and get you out, all while using corporate-speak to pretend they're nice. H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E.

Tempe location is MUCH better, I gave it 4 stars because people actually help you there.
