My mother was looking forward to celebrating her birthday and having fancy transportation. So she was thrilled when Deal Chicken offered round trip transport and made a reso 2 MONTHS in advance. However when we went to confirm with Chris, he informed us that he had ignored our reservation since we did not have an exact destination. We should have been informed of our cancellation instead of finding out 2 days before our big night out. Please do not use this company as there are plenty of others that can offer great customer service and are neither rude nor short with their paying customers!
