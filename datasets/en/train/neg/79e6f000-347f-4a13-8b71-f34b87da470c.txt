This gyro was possibly the worst gyro I have ever laid teeth on... The meat way dry and it just was no good quality. It was also too expensive for what it was. ALSO places that are Greek or Mexican ect that serve hamburgers freak me out!!!

OH and the parking lot is GHETO!!! it is shared with a liquor store and has about 7 available spots.  DONT GO THERE AT NIGHT!!!
