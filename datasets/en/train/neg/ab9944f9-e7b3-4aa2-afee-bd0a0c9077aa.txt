I visited this store while i was on vacation and this was the worst Buckle I've been. The sales people were very rude to me. Usually they are all around you trying to help you out and suggest thing, but here they gave me dirty looks and didn't acknowledge me or my friend. Instead the girl helped out someone else. I left immediately. This has been the unfriendlyist store I've been in. Some of the clothes are over priced too.
