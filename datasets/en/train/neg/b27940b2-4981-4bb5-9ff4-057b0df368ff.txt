Ugh. I don't like giving a tough review, but this is a store that needs to address a couple things.

1. The Service: Long lines and unpleasant cashiers. 
2. Outdated Store: This wouldn't be so obvious if they just did a little cleanup and merchandising.
3. Produce: Maybe in this store they should just no offer produce. The little corner in the store makes you think it was an afterthought. 

I think just a couple things that wouldn't cost much money would go a long way in making this store a go to place for me. Not there right now.
