I often visit the Scottsdale location and just love it, so I was excited to try the downtown location. I ordered my favorite dish: kung pao mock chicken. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It wasn't even close to as spicy as it should be and the brown rice was severely undercooked. I will definitely give it another shot, since I love the menu so much, but this particular visit was disappointing.
