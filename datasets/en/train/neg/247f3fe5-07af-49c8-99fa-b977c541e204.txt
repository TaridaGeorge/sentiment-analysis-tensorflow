If you are into that see and be seen, well scene then this is a place you might like. The food was over priced, and ok... I guess. The service was horrible. Snotty, I'm too hot to be a waiter , what the hll do you want, attitudes totally ruined the experience for me. 

For better, cheaper Italian food drive a couple miles south to Sauce. Same company, waaaaaaay better business model well, for us simple folk anyway.
