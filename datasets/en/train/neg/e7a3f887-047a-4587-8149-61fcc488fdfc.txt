I was very unimpressed. 

We started ordering our food and some college kid actually pushed in front of us while we were placing an order and started ordering his own food. The woman at the counter turned away from us and decided to help the kid who had just walked in a stepped in front. When we were able to order one of our meals was forgotten. After requesting the forgotten food the woman brought it out and slammed it down on our table. It was all a very strange and confusing experience, as we were being polite and friendly despite the terrible service. 

To top off terrible service the steak lunch special came out as strips of fat. I do not often give bad ratings; I feel that they are reserved for the rare combination of poor service, unappealing environment and bad food. This place had all 3.
