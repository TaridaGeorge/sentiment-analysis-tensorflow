Sooooo overrated.  I've been here three times now and this last time will be my last.  I don't mind a wait if the food and experience are worth it, but when you finally get seated at a teeny table with  not enough room for the plate, coffee cup and flatware and then the menu is limited to Denny's fare and just a hair above their quality....well, just go to Denny's.  I haven't been to Denny's in ten years; it will be longer than that before I go back to Matt's Big Breakfast.  Not a fan of greasy food.
