Really dissapointing. I went in for carry out (was just hoping to get a Bahn Mi sandwich). I waited almost 20 minutes and felt that the lady that took my order could have cared less that I was there - she was cold.

The sandwich was tiny (compared to other Bahn Mi I have had) and it did not taste real fresh. 

On this one, I suggest you pass.
