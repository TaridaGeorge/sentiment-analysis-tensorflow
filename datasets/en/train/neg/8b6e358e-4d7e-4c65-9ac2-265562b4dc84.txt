I got caught up in the whole bank locally thing and switched from Chase to Desert Schools.  One of the biggest things I expected was that the customer service would be far superior to that of the big national banks.  Wrong.  

Most of the tellers are, for the most part, nice enough, but the people on the phone are rude, deceitful and spiteful and will do things to make your life miserable if you disagree with them.  One guy there cancelled my debit card just to be an a**hole and his supervisor stood behind his indefensible actions.  Hence, I just closed my account and went to BBVA Compass.  Wow, what a difference.
