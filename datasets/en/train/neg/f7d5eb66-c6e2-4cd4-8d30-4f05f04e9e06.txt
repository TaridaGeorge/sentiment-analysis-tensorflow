While I do not disagree that the staff there is pleasant, I had the unfortunate need to use their services for a small wound that needed stitches and my regular Vet was closed.  I walked out with a bill for over $800.  This is completely ridiculous!  Buyer beware that in times when people are having to make cutbacks in their budgets, this office is contributing to people being forced to not seek proper care for their beloved pets.  Please seek reasonably priced care elsewhere.
