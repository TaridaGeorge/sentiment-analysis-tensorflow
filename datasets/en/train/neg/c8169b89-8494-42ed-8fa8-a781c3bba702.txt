Bland Bland Chicken!! You would think if they specialize in chicken that it would be good, if not great. Not even close. The chicken had absolutely no flavor. The only thing that was good was the sweet tea & even that I've had better when I make it at home. If you have taste buds; DON'T EVEN BOTHER!!
