I went to Wholly Grill last month based on the Yelp reviews. I've been to the Philippines a couple of times and have eaten all the native dishes. I had two barbeque pork skewers with the rice, carrots and brocoli. I normally don't like to review a place after one visit, but realistically, I don't find myself too excited to go back and give them another try.

The BBQ was meh. The yellowing brocoli and carrots were heavily drenched in pepper, not very appetizing.
