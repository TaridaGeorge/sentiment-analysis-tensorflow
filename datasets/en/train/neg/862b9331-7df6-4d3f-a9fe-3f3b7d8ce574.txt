The management of this restaurant has no idea what customer service is about.  The staff made a commitment concerning a promotion they were running.  The manager reversed the commitment a t the end of the meal, and was very rude about it, as well.  This used to be one of my regular favorites, but I will not set foot in this place again.  A letter to the corporate office in Colorado was ignored.  Red Robin sees its customers as a wallet and an open mouth - no more.  Do yourself a favor and go to a restaurant that values your business!!!
