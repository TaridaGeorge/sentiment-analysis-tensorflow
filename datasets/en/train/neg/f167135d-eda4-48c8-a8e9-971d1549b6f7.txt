Racist pharmacy employees. I was on vacation and needed a prescription filled for emergency dental surgery because I was in pain. I used the same insurance card I use at the Target Pharmacy on the East Coast. The employee did not recognize the card, denied there was coverage and asked if I was on some type of Government insurance because I was African American. The employee assumed I was on welfare. I am not.
