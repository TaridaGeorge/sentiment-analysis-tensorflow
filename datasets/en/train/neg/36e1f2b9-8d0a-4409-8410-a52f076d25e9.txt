Terrible service and overpriced.  Didn't get my reservation correct and had to change hotels mid stay do to front desk mistake.  Drinks are way over priced.  Staff is stuck up.  Water spots on the roof everywhere. My tv didn't work ... At all!  And managements response to all of these was sorry.  Not a solution.  By the way I am a platinum Marriott member with over 200 nights in a Marriott this year alone ... Save yourself the hassle and stay at the Hilton!
