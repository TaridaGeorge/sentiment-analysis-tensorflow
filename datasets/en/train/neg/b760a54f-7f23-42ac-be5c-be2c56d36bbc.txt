Never again... if they had a 0 star I would give it. I am from California and I love sushi. This place didn't even have the happy greeting you get when you enter a REAL sushi bar.

Over priced sushi, small  rolls, slow service and we went on a Sunday  in the late afternoon  and it was pretty dead. 

Good for: Nothing
