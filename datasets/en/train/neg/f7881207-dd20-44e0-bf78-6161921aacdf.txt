This place is NOT a 4 star hotel as they try to state they are.  We paid $300 a night expecting to have a nice experience at what is supposed to be a guest only water park. The park was just like any other public water park. There was absolutely no place to sit and the chairs if you could find one were cheap with cheap towels.  We never even made it to our room as we checked out as soon as we experienced the pool.  BTW we found out that they constantly run special pricing cutting room rates to about 100 a night.  This is why the water park is packed and for those of us that expect to receive  4star $300 a night hotel service will be out of luck at this hotel. Might be worth it if you get one of their cheap deals.
