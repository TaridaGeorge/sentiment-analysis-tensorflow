This is my second time visitng since we live in the area.  The first time was average and the second and last time to visit was disgustingly unprofessional.  The overly loud and uninviting climate of the restaurant masks the distinguishing and historical architecture. I was very excited to be revisitng the place to discover more about it, but it all changed...

  Most of all, the service was outright unprofessional and rude.  After making a huge attempt to go out of our way to be kind to the waiter, he just kept barking at us and insulted us.  This extremely angry person ruined every shred of your dignity.

A plead to Hanny's management: i know most of your clientele are tourists, but to keep locals coming back, please hire persons who actually want to work there in the service industry.
