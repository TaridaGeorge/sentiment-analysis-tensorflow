I grew up and lived in Chicago for over 42 years, so I think I am a pretty good judge of what makes a good beef sandwich and hotdog. However the sandwich at this place that tries to pass it's self off as a Chicago beef is simply disgusting. It had the worst aftertaste, and why? Beef should not have a funky after taste.

The hot giardiniera was gross, not even something as good as what you can find at any Chicago grocery store.

The hotdog was Vienna, I believe, and it tasted average.

Overall this place is super expensive (almost $7.00 for a beef, what???) for what you get and tastes bad... Do yourself a favor and go to Al's in Scottsdale or Al's Chicago Style Hot Dogs & More in Gilbert for a real Chicago beef and hotdog. Don't waste your money here.
