Every great airline they've absorbed (America West, Piedmont, republic, Empire), they've turn to crap. I truly hate traveling with them and only use them when Southwest does not have a good time or flights to destinations. Pay for checked bags ($20 for first bag), meals ($7 for bistro meal), and most insulting for pillow and blanket ($7). Southwest still gives you a break on the bags and pillows, and at least gives you peanuts or pretzels. I've flown over a million miles in my career. Could care less if I fly one more mile, especially on Useless Air.
