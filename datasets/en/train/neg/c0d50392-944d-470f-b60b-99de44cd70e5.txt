Read the reviews, had high hopes. Ordered 2 fish tacos. Not bad, but not good enough for me to seek them out again. The tortillas were really good! Also had an order of jalape√±o poppers, not worth the $6 I paid for them. Didn't even finish them. They were hard and again just nothing special. Probably won't go back here, but I love Mexican so I can't say never! Lol. Just wasn't impressed at all and was wondering why it was so highly rated.
