mostly a rip off. but it's not their fault...entirely. we too had a restaurant.com coupon and yes, still wound up paying 22 bucks for 2 rolls, 2 sashimi, and an octopus salad. 
yes, the decor is cool (all ikea...they left the stickers on everything). but the sushi is barely average. way better and way cheaper at sapporo, ra, pearl, geisha happy hours. 
what miffed us the most was the 18% gratuity. sure, we know it's the coupons' fault for adding that, but paying that much gratuity for "counter order" food and not a single follow-up from the staff is absolutely ridiculous. 
glad this place is more than 5 miles from us so we won't consider it again.
