I saw another review this place as great, so I had to weigh in.  It's crap.  I wish I liked it, but I can't imagine have any worse Italian food.  I would rather just have a bowl or cereal at home.  If you want food without flavor, this is your place.

I guess the building is cool looking from the outside...just don't venture in!  I hate being such a downer, but we all need fair warning.
