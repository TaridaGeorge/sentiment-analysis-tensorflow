The food tasted fine, but no veggies, cheap, cheap, cheap with the rice. No sauces with dishes to put on that bland rice. The dinner portions were smaller than a kids meal at pei Wei. We ordered the 4 course and both left hungry. I said something, and the waiter agreed it was a rip off, but nothing happened. I even left the promo behind for a free appetizer next time. I was fuming at the price and skimpy portions, so I called and talked ton a manger, who invalidated the complaint and did not seem to care. So, the ne star is for those cutting back portions but wanting to pay $20. a person for kids meals.
