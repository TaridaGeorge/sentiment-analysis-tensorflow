Clumsy space delightful food, horrible lame service.. hostess wasn't very nice and the waiter was forgetful and spacey though he was VERY cute.. what happens when cute runs out?

I actually wrote Lisa G an email describing the bad spacey service and told her the name of the server. She then informed me that was one of her best servers and I had to be mistaken! The only mistake here would be ever going back! She showed me, huh?!

Single star for food only.
