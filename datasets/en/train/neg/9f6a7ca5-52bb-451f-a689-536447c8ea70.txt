This is the WORST airline ever. I will gladly be herded onto Southwest like some fat ass cattle rather than ever endure the torture of US Airways again.

How can any businesses possibly be such a mess? Ever since they were merged with craptastic America West it's been downhill. Every person from the counter bitches to the flight attendants were out of control rude. It's clear this airline does not value their customers.  The flight attendants were so rude on my last flight that it shocked me. 

And now you want to charge me $30 for an aisle seat. Fuck you!

And don't tell me it's just the industry that's taking a dive because riding on Jet Blue is like going to freaking Disneyland! Polite customer service people, happy flight attendants, snacks, tv's, on time arrivals.... dignity.
