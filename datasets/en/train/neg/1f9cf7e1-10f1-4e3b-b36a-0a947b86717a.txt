Do Not buy this deal. It's a new owner that does not honor the deal and made me pay even though I had already paid Yelp. I took my son there today and not only would the new owner not honor the deal but he was rude. The haircut was nothing special. Just a trim. Could've gotten the same anywhere else. Sad, he just lost 3 customers because both my boys & husband have been going there for years. But, looks like a new staff too. Oh, he was 20 minutes late to open too. Not a very good business owner.
