NO, NO, NO!!!  The Number One rule for a restaurant or any other business has got to be that you don't try to cheat the customer!  I went to the Web site for this place before going there for lunch today, & wrote down what I planned to order, including these items:

Plinchik 2pc. $2.49

Somsa 2 pc. $2.49


What he tried to charge me:

Plicnik 2 pc. $3.99     :-O

Somsa:  "You have to pay for 4 at $9.99."     :-O

I also had an Uzbek Salad & a Lamb Kebab Sandwich.  It doesn't matter how the food was, because trying to cheat the customer on the money is SO NOT OK!!!
