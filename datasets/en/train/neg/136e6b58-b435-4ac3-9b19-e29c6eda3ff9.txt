They make nice stuff but it's not amazing. They have a lot of hidden costs such as $7 because you didn't buy the shirt there. They claim are a set up fee but things are all done on the computer.....$7 to type?! When it's all said and done you have paid for $2 of work and $14 of fees. I'll gladly take my business elsewhere.
