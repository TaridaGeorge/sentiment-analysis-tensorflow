I had a chat with the owners when I walked in here one day with a friend. They're very friendly and I wish them the best. Unfortunately, they'll need more than just my wishes because this endeavor of theirs is not going to work. The food is sub-par. The venue is some sort of an attempt at the fast food concept, except with none of the conveniences that actually come with fast food. There's no desire to drive to this place to sit down and eat. Which leaves only the desire to drive there, pick up food, and leave, if the food was delicious. But the food, again, is sub-par. Sadly, I cannot reward such poor execution with anything more than one star.
