A friend and I decided to try Wallys because they were having a prime rib special. The internet and menu stated the special was available after 4PM. We arrived at 4:15. The waiter said that it would be an hour before the prime rib was ready. We asked to speak with the owner. He came over and we explained that we came beause of the special and it would not be ready for another hour. He started screaming at us and told us to leave. He said 4PM was a typo on the internet and also on his menu. He told us to leave his restaurant and never come back. We were so scared that he would get violent. He definately has a mental condition.
