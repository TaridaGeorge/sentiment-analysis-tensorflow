The service is horrible, I asked if I could change my order before she even entered it into the computer, and she told me no. When I got the sandwich it was dry and bland, the bun was hard and dry but the worst was the fries, a couple of them were still frozen and a couple were rapped in hair. Gross. Not a place I will go back too.
