Groupon offered a $1 lunch deal yesterday at Rosatis, so I thought I'd give them a second chance. It turns out I just wasted my time. When I showed up to pick up my order I was told that my $1 deal was supposed to be a $15 deal and that if I wanted to pay an extra $14 I could get my food. This is wrong on several levels, one of them being that it seems pretty obvious they were trying to cheat Groupon. Venders get 50% of the Groupon price, so if it was really $15, they would have only received $7.50. 

I left without my food, which I assume they had to throw away, because they wouldn't honor their Groupon.
