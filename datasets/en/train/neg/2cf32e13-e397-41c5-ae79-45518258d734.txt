Do not use the drive-thru at this location! They have messed up my order 5 out of 5 times I have used the drive up. They act like they don't care. My husbands sandwich toppings end up on mine, mine end up on his and we have never gotten a sandwich made correctly. Save yourself the annoyance of paying $7 for a sandwich just to get it wrong.
