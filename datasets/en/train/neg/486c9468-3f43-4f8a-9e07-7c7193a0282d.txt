"Don't know, don't care...that's our motto at Best Buy."

Have been to several locations over the last several years. In the last four, they all seem to have gone downhill--even the newer locations. They either dodge you like a bullet--heaven forbid the customer might need assistance!--or they approach you but then stand there scratching themselves, never dreaming they need to know something about their product line because a customer might actually have a question.

I think awhile back Best Buy decided they no longer needed to be competitive, and have been riding a wave for some time now. But that can't last forever.  

As far as I'm concerned, their demise can't come soon enough.
