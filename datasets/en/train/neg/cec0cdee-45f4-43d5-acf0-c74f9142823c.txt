Smashburger?  More like...SALTburger.  Went here last night after hearing good things from friends and fellow yelpers....left disappointed with swollen tongues and greasy fingers. Between the two of us we ordered the BBQ Bacon burger(added the fried egg), Mushroom Swiss burger, regular fries and onion strings.  The burgers, while seemingly good at the initial few bites, soon covered our hands with grease and the fries/onion strings COATED in salt were nothing special. The flavor of the burgers was ruined because all we could taste was SALT!!!  For $25... we'll keep our money; and blood pressure at a normal level.
