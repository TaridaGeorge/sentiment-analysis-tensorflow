My friend and i drove 25 miles to get to a yoga class at 2:00pm, we get there 5 minutes late and they did not let us in.  We did all we could to get there on time and the lady at the front desk asked us to leave and to arrive on time next time.  

I asked her since we drove such a long way to come to this place can we get in?  She still said no.  I felt so hurt at all the effort we put in.  She was looking at us funny because I am Mexican and my friend is Black.  We have both practiced yoga for a while now.

Since then, I will not got back due to poor customer response.  I will not recommend this place to any of my friends.
