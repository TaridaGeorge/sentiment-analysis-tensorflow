This place is horrible. In contact with the Atty General to go after them.  My 70+ year old parents went in with a coupon. Where told they needed a new AC compressor and other parts for a total over a $1000.00. That they could finance the repair.  

Thank God I checked it out first.  They just needed a few dollars worth of freon. My parents went in with a coupon, thinking they were getting their car serviced. Instead they were in the den of these heartless wolves.  taking advantage of retired people. Playing on their worries and fears.  Do they need money so bad to steal from customers?   Boycott them.
