I live nearby so we thought we'd drop by- big mistake. We called so we could take it home-it began with them being out of a menu item then we had to press them to add a side (which COMES with the meal!). When we arrived, they charged us for an extra entree and they were not very friendly when we pointed this out. The meal was HORRIBLE. The eggplant was soggy, NOTHING like the picture, and VERY SMALL. Not at all worth the price. The brownoli was blah (tasted like it came out of a box). We walked away feeling ripped off- we would never return here.
