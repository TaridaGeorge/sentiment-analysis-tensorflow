This is the most overrated place in Scottsdale.  I went two weeks ago for my buddy's birthday.  The girls up front were rude.  In addition, the menu was the most over-priced I have seen.  so I figured that the food would be good.  The chilean seabass was the most sodium-ridden piece of fish I ever had, and I wound up feeling ill.  BUYER BEWARE--STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE.
