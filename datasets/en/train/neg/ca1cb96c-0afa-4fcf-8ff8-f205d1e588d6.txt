This property just lost a customer, and everybody we tell about our stay.  Do not fall for the free breakfast bit.  We booked through Priceline, which indicates a free breakfast.  We had a sub-par breakfast -which would have been fine if it were included.  However, we were charged almost $30.00 for two.  When we told the front desk Priceline indicates the breakfast was free, they referred us to the small print.  I asked "what can you do for us?"  The reply was, "nothing."  Small print or no small print, a property that is unwilling to comp a breakfast to save a customer - when they certainly have the ability to do so - is not going to get my business.  What was supposed to be a short one-night getaway for a weary mom and dad of young children ended on a very sour note.
