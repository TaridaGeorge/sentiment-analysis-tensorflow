Very poor service.  Went in for late afternoon lunch (3:00) and the restaurant was less than half full but looked like a good number of servers working.  We were sat at a table and there we sat for 10 minutes without ever being acknowledged by any of the servers that walked by our table - after 10 min we walked out.   Good service isn't hard people - it's not rocket science.
