How does this place have such a high rating? 
The sandwiches are bland and unimaginative, the potato salad I ordered had more onions in it than potatoes, and the servers were impatient and snooty.
I am not a picky eater. I sampled a couple of different things here and I didn't like any of it. I feel like I could make a better sandwich at home for 1/4 the price.  Which is what I would recommend doing if you're thinking about trying this place for the first time. Save your money, Nana's is too expensive for the quality of "food" they're offering.

Nana's Sandwich Saloon: Come for the uncomfortable wicker furniture, stay for the lack-luster sandwiches.
