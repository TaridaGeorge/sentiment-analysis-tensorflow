DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!! YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! OUR CAR FAIL OFF HIS "TOW DOLLY" & RICHARD (TOW DRIVER) BLAMES US "THE CUSTOMER" FOR HIS COSTLY DISASTER! BROKE THE RADIATOR & THE WHOLE FRONT CLIP OF THE CAR!! MATTER WHAT YOU DO WITH ANY TOW COMPANY IN THIS SITUATION....DO NOT SETTLE OUTSIDE ON NOT USING THEIR INS. CLAIM!!! MY SITUATION IS IN THE PROCESS ON GOING TO COURT NOW AND ALSO!!.....DURING THAT INCIDENT HE STILL TRIED TO CHARGE US FOR A TOWING FEE!! ALSO WE DID GET THE COPS INVOLVED BECAUSE HIM & HIS BODY SHOP BUDDY TRIED TO KEEP OUR CAR!!
