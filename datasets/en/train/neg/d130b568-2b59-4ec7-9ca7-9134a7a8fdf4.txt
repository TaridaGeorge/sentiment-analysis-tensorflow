Service wasn't that great and the "bouncer" had a real attitude with people. It was my birthday weekend and I thought this place would be a cool place to have it. Yeah...not so much. I was really disappointed with his customer service and peoples attitudes. It was suppose to be a cheery event, so we went to prime bar and salt turned out to be a great night after we left this place.
