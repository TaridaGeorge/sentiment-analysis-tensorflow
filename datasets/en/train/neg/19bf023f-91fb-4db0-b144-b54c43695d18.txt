Horrible customer service. I ordered flowers online for Mother's Day, and they called to tell me they needed $5 to make the delivery. They didn't seem to care that a $5 was going to make them lose out on a customer and lose out on a $45 sale. They cancelled the order immediately. 

They should have eaten the cost and fixed their website. 

I will NEVER order flowers from them again.
