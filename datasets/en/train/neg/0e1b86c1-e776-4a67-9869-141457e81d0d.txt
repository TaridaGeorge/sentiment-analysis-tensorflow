Food tasteless. Sad, it used to be my favorite for Mexican food. The salsa was bland and that was a sign of bad news. I had pork Chimi Grande dinner and the pork was very dry, no seasoning, and tasteless. The refried beans and even the dang rice had no flavor. Sat 10 minutes after eating to get bill. Must be under new management because I will no longer drive 13 miles one way to eat there anymore.
