We were driving around Chandler area to find a decent place to eat and Mido Sushi caught our attention. "Oh, Okay!" - I thought and walked right in. We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying!
The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasn't as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced. 
Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far.
