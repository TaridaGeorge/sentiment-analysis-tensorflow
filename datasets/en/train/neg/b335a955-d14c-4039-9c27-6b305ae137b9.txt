Well, This review is based on the sushi alone --- so 1 star. If I was reviewing the bar - 5 stars!

Anyway --- If you actually enjoy RA Sushi, I wonder if you're only eating Vegas Rolls and potsickers. I know your type: New to sushi, want to get drunk with your friends and pretend to actually enjoy raw fish. I know, I know...you're in college and it's Mill Ave. 

I am fine to get trashed here, I LOVE their bartenders and inventive drinks...but the food is nast. 

That's RA in a nutshell.
