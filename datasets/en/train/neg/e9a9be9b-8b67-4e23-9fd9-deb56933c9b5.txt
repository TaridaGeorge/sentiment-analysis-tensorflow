The WORST service I've ever experienced.  I love the sushi, but I will never go in there again.  If anything, I may order takeout....but even then the service is rude and slow.   On three different occasions with three different servers,  I was treated with a bad attitude.  My iced tea wasn't refilled for 45 minutes....I asked my server several times and she gave me her pointer finger and told me "one sec".  I asked another waitress to refill it for me and she said "hold on, your server will be right with you".  I gave the place several chances, but each time the service was slow and ignorant.  Left a penny tip I was so pissed.
