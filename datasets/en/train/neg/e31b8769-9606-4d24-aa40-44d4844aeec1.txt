OH GEE I'm sorry I ever came here. Then again, it could have been what I ordered--Pollo Pizzaola. I should have stuck to regular bar food, but I just wasn't in the mood for a burger, pizza or wings. 

IF you decide to eat here just realize they have one type of sauce, pizza sauce and it's not that great. There are lot's of other places in the area with better food. 

Please don't waste your  money eating here.
