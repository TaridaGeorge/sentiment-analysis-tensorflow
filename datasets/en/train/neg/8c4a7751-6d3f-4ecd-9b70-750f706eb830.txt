Arg!!! They really need to get more employees or people just need to start using the self service machines for non-complex transactions.  Seriously its not that hard! I dread having to mail anything internationally because then I HAVE to take my package to the counter.  Line is always ridiculously long here.  Doesn't matter what time of the day either.  Honestly if you don't NEED to go to the counter use the self service mailing center or buy an inexpensive scale and print your postage labels from home.  Plus it's discounted online vs at the PO.
