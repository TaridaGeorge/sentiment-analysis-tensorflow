What can I say! The changes! McDonalds has been around forever! And now they want to change! Just because a few people wants to run our lives!! I get it! You can always make it an option! But no! You have to request fries! or soda! If I want a freakin apple or milk, I'll just eat at home! We come to the golden arches to get away from everyday life. Give me that processed food! That's why we come here for!!! Anyway, this location is like any other place. Good service, at least they try! You have to realize that if these workers were more valuable, they would be working somewhere else! Give these kids a break. We have all been there!
