Had breakfast this morning at Distrito, ordered the Distrito Eggs Benedict. I was thinking that was a safe bet, how do you screw up Eggs Benedict?  Well, I'll tell you:

The menu describes the dish as comprised of Chorizo, Black Truffle Hollandaise and Brioche. Sounds creative and yummy, right? Think again.

There was a SINGLE piece of unbuttered, generic egg bread toast, sliced diagonally. ON ONE SLICE was a poached egg. THE OTHER SLICE was completely dry. A poached egg laid on the plate, disconnected to the toast in any way. Also on the plate was a tablespoon of greasy fried chorizo, and another of non-descript Hollandaise. The entire thing was sprinkled with a confetti of some kind of sprouts or greens. I had this paltry offering and a cup of decaf - the bill (including 20% tip) came to $21!

Jose Garces, you should be ashamed. Literally, WTF?!!
