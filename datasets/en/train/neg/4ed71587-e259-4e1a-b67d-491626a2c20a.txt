I saw a coupon online for $50 off, so I called to get a quote on replacing my brake pads. I told him the make and model of my car, which is a fairly common non-luxury vehicle. He said he wouldn't know the cost until he saw it and I had to bring it in. He said it could be from $100 to $1000, but he wouldn't know until he did an inspection.
