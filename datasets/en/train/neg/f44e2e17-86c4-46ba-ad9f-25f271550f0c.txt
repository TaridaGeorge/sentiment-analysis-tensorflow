If I could give a 0 star, they'd own it.. I have nothing.. Not one positive to say about this bank. I wanted a local bank because most of my money is in USAA which used to be hard to make deposits to because they are based in San Antonio. BofA has fees upon fees.. Long lines at any lunch hour... Waits on phone , awful customer service.. Oh and the kicker.. I deposited a trust fund check.. From Vanguard!! They wouldn't let me have it for 10-14 days.. Despite that Vanguard had cleared the check with them.. I'm guaranteeing BofA made interest off of my $7k! Don't get me started on what they have done to our housing market.. Ahh.. Thank God I can bank with USAA..
