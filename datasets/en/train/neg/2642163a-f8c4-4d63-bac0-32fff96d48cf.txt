Pro:  had a groupon; cute waitresses; clean bathrooms; better than expected decor

Cons: Dirty dishes- came with a group of 4- two of the plates had food stains on it - 2 of the bowls for the soup had food particles on it - hard to get over that hump - food is mediocre and pretty tasteless  - if looking or Asian fusion, save yourself the time and money and jut head over to Pei Wei.

Flies liked our food, though
