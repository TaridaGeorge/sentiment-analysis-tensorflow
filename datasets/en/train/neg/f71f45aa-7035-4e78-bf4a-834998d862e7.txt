Food-wise, I think this place may have deserved 2 stars. I'm from the Bay Area, and the Thai food there is delicious!

The coconut soup wasn't what i expected-- the taste was okay, though a bit watery. I liked the lemongrass in it.  then we had Rama's Favorite, which was basically beef with peanut sauce. more like peanut butter-- the peanut was overpowering. 

the WORST part was the food poisoning-- both my fiance and i subsequently got vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. i even had to bring him to the ER, it was so bad. I see Thai Basil is generally well reviewed here on Yelp, so maybe it was just an off day? but just warning you-- something we ate there was bad, and I think it was the Rama's Favorite.
