If I could give it less than 1 star I would.  
I don't understand all the people raving about this place, the food is horrible. They must be friends or getting paid for their reviews. Every roll is a really bad California roll with Krab meat and horrible to mediocre toppings on top. I ordered a spicy tuna role since it's pretty hard to mess up, wow was I wrong. The roll was the nasty California role with chopped tuna on top and there was  absolutely no spice to the role. I was told by the waitress 'that's how we make our spicy roles'. This confused me  since the definition of spicy is ' seasoned with or containing spice'  so their spicy roles are not really spicy roles.  

I will give them this, the roles are big and inexpensive but who cares when they are basically inedible .
