I'll pretty much finish any sweet sitting within a 5 foot radius of my body, but I actually threw away half of this cupcake.

I've had many red velvet delicacies, to the point that I feel compelled to eat any offering of red velvet anything, especially cupcakes, and rationalize it as research.

This place is a catchy name, and that's where it begins and ends. The cupcake I had was very dry, and the icing was cheap and gross.  I've had better cupcakes by the dozen on sale from a grocery store.  I gave this place one start instead of two because I think even in my biggest sweet craving/desperation I would still bypass and just deal with the craving...
