We went to the Phoenix/Ahwatukee store and the service was horrible, we felt unwelcomed. When we picked up the suits, they did not bother looking at them instead they rushed me out the door. When I got home I see that the shirts fit, but they are not the style we ordered. My son's white suit came with black socks and shoes (we ordered white), and instead of the bow tie my son ordered they packed the suit with a tie. The guy was sitting there writing everything we asked for (so we thought), but our order was not accurate. We spent $314 to rent two suits (one adult/one child) and we expected better service than what we received. We will never rent or purchase from the Men's Wearhouse again.
