Sunday brunch was a huge disappointment. The place wasn't all that busy but, they were constantly running out of food and it took ages for them to bring more food out. 

They ran completely out of brisket at the carving station and replaced it with a RAW pork loin. It wasn't just undercooked, it was Red in the middle when they cut into it. They took it back and cooked it some more but then brought it back out to the carving station and served it directly on the cutting board where they had just cut the raw pork loin a few minutes earlier.

The fried chicken was like eating leather. We didn't even get to try several of the items because they were out and it took forever for the empty trays to be replaced.

Big disappointment. Will never go back.
