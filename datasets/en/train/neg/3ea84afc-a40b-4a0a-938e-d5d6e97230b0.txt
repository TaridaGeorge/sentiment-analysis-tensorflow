This store has been awful in regards to the customer service experience i have had.

A. I have apple-care on all my products yet this tore seems to beleive that this doesn't matter and they can simply pass the buck.

B. Made an appointment and it lasted all of 2 minutes and ended with the "genius" letting me know i shouldn't run so many APP's..

answered none of my questions and ignored my request for clarification in regards to the issue and here i am sitting with my phone completely unresponsive.

You rock apple!!
