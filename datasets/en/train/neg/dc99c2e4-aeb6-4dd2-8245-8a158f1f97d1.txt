VEGANS, BEWARE! 

When I first started going here I asked specific questions about the "veggie" meat, Was it Vegan? Did it contain any dairy or egg? etc. 
I was assured that it was absolutely vegan and a 100% soy product. 

I recently heard that their "veggie" meat contained egg whites. 
I called up and asked them to please look at the ingredient list to verify this and sure it enough it contained Egg Whites!! 

I am so upset that that the owner/manager of this shop was so ignorant  that he could profess the vegan wonders of this "veggie" meat to me knowing that it was not. 

I'm appalled by the false pretense and all the times I ate here unknowingly putting things in my body which are not OK with me. 
What if I had been deathly allergic to eggs?
