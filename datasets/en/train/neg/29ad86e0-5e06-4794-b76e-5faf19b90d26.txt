The service was great. The owner was really nice, and very sensitive of needs of my party (a friend that had a disability)
I had Mapo Tofu. It was okay.

When I came home my man told me about the server who squashed a cockroach with his hand and showed it to his co-worker.
I barfed about half an hour after that.
