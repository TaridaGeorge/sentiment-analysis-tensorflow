I went to lunch at Legends (formerly Coach & Willie's) in downtown Phoenix on November 14, 2012.  One lady in our party of 15 was served 15-20 minutes after everyone else.  And when the food finally arrived, most of the plate was cold.  Yes, things like this happen sometimes.  My objection was how the manager handled the situation.  Instead of acknowledging a problem (and perhaps comping the lady's lunch -- a whopping $10), he argued about it with her, and then later, two others in our party.  This is not how your practice good customer service.  I won't go back.
