This is another bottom feeder collection law firm who only works for homeowners associations and makes their money by pursuing leans against honest homeowners who were the victims of bylaws or administrative errors by their clients, the homeowners associations.  

If you happen to be in their office in person, check them for a pulse because these guys are heartless.  What a bunch of obstinate douche bags!
