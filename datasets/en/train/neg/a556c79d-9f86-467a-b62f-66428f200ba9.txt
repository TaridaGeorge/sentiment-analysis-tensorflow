Overpriced, slow, and simply mediocre, this place is certainly nothing to write home about.

As a previous reviewer noted, two kabob sandwiches (no drinks) totaled roughly $30.  The food wasn't horrible, but I definitely don't think they were worth the price, or the wait by any means.

On a comical note, a patron from the patio next to ours jumped the barrier, took a seat at our table, proceeded to order beers, and discuss details of her life.  I'm pretty sure this is a first, and hopefully a last...
