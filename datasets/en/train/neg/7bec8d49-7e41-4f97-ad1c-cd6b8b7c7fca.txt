Absolutely Horrible! The food was not fresh, the service was lousy and staff were seriously drab. I haven't been here in the evening or on the Karaoke nights, but I can only imagine this dump going downhill. It's possible that a good crowd could change the atmosphere a bit, but I didn't experience that when I was there. If you are hungry move on.... if you want a beer stop in....
