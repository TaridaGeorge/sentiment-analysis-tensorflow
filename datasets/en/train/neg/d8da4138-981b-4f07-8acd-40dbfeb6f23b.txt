Charlie's has not been Charlies for a long, long, time.
If you have fond memories of the gay CW bar that existed in the 80s and 90s don't go back.
It is not the gay country western bar it used to be. The cowboys are long gone.

The name should be changed to something like Tia Maria's hip hop salsa cantina - because that's what is now and has been for quite a while.
If you like chi chi twinks, chi chi drag queens and don't mind lots of women - you'll like Charlies now.

If you like cowboys don't bother. They're not there anymore.
