Went with the lowest expectations and wasn't disappointed. Not a fan of buffets or of fried foods or fatty foods.  The clam chowder was ok. The salads were ok.  No alcohol here.  The hot fudge dispenser at the desert bar was empty.  I was buffeted about by annoying fat ill-mannered  mouth-breathing children rooting around  at the troughs unaccompanied by adults.  I think I now fully comprehend why it's called "buffet".  I would rather have root canal than return to this place.
