$150 for an old tv, $90 for a bike with a rusty chain, frayed brake lines, ripped seat, missing chain guard, and flat tires? What??!?

You can buy a brand new bike at Walmart for $80. They also had no clothing for kids under 2 that wasn't ripped, badly stained, and overpriced. They had a very nice electric coffee carafe, yeah I opened it and it was encrusted in old coffee grounds (at least I hope that's what it was). 

Perhaps I was spoiled by the Salvation Army back in Ohio but even in the ghetto one there you could still find used items fairly priced and with life left in them. I guess I thought in a nice town like Tempe, they wouldn't put out overpriced crap for sale.
