BUYER BEWARE! Want to learn the art of up selling. Come here.  It can never just be a regular oil change.  They do not realize the value of repeat business.  I suppose they want to get all they can on the first sell and don't value loyalty.  They don't realize a loyal customer will go 3-4 times a year. Oh well.  Buyer Beware.
