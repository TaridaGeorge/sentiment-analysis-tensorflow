The ONLY reason I gave this dump one star is because I couldn't give it NO star!

It is dirty & old.
Carpets stained- don't take off your shoes.
Bathtub/shower- stained & unclean. A brown ring around the tub.

I was there for a business conference- no pencils/pens or writing paper in any rooms. 
I had to ask to move to another room because the AC/Heat didn't work.
they said they would send maintenance up to fix it- NO ONE showed up.

The gift shop- is a room with three vending machines.
No pencils/ pens/ paper.
I needed some antacids from the 'gift shop'. the machine ate my dollar.
When I complained to the desk - the woman said it was a vendors problem not the hotel's... WHAT?????

I would never- ever recommend this place.
