We were shopping for  a new washing machine. We had been to Home Depot and were comparing. Lowes did have a better selection and their prices were in line with Home Depots.

Good prices and good selection are great things, but they don't really count if you can't make a purchase. We had waited in the area for about 15 minutes then asked a Lowes employee for help, they said they would get someone. We waited another 15-20 minutes and no one ever came. 

Not sure if this was an off day for them or they were short handed. Whatever the reason Home Depot got the $450.00 sale they would have gotten had someone been there to help us.
