The bartender stole my debit card and then said I never gave it to him.  I also discovered later that they charged me for drinks I didn't buy, wow. This place is run by a bunch douche-bags that are Jersey Shore wannabes.   They didn't even offer to compensate me for the trouble they caused me, just oops, we found it since you called it in stolen.
