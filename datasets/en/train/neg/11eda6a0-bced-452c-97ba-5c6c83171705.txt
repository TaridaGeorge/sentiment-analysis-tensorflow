I agree with others who have said about the broth being too oily and fatty. Noodles were fine, but I couldn't even finish half the bowl before I started getting grossed out and had to eat from my husband's bbq pork sandwhich instead, which was actually pretty decent. I'm a big carnivore, but even I thought the spring rolls lacked veggies, too much meat and pretty tasteless. Service was HORRIBLE! You're lucky if u can even get some eye contact with the service once your meal has been served. Soda was served straight from the can - no glass, not even a straw. Definitely not worth the 12 mile drive!
