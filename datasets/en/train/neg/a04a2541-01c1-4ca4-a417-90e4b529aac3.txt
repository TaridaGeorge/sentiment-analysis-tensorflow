HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!

The nurse practitioner on duty was completely incompetent!  She was asking the assistant general procedure questions.  After 15 min. I picked up my baby and walked out.  How can a nurse practitioner not know how to answer general questions?   She actually guessed and then tried to verify with the assistant.  The assistant was very knowledgable and corrected her mistakes.  I left 4 messages and emails for the manager.  After 5 weeks was given a return call to tell me she had passed my messages on to the Doctor in charge.  I never received a call from him and it's now been 2 months.  This facility is horrible.  Go to PCH urgent care instead.  They are great!
