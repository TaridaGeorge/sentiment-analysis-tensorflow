Are zero stars an option?

I rarely write bad reviews. I use Yelp primarily to support and give thanks to businesses I like.

Mountainside Fitness has changed my protocol. 

After being a member for over 2 years, when I wanted to cancel they made it  impossible. They have extremely bad business ethics and policies. The CEO is arrogant and rude and does not operate with the philosophy of treating customers right. 

Do not join this gym unless you are prepared to be a lifelong member.

check out another former mountainside member's online debate with billy malkovich, "harvard graduate". it's pretty funny.
