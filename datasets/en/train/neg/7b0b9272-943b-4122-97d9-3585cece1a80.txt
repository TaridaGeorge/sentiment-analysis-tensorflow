I've eaten at this Kona Grill several times. It's the only Kona I've been to so it may not be reflective of the rest. But I'm really disappointed with it and not going back. 

The service has been exceptionally slow recently and the quality of the sushi (while not great to start with) has gone down. 

I'd highly recommend skipping this restaurant in lieu of its neighbors - ZTejas or Yard House - if you need to eat while at the mall.
