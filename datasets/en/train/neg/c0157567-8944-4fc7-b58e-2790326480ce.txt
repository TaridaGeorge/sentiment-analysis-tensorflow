hours posted are wrong. arrived here at 4:45 today, opened door and was greeted by a woman telling me they didn't open until 5:30. well as of now posted hours here are from 4. I get that hours change and not all media gets updated, but their doors were open and their hours reported as such. No offer to be seated and offered a drink anyway or even an incentive to return during new business hours. just a simple we are closed until 5:30 and an escort out.  I repeat, hours posted on this site as of writing this review reflect my attempted patronage. lock your door or update online info or be courteous. there were only 2 of us, and not even a question if there would be more which there wasn't. never been here before. probably will not try again thanks to this experience
