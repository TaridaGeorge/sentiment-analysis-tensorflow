Have had about 20 facials at various places. Thanks goodness I got this facial with a coupon. I was very disappointed. Products were fine but the technique left a lot to be desired. The message you get with a facial [chest, neck, shoulders and of course...face] was more like a lite rub than a message. I felt Cindy's fingers but there was no message what-so-ever. Glad I got to try a new place but, won't go again.
