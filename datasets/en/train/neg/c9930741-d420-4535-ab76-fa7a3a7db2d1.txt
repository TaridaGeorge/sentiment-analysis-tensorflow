If I could give 0 stars I would, If I had the energy I would rate every Ra in the country this "0". Thank you to the Muslims for inventing the 0 as a concept. This place is completely cliched, lame, and annoying, oh did I mention the sushi is sub par, the service usually sucks, since they must only require an IQ of 28 to work here.

 "Yes, Billy  the fork is the thing with the four prongs on it...."*new waiter proceeds to bring said fork to table* 

You can go to so many better places for sushi in Phoenix, going here is only cool if you want to leave partly deaf. Even their happy hour is weak.

ABRA = Anthing but Ra.
