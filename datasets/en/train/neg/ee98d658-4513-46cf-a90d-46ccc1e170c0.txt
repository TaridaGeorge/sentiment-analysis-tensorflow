delta airlines is one of the worst airlines out there. my flight out of PVD was delayed, sat on the runway for a good 20mins when we arrived in ATL, they forced all of the passengers to do planeside valet bc the overhead bins were smaller than normal so i had to wait another 20mins for my luggage. these series of events caused me to miss my connecting flight to PHX. none of the delta representatives and managers cared. there were no more flights out to PHX that night and they were not willing to provide hotel accomodations and/or a meal voucher so i was stuck in the ATL airport overnight. seriously, one of the worst experiences EVER and i fly a lot. 

0* if i could!!!!
