This is just a bad place to eat period. I ordered a pizza and was told it would be ready in 20 mins, I showed up on time and asked for my order two of the employees huddled up really.quick and one went to the back the other said it would be a few mins. The other girl never came back up and the other girl was making a huge excuse about the register being locked. I know they never put my order in as the girl trying to unlock the register was playing with her phone more than trying to fix the problem. After waiting 10 mins I walked out and when I said I was she made no last ditch effort to save the sale other than "are u sure?" I would give this place a zero star and would never visit this site again.
