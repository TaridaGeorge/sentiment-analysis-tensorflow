Way over priced and WAY pushy people! Really? There is now way the average person buys $140 worth of tea a month!!!!! Never spending money there again!
They push these 1 LB containers of tea (mind you the average tea is $10 per ounce!), and the "air tight, light tight containers" are $7 a piece, they don't give you an option for anything else...
My boy friend and I were really looking forward to learning about tea and trying something new, and this definitely put a damper on our excitement. Cost Plus had tea pots just as nice for 1/5th of what Teavana was charging (and some yummy teas at half the price)!
