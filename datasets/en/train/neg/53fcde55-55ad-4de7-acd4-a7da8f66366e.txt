So disappointed! 
My guy and I love Thai (rhymes, cool). 
We ordered the traditional Phad Thai with shrimp and the Ruby Red Curry with chicken. 
We picked it up and brought it home. The first thing I noticed was that there was no shrimp in the Phad Thai. We called and they said that we were not charged for shrimp...ok but I ordered shrimp and that is what I wanted. 
The worst part should have been the easiest. The white rice that accompanied the curry was beyond mushy. It didn't even look like rice. It completely ruined the entire dish for me. The curry flavor was OK but I could not get past the super mushy rice. 

Looks like the hunt for good Thai take out continues...
