Well I was out and feeling a little hungry so I decided to drop in a grab a bite. Imagine my surprise when I arrived and the lights were off, and the sign taken down. What happened??! Did the snow birds drive this little shop out of town? Who knows? Guess I will have to go to the other location "sigh". Note: this is in reference to their location that was on the border of Apache Junction and Mesa. This location closed and they moved to the location on power.
