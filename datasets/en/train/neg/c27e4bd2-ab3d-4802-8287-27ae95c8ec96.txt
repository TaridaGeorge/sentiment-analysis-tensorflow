It's no longer Planet beach - it's now Tangible Tanning. -"De-franchised" was what they advised me although the contracts with Planet beach are still/bought by them. Say bye-bye to the half off after being with PB for two years. I think I'll be going elsewhere now.  Especially for over $55/month for the 'basic' membership. Rip-off!
