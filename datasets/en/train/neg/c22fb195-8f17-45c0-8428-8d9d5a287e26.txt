I came here with a buddy of mine one Saturday afternoon. The place was pretty empty. For starters it took roughly 10 minutes for our waitress to finally greet us and take our drink order. Then another 10 minutes for our drinks to come out. I had ordered an iced tea and there was no sugar/sweetener on any table. Our waitress was nowhere to be found so I asked another waitress who said she would bring me some....she never did. I ordered a basic cheeseburger which was very dry and overcooked. I don't know why our waitress even bothered to ask how I wanted my burger cooked. Our waitress never offered to refill our drinks or even bothered to check up on us after the food was delivered. We had to go ask the bartender for our check. Terrible service. Terrible food.
