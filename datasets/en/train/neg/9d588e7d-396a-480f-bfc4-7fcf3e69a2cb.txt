Having to leave security and board a bus to get from one terminal to another = complete design failure.

Having all the food outside of said security = extremely inconvenient.

After having to play roulette with the length of the security line while wolfing down food on a short layover, there is no way to win.  Sky Harbor, you lose. Go to the back of the line. Do not pass go. Do not collect $200. No cookie for you. One star for you.

The (considerable) amount of ill will I can summon for Sky Harbor feels completely inadequate (over a year later).
