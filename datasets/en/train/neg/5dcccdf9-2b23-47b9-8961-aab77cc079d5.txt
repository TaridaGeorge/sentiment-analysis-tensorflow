I was really craving chinese food today... too bad this place was NOT what I had hoped for. I ordered the orange chicken, fried rice, soup, and crab puffs. The chicken is dry and tasteless (on the menu it said SPICY however it is not spicy or flavorful at all). The rice has no vegetables or anything - it is just flavorless, oil soaked grains. The soup container was LESS THAN HALF FULL and smelled so wretched I couldn't bring myself to taste it. The crab puffs were decent, but not enough to make up for the 15 dollars worth of wasted food. I won't be coming back.
