Not a good experience at all !!!

We arrived early to a less than full restaurant and the Host tried to set us at the worst table available.  The food took a long time to arrive and when it did it was a disappointment, the lamb curry was OK at best but the chicken tika was dry and flavorless so I sent it back and they did remove it from the check.  The garlic nan was not very good either.... I've had better from Trade Joe's.

The music was so loud I couldn't wait to leave.   

I was surprised the restaurant did fill up by the time we were leaving.

Based on my experience I have no plans to return and would not recommend it.
