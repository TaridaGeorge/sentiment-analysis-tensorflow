i spent my formative years at this very mall. an orange julius at the food court, shopping for prom dresses at wet seal... ha ha. this mall, and that entire area on southern from dobson to alma school is pretty much abandoned. the only reason anything still exists there is because MCC is right in the area.
the mall is floundering, the surrounding restaurants like bennigans and even the pancho's couldn't make it. it's not surprising with super-planned, pre-packaged for the middle class to feel like upper middle class malls like chandler fashionsquare around.
