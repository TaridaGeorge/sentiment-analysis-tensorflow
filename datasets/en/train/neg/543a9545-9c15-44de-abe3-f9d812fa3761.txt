I am an artist and have been looking for an outlet type store for buying frames.  This store claims to be an outlet.  I spoke with a woman who told me this is their factory and they build and supply frames to their Hall of Frames stores throughout the valley.  I told her I was looking for a place to get some great prices on frames and she said "You have found the place!"  HA!!  Then she proceeded to show me the frames they carry and how I can get 25% - 40% off.  I was NOT impressed.  I am getting 40% off of an exorbitant price.  No thank you.  I will not shop at this business.
