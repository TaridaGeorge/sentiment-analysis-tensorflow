I used to really like this place but it has changed hands and the service has plummeted.  Visited last week and our server could not have showed any more contempt for her customers.  The senior person was chatting up two friends at the bar and ignoring the 2 whole tables occupied.  

Afte slapping our food down our server went outside to smoke a couple cigarettes not returning until we were finished with two empty wine and water glasses.

It's a shame, I used to like seeing the owner here, he was a engaging attentive soul who kept his staff on task...

Maybe use it for take out??
