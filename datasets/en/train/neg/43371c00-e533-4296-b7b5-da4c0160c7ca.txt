My family loves a particular nearby fro-yo place (Kokomo), but we wanted to try something new.  Sadly, it just confirmed we need to stick with what we love.  Yes, Tasti D-lite offered a huge menu, but it was not worth the price.  The place was empty, so that should've been the first sign.  It didn't have a great ambiance inside, and the fro-yo didn't taste that great either.  We will be sticking to our regular treat store.
