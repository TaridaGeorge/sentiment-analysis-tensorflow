There were 3 cars in the parking lot and people walking to the door but the young lady closed the doors at 9:51pm

The young lady spoke through the glass for atleast 4 minutes explaining she would not open the doors

I live behind this location but I may not return. There is a Walgreens off of 7th Street...
