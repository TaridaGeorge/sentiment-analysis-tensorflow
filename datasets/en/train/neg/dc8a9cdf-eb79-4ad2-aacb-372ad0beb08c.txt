Bartenders= 100% cool. Bouncers = Douche-bags. Management= A step above a monkey in a suit. Great place for sub-standard food that is way overpriced.  It also has really nice cheap and corny decor inside.  If you wear Tap-Out gear with a bandana tied on your head or if you are a 45+ patron "trying" to recapture a youthful night of fun, come here and you will fit right in.  You could throw a dart at a map and find an establishment with better food and there are waaaaay more places in walking distance that are more fun to grab a drink at.
Saddle Ranch (even the 2 in LA), you guys should crawl in a hole and die.
