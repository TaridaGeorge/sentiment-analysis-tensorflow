My wife and I stayed at the Phoenician last weekend.  We knew the hotel was on the Conde Naste list for hotels in the US.  Being a Starwood Platinum guest, we were upgraded to a nice suite and the resort was amazing.  Unfortunately, the spa at the Phoenician, the Cenre for Wellbeing, was really just awful.  It was old, had very poor service (no attendant in the locker room), and was really dirty.  We were surprised at how such a nice resort could have such a dingy spa.  We loved our weekend anyway, but decided to stay away from the spa and instead hit the tennis courts and the pools.
