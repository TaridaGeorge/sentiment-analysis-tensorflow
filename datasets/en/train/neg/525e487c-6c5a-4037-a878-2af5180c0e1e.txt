This is more than a yogurt bar. They've got burgers and apparently waffles. The air was heavy with oil when I walked in.
I like to try several favors when I visit a yogurt bar. My first attempt was the mango sorbet. When I pulled the trigger a bunch of thick liquid globbed out. We asked about the sugar free "dairy free" vanilla and the cashier proceeded to tell us it's not really dairy free. 
The flavors of my selection were disappointing.
This was the worst yogurt bar experience I've had.
