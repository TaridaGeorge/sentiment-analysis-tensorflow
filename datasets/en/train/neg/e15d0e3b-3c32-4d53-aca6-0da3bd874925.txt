I sat at the bar and had to ask for my second beer - even though the bar tender walked past me several times.  The wings were on the under-cooked side. I originally went there to play Buzztime trivia and was instructed that the machines where by the door.  This would not have bothered me if both machines that I used ended up running out of power.  I will no be returning to this place.
