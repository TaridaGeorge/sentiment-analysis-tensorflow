I just read Melissa D's review and laughed. It's either the owner himself posing as a woman, or a friend of his who has been going around and writing positive reviews of his schools (I've seen a few reviews written by the same person). I can't emphasize enough to stay away from the belt factory called "Karate for Kids", the chain really exists for the owners to feed off of parents' love for their children ($$) and not to help kids. While my son was enrolled I heard other parents' stories, and not many were positive.
