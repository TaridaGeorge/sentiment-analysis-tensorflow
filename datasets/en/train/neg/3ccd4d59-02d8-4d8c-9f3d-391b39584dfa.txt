The service was less than satisfactory.  We ordered a beef burrito but wanted a traditional one like the popular Carne Asada in California but the only offered beef.  We asked if they could add beans, rice and salsa.  The waiter looked at us strangely then said he would order it,  We received a bean and cheese burrito with beef that was truly barely visible.  We cut open the burrito to see if it was at the other end, but there was no beef.  We told the waiter and he took a fork and looked through the burrito.  he said he saw a couple of pieces.  A beef burrito has beef.

Furthermore, two of the utensils were dirty.
Not recommended at all.
