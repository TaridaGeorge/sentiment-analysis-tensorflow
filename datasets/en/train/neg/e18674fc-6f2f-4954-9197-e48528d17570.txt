I came to party city looking for supplies for a jungle themed birthday party for a little boy.  I didn't find much in stock that suited my needs.  There were a lot of luau themed party supplies.  I did manage to find a few things that would work for my party, but upon interacting with the staff, I decided against purchasing any of the items I had gathered.  One young man was helpful in a perfunctory way, but the young woman who seemed to be in charge was so rude that I voted with my feet and walked out without spending any money.
