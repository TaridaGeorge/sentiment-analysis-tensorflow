And the Herb Box does it again... I knew not to go back after the terrible service, but my girlfriend said she really wanted to try it.  So what happens? I check my bank statement and they charged me twice!  Once for my meal and an additional charge for 137 bucks!  I'll change this review if they handle it well, but I'm not holding my breath.
