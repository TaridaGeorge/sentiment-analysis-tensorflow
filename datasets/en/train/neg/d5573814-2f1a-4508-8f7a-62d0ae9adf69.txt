D*** straight "methinks not"! Talk about hype.  For 2 breakfasts (2 American standards, 2 sides of pancakes, an JO and coffee) I paid $30 that amounted to nothing I couldn't have made at home for $8, and my version would have tasted better.  What really irked me was that in order to get a pancake instead of a biscuit I had to buy it as a side, which was fine... until I found out that $3 doesn't get you a side of pancakes, it gets you one pancake about the size of my palm, that tastes like any other so its not as if they're super special.  Thank god at least the coffee was good.
