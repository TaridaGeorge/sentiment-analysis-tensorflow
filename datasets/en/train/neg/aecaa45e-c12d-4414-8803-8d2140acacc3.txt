Ordered two pizzas for our office: one full pizza with sausage, peppers, onions, pepperoni and olives and the other was a medium veggie pizza.

The food not that great; it tasted like the pizza had been sitting in the car for a while. The sauce tasted bland and the crust was not crispy at all.  I felt like the pizza was frozen and re-heated up again. Also, it seemed like the vegetables were overcooked.

I do not recommend this place to anyone.
