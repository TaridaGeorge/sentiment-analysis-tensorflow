I have walked by Jimmy Johns often and was interested to try a new place. I was excited that they deliver and I live within a mile of them. 
I gave a new business a shot and tried to order two sandwiches. I don't know where you live but if you live anywhere north of Rio Salado, you are not in their delivery area ( 1/4 mile north!?). WTF
They can't drive north at all? (We aren't wicked up here!)
Went back to Silvermine because they deliver more than  1/4 mile North. 
I suppose Jimmy Johns is scared of bridges. Jimmy Johns DOESN'T DELIVER.

PS. as I write this Silvermine knocked on my door.
