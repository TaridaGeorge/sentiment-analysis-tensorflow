Was completely mislead by website on suggested trailer for my home.  Went with suggested trailer only to later find out, only 13ft of that trailer was in the quote.  $800 additional charge after the fact does not sit well with me and I will never use or recommend them to anyone ever again.  Also the danger of a $300lb detached ramp is an accident waiting to happen.
