Awful.

The selection still consists mostly of t-shirts from the 90s and out of style clothing. Yet, when I bring in my VERY RECENTLY purchased designer clothes to sell to them--- they take nothing. Hmmm... someone needs to take a second look at how they manage their inventory.

Today I went there for the last time. I brought a never-worn Banana Republic cashmere sweater, T-bags dress, JCrew dress, and new CHLOE dress (among other very good, wintery items) that the girl at the counter didn't take. She was about 18 and obviously wasn't trained to recognize good merchandise!! That's just lost money for them... considering they mark up what they buy from you by about FOUR TIMES as much as what they gave you for it.

I suggest My Sister's Closet.
