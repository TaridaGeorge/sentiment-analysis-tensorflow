Never used the service but I was just driving near this dude and he drives like an asshole. Who knows, maybe he was in a hurry to pick someone up, but that doesn't give him an excuse to weave in between traffic and then ride someone's bumper when he can't get around them. I definitely wouldn't use this company even if someone paid me.
