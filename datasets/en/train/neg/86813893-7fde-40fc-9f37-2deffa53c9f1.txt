I always pass this place driving to school but never had the time to try it out. I was excited to try it today with a group of people after church. I really wanted to like it, but overall, it was a bad experience. The food took an hour to get out, the interior design is old and non-welcoming, and the cook (i'm guessing is the owner) came out to greet us with bed hair. The food was mediocre, I ordered the pad thai spicy. Sorry, I wont be dining here again.
