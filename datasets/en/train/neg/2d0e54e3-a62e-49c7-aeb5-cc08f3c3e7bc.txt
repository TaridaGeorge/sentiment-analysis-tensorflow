Staff was rude, really unaccommodating to a group of elderly visitors, while I was a caregiver. And they don't split checks, which they told us beforehand when we made the reservation that they did. Food was over priced, and the girl with the nasty ace bandage around her wrist serving food made me want to barf. Will not be returning, ever! This review is overdue, and it was last year that I went, but didn't know the name of the place we ate after the museum.
