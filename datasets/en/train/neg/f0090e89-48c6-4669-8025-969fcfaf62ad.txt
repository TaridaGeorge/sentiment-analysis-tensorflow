BEWARE******Used my Credit Card on 5/14/12 Lady walked away with my card to the back of the Restaurant while I stood at the counter and 2 days later the FRAUD team from my bank called to confirm hundreds of dollars of purchases at Rite Aid location in California******someone copied my card and purchased Gift Cards.  My bank indicated my Credit card was cloned with a different name.    This was the only place this could have happened.  Had not used this credit card in over 4 months.  My bank clearly indicated that my card was swiped using an identity theft machine.
