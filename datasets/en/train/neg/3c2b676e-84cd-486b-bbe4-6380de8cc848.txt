Has been a while....the sushi was good, the service was poor and the appetizers were not as good as they used to be. I now live in Surprise and won't be making the trip out here to eat in or get anything other than sushi. Since we passed a few good places to get here.... Those places will get our Sushi business. The busboy gave us better service than the actual server.
