I went to this establishment for my birthday, walked in for one beer, 30 minutes we left at 9:30 to find our designated drivers vehicle had been towed.
A dirt parking lot , chalk lines, an empty space in between two cars is where we parked. No signs visible, had to call the tow company, would not let us pick the car up til 8 in the morning, had to take a taxi.....I was then informed All City towing owned the lot, that Coach House leases for parking.
$ 120.00 later, a miserable experience...will never go back. The Coach House said tough, claims we were illegally parked, blocking an exit. 
Really.  Our vehicle was actually stolen in my eyes.
What a racket...
