They didn't fully honor the oil change coupon discount, told me I needed a lot of stuff that I didn't need. which I declined. They didn't seem trustworthy... the next day I found a screw in the driver's side tire - coincidence? I was getting my oil changed at Cobblestone before, and will not deviate again.
