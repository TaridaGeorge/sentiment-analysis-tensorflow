Okay...someone needs to tell the truth about this place. Yes, I can admin that their food was tasty and cheap, but you get what you pay for! I ate lunch here with a friend of mine, that same evening both of us felt the effects of our authentic mexican. Let's just say that I skipped dinner that evening thanks to a bad case of stomach cramps.
