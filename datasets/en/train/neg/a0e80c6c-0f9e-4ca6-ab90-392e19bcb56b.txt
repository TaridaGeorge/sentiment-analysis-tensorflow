The blonde lady that works interrupted me to tell me HER thoughts every time I was considering a piece.  A friend and I were having private conversation and she thought it necessary to interject as much as possible.  What made it worse was after I made one comment she apparently didn't agree and was condescending to me.  We left without making a purchase and I will not be back.
