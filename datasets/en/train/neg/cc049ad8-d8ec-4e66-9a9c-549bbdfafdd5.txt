Not busy at all but took nearly 45 min to get our meal.  Ordered the trout and was shocked to see lots and lots of bones. Hmmmmm. Well asked the waitress about it and she said "they try the best they can"  hmmmmmm isn't this a "fish" restaurant? 
They comped the trout but still not sure I would go back.
