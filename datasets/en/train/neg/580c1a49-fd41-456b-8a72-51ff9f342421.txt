We had difficulty in finding this venue. It is hidden in ell of large shopping center and does not have a lit sign nor is it listed on directory. We had called ahead and  our
signature "Gourmet Works" pizza awaited us. We were greeted by the apparent owner, who was friendly and polite. We seated ourselves in a booth, where small lcd screens displayed old "Tom & Jerry" cartoon reruns.The pizza was low mediocre at best. Kind of like an inexpensive frozen supermarket brand. The undercrust was soggy. You can do much better with any "Take & Bake"
Apparently, this place was a failed franchise that was reopened by it's old owner. 
There is no wine or beer, but soft drinks and tea have free refills. My wife and I did not try any thing else, but I would pass on this place.
