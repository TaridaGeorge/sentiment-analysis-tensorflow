The drinks were only so-so. The waiter was pretty rude and was trying to tell us what to order.  When we didn't order what he recommended he seemed annoyed.  We ordered the "seared" scallops for an appetizer and they were not seared, rather mushy.  The worst part of the meal was the portion of my meal.  I ordered the special, red snapper wrapped in a leaf of some sort.  I saw the couple at the table next to me eating it and their portions looked appropriate.  When I got my meal, I had maybe 2 ounces of fish, a large piece of raw pineapple and some sort of a bread stick.  I don't know if the waiter was trying to punish us for not ordering enough cocktails but I have NEVER had a portion so small, not even in Paris.
