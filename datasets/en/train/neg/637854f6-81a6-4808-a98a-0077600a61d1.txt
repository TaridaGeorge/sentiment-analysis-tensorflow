this is a shame! Muslims are not dirty people, and have high standards of hygiene, but you would never know going into this place!  I bought lentils one time from here, and it was infested with moths! they got into everything in my pantry resulting in a bunch of stuff having to get tossed, we had to empty our entire pantry because they laid eggs and made cocoons everywhere!!! EVEN MY COFFEE FILTER!!! (barf!!!)  Needless to say, they didn't even apologize or refund for that... and their meat sucks! they never cut it the way we ask, and last time they kept our meat in the fridge not freezer for 4 days, I forgot to pick it up, and they were like, we still have it! GROSS!  I never went to get my order, and will not go back here! Kosher Butchers here I come!
