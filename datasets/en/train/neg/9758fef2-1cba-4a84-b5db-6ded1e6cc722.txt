70$ for the two off us that included eggplant and gnocci that tasted like the olive garden.  My wife said her meal was good, but I was seriously disappointed.  If I'm paying 25$ for a plate of pasta, you better give me food orgasms.  Well, olive garden tasting food was far from it, plus the parking situation is a joke.
