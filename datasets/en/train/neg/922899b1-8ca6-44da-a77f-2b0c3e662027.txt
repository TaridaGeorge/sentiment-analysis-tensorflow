I have always been a fan of Burlington's deals, however I will not be shopping at this one again. I went to return a belt... pretty simple. Instead, I stood in the customer service line for 15 minutes thanks to an employee of Burlington buying/putting things on layaway. It took three other staff to help her out. There were no words said to me except "Hold on". I was pissed. When the lady was finally done, the employee at the service asked "what do you want?" Serious help is needed there!
 If you work in the area of "customer service" I think you should have some.
