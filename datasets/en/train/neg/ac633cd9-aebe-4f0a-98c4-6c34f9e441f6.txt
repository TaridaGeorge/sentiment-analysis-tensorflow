Only go to jo-Ann if I have no other choice!!!!!  However here in Mesa there are few choices. When I visit my daughter in So. Cal I stock up. Everyone should be very..very careful with so coupons/discounts...half the time they do not give them to and trying to read your receipt is a joke... Good for profits bad for customer.
