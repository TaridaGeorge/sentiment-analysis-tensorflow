This place was way to pricey for me, especially having a "laid back" atmosphere.  It is a trendy place and I feel like sucker for giving them my business.  You don't pay top dollar for that kind of atmosphere.  And paying 12 to 14 dollars for a little martini is outrageous.  The food is good, not great.  There are plenty of hole in the wall sushi places that give you great food for what you pay for.
