We stopped ordering from pizza hut. Even after talking with the manager we received horrible pizza. It was obvious that they were taking a premade pepperoni and then putting our toppings on and reheating.  We will never order from them again. We found Little 
 Sicily a couple weeks ago and it is wonderful.  It's on bell and grand and it is worth having to pick it up yourself.
