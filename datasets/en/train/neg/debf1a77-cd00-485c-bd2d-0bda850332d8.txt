I was thoroughly unimpressed with this venue for many reasons....

 1. it took 25 minutes to obtain a tasty beverage (beer) and about as long for glasses of water. (the restaurant was NOT even 25% full!)
2. the waiter "strolled" by with his Faux Hawk to take our order about 45 minutes later.
3. when the food finally came a member of our party found something mysterious in her burger.
4. we displayed mysterious item mentioned in #3 to said Faux Hawk and he appropriately took the plate away. however did not omit the vulgar item from the bill until we explicitly asked.
bottom line, the grilled salad i had was good, but not good enough to warrant a second trip to Cook N Jacks or a recommendation to anyone.
