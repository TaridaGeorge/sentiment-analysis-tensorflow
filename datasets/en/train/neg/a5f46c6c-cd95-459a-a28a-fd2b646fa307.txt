We were in the mall with young grandkids one afternoon.  The restrooms were absolutely filthy.  The children's play area was getting its daily cleaning (why is this done at a time when kids could be playing and not before/after mall hours).  No wonder the place is deserted and unshopped.  There is nothing appealing about coming here anymore.
