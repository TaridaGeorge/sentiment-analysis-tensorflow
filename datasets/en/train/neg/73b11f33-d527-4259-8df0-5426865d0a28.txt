I can't stand this place. It's always filled with a bunch of drunks, it smells, and the karaoke could put me in the grave. The last time I went, I was DD and the waitress tried getting a double tip out of my drunk friends. I didn't appreciate her taking advantage of my friends (who had no clue what was going on) so swore I'd never be back. And, I haven't.
