If I can give it below 1 star I would! I have been a regular customer here until the last time they messed up my nails so bad! Going for a refill and pedicure and guess what, they hurted my finger nails and did a sloppy job on nail polishing. 

I'm not sure if they ever clean the tub but I got a bad fungial infection from here. That is very gross.

From having pretty nails to all messed up fungial nails made me extremely disappointed. I would never go back!
