Worst place in Arizona.  I went with a group awhile back.  The server was very cocky.  The manager was arrogant.  We complained to the owner but did not get a response.  

Now, on to the food.  the quality was decent but it is very over priced.  Most overrated restaurant in Arizona.  DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.  Buyer beware.
