I was so excited to eat here. Until I paid. $25 for 2 burgers and fries and a sodas. It was crazy loud inside so we ate outside. Soda was one step away from flat. My burger looked like it was attack by a spatula then hidden by a soggy bun. My mushy fries were over salted to the point where all I could taste was salt. Not impressed and we will not be returning. In N Out is way better and priced right.
