Never again! This place is SO slow! Not only that, the last time I went, I had to wait 15 minutes just to pay for my order because the cashier was getting her "drawer ready". At 8AM on a Sunday morning????? Another problem was, I ordered an iced coffee with a shot of hazelnut. I was given a plastic cup with some hazelnut in it and instructed to go to the self-serve area and get my ice and coffee. You can guess what happened when i added the hot coffee to the ice. This is no way to serve iced coffee!

I love their bagels and their coffee but I will not be going back here again. What a disappointment!
