Went there for lunch buffet, what a disappointment. For 5.99 you get pizza breadsticks and pasta. They will give you one small bowl of salad for an additional 99 cents ( what a deal ) I guess if you've lived in Phoenix your whole life then this is what you expect from their buffet. The pizza hut buffets we are used to for 5.99 include pizza, breadsticks, salad bar which includes salad, cold pastas, fruits,deserts and pretty much what you'd find on most salad bars plus 2 hot soups. All this for the EXACT same price! Wow.. Guess if we ever get a craving for pizza hut buffet we will wait until we go back to IL. to visit because it's a scam here.
