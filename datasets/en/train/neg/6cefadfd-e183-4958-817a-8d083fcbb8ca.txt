Always pass by this place so we thought we would stop and give it a try. I'm thinking that was a mistake. First of all, we have been to a lot of Mexican restaurants and have never seen a menu like this, it was basically foreign to my fiance and I. We both had some questions about a few things on the menu that we planned to ask our waitress. Only when the waitress came to take our order we discovered that she barely spoke any English. When our food came it wasn't what either one of us expected. Apparently I ordered a chicken quesadilla, which I wrongly assumed was going to be enchiladas. Food was very bland. Needless to say, we wont be going back.
