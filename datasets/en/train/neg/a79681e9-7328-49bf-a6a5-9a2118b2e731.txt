On way home from downtown and wife had a taste for one of their shrimp pizzas. Called and got put on hold for 5 1/2 mins then got hung up on. Called back and put on hold again even after I told him I had just been on hold. Another 3 Mins and then they need all my info for computer.  By the the time got my order in I was there. On top of that they don't even have the pizza my wife wanted on menu any more.  
Then when I arrived and asked to pay he said he had no orders for me. Took another look and there was my order. 
Tables empty and people waiting at door for seat 15 minutes. I wont go back. Pizza was expensive and not that good.
