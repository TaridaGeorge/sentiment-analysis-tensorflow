Certainly is beautiful. Except the management can't manage to make it profitable (in a non-profit sense). 370,000 visitors! That's it. Bunch of bureaucrats operating a facility that should be doing more then 500,000 visitors. It's an bureaucratic playground, and the price charged? Take a walk in the desert yourself...and save the cash.
