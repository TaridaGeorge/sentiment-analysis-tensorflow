Is this place a joke?  First off, to call two small rooms with a few exhibits a museum is comical to me.  Second, these "works of art" are abosultely horrible.  It looks like just threw something together at the last minute with no thought put into them.  I'm not kidding when I say that one of the exhibits was literally stuff that you would find under the couch coushins- change, scraps of paper, lint, etc. One pile of art looked like someone had just dumped their junk there, prompting a fellow patron to joke, "this one is titled, GOODWILL."  Even worse is that while you're checking out these piles of junk there are 2-3 security guards stalking you to make sure you don't steal their pocket lint.  I dont think it was worth the price of admission (Free).  At least it's air conditioned?
