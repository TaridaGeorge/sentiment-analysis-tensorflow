Let me start by saying this...I normally would never eat at Coco's but we needed to find lunch on Thanksgiving before our evening meal, so what can you do? Coco's was the only place we could find that was open.
It took too long to get sat. Once we were seated, a very sketchy server took our drink order and never came back. We waited for about 10-15 minutes and watched four other tables get up and leave. Needless to say, we followed them. 
I understand that Coco's is not an upscale establishment and that you get what you pay for, but this was unacceptable. I've had better service at Taco Bell. The place was dirty, unorganized, and a terrible place for anyone to spend the holiday. I mostly felt sorry for the people I saw there trying to enjoy a Thanksgiving dinner.
