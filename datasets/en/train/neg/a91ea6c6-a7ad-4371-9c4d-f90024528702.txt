I hate to break it to you all... but the long awaiting delivery of an H&M store in Scottsdale, turned out to be a huge disappointment! Ever hear the saying "Good from far, but far from good"?  This pretty much sums it up. The clothes are great for a straight figured person with no curves that only wants to wear their cloths once or twice. Otherwise you are SOL!  There is no quality control whatsoever, except that they are all made cheaply!  The only thing good I can say about H&M is the have cute accessories.
