This place has a very unique atmosphere, with a live organist playing all kinds of crazy instruments hooked up to the stage organ and taking very limited requests. This is primarily a pizza place with similar sides, but nothing there is good except the beer. I personally had a bad pizza experience there and now refer to this place strictly as "The Organ Stopper". Bring kids up to ages 8 or 9, but beyond that they will probably get bored or annoyed fast, unless they are very musically-minded or have an organ-playing scholarship on the horizon. For adults, bring a DD and knock back a pitcher or two to make your time worth it.
