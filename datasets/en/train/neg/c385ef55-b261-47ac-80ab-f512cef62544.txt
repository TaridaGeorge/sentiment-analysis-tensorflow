This place is whack... way too expensive used junk. I went in here on my lunch break one day.  I mean it is used clothes and they are prices like brand new clothes.  I looked at the jewelry section and again prices like new.  I would not shop here at all, if I want to spend that kind of money I would just get new clothes!
