I had really bad service at this location.  I went back and forth with the waitress about drink specials when they had it posted on their LCD TV's and flyers in their windows.  I sat with a party of 8 and she served everyone at that table food and at least two drinks before she even looked my way.  It took almost 45 minutes for this lady to get me another drink and didn't happen until I went to the manager to complain about her.  To the owner, please hire more outgoing ladies for waitresses because they look attractive does not mean they have the best attitudes.
