I eat out a lot and I truly love Italian food.  Daniel's is on the high end on costs....and I can say honestly, it's simply not worth it.  We had three meals among us....and not a single one was good.  The place is stuffy and I found the wait staff to be old and not particularly friendly or customer service oriented.

I rank Daniel's at the bottom of Italian and I don't recommend it.  Avoid this one for better options

I read Yelp a lot...so I only provide honest feedback based on my opinion
