I have to say that I was disappointed. Having been told some good things by people that went there two years ago, I thought I would take the family for a special day of pampering and rest. It couldn't have been worse. The valet seemed more intent on telling us we were lost than showing welcoming us, and the food in the restaurant (apart from the omelets!) tasted like it was cooked way back when my friends went to the resort. The coffee was lukewarm, people kept swarming around asking to clear dishes, and that was even before some of our party had finished getting their food. With so many resorts in the Valley, this is not one I will be going back to anytime soon. No, ever.
