This place is weak! I've heard of and seen this place before ,was in area stopped for a sandwich today, worst people working there seriously rude! I paid 17 bucks for sandwich a side and two drinks for that price it's should be good and have great service, I was blown away bye how basically mean the people were and the sandwiches were totally regular nothing special I watched the guys basically throw my sandwich together with distain he even had to make it! I will never go there again and will tell everyone I know ,the place sucks!!!
