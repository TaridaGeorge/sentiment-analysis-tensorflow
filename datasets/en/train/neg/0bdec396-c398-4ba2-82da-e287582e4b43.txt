Worst experience ever here! Had my car towed in as it gave out while driving somewhat a few blocks form there place. Eventually I found out it's just a fuel filter issue from Granite Reef Service Center.  Sun Devil Auto wanted to charge me over $700 by charging me 3 times over the price of the parts and labor ((WHAT??!! I told Peire they're Salesman F no!)) I had to involve the Police to mediate the situation and eventually had my car towed to Granite Reef Auto $200 and I was out the door... I'll never go back and deal with this shady place.
