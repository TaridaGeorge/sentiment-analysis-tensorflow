I would rather be a human pinata...
I would rather watch Cloverfield again....ugh...
I would rather be the guy who has to clean busstop areas....

...than ever, ever see a movie here. I've left shoes behind the floors are so sticky. Wads of gum EVERYWHERE. And it's like Chuck E Cheese decided to open a movie theater. Crying. Screaming. Kicking. And that's me trying to shut the little snot nosed brats up! 

Seriously. Stay at home. Watch the best of David Caruso. Or watch Pamela Anderson on Celebrity Jeopardy. Watch the grass grow. Watch water boil. Just don't watch a movie here. You'll thank me!
