I ordered a teriyaki bowl, to go. 20 minutes later, I was still waiting. Some people who came in after me had already been served - with the same dish I ordered. Two people who ordered before me hadn't been served yet, either. The cashier didn't even offer an apology when I asked for a refund. She seemed to be on some hell of a drug, or perhaps practicing astral travel while taking orders.  Pretty awesome.
