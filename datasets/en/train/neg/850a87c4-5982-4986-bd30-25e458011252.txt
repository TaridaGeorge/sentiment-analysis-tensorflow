I would rate them ZERO stars if I could. My partner, who is deaf, went to the store to replace a broken part on one of my waterpipes. The lady at the front desk was extremely rude and asked him to leave after he showed her the part that he needed. She literally pushed him out of the shop as he was trying to explain what he needed. Either this store actively discriminates against the deaf or the woman who was minding the store is a complete b*tch.
