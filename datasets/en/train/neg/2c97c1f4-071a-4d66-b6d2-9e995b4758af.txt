If I can be honest, my wife, daughter and I simply tried to make the most of it since we were almost certain we would be murdered. It was scary as hell and there was NOTHING even worth considering buying. It's dirty, gross and in the middle of a nowhere totally freaky town. I'm actually positive that this is the town that "From Dusk 'Til Dawn" took place in at the end. 

Stay away, go find a scorpion to sting you in the eye instead.
