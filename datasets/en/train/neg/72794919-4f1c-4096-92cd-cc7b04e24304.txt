My good pal Jeff C. was so kind to give a girl a sample of the Fairytale Original brownie....

2 words: Not Impressed....

I was expecting more from Eileen Spitalny and David Kravetz but instead got a crumbly, way too softty, chocolate disaster....literally when I went to give a piece for a friend to try it broke in half....I know soft is yum but too soft is 15 thumbs down....

I expected something that would please my palate but instead recieved a rude awakening....
