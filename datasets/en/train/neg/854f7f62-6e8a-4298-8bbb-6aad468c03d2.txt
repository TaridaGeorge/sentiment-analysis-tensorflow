I hate this place! I don't know why I ever go in there! If there were a JoAnns every 5 miles I would gladly go there! Every time I go a Michaels I am sadly disappointed. No matter what store I go into the employees are dull, unfriendly and lazy! They are always carrying on dumb conversations. The lines go on forever. The old lady cashiers are always rude like I'm wasting their time! There's always something on the wrong shelf so when you get to the cashier she looks at you like you're lying or just stupid!!! They have lost my business!!! Someone needs to get the District Manager in these stores because they wont stay in business with that customer service!!!
