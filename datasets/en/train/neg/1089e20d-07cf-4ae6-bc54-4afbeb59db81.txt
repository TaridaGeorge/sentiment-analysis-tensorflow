Went for minor throat symptoms. Was prescribed prednisone (a steroid). When I got home and checked the bottle, it was labeled cephalexin (an antibiotic) and had someone else's name! Turns out everyone got the right pills, but my bottle had the wrong label. So not as bad as it might have been, but still an unacceptable mistake. Doubt I will use them again.
