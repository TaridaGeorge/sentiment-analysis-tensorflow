Pros:  Biscuit and gravy is A+.  Everything else - eh.
Cons: The service is laughable.  You would think the wait staff is straight out of the movie Clueless - especially the male waiter that works by the kitchen.  He will forget your order, has no idea what's on the menu, and will not refill your water.  When the restaurant gets "filled" with 3 full tables, everyone hits panic mode.  I wasn't sure whether to stop, drop, and roll or jump up and join the excitement at having more than 10 people in the restaurant at one time.  

I'd rather have a hangover than deal with the service at this Club.
