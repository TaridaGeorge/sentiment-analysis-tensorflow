Rude and sloppy. About three months ago I decided I would stop coming here after being cut on two different occasions by manicurists while they trimmed my cuticles. But in a bind and needing a spot right in that neighborhood I decided to give it one more try. I walked out with NO manicure, because the manicurist messed up my gel, then I had to soak to start over, and I had no time to start the whole process over. No one even apologized. There are one or two girls here who actually do a good job but if you get one of the others, you're wasting your money on a crappy manicure.
