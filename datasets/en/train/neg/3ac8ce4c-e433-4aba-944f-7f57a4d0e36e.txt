Worst gym I've ever went to. The staff is always trying to sell you stuff and the equipment isn't maintained very well IMO. I cancelled my membership after 7 months and started going to 24 hour fitness up the road. I also had multiple problems with the billing because they always seemed to double charge on the kids club.
