I'm writing this review mainly for the McDonald's inside (since it's a given any Walmart is one star). 

This is easily the worst run McDonald's I have ever had the displeasure of going to. Whether it's stale over cooked food or making you wait an eternity to get your food, it sucks every time without fail.  This location is the closest to my home, so once in a while I get sucked in to try one of the Extra Value Meals.  They have gotten me for the last time. I refuse to eat here ever again.  Eh, I'll be better off anyway.

Also, Walmart's produce is the worst since it is awful organic produce.  Waste of money for an inferior product.
