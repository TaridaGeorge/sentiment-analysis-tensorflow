Went here because we had bought a coupon off of LivingSocal.com. First the service was lacking. There was only two other tables seated yet it took 10 minutes for someone to acknowledge us.  The food was mediocre tasting. The chickpeas were hard in the channa masala, the chicken tikka masala tasted burned and the shrimp in the shrimp kadahi was overcooked.  We ordered the food spicy and I found the food to be bland with just spice (heat). We did complain about the chicken tikka masala and they did switch it out for us.  The worst of it all was that they didn't accept the Livingsocial voucher. The manager gave us some lame excuse and claimed that he had a sign up stating that. It wasn't up that night for us to see. Frustrating!  I won't be going back.
