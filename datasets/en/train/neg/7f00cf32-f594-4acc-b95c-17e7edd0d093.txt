There are no car washes in the area except this one. You have to put exact change in the machine, and it never takes bills. You have to go inside to get a code to use the wash, which is inconvenient! Why doesn't the machine want to take your money, I have no clue. This car wash could be making a lot of money given it's location, but it's junk. I will never give this gas station my money again.
