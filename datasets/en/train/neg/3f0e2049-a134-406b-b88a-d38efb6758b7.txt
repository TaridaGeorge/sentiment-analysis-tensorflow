This place used to be Filibertos but is now Juliobertos.  I've been a few times as it's close to my work and sometimes I crave some carne asada.  Juliobertos is the same exact thing as a Filibertos but not as good.  Not that Filibertos has been good for about 10 years.  Remember back in the day when you could get a huge foot long carne asada burrito for just over 3 bucks?  Those days are long gone.  There is more tortilla than carne asada inside these burritos.  Their tacos are also greasy and lacking in flavor.  I've also had the nachos which were made with hamburger meat and what tasted like canned refried beans.  Grease overload.  The flies on the window were Gods way of asking me why would you put this garbage in the body I gave you?
