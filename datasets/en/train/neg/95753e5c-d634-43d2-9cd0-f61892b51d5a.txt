Purses. Junk

Jewelry. Junk

Shoes. Junk

I came here specifically looking for purses and what they had were either soccer mom or old granny purses. I saw some purses that were a little better but they were over-priced. I think even Walmart has a better and nicer selection of jewelry and that is not saying very much. Shoe selection was shabby, not a looker in sight.
