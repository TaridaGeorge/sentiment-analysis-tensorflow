DO NOT EAT THE BEANS! My coworkers and I went to Arribas yesterday for lunch and we all thought that something tasted weird about the beans. Two of my coworkers ate them anyway and put lots of salsa on them to cover up the taste. An hour after eating they were both feeling sick and went home.Both of them were sick with food poisoning ALL night last night. We will never go back! Plus the service wasn't great and the rest of the food was only mediocre.
