I was well aware of your 48 hour cancellation policy and was not expecting any money to be returned.  Yes, it was nice of you to offer, but that is all it was.  What I did not expect was the insults and berating from this man.  Which in my opinion was uncalled for and totally out of line.  So buyer beware.
