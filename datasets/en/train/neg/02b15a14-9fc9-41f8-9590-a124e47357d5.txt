Incredibly rude, and terrible customer service.  I have ordered from this location twice, both times the service has been shockingly bad.  From the delivery guy who brought me my pizza, to the main reason why I writing this review, the lady who took my order over the phone.  I was appalled at the low level of her customer service and impatience that she had with me and taking my order.  I was a loyal customer until this happened again...change your attitude Barro's, I'm not the only one who feels this way.  I guess taking orders over the phone to make money is a really stressful job.
