I dont think the price is worth the food. I asked for my gorgonzola steak medium rare and got it bloody red rare. I would have asked them to take it back and cook it some more but the gorgonzola cheese would be an absolute disaster for that. Others complained about their steak.

I would rather cook myself or go to outback... or any other high end steakhouse in the same price range.
