Service is not good. The food tastes flat. The ambiance is somewhere between a sports bar, a mongolian BBQ and a cheap chinese restaurant. The drinks are not good and prepared by non-professional barmen and barwomen. I had to ask for the bowls to be replaced because they were dirty and the waitress didn't see anything wrong!!! For the same money I can have better food across the street at Pei-Wei.
