One star is probably not right, because the museum itself is very nice, especially for young (2-5 yo) kids. 
HOWEVER, it's expensive (pay for adults) and it is completely overrun by older school children-what exactly they are learning there I am not sure. I feel like I wasted 33 Dollars and valuable time off going there. Being told by a staffer to come after lunch (my kid's naptime) did not exactly help in raising my opinion of this place. Also, being told that today was a "slow" day for field trips triggered me writing this review-you really don't want to go there on a busy day. Apparently, they show on their website how many visitors are expected that day, so that might be helpful, but I haven't seen that yet.
