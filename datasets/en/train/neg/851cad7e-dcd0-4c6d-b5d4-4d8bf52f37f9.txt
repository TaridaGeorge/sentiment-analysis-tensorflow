Boobies, bad food, below average service, good for watching sports.

That about sums it up.

Had a burger and garlic fries that were both disgusting and inedible.  Burger was supposed to have grilled jalapenos, they were just cold ones thrown on.  The taste was not good.  The garilc fries were soggy and oily with no real garlic flavor...not even real garlic it seemed.

The service is below average with most of the boobies, I mean girls, chatting amongst themselves and ignoring customers.

I just did not enjoy this place and will never return.
