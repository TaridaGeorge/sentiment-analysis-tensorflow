Went there this weekend.  The employees are operating under the directive that they are there to train the CUSTOMERS.  Customers at this Paradise are to not ask for too much and to do everything so the high schooler employees don't have to do too much.  

My neighbor had warned us about this Paradise location....but we took relatives who were staying near at Gainey Ranch... mistake.
