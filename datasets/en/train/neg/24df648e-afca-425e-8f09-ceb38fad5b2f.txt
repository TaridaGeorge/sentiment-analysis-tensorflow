We had the worst 2 experiences EVER here!! Went for dinner and had absolute HORRIFIC service. I asked for lemons for my Salmon, received it 15 minutes later after asking 5 people for it. Needless to say my food was cold by then. Waiter never offered to refill our drinks. It was very disappointing. We decided to try it again for breakfast to give a second chance. STRIKE 2. Horrific service again. Not even sure if after the waiter took our order, he remembered we were there. It was so frustrating. Then when we tried to get a manager involved. She was no help. Will never go eat here again. I can't believe a place like this was horrible. DO NOT GO HERE, WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!
