Mickey's is always packed with the worst people in town.  It smells.  It's loud in a bad way - think a constant stream of brospeak.  I gave it an extra star just because they serve beer (hey, I'm easy to please) but then took it away because they serve Schlitz in a can.  That was a lot cooler when I was 21 and broke, now I just find it in poor form.
