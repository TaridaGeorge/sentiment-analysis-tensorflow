getting through the phone menu is a nightmare...87 different choices and a constant recording of "press 1 for this location, press 1 for this department, press 1 for something else...press 1 to be directed to, press 1 to go here, press 1 for this type of pool, press 2 for a spa, press 3 for phoenix, press 4 for kierland. Im sorry what?
Is there a number for retail supplies on thomas rd or is there a number for a live person
