They started out okay, but within just a few months they had stopped coming and I never heard from them again! :( Very unprofessional and disappointing. Would not recommend these guys to anyone that is looking for good, consistent landscapers. If you want someone that will come for a while before leaving you in the lurch and do an okay job, these are the guys for you! If you like unpredictability and the adrenaline rush of not knowing if your landscapers will show up as scheduled to spiff up the yard the day before you are having a big pool party, this is the perfect place for you!
