Food was ok they didn't bring out my friends meal about 15 minutes after mine it wasn't hot. Highlights greens although don't add salt. Waffle tasted like a piece of fish had been dropped in the batter but that was only one bite. Overall I'll be looking for a different place next time I eat in the area.
