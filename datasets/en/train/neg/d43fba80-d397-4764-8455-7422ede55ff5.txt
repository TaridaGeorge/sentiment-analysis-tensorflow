Ordered a gyro combo w/ fries and a side of falefel to go.  Falefel came with 5 of them decent sized.  They lacked flavor and moistness.  The dip that came with them was also on the plain side.  The gyro was one of the worst I've had in a long time.  The bread was not fresh, the meat was dry, and the vegetables were sad.  The fries were probably the worst part of the whole ordeal.  Imagine cutting a potato up and throwing them in hot oil for a few minutes and then not straining them and throwing them in a container.  They were soggy, oily, and hung like a wet noodle.  I will never come here or recommend anyone else coming here.  God, if you are listening, this zip code needs a decent restaurant.  How I wish Z's Greek was closer...
