Can't give this place any stars!   My wife and kids thought we would try this place on Wednesday night.  The food was terrible.  The cab was bad, the shrimp was bad, the watermelon was bad.   My kid tried the jello and said that tasted funny.   We overheard another table point out the crab was bad and the watress apologized to them and went to check the rest of the crab to confirm it was bad.  Then during the meal my daughter pointed out a roach on the wall next to her.  As we paid our $41 for our meal and as we were leaving we saw the waitress getting rid of all the crab and she asked if everything was alright. She knew the answer!
