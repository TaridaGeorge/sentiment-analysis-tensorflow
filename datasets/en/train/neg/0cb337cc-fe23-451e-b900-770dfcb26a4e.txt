The guy at the front desk was very condescending on the phone and when I arrived.  They only actually changed my oil but marked they put a new filter in and vacuumed/cleaned windows.  I thought my coolant was low but they said the fluids were all fine.  Well I checked again today.  No coolant at all and my engine is running hot.  Awesome job guys!
