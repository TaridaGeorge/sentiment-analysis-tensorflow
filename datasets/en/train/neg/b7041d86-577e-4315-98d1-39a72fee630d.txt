Vile megastripmall of the future. No wonder H&M wouldn't settle down here despite so many chicken sacrifices from cheapskates who would love an alternative for cheap officewear cut to fit actual human beings (suck it Target and Old Navy boxpeople). 

There's not much more that can be said about how poorly planned the parking and store layout is, all the other One Star Crew reviewers have nailed the relevant points. 

The biggest gripe I have about this place is that it is in an area where I need to shop. 

Driving out to other "outlying" Targets, Petsmarts, etc, is a pain in the ass so there I go to Tempe Marketplace again! Being such a typically lazy American consumer pigdog and resorting to the last resort fills me with the sort of self-loathing usually reserved for bikini season or high school yearbook viewings.
