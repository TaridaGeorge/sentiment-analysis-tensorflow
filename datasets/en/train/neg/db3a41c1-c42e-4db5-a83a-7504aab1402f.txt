The rooms are nice but my property was stolen from my room. 
1 Wacom tablet and mouse
1 button down shirt (yes a shirt!).

  only noticed the shirt missing then when I returned home noticed that my Wacom tablet was missing as I needed to edit some images. I only had one bag for my trip so it was always with me (it's a messenger bag). 

Waiting to hear back from the hotel...if it's not what I want to hear then I'll file a policy report. I fault myself for not noticing right away but I've never ever had this happen to me before. Not good times.
