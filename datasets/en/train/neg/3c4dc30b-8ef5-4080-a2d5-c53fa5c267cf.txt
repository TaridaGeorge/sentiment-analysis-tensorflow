The manager here (possibly owner) is a complete asshole. The bread wasn't cooked and was gooey all wet and he refused to re-make the sandwiches. He's a real cheap bastard. The workers seemed to be in good spirits; I have no idea why seeing who they work for. I wouldn't return to this location if you paid me!
