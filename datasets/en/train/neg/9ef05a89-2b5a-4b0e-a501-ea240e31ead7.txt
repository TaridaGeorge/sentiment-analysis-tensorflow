So I thought reading their menu, seeing it in Chinese language and in the 
Chinese District . . . it could be a real find -- I love dives with surprisingly good food.

 I was soooooo disappointed.

The egg drop soup was vegetable soup and just warm.  A minute after my soup
was served, my main course came out.  It had two items--pea pods and pork.  Not very BBQ flavor, rather a funny flavor.  No other veges such as water chestnuts or bamboo shoots.  The minimal sauce was very bland.  The rice was not fresh.
