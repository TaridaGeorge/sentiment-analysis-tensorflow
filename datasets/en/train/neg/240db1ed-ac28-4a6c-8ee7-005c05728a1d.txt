This company has terrible customer service as far as I'm concerned. They also made a firearm ammunition sale to me that was not according to federal law. I consider myself a reasonable person and understand people make mistakes. It is a very fun place to visit but their selling practices and and customer service on the management level are absolutely unacceptable.
