Not sure that it's any better than other options in the US Air terminal there at Sky Harbor, but it was bad. Slow service and awful food. Even the diet coke seemed to be mixed incorrectly. Had an overpriced sandwich with waffle fries that were coated in some weird mixture. I was trying to avoid the other awful fast food options there, but I should have just gone to burger king.
