Is open enrollment the new policy here or do they just let anyone in who can fill out the application?  I've read that class sizes are even larger, and I'm not talking about the 400 person lecture halls.  The classes that were formerly capped at 40 are now upwards of 70, even for elective classes in the various humanities that are normally essay or paper focused forms of evaluation.  Oh boy, nothing like a political philosophy class with a bubble form exam to stimulate the mind!

Parking is atrocious and they bend you over for the prices as well.  Many faculty are research focused only with virtually no effort put into teaching, except for those that see their courses as a golden opportunity to indoctrinate their students into their various political views.  What a joke this place is...
