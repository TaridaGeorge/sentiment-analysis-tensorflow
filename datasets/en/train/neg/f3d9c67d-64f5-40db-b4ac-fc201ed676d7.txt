NEVER AGAIN! We went at 8:30 on a Friday night. We were seated & drinks were filled once. They said they were closing at 10, however they were too busy closing to run the restaurant. The food was cold & old. No new food was placed out while we were there. The person who was supposed to be our "server" was eating ice cream & the "hostess" was eating at her station, so we bussed our own table. While at the buffet, an annoying employee was trying to get me to eat the last of several differ dishes, I assume so she had less to clean up. What a waste of time & money. Thumbs down. Negative 5 stars. Don't eat there!!! In n' out is in the same parking lot!!! Just sayin.
