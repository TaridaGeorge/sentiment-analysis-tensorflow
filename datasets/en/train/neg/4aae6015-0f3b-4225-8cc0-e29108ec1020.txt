If you are looking for a camera or accessories do yourself a favor and drive past Ritz Camera! After spending nearly $1400 on a Nikon camera and having it 13 months, the staff at Ritz told me that because I didn't buy their "extended" warranty that would not help me regarding a defect with the camera despite the fact that Nikon has a 1 year manufacturers warranty. Their "solution" was for me to bring it in so they could send it to CRIS camera repair ($45 charge) and they would determine if it was a defect or damage caused by me. They wouldn't contact Nikon-I had to make the call!

For $25 I took it to Tempe Camera and now it is heading to Nikon for repair. Maybe when Ritz goes bankrupt again they'll realize that "customer service" still counts!
