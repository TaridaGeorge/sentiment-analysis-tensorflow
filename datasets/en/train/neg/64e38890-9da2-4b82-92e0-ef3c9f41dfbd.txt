This place is new??? Dirty room, crappy breakfast. When I asked for a new pillow because I didnt like the thickness of mine (size of a cylinder block! 1.5 feet thick! Huge and uncomfortable pillows), they said "they're all like that. Put it between the matressed" and laughed thinking I would play along. I sat there unphased and angry and walked away unsatisfied. Also the Internet connection is atrocious! Never will stay here again!
