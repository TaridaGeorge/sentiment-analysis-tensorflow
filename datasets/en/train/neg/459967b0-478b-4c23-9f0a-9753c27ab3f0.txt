Won over by the reviews, I decided to try this place for dinner and am incredibly disappointed.  I like to keep bad reviews short and concise, so...

-Had the orange chicken and "crab angels"
-Strips of odd color chicken that had the texture of beef jerky and even covered in the sauce did not taste like anything.  Honestly, it was a little strange, really like, nothing.
-Crab angels were under cooked and very bland.
-Rice, old and, just old.

Yep, never again.
