I usually don't like ripping on places too often but people are WAY too high on this place. ITS  A DUMP! It's full of bratty screaming kids, dirty-nasty-stained-clothing and shoes and there's always a need for police there. I could see if it actually sold desirable clothing there but I wouldn't even call it last years fashions. Most of the stuff there was never "in style." It smells like a sewer in there as well. I would rather pay full retail for something then to ever step foot in this dump.
