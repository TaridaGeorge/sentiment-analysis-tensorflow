I haven't seen a motel this scary since The Shining. Room 325 stunk, and 326 stunk worse. The beds must have been slept in by sumo wrestlers. The 2nd floor walk way  was slightly bent, and felt like it was going to collapse. The AC was noisy. I'm a little surprised  we didn't see ghost.

The bathroom looked clean, except for a mold stain behind the toilet. The staff was friendly and attentive. Perhaps not too strange, the clerk didn't ask us how are room was.
