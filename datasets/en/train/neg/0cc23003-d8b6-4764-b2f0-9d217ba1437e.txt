It is what you would expect from any themed place called "Heart Attack Grill".  Mirrors on the bottom part of the bar so you can see up the skimpy outfits the "nurses" wear at the bar.  Van in the drive through section is painted to look like an Ambulance.  Hamburgers are named after cardiac events.

The food was bad, greasy unlimited fries and a giant hamburger that tasted as if they mixed in filler of some kind we had never experienced before.

If you plan on going, enjoy the experience cause the food will not be something you would head back for again.
