hi, so i have lived downtown for the past 10 years and i've seen it grow substantially some good some bad, any ways its good that places like this keep opening but the problem with phoenix is that people think they are to cool. i went to the roosevelt on friday night to have a beer and had a terrible experience the bartender was very rude and had mayor attitude like we did not deserve to be there, so to the owners of the establishment maybe you need to talk to your bartender so she changes the attitude problem. :)
