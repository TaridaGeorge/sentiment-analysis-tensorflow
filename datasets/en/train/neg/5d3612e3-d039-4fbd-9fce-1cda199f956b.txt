I stopped here after Lunch for some Baklava.......well........
That was by far the WORST Baklava I've ever eaten.

I was so disappointed, after reading the reviews I was expecting something that would knock my socks off.

I ordered 1 piece of walnut and 1 piece of pistachio. They looked perfect (see pics) 

Boy are looks deceiving, I bit into soaking sticky wet Goosh, it was so soggy and stale at the same time, I literally spit it out along with the next bite of the pistachio piece, both not worthy of swallowing, it was that bad!

I guess I'm spoiled, nobody makes Baklava better than my Mom or my Gramps, I need to make a trip home.

1 star for their Baklava, I'll have to go back to rate the food,maybe.
