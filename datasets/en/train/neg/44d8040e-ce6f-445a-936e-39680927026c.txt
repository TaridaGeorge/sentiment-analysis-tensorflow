Meh. Seriously, meh. I would never have chosen to come here on my own but my office group picked here for our end-of-year luncheon so I was sort of obligated. It's just kind of....well....it's gross, frankly. I already get weirded out by buffets but this one was really gross. The "sushi" is so disgusting and nothing is labeled so you have no idea what you're even putting on your plate since many of them are fried, which means they are soggy since they've been sitting out god knows how long. The order to things is bizarre. They have donuts next to shrimp next to fried rice and apple pie next to pizza but then they have a whole separate section for desserts? The food was bland, oily and lukewarm. Ugh, never again. If my work picks this place again, I'll feign the stomach flu.
