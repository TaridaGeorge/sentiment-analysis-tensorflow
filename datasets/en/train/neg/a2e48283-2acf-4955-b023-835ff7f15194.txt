Worst Mani-Pedi Ever! We stopped in on a week-day afternoon with out of town guests wanting a quick fix for nails and toes. Ew. Filthy dirty store and if I get a fungus I will NOT be surprised. Ew... again. My fingers are sore and cut around the cuticles and my nail polish on my toes came off the very next day. And, the manicurists were yelling at each other back and forth with no regard for clients. They kept talking about other salons where the manicurists don't speak English. Very unpleasant, sarcastic, and demeaning atmosphere. Cheap, for sure ... but you get what you pay for. Awful Awful Awful.  Oh, and no putting your tip on your credit card either as if I was going to leave one....
