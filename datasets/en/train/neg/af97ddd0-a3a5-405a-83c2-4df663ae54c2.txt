dillards. we were once friends. a very good friend of mine was shopping here last week. she was carrying a top searching for the fitting room when the employee approached her and asked if she needed help. my friend said she wanted to try the top on, to which the employee said, 'i'm sorry, i hate to be honest with you honey, that's just not going to fit.'

my friend was obviously horrified and left the store immediately. 

i was shocked to hear this. this is one of the most unfortunate things i have ever known anyone to experience.
