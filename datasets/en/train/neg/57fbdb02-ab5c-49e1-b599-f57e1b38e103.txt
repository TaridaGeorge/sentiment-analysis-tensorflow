I cant imagine a chain that is so poorly run, but it is.  I have never had a delivery order without either a mistake in my order or a half raw pizza crust.  Wait times are insane, the staff not helpful at all for any reason.  Last time I called for delivery they forgot to put my order in period and then discounted me 20% for my trouble, as if that makes up for a 90 minute wait time.  While I prefer Pizza hutt pizza in general, I would much rather go to Domino's or Papa John's because it really is unbearable.
