I don't know how anyone can give this more than 1 star. After reading peoples reviews I think that the buffet at one time was good. I wouldn't eat here again if you paid me. This is the worst quality of food I have ever had. It was tiny and the selection of foods were horrible. Greasy mess. I ate the bare minimum to get me full. I should have got my money back. Will never eat here again it's all yours old people.
