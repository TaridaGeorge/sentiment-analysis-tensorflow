Apparently a lot has changed since November of last year with Dr. Jensen.  He DOESN'T take any time to listen to any concerns or questions that you have; he's just interested in getting you in and out as quick as  he possibly can so he can go on to the next patient and collect even more money.

He doesn't strike me as being very competent either; he suggested surgery for a medical condition for my wife (without recommending any surgeons or even suggesting how to go about getting this done) even though I'm sure there are plenty of more cost effective alternatives to surgery, which leads me to wonder if he gets a cut off of  any referrals that he makes.
