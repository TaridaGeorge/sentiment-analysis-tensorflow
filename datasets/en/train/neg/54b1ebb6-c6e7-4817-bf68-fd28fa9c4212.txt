Wow.  Hmm.  How does this place stay open?  Bad bald bartender who is straight out of corporate Appleby's,  inconsistent drinks,  and heinous food.  Location is good...
The mural inside and out is crappy.  I do like the groovy green booths.
Maybe it is like watching a train wreck --  super professional bald bartender has the worst people skills ever -- and he can't remember a drink.  And he made a big point about giving me my drinks at happy hour prices during happy hour.  
I really wanted a place to day drink after the Newsroom closed.  This is not it. Some kind person should put this place out of its misery.
