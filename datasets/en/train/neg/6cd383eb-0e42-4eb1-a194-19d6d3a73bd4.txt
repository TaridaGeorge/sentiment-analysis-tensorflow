They promised they would have my car fixed in under 30 days from massive hail damage.  Instead, they had it for 45 days.  I had to pay for two weeks of car rental out of pocket because they took so long, then it wasn't fixed right, and I finally had to have my insurance agent step in to force them to do the job right.  Very unprofessional, and I will never bring them my business again.
