slllllloooooooooooooowwww.  Always a line and not enough help at prescription counter; makes me wonder..is there is a Dr. Feelgood in Maricopa??  All these dreadful souls there to pick up their oxy and Vicodin?  Not to mention, overpriced.  And do not take initiative when there is a problem.  GO TO COSTCO!!!!!
