stay far away from this place,  you'll get what you pay for with the 100 dollars for the year membership, they handle the crowds by being as cold and unwelcoming as possible, non-members stay away!!!!!!  on Saturdays and Sundays it  is extremely crowded and employees will do everything they can to make sure that you do not "get in the way" of the members. (be prepared to get kicked out).  It is more like an NRA cult then a gun club, don't waste your time or money, there are plenty of professional gun clubs in AZ do not even consider this one as an option.
