I was on a mission to find a birthday present for my mom, so I gave Steinmart a shot.  Tucked away in the center by Bamboo Club and Chili's, it doesn't look too bad from the outside.  

I walked in, took about 30 paces, and was overcome with an overwhelming sense of depression.   I spotted some jeggings and muumuus on racks that were awkwardly high for the place...this store is not well-planned.  

As claustrophobia sank in, I glanced around for home wares and spotted a tiny little section by the main entrance.  They had a couple grill racks and some tacky, kitschy knick-knacks.  I think not.  

I high-tailed it out of there, increasingly relieved as I made progress toward my car.
