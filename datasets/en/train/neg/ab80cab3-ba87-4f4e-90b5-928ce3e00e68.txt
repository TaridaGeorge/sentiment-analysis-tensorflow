I hate to be the first bad review but my husband and I were REALLY disappointed.  We got  a slice of the Hazelnut Cake with Mocha Ganache Filling and the Old Fashion Vanilla Bean Cake.  Both cakes were very dry and bland, and lacked sweetness.  The icing was too sweet.   I don't think I'll be back.  If I do, I'll try something else, like a cupcake or cookie, as everyone else seemed to rave about.
