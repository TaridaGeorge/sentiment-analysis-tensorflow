This place is below par. The cashiers are to busy to take care of customers because they're on their cell phones alot Left several message for the manager "Patricia" she never call back so you know where she is as for customer service. The only people who seem to care are the van drivers but they have problems with the staff and under man.
And when does rain you have to be careful where you park due to flooding in the lot.

So lets see 4 days p/week  X $ 7.00 p/day=  $ 28.00 X 52 weeks=$ 1456.00 X my 3 people $ 4368.00 P/Yr. Well Patricia that is what you are losing as of this week. My people and I are moving to another lot.
