Unless you love the smell of mold, urine, and tons of Lysol burning your sinus. Never never stay here. There are defiantly no cozy feelings here, more like the feeling of a crusty old apartment that's been rented out to crack heads who own dogs. Trust me, I had to stay at the comfort inn when i got in at 130 this morning because i could not check in early here. The inn is no palace but is at least comfortable and doesn't smell horrific. Whatever i guess this is my happy home for the next ten days but I'm not sure if i can hack it.
