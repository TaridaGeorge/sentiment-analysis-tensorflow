Why is it that people who work at starbucks think its ok for them to ignore customers when they are in a con station with other staff

All I want is a cup of coffee, I don't want to be your friend, you don't need to know my name. I am the only one I the store! It's not like twenty people are here asking for a black coffee
When I ask for a black coffee why do you ask if I want room? Room for what ? I want it black!

Please Starbucks teach your staff to serve not make friends
