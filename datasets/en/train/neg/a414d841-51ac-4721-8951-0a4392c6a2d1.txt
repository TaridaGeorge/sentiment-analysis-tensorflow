Never again. I have to go to Avis because they're one of my company's "preferred" vendors, but I'll have to make an exception next time. Service was mediocre. However, when I got to the car to my surprise it was a tiny little Chevy Aveo, which I imagine is an automobile only used for rentals, since no one in their right mind would purchase a vehicle like that. If that wasn't bad enough the car wasn't cleaned; filthy inside and out, the clock in the car was about 7 hours off, there was no power steering, and the navigation system kept on falling apart almost causing me to get in an accident every time I took a turn. I'd recommend any other car rental co over Avis.
