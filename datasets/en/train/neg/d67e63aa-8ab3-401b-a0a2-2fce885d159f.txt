The ikea customer service and in particular in the Tempe store is the absolute worst. After months trying to get missing parts from a new bed that was missing from the moment i purchased it, and then ikea sending the wrong ones twice and numerous calls to the corporate office, I finally received the right parts. corporate office promised me a gift card for my troubles which I received today. It's a whopping $25. I feel like sending it back but will actually donate it. Save your time and money. Don't buy Ikea furniture.
