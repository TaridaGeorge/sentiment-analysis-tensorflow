Real Rating should be ZERO STARS, but it makes me put a minimum of one....

No stars for the Tempe Library at 120 5th Street.  "Why not?!" you ask.  Well, I headed there today after reading the reviews and stood at 120 5th Street and noticed that it was home to the Courthouse and the Police Station.  A guard at the court house saw me looking at the building and motioned me in.  He asked, "What are you looking for?"  "The library," I replied.  To which he responded, "Oh, it just says there is a library here on the internet, there really isn't one."    

Hmmm... "It just says there is a library here on the internet."  So, no stars for the library at this address because IT DOES NOT EXIST!!!!
