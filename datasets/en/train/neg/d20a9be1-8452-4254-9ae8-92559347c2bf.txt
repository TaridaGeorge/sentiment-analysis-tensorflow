I hate to leave a bad review because I really like the decor and feel of this place. I have been here three times in the past year and I am just not crazy about the new menu. My husband had the lasagna last night and could not eat it. It looked like it had been reheated for three days in a row. He is actually sick with some kind of stomach virus today and I am thinking about calling the restaurant. I had the flatbread and it was not near as good as my last visit here 3 months ago. I probably won't return. For the price there are much better restaurants in the area.
