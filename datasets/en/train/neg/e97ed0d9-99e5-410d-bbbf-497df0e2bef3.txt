French toast was gummy--pancakes heavy.  Took them 30 minutes to take our order once we were seated, another 30 waiting for our check after we'd finished, and another 15 minutes passed before my husband got fed up and had to go get his change!   Jeez.  The staff WAS friendly but I'd prefer good food and efficient service.
