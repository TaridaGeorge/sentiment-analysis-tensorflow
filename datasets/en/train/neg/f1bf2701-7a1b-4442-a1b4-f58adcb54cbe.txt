Aside from the fact that I had to go back 3 times, the third time should have been in and out as I was told on my way out the 2nd time.  Unfortunately they lied to me and could not see me.  They said they are open till six which means you should serve people until six and and not tell me on the phone "we make sure we see every animal that walks in for that day".  I even them the day before I was going to be coming in approaching 6.
