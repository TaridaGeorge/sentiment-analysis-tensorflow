So...I bought an oil package of theirs, 10 changes, etc. Yet...the last 2 times I've gotten oil changes at Firestone due to the fact they can never seem to schedule me on a time where I wouldn't have to take off of work. Now add to that I'm able to show them that the alignment specs they are using are destroying my not cheap tires and they REFUSE to use a new adjustment. Not that they can't do a manual adjustment, they just won't. Thanks for nothing guys.  Ran up the street to Firestone, not only did they use the manual numbers, but it turns out Fletcher's messed up the alignment to begin with (and may very well be completely responsible for the tire wear).  Riding much nicer now after my visit to Firestone.
