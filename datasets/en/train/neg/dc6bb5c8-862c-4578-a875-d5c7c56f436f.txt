I will never go to NEXT COFFEE again.  I stopped there on the way to a 10:00 Little League game.  They were not busy at all.  The staff of young "college students" (what it says on their TIP jar)  was very rude.  They slowly made my 2 hot chocolates (which were terrible) and put them on the counter without letting me know they were ready.  When I asked if they were mine they said "ya probably," then walked away to continue chatting.  My coffee was terrible and the kids wouldn't even drink the warm milk they tried to pass off as a $3.50 cup of hot chocolate.  It was my first time there and I will not go back.  There are too many other places to go.
