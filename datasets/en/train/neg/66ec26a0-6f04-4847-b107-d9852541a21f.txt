I found out yesterday that all UPS stores are franchises and totally unconnected to UPS. I would never, ever use one again. While in Kauai two weeks ago, I bought a good quality ukulele ($hundreds) and sent it to a relative in the Midwest. It was missing for nearly 3 weeks (finally found yesterday). Still not delivered and opened, so don't know yet in what condition : (

UPS blamed the UPS Store (in Kauai); the store blamed UPS. The long and short, you have even less protection than sending directly with UPS or even the POST office for heaven's sake, because they both can blame the other. This is backed up by legal disclaimers in back-of-the-form fine print. I used this store once and they were WAY unfriendly, but I find that's true of other UPS Stores. And now I'm done with all of them.
