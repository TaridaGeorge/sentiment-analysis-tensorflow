Wow, I never would have expected a hotel this dirty and unsanitary. I am not one to be picky when getting a cheap hotel, but holy smokes was this place nasty. The shower was clogged, the bathroom had hair all over it by the bunches, the kitchen was not cleaned, the bed had stains all over it. The television didn't get every channel and the homeless people didn't help. I'm just stunned at such filth. Please do follow my advice and avoid this dump. It was straight out of a movie
