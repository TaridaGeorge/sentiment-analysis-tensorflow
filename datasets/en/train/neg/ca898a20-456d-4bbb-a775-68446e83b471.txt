I have been to this location on several occasions thinking I would give this place the benefit of the doubt, but boy was I wrong. The prices are great, but the food is NOT. 

All three times I have gone to this location the people that worked there had messy work outfits/uniforms and smelt like smoke. They also had dirty fingernails and were acting very unprofessional. The first time I went there the pizza tasted like dirt and another time it was still doughy. I love Little Caesars, just not this location.
