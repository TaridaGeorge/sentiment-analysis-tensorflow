Very unspectacular food.  There are so many other fantastic Mexican restaurants to go to I would pass this one up.  

Chips:    Average from the bag variety.  
Salsa:  Sitting out all day on the tables.  How fresh is that?
Hot Salsa:  In a plastic squeeze bottle.  That's all that needs to be said. 

Refried Beans:  bland.
Tostada:  Average
Bean Burrito:  Average

I know, that's a lot of beans!  But again, I've had some pretty tasty refried beans, and this place doesn't cut the mustard!  

I spent $15 after tax and tip for a 2 item combo and a coke.  It's not worth it. And you're not paying for any atmosphere either.
