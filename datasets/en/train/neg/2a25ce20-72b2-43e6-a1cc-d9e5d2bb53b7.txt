Unfortunately Rightsource is part of a huge insurance conglomeration with glitzy brochures and snappy patient ads. It's about marketing, not healthcare, not true patient care. Rightsource lost my prescription and agreed to contact my doctor to get a new one. It never happened. The medication is one where you can't stop it without gradual withdrawal and it was a bad experience. If you're considering Humana or Rightsource, please check for other insurance options.
