I've had better frozen pizza! This place seems to do decent business, but the pizza was soggy and the toppings almost seemed like they were tossed on at the end of being baked.  The cheese and sauce was bland.  I would not suggest buying a pizza here.  The place was clean and the people friendly, but get pizza elsewhere.
