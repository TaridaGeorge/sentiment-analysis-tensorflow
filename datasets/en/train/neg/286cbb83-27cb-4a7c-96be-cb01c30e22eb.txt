SUCKED/HORRIBLE/WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!     I placed a order It took a hour te get my meal and when i received it my frys were still frozen when served, my sub had hardly anything in it, a slice of meat and hard melted cheese. The wings sucked. I spent 40 bucks there. I would have been better off going to subway and long wongs then this crappy place. When I complained there was no correction for what was served. Never go there. This place is HORRIBLE!!!!
