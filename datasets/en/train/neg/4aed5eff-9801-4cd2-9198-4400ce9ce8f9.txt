I know 2 ppl who won't go back, that's me and my bff that went with me. The sushi was good, but quite pricey. We were disappointed they did not have vegetable/shrimp tempura...we always get that when we go out for sushi but they didn't have it, at all. The service was AWFUL and unbelievably SLOW! The waitress we had was so RUDE and had no knowledge of what she was serving. We had a couple questions about some of the sushi but instead of answering the questions or finding out she made us wait for an "explanation display" which never really even answered our question. We were there for an ungodly amount of time but we survived the stay. Like I said the food was good, but not good enough to get us back into that place!
