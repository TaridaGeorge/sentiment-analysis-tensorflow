Oh Luci's.  I really wanted to love you!  Sadly, I cannot.

When you see 'Healthy Marketplace"  there is a certain level of expectation that comes along with that.  Upon first glance at the menu it's pretty obvious that most of it isn't healthy what so ever.  Where are the fresh salads?  How about some quinoa or beets?  Whole wheat pasta?   How about something made with fresh, local ingredients?  I tried a veggie wrap of some kind and it was ok.  Not memorable at all.  And everything is prepared in this tiny 'kitchen'.  It looks more like a demo kitchen!  How can you truly create amazing food if you have no space to do it?
All in all, Luci's is a big disappointment in my book.
