Bleh. This place looks pretty rough, but it's been here for a long time and I was thinking that the food must be pretty good if it's survived that long. Wrong.  I'd say that at least half of my Hunan chicken & shrimp combo went in the trash. I could've done better with Panda Express and I'll be eating a bowl of Cap'n Crunch in hour or two.
