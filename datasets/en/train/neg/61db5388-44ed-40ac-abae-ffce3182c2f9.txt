The idea behind this was great but the execution was apparently figured out after finishing a bottle of Jack. You have to wonder if the event was but together to support Food Trucks or to just make a quick dollar.

On a side note, all the food we had was great and I want to state that the bad rating is for the event only, NOT a reflection of the Food Trucks that participated. Unfortunately because of long lines, I was only able to try 4 Food Trucks but none of them did disappoint.
