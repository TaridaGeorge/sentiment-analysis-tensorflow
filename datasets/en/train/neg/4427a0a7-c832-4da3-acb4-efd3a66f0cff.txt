Just walked out of this place after being seated and ignored for 15 minutes in a mostly empty restaurant.  3 servers walked past us and even after alerting the empty headed hostess of our plight another 5 minutes passed.  We gave up and have forever given up on this place.  Can't wait for Sushi Brokers to open their new location.  At least the service is
always good there.  Done with Stingray!
