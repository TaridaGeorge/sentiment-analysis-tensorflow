This pizza is absolutely foul!
I can't believe that anyone likes this place!  It's so disgusting and greasy.  I ordered sausage and it was shredded and salty.  So gross.

And what's the deal with having them on every corner?  Worse than Starbucks!  I swear there are about 3 or 4 within about 5 miles of my house on Carefree Highway!
