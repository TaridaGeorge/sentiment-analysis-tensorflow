There is nothing simple about this airport. Security sucks. if you are connecting from one airline to another, you have to go through securtiy again. and they don't care how short a window is for  your connection. 
If you have to go to another terminal to connect, there are no signs to tell you which airlines are in which terminal. Employees are not helpful. 

I hate this airport. I would rather have a root canal than to fly into/connect through sky harbor.
