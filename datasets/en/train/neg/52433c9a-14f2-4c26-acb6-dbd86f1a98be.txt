Total disaster. I hardly ever go here except for the odd occasion when I need some obscure item. Today I needed two such items so I headed over to wal mart.  And wouldn't you know it! They were out of both! All I wanted was some sugar free vanilla coffee syrup and a pair of brown dress shoe laces. They had a dozen other coffee syrups but no sugar free vanilla. And they had at least 20 different types of shoe laces but not one pair of brown dress shoes. I could see the prices for both items but this store was clearly out of stock. Maybe this is an indication that the end of the world is near because if wal mart starts running out of food our society is doomed.
