Went here 4 times, 2 of the 4 was to get my gel manicure re-done. All bubbly and rough. So much time wasted. After giving them a second chance I end up wasting 2 more hours in getting my nails re-done, all while the nail tech was practicing her english by asking me about my personal life. Super fun. Then owner blamed the poor quality on his tech, then does an even worse job. Told him if I wasn't given a discount or something free I wasn't coming back, he said he didn't care. So, super excellent customer service. Don't come here unless you like being massively punished.
