WHAT!?  5 stars.  Not a chance people.  I checked this place out because of the great reviews.  They use very nice china and cutleries.  It's clean.  The atmosphere was great but that was all this place has to offer.  The food was mediocre at best.  Asian station was panda express served on real china.  No sushi!!  Dumplings tasted like the frozen ones from Fresh and Easy.  The pizza was not any better than Peter Piper.  Dessert bar was comparable to Old Country Buffet.  Mexican food was mediocre.  Steak was a disappointment.  Gelato was okay.  G  Casino Buffets with no crab legs?  This place was a total disappointment.  NOT worth the money.
