After reading the great reviews about this place, some friends and I decided to try it. The food was AWFUL! I'm not sure if it was an "off night" but no one at our table enjoyed anything we ordered. We ordered the Mac & Cheese which was dry. The steak sandwich had some weird sweet sauce on it. The trilogy of bruschetta was really strange. It was 3 pieces of toast, one had cream cheese and jelly on it? The roasted chicken sandwich tasted like fruit loops. The only thing that was remotely edible was the simple salad. On the flip side, our server was really sweet, the drinks were great, and the atmosphere was nice. I'd come back, but only for drinks. Avoid the menu!
