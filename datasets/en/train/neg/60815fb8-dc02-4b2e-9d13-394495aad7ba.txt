Horrible! Most of the employees, including some who were apparently off duty, were too busy hanging around chatting with each other to get orders packed correctly, interact with customers in a friendly manner, or clean the disgusting bathrooms and customer seating area.

Edited to add this follow-up: Complained to KFC about the lousy service, wrong food, and disgusting, dirty conditions. Got a standard apology letter with a $5 certificate usable only at the location we told them we'd never go to again. Way to go KFC! Way to listen to your customers. Not that they have to since they're so big, but it makes me question myself every time I get a thought about visiting any of their stores, and I've stopped myself from going there from time to time.
