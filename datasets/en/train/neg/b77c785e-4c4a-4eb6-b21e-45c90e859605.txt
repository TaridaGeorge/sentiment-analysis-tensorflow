Drove to this place from Glendale this past Friday. Got there about 5:30pm and not that many people there.

We ordered. Had to remind the waitress about the lemonade since it took awhile and she was texting at the counter. Thought it would be freshly squeezed because of the wait time---nope.

Took hours for the food. Waitress and cook yelling at each other in the kitchen. Someone forgot one of our two orders. Insincere apologies followed.

Food was OK. Agreed with the previous reviewer...Fry's fried chicken is way better!

If you want attitude while they forget your food, this place is it!
