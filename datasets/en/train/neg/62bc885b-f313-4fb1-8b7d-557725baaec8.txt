We went for lunch on a Saturday.  Without doubt, we were served left-overs from the previous night's dinner.  The fries were not even warm, and they were hard, the brisket and ribs were luke-warm and we could see everything getting reheated in the microwave including the Mac and cheese for our kid that had a generous layer of melted grease on top.  We asked to sub the sweet fries with regular fries because those looked more fresh and cooked to order but we ended up giving up and leaving the place to eat across the street @ indulge burger before they got the replacement fries order to us.  Never again - food was not edible.  Perhaps dinner is different but won't be going back to find out.  If I could give this place 0 stars, I would.  Terrible experience.
