THE WORST experience of my life! The service was good and fast but the food tasted like has been frozen for years! Remember the hot dog  commercials back in the day where they advertised that the hot dog would fit in the bun? Well maybe they should of sold one to In-N-Out Burger! The burger filled about half to 60% of the bun. Also the milk shake I got was basically ice cream in a cup. The hype is way over rated! I will never set foot in one again it's not like we don't have enough burger joints to chose from! Two thumbs down!
