I do not recommend this office. Their follow up on test results is terrible, then you can't get answers. Questions during my appointment go unanswered because I'm rushed out the door so quick. I have been going to this office for 4 years and it's gotten progressively worse. I had a hysterectomy there 3 years ago that continues to cause me problems that I'm trying to get looked at elsewhere. Then to top it off, I just found out that they want $25 for me to pick up MY records!!
