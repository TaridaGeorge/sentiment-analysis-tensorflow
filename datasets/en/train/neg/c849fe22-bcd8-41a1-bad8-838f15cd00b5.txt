EL STINKO!So I went in here looking for a firearm that a website said they had but the gun was not in stock. I think they must order guns for people or something, but the pawn shop was lame and it smelled funny to. They hardly had any merchandise as well. Would not recommend this place since they had nothing and it smelled worse than a 50 year old Hodgie Mart!!!!!!!!!!
