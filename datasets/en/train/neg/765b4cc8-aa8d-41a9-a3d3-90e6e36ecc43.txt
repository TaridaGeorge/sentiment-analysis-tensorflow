Terrible!!! The people who work in the shoe dept. need to learn respect! I was there with my sister and the women were making fun of the shoes we were trying on. I ended up getting a pair and later that night they broke on me! I couldn't even go back to those women to return them. I ended up going to the mall in Scottsdale.( MUCH BETTER)
