Everyone raves about this restaurant but I honestly don't get it.  

The set up is certainly interesting...the restaurant is entirely underground...thus the name I think.

I went there with a big group and about the only thing I enjoyed was the conversation!  

The clam chowder was watery and pretty tasteless.  I'm used to good New England chowder after having spent several years on the east coast.  Heck, even Legal Seafoods has better chowda and it's a chain.

The crab cakes were totally overpriced for what they serve and not that great either.  I've had better and cheaper crab cakes from Costco.

Seriously, this place is overpriced for what you get.  I'd say go to Capital Grille or some such place if you want an expensive meal that also tastes good.  

Sorry!  I don't get it!
