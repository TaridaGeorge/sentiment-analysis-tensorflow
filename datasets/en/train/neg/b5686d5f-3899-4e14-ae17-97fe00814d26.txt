Ekkk! We went here after reading great reviews and seeing that it was one of The Arizona Republic's top 10 chinese spots in the Valley.

Nothing was good, I'm sad to report. The sweet and sour soup had such an odd overly bitter taste, it really wasn't edible. I ordered their version of Happy Family and the "spicy brown sauce" was watery, sweet and made the veggies soggy. My husband ordered the bell pepper chicken, which was just OK.

We got our order to go, otherwise I would have sent the soup and my dish back. And maybe would have had a different experience...

We've had such a hard time finding a good traditional chinese place in Phoenix.
