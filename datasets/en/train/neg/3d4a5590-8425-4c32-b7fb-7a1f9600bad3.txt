We ordered.  I had to return my chicken tenders.  Undr cooked and rubbery.  My wife ordered a hamburger and is now home throwing it up.  what a horrible experience.  We have been huge fans and now this?  I called and spoke with someone who barely has a grasp on our language and they said they would get right back to me.  Still waiting My wife is in bed looking so sick.  We will never return!!
