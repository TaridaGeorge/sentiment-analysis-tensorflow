Horrible customer service and complete incompetency. Tried to ship something and the old man behind the counter couldn't figure out how to use the computer. Waited for over a half hour as he took all the  and quotes prices... I believe he is the owner! I prefer to always give my business to locally owned businesses... Not at this place! Try somewhere else for sure!
