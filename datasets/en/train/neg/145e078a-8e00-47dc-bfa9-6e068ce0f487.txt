Worst of airport food.  Since the owning company is in Arizona, they obviously need to come out unannounced and do a quality check.  The meat was very gristle ridden and almost flavorless. Salt and pepper are desperately needed.  The onions were totally under done and the meat seemed precooked so it was overcooked when served.  The fries were not completely cooked.  They should strive to be like Charlies in the Atlanta airport and less like an greedy food vendor who doesn't care about quality.
