i've always liked ihop as a kid but now that im older i watch where my dollar goes and when i have poor service im not giving up my dollar to anybody with that said we entered this IHOP we were seated rather quick by the host our waitress came once asked about our drinks we never saw her again this was early sunday so myself and my family promptly get up and exit no one attempts to ask what's wrong the host was really the only one concerned but made no comment in fact she kinda looked as if that happened before this is not good IHOP
