These people are the worst.  They get a little power over you and they treat you like garbage!!!  They are like Nazis!!  Just mean for no reason.  I hate dealing with them.  Curt and impersonal.  Avoid at all costs!  They like to call themselves a law firm, but they are a collection agency with absolutely no personal touch.  They obviously do not depend on repeat business from anyone they deal with and they show it.  I have never written a review before, but I was compelled to after my last phone call with Christine.  Good luck!
