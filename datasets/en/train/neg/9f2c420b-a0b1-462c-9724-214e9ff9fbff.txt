The food was disgusting and made me sick. The waitress had an attitude and looked like she'd rather be anywhere but there. I will never eat there again. Not worth it. The atmosphere was OK, you get over it after 5 minutes. I just wanted to leave. Plus the food is way overpriced. I would be happier eating a frozen dinner.
