I was seeking a place that I could go to strengthen my marriage and was given a referral. The classes are group sessions and of the 2 hour block that you attend there is about 20 mins of content.

If you approach the instructor at the end of the class in a sincere matter you are quickly brushed off as the instructor seems to be trying to escape as if they know they place is about to be bombed.
