Unlike a previous reviewer my wife and I did not have a pleasant experience.  We did end up with the home of our dreams only after we contacted the seller's agent because it was clear our agent was not working on our behalf.  All they cared about was the sale and frankly bordered on some questionable ethical decisions that came very close to illegal.  We even considered hiring an attorney because of this mess.  If you are selling a home, then maybe they are for you.  If you are buying I'd stay away from this office altogether.  Keller Williams was able to screw us over while we purchased our dream home.  This should have been a pleasant experience, but it wasn't.  Do not deal with them if you have to.  Seek alternatives.
