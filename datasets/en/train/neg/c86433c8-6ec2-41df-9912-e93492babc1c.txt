Our group of 4 adults went on the morning of Mar 17.  The concept is appealing and some of the items interesting.  The blacksmith was great.  However this venture is dependant on volunteers and even though this was a Saturday morning there were not enough volunteers to have the "gun fight".  The cost is modest and parking free.  I would not recommend it.
