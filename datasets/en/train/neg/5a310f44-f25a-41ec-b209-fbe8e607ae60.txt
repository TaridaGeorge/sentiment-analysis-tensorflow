I was so excited to eat here after reading the reviews but we were never served so we finally left. We stood outside for 15 minutes waiting for a table then sat at our table for another 15 minutes waiting for menus, water, maybe some of those chips and salsa. After looking around and realizing that most of the patrons were also looking lustfully toward the kitchen over their empty tables, we decided to go elsewhere. I don't know what was going on, perhaps all their staff called in sick? We were never even able to catch the servers eye, it was so weird. It was a Friday night, maybe we'll try again on a weekday.
