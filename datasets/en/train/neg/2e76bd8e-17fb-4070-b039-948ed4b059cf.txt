Service is non-existent.  Ordered 5 drinks.  Took forever.  A group came in wtih a large dog while we were sitting waiting for our drinks.  The dog was served a bowl of water and a large carrot that he tore up all over the patio while we were stil waiting for our five drinks.  A table next to us had an issue with a bowl of something.  The waiter was holding the bowl in the air.  One of the people in my group asked the waiter what was wrong with it.  The waiter, still holding the bowl, looks over and yells back, there's a hair in it.  We had ordered a couple of sandwhiches.  With the waiter's info, we went up and canceled our order and left.  Good luck to anyone wanting to be served and wanting clean food.
