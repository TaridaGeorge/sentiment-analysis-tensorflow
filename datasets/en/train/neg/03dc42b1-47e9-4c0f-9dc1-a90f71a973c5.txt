NO WAY!  Went there in plenty of time of before Groupon expiration date and got a story that they are booked until expiration.  They would not honor for the Groupon value after that date, even though it was THEIR fault that we couldn't get in.  No, I will not spend the lesser amount coming back to Salt Cellar.  They will get NO money from me.  Groupon will refund my payment.  Rude, rude, manager.  No desire to eat there.
