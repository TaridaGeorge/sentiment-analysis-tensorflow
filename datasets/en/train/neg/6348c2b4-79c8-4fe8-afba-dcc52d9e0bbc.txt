I took my parents here today, none of us had ever been.  The food was terrible, they skimp on all their ingredients.  I ordered the killer Cajun omelette, there was the portions of the food were extremely small, and all the ingredients in the omlette were all on one side of the omlette.  As my father was paying the bill the hostess asked how our meals were, and my dad told her...not very good.  This girl said nothing after!!  Nothing!  If you want below average food and service....this is your place!  If you are looking for a good breakfast then there are many better places in the valley.
