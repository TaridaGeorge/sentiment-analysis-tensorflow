Ashley Manor committed to a memorial service and then after we sent out the evites and planned the event they pulled the plug saying they were over committed. Unbelievable!! Under no circumstance should this have happened.  If they can't book properly how can the do anything properly.  I am appauled. Do not use this venue under any circumstance.
