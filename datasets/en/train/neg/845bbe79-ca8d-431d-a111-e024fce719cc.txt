The girl at the door was unbelievably rude.

The fish was overcooked.  Really bad.  And we specifically asked before ordering, because not all places do fish well - and were told it was the best.  Nope.  The soup was ehh, and the cotton candy was fine.

I can't remember giving another restaurant a one-star review.  But I really will never return and I tell everyone who asks not to go there.  Oh, and it's incredibly loud.  I assume they play the music so loud to disguise the conversation of the people sitting far too close to you (do they really need to jam that many tables in?).

Horrible.
