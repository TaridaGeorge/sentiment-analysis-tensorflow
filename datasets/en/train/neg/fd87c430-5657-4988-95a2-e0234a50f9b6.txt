As someone who was a big fan of this place for years in California, I have to say that for many reasons, this would be the your worst choice for breakfast in Scottsdale. Our previous visits have always been filled with ridiculous waits for OK food and a very dirty table. This past weekend, we had the added bonus of a bitchy hostess/manager that actually mouthed off to one of our party and was completely rude and unreasonable. Please do not give your money to this establishment. (Besides, they only take cash...)
