This one sucks! Was staying at the Hilton, ordered a pizza said it would be here about 11pm, showed up at 11:30pm (I ordered it at 10:20pm) and the pizza was room temp!!!! Called manager, he offered a credit for another medium pizza.  Ok, was somewhat satisfied. But then when I called on Sunday to claim my pizza that was owed to me, the girl on the phone said it would be a little over an hour for delivery!!! What the hell is the point? Are they that short staffed for an entire weekend?!? Bad business.
