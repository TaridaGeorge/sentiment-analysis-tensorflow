As you walk in you are greeted by a sign that says Cash Only ATM inside alright times are tough I get it.  Then you see the special board which read "Good Food Takes Time" and there is a clock next to that.  Fine that's cool but the problem is that after waiting for our "good food" it came out and was awful.  My wife said she has tasted better pancakes out of the freezer section at the grocery store.  $30 later we boxed up the food only to throw it away.  The good news is that we went around the corner to the Breakfast Club and had an excellent meal.
