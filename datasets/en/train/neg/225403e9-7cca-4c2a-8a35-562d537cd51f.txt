Tellers dont know their products or policies!  I went into lobby to confirm that my "paycheck debit card" (BofA) has no fee-as I heard mult. views that they charge a fee to use debit. Teller said "let's try it--then you will know for future.." JUST TELL ME if there is a fee, then I can use the ATM.
Tellers passed my card around giggling like a joke-waste fo time. Teller had to call "policy"  as I waited to find out  if it was real., scanned my license, wrote up a "cash advance"...he never told me if there is a fee!  This Bank does NOT train their people. No CS skills, no sorry for the wait. I may close my actual BofA acct. Is the USA declining in ethics and IQ's --seems so.
