I was referred by my dentist to have a tooth extracted to this office.  My first impression with this office was I felt like I was being nickled and dimed to death.  I already knew what tooth I needed to have extracted, but they wanted to do a consult.  Ok, no big deal, however they wanted a $100 deposit if I wanted it done on the same day as the procedure.  If I came in separately I could do that without paying the $100.  

Oh wait it gets worst..... they called the next day to tell me that it is still going to be an additional $37 just to consult me.  At this point I had had enough.  This whole experience with the unprofessional office staff left me with a bad first impression.  I found another dentist that was more caring.
