This festival sounded like it was going to be amazing! Unfortunately, it was such a bust! Outside of the parking and entrance fees that literally did nothing but get you into the place, you then had to buy tickets to try samples (literally one bite samples) at $2 each. The lines were ridiculous, well over an hour for most AND most of the trucks had run out of food shortly after it started. 

I won't be wasting my time or money on this kind of event again. Sad.
