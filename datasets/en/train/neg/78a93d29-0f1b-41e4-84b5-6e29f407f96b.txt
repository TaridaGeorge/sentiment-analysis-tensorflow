I wish that I would have seen this review before I wasted an hour waiting for this business to open. Mentioning this detail to the employee that I finally was able to speak to found absolutely no concern for the discrepancy or even my presence as a customer. If you have a Dyson vacuum cleaner  that needs repair and this location was assigned to you for warranty, ask for another chain of repair stores...
