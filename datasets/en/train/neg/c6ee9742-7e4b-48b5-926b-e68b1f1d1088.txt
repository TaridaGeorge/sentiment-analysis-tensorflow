Wow I couldn't have been more disappointed with the food. I am far from a picky eater but the burgers were bland and over priced (I have no problem paying even more if it taste good). Service staff was great but the frozen style tasteless patties and fries were massively disappointing. You couldn't get me to eat here again if someone paid me.
