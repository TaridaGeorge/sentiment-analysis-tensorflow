No star would be better, horrible customer service in the "SERVICE" department, and walk-ins not accepted. Stopped there several times staff not helpful, in fact they seemed annoyed by my questions. Was prepared to wait for an oil change (realizing that it was a Saturday and the snowbirds are still here) but was told that was not an option.  No wonder Chrysler in financial hurt, next time I buy American I'm buying a Chevy or Ford!
