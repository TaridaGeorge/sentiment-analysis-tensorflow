Great place to go if you know nothing about wine and just want to gawk at the ladies.  The wine list does not change frequently.  The bartenders are not terrible knowledgable about the wines nor are they terribly friendly.   The wines in the shop are way overpriced and the manager seems to be very uninformed about the wines.   We inquired about a $400 bottle of wine by Heidi Barrett.    You'd think you'd know a ton about a wine if you were selling it at that price point - apparently not.
