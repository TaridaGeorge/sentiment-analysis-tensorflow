What can I say, it's the DMV. It's dirty, it's gross, the chairs are too close together and the rows all face each other so you have to stare the the people in front of you and then look away really quickly when they look at you, it's so awkward and uncomfortable. They laugh in the face of customer service and helpful information can be found more readily in the bathroom walls than from one of the people working the windows. The woman I spoke with gave me a phone number to call when I had a question about my registration for my vehicle. I tried to explain to her that she worked for the DMV, the end all be all of anything related to driving your vehicle. At this point she busted out her pencil and circled the number for me and told me to call it...thanks lady!
