I really would not eat here, I dined here on Saturday 6/16 and used my bank card, after my card was charged and it went through I have continued to get charges from AAPA Investments out of Mesa in which owns Genghis Grill. They keep trying to charge my $15-30 dollar increments continually since Saturday, I had to cancel my bank card, file a claim with my bank, etc. It has been a nightmare, I will never be dining here again due to their fraudulent and unauthorized use of my bank card after I had already been charged. Very Very shady activity.
