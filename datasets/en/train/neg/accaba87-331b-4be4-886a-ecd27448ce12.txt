To put it simply ... This place sucks! I have been asked to eat there three times for breakfast in the last three months for business meetings. You always let the customer choose where to eat, unfortunately they have all asked to meet at the Good Egg on Central. How do you screw up Breakfast? Well,have cold Eggs, cold Potato's, and cold toast! Three out of three times! Horrible Coffee and VERY EXPENSIVE! OMG kill me now if I have to eat there again! The only thing I can say that is positive, the servers seem to be attentive. Go up the road and have Breakfast at 5 and Dinner on 16th St. Not great, but at least you'll get a hot Breakfast and get your money's worth!
