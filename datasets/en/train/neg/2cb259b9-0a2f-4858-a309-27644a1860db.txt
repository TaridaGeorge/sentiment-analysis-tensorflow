Yes, this has dropped to a single star for me after our last experience. We went in for a weekday lunch, so it wasn't super busy. I'd say the quality of the food is the same. What caused the change? The German cockroach climbing the wall behind us. This wasn't a sewer roach. When your house becomes infested with roaches, these are the roaches you find. There is never just one, and the fact that it was in the dining area has it a little too close to the food prep area (which is smack in the middle of the dining room). I'm not generally one to generally worry about a bug or two. Flies come in through the door, etc. Roaches are a different matter entirely. Our last visit was just that... our last visit.
