I am not sure why people are rating this place so high. Maybe we are not clear as to what French cuisine is. My experience was terrible-I have been there twice. The place is very expensive and it's not because it is good. Plates are small, food is not that fres or tasty, and server was arogant. Just save your money and go to another place. Any place.
