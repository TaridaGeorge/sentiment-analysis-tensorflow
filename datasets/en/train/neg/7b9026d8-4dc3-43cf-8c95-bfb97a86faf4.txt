Take warning! Do NOT go here for sporting events, especially football! I gave 1 star bc the wait staff was ok. They did not make the home town team thr priority game. I was tucked in a corner for Cardinals game watching a tv with no HD. I ended up leaving after the first quarter... Better off at home... Or ANY other sports bar in town! In all fairness, I cannot speak to the quality of food or atmosphere when it isn't a game day.
