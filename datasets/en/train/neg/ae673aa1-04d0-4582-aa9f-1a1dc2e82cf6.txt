John Ghiz with Arizona Mobile Pet grooming did a horrible job on my two dogs. He was rather wheezy and tired looking and had my golden and corgi in the van for over two hours and when I called out to him he opened the door and the dogs were only half done. He missed some nails on both dogs, did not clean out their ears, brush them or trim them. He just washed them. Worst and most expensive grooming EVER.
