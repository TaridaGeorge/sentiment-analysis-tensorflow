We've been to lots of Peter Piper Pizzas being that we have young kids and this is the Bday party hotspot. The other night we went here after a final t-ball game. Granted it was a Tuesday night and they likely weren't expecting 10 families to stroll in. 

However, the food took FOREVER to cook and many of the games did not work. We had one family wait over an hour for their food. We brought a lot of business, but not so much that they couldn't cook a pizza on time
