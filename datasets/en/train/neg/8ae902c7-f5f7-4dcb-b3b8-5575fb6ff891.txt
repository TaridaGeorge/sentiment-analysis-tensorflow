From the other reveiews and what I have heard from a friend, I might have to try narcisse again. I was there for brunch this past sunday and was disappointed. After being seated inside, we waited 9 minutes before we were greeted. Right when we were about to get up and leave, our waitress finally appeared asking us if we would like to order a drink. I ordered a nonfat cappucino and without even asking my boyfriend what he would like, she just walked away, clearly irritated that I had ordered a cappucino. She came back a few minutes later saying they dont have nonfat milk. We just weren't feeling it so we left and went somewhere else instead. Im sure brunch is amazing but just the greeting we recieved left a bitter taste in my mouth.
