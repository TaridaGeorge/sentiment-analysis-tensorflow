Worst employee ever!!!  I recently visited this theatre with a friend of mine with a walking disability.  I asked an employee (Alfredo) for some assistance with some extra light for her after the film was over.  Even a flashlight would have been great.  He not only refused, when she finally came out of the theatre he laughed at her.  So insensitive!!!!!  I have made complaints to both the theatre and the main office.  Why this employee is still there is beyond me.
