First, yes, the waitresses were beautiful, even on a Monday night.  Drinks were average at best...lots very dark Jack & Cokes.  
Food was terrible.  Frozen pizza appetizer was the lowlight.  Highlight was the what seemed to be homemade potato chips.  They were nice.
2 stars for the outfits but no stars for service.  Had our waitress had more of a personality, we may have stayed longer.  But weak drinks, bad food and poor service are not a good combination.
Oh, and add in the creepy guys who were there eating by themselves and not a good situation.  Made me long for Hooter's...(OK, that part isn't true.)
