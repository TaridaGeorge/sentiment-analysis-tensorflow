Would not even give it a star. We went there over a month ago and still tell everyone how horrible the food was. Service was ok nothing to write about. There was 4 of us and we all where extremely dissatisfied with the bland lack of flavor we had from every aspect of the meal the best part was the salad at least the dressing! No one finished their food ok the drinks had taste but they didn't make that!!!!!!!save your money go to a street vender.
