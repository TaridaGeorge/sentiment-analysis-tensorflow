Okay, so I went to this Starbucks on Saturday and ordered my usual café mocha and a breakfast sandwich,the sausage classic.

They did not have one so they offered me a spinach-type breakfast sandwich. It was hard as a rock, overcooked, old and I threw it away.

I went by today, which is Thursday, ordered my café mocha and the sausage classic sandwich and, once again, it was old, stale, overcooked and hard as a rock. Had to throw it away as well.

I called the store and the lady said, "what do you want us to do for you"  i said a gift certificate would be nice. Her suggestion was that I drive all the way back to their store to pick it up...Even though I had just said I could not come back to get another sandwich! Ridiculous!!

I will not go back!!
