I went to the Blue Coyote Grill & Bar last night. It was the worst experience ever. I went there with 3 of my friends and it took 45 minutes to get our food. There was nobody in the place just myself and my friends and when the food finally showed up to our table, three of the plates of food were cold. They even messed up 2 of the orders: we had asked for eggs over medium but ended up somehow with scrambled eggs instead. The portions themselves were very small at $10 a plate, while their menu suggested a hearty size meal. I honestly get better service and portions at Denny's then at this place. I would not recommend Blue Coyote Grill & Bar to anyone.
