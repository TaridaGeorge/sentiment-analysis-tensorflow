One star is really too much. We went to the one in north Phoenix (next to Red Robin) on a slow Monday night. It took forever to place our order, then over an hour to actually get the food. It definitely wasn't worth the wait. I'm pretty sure my shrimp wasn't cooked and the only veggies on the shrimp and veggie skewers were onions and barely-cooked zuccinni. The waitress wasn't even a bit apologetic for the wait or quality. I won't be going back.
