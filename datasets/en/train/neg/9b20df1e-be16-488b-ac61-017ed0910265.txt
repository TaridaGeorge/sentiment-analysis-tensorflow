This restaurant had a nice atmosphere, but the food and service were horrible. I ordered the Irish Benedict and the english muffin was soggy and not toasted. The corned beef hash was straight from the can. Our waitress was extremely busy but it seemed like we were bothering her with a request for a water refill. I will not be back to this place. So disappointed.
