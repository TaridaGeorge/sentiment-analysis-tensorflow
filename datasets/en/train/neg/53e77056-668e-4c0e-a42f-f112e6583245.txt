Heard this is the place to go to.  Well, no.  My wife and I went for lunch while on vacation during the week.  Nobody was there-on the weekends it is crazy.  Ok the fries were awesome.  I bit in to my hamburger and it tasted funny so I looked at it and sure enough it was pretty raw on the inside.  My wife's was pink, but mine was raw.  Manager came over after we waited 15 min for a new one.  Tried to explain it was raw, but he just made excuses like that is how they cooked them.  Tried to explain the difference between mine and hers but he wouldn't listen.  Complained on their web site over a week ago and they never even responded.  Good enough for me-I'm done with you Smashburger-never will see a dime of my money again.
