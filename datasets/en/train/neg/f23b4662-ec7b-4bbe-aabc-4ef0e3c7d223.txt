This place is a joke. 

They are completely inept to handle any group larger than 4 people.   Unable to accommodate our  large group, they offered the option of family style.  Sounds like a good idea right?  Wrong. They brought out what I assume to be their regular sized portions for everyone to share.  Family style implies that it feeds more than one person.  They don't need to be Bucca (Disgusting BTW) sized, but geesh.  

On top of all that they don't even serve fountain drinks.  The only serve "natural" products.  Get over yourself. 

I'd rather go buy a frozen Stoffer's and bake it and serve 2 liters than ever go to this disaster of a place again.
