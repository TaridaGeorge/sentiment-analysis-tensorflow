VERIZON 4G LTE MOBIL INTERNET.  What a hunk of junk this thing is.  Constantly resetting, always at the most inconvenient times, you can't use it on battery power for longer than 30 minutes or so, so I always have to use it plugged into 120V outlet...which forced me to spend even MORE money on buying an inverter for my vehicle, which means MORE WIRES..whereas this is supposed to be WIRELESS....Oay Vay..why bother?  And my signal is ALWAYS in the yellow, rarely in the green...yet I am FORCED to pay exactly the same price for lousy reception that others are paying for Excellent reception.  Back in the day when the phone system was run by Ma Bell, things were MUCH better than they are today, yet people today seem to accept higher prices for lousy quality.  It makes no sense at all.  Everyone's gone koo koo.
