I went to the original opening of Old World a few years ago when it was up in North Phoenix. It was a good time, though they only had 2 beers at the time.

I had been meaning to check out the new location for a while now and finally made it down there a little bit ago.

Wish I hadn't. The guy behind the bar was friendly enough and helpful, but aside from a couple of nice posters in the men's room, that was the highlight. The beer was thoroughly eh on tap. The two six packs we took home were both flat with the honey beer being almost undrinkable. The place was a mess.

Hopefully we just caught them on an off afternoon, but I doubt I'll be back to find out.
