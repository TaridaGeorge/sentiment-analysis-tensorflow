I would have welcomed the smell of poppers, petroleum and wet Baby Man diapers set ablaze as if I had just hit the coast for the first time ever and was breathing in salty sea air. Not sure what the stench was, but I am sure I never want to smell it again. Not the scariest of these type places that I have ever been, but trust me, you do NOT want to be there at last call when the lights go up. Some interesting people, but not worth the full contact olfactory assault. Perhaps I dreamt this experience, so just in case, disregard this review.
