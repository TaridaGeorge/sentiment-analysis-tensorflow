When I first moved to Phoenix I unknowingly wandered into this place.

I love a good bargain, who doesn't, but this place gives new meaning to the term "Dumpster Diver" or perhaps it's where the term originated.  I felt dirty just being in this place. 

If you've ever seen the cartoon of Tom and Jerry when Tom is fishing and reels in a dirty old rotten boot............................Same concept applies to this store.

I wouldn't recommend it.
