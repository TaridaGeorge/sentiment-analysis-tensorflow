This place wasn't even busy and as two girls simply trying to get over a long night of drinking by finishing our Starbucks before switching over to vodka; this place was a terrible idea! We were approached by a below par (in reference to her looks & customer service skills) waitress, told we could not sit at a table that accommodated more than 2, we had to move AND we couldn't drink our Starbucks in the bar! Most ridiculous things I have ever heard. Little does she know we are in the industry from both San Diego & Las Vegas; there will be a lot less good tippers there NOW assuming that waitress ever even got tipped.
