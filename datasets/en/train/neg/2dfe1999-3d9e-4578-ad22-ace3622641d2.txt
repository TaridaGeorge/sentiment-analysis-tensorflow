Like their competitor Sprinkles, Tammie Coe is just way to sweet for me. Their frosting is heavier and their is just something in their cupcakes that makes me wonder what is that? As much as my coworkers enjoy both Tammie Coe and Sprinkles, I pass everytime someone brings them in as I am just not a fan. For those that enjoy them, by all means I am not mad at ya. Just don't understand what all the fuss is about.
