This car wash is terrible, we paid for the works, they did not wipe the interior down. They left dirty spots all over the car the windows were not wiped down inside. To top it all off they never told us our car was done and left it sitting in the sun, it was like an oven when we got in. On the whole a really lousy job. Left no tip and would certainly not recommend.
