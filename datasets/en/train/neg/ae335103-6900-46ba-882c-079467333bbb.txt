Do not go here unless you like to listen to a sales pitch and have the guy not listen to you when you tell him what you want.  I pulled up on a Saturday morning and there weren't many cars there. The one car that was in line pulled back out and left as did I after the guy wouldn't take no to his offers.  I went to Danny's and used my coupon.  No sales job, just got the car washed
