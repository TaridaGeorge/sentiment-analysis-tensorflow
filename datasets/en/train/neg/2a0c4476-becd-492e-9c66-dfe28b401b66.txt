Let's start with the fact that we didn't get noticed for 15 minutes by any wait staff.  Then once we were noticed by a waiter (not ours) our waiter got in an argument over the fact that it was "her" table.  We didn't get the salad until we asked for it. (it came right away) then our entre was delivered to the table before we were finished with the salad.
At this point the food would have had to been fantastic, and it was edible at best.  Let's just say my mom's meatloaf would put there's to shame.....
