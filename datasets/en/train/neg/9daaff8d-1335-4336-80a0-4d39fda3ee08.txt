GCU somehow obtained our home phone number after my wife signed up with some online job recruiter.  Once they got our phone number the calls from GCU started flooding in.  These scumbags actually REFUSE to remove you from their telemarketing lists.  By that I don't just mean that they continue to call but they actually had the nerve to admit they won't remove me.

If this company acts like this to a complete stranger that has never done (and will never do)  any business with them imagine how they'd be willing to treat you if you're a student at this place?
