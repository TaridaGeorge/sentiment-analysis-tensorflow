went for a manicure as a walk-in. no one was in the place except the employees. kinda strange. did not like the atmosphere thought it was cheap and tacky. 
nails were cut uneven, cut my cuticles really bad, nail polish all over my fingers and she smudged three nails. worst manicure and nail salon i have been to in a long time! will Never go back and will never recommend to people! 
prefers cash instead of credit, who carries cash now of days??? its ridiculously expensive for the whack job that was done on my hands.... 
word of advice stay away and go elsewhere!!
