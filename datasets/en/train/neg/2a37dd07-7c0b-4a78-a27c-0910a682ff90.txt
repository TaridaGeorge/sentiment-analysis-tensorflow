This is by far the worst Walgreens Pharmacy in Arizona,  these people are mad at the world.  I thought I did something wrong, smelled because I stepped in something...hell I must have commited a crime of some kind.  Then others told me they were treated terrible at this same location and they could not determine why.These folks are just down right nasty to you just because you walked up to their danged counter with a prescription.  I now go to Central and Osborn for all of my scripts.
