I can't give this place 0 stars?  Too bad.

We've been here a couple times and have liked the food however my most recent trip led me to 5 days (and counting) of the worst bacterial gastroenteritis, two trips to urgent care and countless hours of misery.  Will be making a complaint to Environmental Health.

For you health - do not go.

And the service sucks.
