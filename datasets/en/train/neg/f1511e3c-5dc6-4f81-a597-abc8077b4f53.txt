Don't go here.

I also subscribe to Open Table.  This place has been advertising 1,000 point dinners for the weekends that are not available.  Geisha a Go Go does not take weekend reservations, so the advertisement of a 1,000 point dinner is fraud by enticement. They offer a service or reward that is never available.


Give it a skip, go to Hiro or Kampai.
