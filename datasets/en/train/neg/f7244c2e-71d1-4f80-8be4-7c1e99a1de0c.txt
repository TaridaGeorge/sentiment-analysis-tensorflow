Every time i go to this establishment I feel a mild neglect like a stray unwanted dog that roams on your front lawn. There is only one server that is actually attentive but everyone else is never around. The building is nice and new and thats about the best thing I have to say about it. The Swizzle Inn across the street has been there sense jesus walked the earth and its old and looks creepy but it blows Zipps out of the water.There is a few bars on that corner and they are all better. If I could I would give it no stars. If you work in the food and beverage industry customer service is key to success. The food can be crap and over priced but if they take care of you alls well. Stay away from this joint unless you like being ignored.
