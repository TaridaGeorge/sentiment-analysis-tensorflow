their vietnamese pho sucks.aint nowhere near the real thing.the meat put in the combination pho are rubbery and look disgusting.tastes bad too so i had to keep myself from not throwing up. they only take CASH.no credit cards.no debit cards.just COLD CASH.a real bummer!
one of my companions was a filipino and the chef said there wasnt anymore left of any filipino food.he left sulking and stark raving disappointed! no REST ROOMS would you believe! the over-all lay-out of the place is an Interior decorator's nightmare. even the name JUICE HOUSE simply aint right.doesnt make any dang sense. a total LET-DOWN! If you wanna waste money  and feel like you are in a hole in the wall back-eatery of somewhere 4th world,  then check this place out. i gave their boba 2 stars out of 5.....as i feel generous today.................
