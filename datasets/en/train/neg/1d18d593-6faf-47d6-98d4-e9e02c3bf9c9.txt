Avoid this place unless u like "hairy" over priced burgers. After waiting for around 40 mins, we finally got our burgers. My GF found a pube like thick hair attached to the side of her $18 burger. We pretty much got grossed out and had to leave. I only had taken a single bit out of mine but still had to pay almost $20 before it was all said and done... I recommend five guys burgers instead..
