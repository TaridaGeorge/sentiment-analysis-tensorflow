I would give Riga Tony's zero stars but I can't. Their rigatoni was the worst dish of Italian food I've ever tasted in my life. My wife ordered the lasagna and she said she would prefer a stoufer's frozen lasagna to what she was served. 

I have no idea how anyone could enjoy the food here. Dine here at your own risk.
