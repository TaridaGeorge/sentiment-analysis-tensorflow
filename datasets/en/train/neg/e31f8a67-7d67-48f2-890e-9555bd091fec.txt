Visited today right @ noon.  this is a start up company, they did not have any prices on the wall and the sign on the windows are crooked.  We went in to see and try the gelato. no one was behind the counter and no one ever came out, we called out, whistled and everything then we left after a while since no one knew what customers were all about.  they should have a bell ring or something when the door opens. as addition to detail is not part of this company.  also could not find a list of ingredients anywhere and according to Arizona law all food businesses must post a list of ingredients for everything they sell
