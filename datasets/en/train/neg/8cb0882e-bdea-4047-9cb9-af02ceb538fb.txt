Why did I go here again when I've had bad luck in the past?  Went about 2 years ago, food was just OK, service sucked.  2 years later, exact same....

Visited for lunch on a week-day.  Place was very empty.  Service was very slow.  Took an hour for lunch between seating and leaving.  Food was just OK, drinks were empty and the waitress just didn't really seem to care (and she was only handling 2 tables).  $16 for a sandwich and ice tea.
