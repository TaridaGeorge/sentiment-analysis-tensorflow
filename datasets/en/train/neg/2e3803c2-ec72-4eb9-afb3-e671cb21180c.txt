The Vig sucks!!! The manager at this establishment, Pam, kicked me out because her bad excuse for a waitress, Kate Lynch, was so inappropriate as to tell my friends mean things about me. This was not only inappropriate but unneccessary. She did NOT need to tell my friends anything!  For me to get kicked out as a result of this is absurd!  I would urge everyone to not go to the Vig! It is a BIG mistake to ever go to the Vig, the more people I deter from going there the better! Maybe it's time to break out the markers, make signs and pickett the place so that everyone knows just how unfair it was to kick out a customer because their waitress felt like getting even.
