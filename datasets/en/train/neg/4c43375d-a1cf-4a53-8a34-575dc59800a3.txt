I went to get rabies shots for both of my chihuahuas.  One is a little chunky and the other is really skinny.  They weighed them and said they were each three pounds heavier than usual. The vet told me my skinny dog was over weight! I told them that their scale was off but they said it wasn't.  I went to Pets Mart later that night and weighed both of my dogs.  And I was right, their scales are off.  I even brought a 10 lb weight to make sure Pets Mart's scale was right.  So my entire annual visit was based around wrong information.  And I feel they talked to you like you were an idiot.  They also overcharge for teeth cleaning.  I would NOT recommend this vet.
