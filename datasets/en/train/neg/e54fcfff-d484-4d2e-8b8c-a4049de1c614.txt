So it's New Years Day. I got up at 7 am and drove 40 miles so we could have breakfast at Chompies in Tempe then catch a 10:45 showing of "The Hobbit" at Arizona Mills Imax. We got our tickets, bought a drink, found a seat watched the same coming attractions we had seen last week in Harkins Casa Grande. When it came time for the Movie to start they tuned on the lights and said "the projector is broken this showing is cancelled" . They gave us 4 return passes but so what. We have lived in this area for 10 years and this is the second time we have been there. Driving 80 miles to see a movie takes the fun out of it. Screw You Harkins
