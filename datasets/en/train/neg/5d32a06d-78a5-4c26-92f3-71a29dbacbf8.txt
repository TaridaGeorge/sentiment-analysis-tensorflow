Beware when you visit any Claim Jumper - the drinks are an absolute rip-off!! I ordered a drink & not only was the glass small, but it was only half-full! And for $9.00 a pop - not worth it. We brought it to the bartender's attention (a young guy, didn't get his name) & he got all defensive & said "I measured it like I'm supposed to". We then spoke to the mgr. Sara, who was very condescending & absolutely no help at all.  Yes, their portions are large, but full of fat, calories, sugar, etc.! All of the employees have an attitude, even after we've gone there several times - we are not treated like "regulars". Poor management - terrible experience - last time.......
