If you email the Paper Studio, don't expect a reply.

A few unanswered email inquiries about their Online products will go unanswered. How's that for service?

A few years back, I remember shopping at their booth when they were a vendor at a local Mixed Media Art Show with a great selection of unique papers and products....a bit stand-offish too & not very friendly either. Real nice impression.

Why bother with friendly service if you are a merchant selling things? Customers will be happier spending their hard-earned bucks someplace else...very disappointing.
