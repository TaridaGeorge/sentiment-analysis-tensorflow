I agree with the other reviewers. I came in for a mole check and they ended up removing 3 moles  They didn't inform me how much it would be to remove them. I told her my insurance isn't great and I was worried about the cost. I ended up paying almost $1,000 for everything which is ridiculous and now have three ugly scars. I've been going to  dermatologists for years and this is the first dr who removed this many moles. It's definitely about getting your $ at this place.
