My husband that wears hearing aids went to surprise me & bring home breakfast. He got out of the car & went to the patio.  He push button & tried to order but could not hear the lady. He asked if the lady could come outside. Since he was on the patio close to the door he did not think it would be any trouble. The lady said "come back with someone that can hear". I am so angry. I will never go to Sonic again.
