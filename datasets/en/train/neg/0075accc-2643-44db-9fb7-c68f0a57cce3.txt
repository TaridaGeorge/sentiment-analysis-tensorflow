Yes the owner is really nice and they do have a really old grocery store (which means most of the ethnic stuff they are selling are old)

But commenting on the food, I had the baba ganoush and the Kefta kebab. The ganoush was bitter (methinks came out of can with citric acid and other preservatives imparting the bitter taste)
The Kefta wasn't that bad (but I have had better) however the: tzatziki enveloping the kefta was bitter. I have found the same phenomenon in Spices on the other side of 101. 

Either that is how it is made or else they both are using canned stuff to feed to us.
