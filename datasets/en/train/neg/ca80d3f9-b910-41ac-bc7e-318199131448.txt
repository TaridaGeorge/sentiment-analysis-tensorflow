Wow, I had eaten here before and it was good. But today was another story. Ordered the Pork BBQ sandwich and beans. Waiting for my food, I noticed there were multiple flies in the restaraunt which is not a good sign... Then I got my food. Now, I like a good BBQ sandwich and was looking forward to this!  BUT, the bun was wet on the bottom, and when I picked it up, the meat fell through. It was not wet with bbq sauce either. It was more like water, which was slightly disgusting. I tried to eat the meat with a fork- there was almost no BBQ sauce and NO flavor.   I threw it in the trash and left. I was very dissatisfied.
