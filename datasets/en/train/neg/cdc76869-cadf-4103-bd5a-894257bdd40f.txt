This dog park gets one star.Why?Because the last time I went,some piece of shit broke into just about every car in the parking lot to steal whatever they could.So much broken glass from side windows everywhere.
It used to be okay before this incident,but a busy parking lot in borad daylight and some vulture lies in wait?
Yeah,I'm done here.
