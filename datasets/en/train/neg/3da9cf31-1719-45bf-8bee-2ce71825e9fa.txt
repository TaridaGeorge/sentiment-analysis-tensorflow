Avoid on weekdays if you want Dim Sum!

The last two times I went there I left after sitting at a table for 20 minutes with no food. Sometimes a cart would go by - a different table.  

No amount of hand waving or imploring looks would do any good.

You couldn't drag me in there kicking and screaming on a weekday again.
