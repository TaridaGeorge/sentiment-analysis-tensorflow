This place is Disgusting!!! Rice is Overcooked, tasted like a baby food 
My California Rolls did not even looked like ones. Lunch menu was way too small for the price. 
All-You-Can eat was a disaster. It took them 45 min to bring second order of rolls which we could not even eat, because they had NO Taste !!! Service is way too slow as well their chefs which I think would make a much better job cooking Salsa. 
Save your time and money and try to stay away from that Sushi JOKE Place!!!
