This place is truly horrible. The prices only add salt to your wound. 

There are a lot of great Mexican restaurants in AZ and they are not hard to find. You do not need to pay extra to go to this place. I saw a review in Phoenix magazine and decided to check this place out. The only explanation I can possibly think of is that the  reporter got lazy and decided to skip on the meal and browse the website instead. Literally everything we got from our chips and salsa to our main entrees (recommended by the waiter) was bland. 

The patio is cute although we had to sit by some tanks of gasoline which wasn't really a good vibe. While I'm sure this place is healthier than some of the other mexican restaurants it's not worth it.
