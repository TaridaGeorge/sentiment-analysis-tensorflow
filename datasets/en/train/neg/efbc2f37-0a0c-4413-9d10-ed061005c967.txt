I'd give it zero stars if I could and based solely on their pushy car wash guys speaking to you in a condescending tone  .. "you ever try a wax bar?" "I can get you a good deal on detailing my man!" "I don't think those water spots are coming out unless we do a detailing!" Ummm...your next career stop is selling gym memberships and then used cars. Now, I've gone from once a week car wash at Danny's to somewhere else where I just get a car wash and not a sales pitch. Stop talking to your customers like they are idiots.
