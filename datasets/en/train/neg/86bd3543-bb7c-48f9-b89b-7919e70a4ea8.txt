This place is ridiculous!!!

Service is extremely slow and unprofessional. I was with 2 friends, when their food came out (already very late), the waitress looked at me and realized that my food wasn't even prepared yet... 20 minutes later i get most of my meal, but the eggs were so undercooked i couldn't eat them... I also never got my toast... we ordered chocolate milk, but instead we received milk with a few drops of Hershey syrup, it was not good... I will NEVER go back here again... EVER!!!!

Avoid this place by all means!!!!!
