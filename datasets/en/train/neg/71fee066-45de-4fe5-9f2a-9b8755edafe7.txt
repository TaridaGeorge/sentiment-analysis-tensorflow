I wanted to give this McDonalds NO STARS, but I didn't know if I could.  Anyway, if you want your order WRONG, this is the place to be!! I have gone here on many occasions and out of 10 orders, 8 have been wrong. Be careful when Ordering a Sausage McMuffin, you will GET EGG PUT ON IT THERE.  I even took my order back and they gave me the same thing again WITH EGG, when I specifically said SAUSAGE MCMUFFIN!!!  I love all people and I am not racist but, if you gonna work in AMERICA you gotta not only SPEAK English, but UNDERSTAND it too!!!
