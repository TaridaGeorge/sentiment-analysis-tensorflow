Called requesting a packet of information in order to hire one their models for regular fashion shoots. They never sent it. The impression I was given is that I am a waste of time because I do not have billions of dollars.  Guess what?  My money spends just the same as any wealthy client you have.

Way to screw the start-up.  Great job, guys.
