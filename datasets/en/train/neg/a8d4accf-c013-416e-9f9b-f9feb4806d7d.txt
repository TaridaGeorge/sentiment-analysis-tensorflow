-10 stars for them I live right around the corner from here and I refuse to shop there! When I do stop in to shop it drives me nut really I just want to scream at everyone working they are so rude and move everything around the lines are OMG the worst .. I drive all the way to the one on Arizona ave cuz it's sooo worth it. They now what customer service is and show it!!!
