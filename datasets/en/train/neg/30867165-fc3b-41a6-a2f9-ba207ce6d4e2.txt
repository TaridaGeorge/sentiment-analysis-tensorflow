The food here sucks! Taste like frozen crap right out of the bag.
I had the calamari and it was rubbery and undercooked. The breading fell off the calamari. My friend had the burger and said it was dry like a hockey puck. This is your standard BAD BAR FOOD! The place is huge and not really a restaurant but more of a night club. I would NEVER ever consider this place for dinner. The beer selection was good and the service was okay. Given the level of competition at the Scottsdale Quarter you would think they would have better quality products. I won't be back.
