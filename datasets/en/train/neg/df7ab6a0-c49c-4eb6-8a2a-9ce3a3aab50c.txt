Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb...dumb, dumb, dumb, dum, dummmmmmmbbbbb. Waited in line for-ev-er cuz the sensor didn't pick up our truck. So, we proceeded to the window to place our order & had to tell the girl 3 times that we wanted a Mc-gridd-le, real slow like so they'd understand English, or so we hoped. But alas, it shan't be. They even had it correct on the receipt, but nay, I tell you, nay. The screwed it up afterall.
