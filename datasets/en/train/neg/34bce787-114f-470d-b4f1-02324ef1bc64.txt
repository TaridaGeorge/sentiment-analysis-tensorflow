I have been to San Tan Eyecare 3X and every time it's a debacle with the front desk staff. The doctors are great but it's starting to not be worth going to. I was forgot about in the waiting room for an hour. They got my order wrong and over charged me $200 and was rude on top of that. The only thing consistent about this place is the incompetence of the front desk staff.
