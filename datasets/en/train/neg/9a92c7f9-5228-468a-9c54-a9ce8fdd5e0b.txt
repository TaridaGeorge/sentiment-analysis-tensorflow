Horrible experience. Very dirty and the staff was obviously sick. The man doing my nails kept getting up to blow his nose returning without washing his hands. He then wiped his nose on his sleeve, That's when I had enough! 
The smell in the salon was horrible. I understand people get sick, but call in sick please!
