Oh how far the mighty fall.

While the hip factor on this place has gone up and down over the years, at least they had semi-decent coffee. I went there today, and now even that's dead. It tasted like pencil shavings. And not those yummy, creamy pencil shavings either. They were the kinds you get from a pencil. Steeped in boiling water.

It's no wonder the place is usually abandoned. Well, that and all of the Starbuck's in every corner of the Earth...
