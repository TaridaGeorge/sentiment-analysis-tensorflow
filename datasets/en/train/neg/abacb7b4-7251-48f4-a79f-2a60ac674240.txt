I give this place NO stars. They have karaoke which would be good except for the co-host is NASTY! The rest of the bar is typical with darts, pool and poker. The food SUCKS! don't bother to go here unless you like being whined at by a wussy faggot at night long. I know that is harsh but the co-host really is nasty.
