I use to like Barrows but this location has TERRIBLE service. I have been there twice, both times received unfriendly service. Second visit received the wrong order (twice) and was actually asked, 'Well do you want it?'. Was also charged the wrong amount. No concern or correction from staff of their careless mistakes. Pizza was as greasy as possible with no flavor. Will not be returning.
