Went back today as I feel every place deserves a second chance. I was again irritated that the smallest sub I could order was an 8".  Also I verified on the VITO there is no mention of mayo on the menu,   it states it is served with Italian vinaigrette. I made sure to mention it to the girl behind the counter and she told me they put mayo on all their subs. I will not be back.
