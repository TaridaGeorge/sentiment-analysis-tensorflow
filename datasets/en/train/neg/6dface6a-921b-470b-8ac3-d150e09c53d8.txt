What an odd and disappointing experience!

I simply asked the cashier to confirm the contents of the Monterey Ranch Crispy Chicken Sandwich (I wanted to make sure that it didn't have any bacon) and I got a snippy, sarcastic, and just plain rude tone from the cashier.

The food came out within a couple minutes, which probably accounts for the french fries being cold and stiff and the sandwiches having unmelted cheese.

I can't remember when I've ever had such a bad experience at a Wendy's, but by the look of some other reviews as well, it looks like it's best to treat this branch as a poor exception to the norm.
