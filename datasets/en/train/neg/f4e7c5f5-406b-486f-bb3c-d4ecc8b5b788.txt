Positive: Nice trendying atmosphere, happy hour specials but not all that great.  Sauces good.
Negative: Sushi was low grade, seared Ahi-Tuna was really fish tasting.  

Overall - great for drinks but if your looking for quality sushi I do not recommend; save time and money and go to RA or Geisha a GoGo.
