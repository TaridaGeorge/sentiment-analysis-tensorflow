The wife and I went last night to this restaurant and to our amazement were seated immediately (never a good sign.) We immediately noticed how HOT the place was and we asked the waitress about it. She told us and I quote: "We can't lower the A/C to anything below 79 or it freezes up." Well let me tell you it was every bit of at least 95 degrees in there. After a few tentative looks from the wife we decided to get up and go to the OTHER Joe's on Baseline. It was much much cooler there and we had a great time. We love the crab pots and the salmon sunrise. We hate the heat and won't be coming back to the location on Southern unless they fix the A/C.
