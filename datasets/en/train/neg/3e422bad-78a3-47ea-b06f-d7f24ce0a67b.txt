Was excited to check out menu and get an appetizer to go. Decided to sit at bar to have drink while waiting. Male bartender gave me the stink eye... Male bartender waited on every guy there first then looked at me barely and goes do you need something? I didnt want to detract from his attention to all the dudes there...so I left and decided to come back some other time and maybe just order from the hostess. I went across the way to Tutto Cucina and they were so much more gracious and had good wine too. Ill prob go back to try it but not for a really long time...there's just too many other great places in Old Town.
