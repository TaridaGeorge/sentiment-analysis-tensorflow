ROARING FORK HAPPY HOUR. Go there and try their big ass burger (that's literally what it's called). They have a happy hour all night. Very nice atmosphere. Once you've tried their burger, Fudruckers just won't cut it. I paid less to eat a gourmet hamburger at a table cloth restraurant than at Fudruckers. For me, it's not about how many toppings or condiments you can put on a hamburger, it's the quality of the meat, bread buns, etc. ROARING FORK...way better than Fudruckers.
