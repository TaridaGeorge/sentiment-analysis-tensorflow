Let me start with saying that the service was great (3pm on saturday, pretty empty), we were seated immediately and drinks were constantly refilled promptly. Unfortunately the rolls (Philadelphia, spicy tuna) and the salmon nigiri were horribly sub par. The salmon nigiri was a light pink color (it wasn't yellowfin) with almost no marbling and it was rather small for two pieces for 5 dollars. The rolls on the other hand were absolutely tiny! The amount of cream cheese in the phili roll was about twice the size of the salmon. The spicy tuna was tiny as well, both being poorly rolled as well with a ton of overlapping of the rice. All in all, bland and definitely overpriced. Also, for a heavy Asian ambiance, I did not like loud rock music.
