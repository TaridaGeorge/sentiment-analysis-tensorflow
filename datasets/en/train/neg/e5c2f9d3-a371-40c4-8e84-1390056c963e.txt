Its amazing how Bell Lexus  "certified " technicians can't find nothing wrong with the car while under warranty.As soon as my warranty ran out basic and powertrain,they "recommeded" me shocks,radiator, and a bunch of other stuff.The shock and radiator where leaking but nobody told me that ,only after the warranty expired.Also the prices are ridiculous. I know a things or two about cars,i used to work in automotive/parts related business.I'll bet Bell Lexus  doesn't want to "up-sale warranty work" because they make less money on warranty jobs.Be aware when doing business at Bel Lexus,i would not recommend any of their services.
