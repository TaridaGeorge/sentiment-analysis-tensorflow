Great location, excellent selection, and a layout that appeals. It's got a very cozy, homey feeling that would be comfortable to gather and have a small chat.

Unfortunately, the owners or the managers seem to be so in love with their sound system that, whenever they have a musical guest, they ruin the "home" feeling of the establishment, a comfortable hang-out, and turn it into an unsustainable flood of conversation-killing, over-amplified noise.

My disdain of the sound system has turned me off of the Lost Leaf for so long that, whenever it's agreed that "everyone" is going there, I'm not a part of "everyone" and I choose to go home instead.
