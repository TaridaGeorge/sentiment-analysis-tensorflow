The Casino is a trap on so many levels. First off the Buffet is so not worth it, why pay 10 dollars for salad and hot dogs? Second the staff at the Casino are all a bunch of little Mamone Cocksuckers that are afraid to let you sit 5 minutes in the parking lot before they call the Salt River Police.  If you feel like seeing the back of a Police car and getting physically and verbally abused by several sets of fake ass cops then Casino Arizona is the place for you. NOT WORTH IT!
Just go to Hometown Buffet and save yourself lots of time and trouble.
