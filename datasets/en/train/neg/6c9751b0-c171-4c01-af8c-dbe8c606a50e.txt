I guess I should have asked for Rose.  I tried this salon because my hairdresser moved and groupon had it on their website.  Worst haircut of my life, I asked for two things...make sure I can still pull it back in a pony and make it all one length...didn't get either one right, one side is about a half inch shorter and won't stay back and she beveled the back instead of texturizing...
