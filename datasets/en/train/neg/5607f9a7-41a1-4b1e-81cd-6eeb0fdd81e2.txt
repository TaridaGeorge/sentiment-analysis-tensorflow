lmfao.  So we are walking through BB the other day, because it is an anchor store at our mall.  I see the cop car outside in the parking lot and as we are entering the first doors I say "haha they called the cops on a pissed off customer" to my husband.  We walk through the second doors, and off to the right at CS, there is a pissed off man, the police, and the BB manager.  Since I have not shopped there due to the previous incident, I have not been back.  I see they still operate in the same way.
