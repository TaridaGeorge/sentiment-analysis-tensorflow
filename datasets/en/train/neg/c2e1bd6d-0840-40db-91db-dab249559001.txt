I have been using this location for a few years now, and gradually the customer service has been getting worse and worse. I have finally reached my breaking point in the past few months. From the excessive wait times both inside and in the drive through (sometimes when there are no other customers waiting), to the staff's utter indifference toward customer satisfaction (I have too many examples to list here), to the mix ups and misinformation that has resulted in me having to make way too many extra trips, I would say move on and find another pharmacy. Unfortunately, I HAVE to use Walgreens as per my health insurance, but I have found a new location 2 miles from this one that is 24 hours with a drive through, and I have to say so far that the difference is remarkable.
