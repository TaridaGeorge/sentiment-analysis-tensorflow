I had a septoplasty with Dr.Bailey a couple of months ago. First meeting with him went well I thought that maybe I found a good doctor. Unfortunately that wasn't the case. He is everything but a good doctor. He is rude and definitely not professional. The surgery didn't help me at all it was totally worthless. Since he took out the splints from my nose they have never tried to contact me for a follow up. Don't waste your time and money on this doctor try to find someone who really cares about his patients because that is NOT Dr. Bailey!!!
