Ok...we are new to the area and are still trying to find our favorite restaurants.  We thought we would try this place based on other Yelp reviews.  The restaurant itself is ok, just as you would expect for a Chinese "strip mall" restaurant.  The food was comparable to getting Safeway Chinese food (so I thought...).  My husband and I were unable to finish our meals (large portions).  When we went to eat the leftovers the next night...my husband yells from the kitchen "is it gross that I just found a rubber band in my left overs?"  OMG!  Yes that is gross!  Are you kidding me??  How the heck did a rubber band get in our food?  And if there is a rubber band in there....I don't even want to know what else is in there.  SICK!  I would never eat here again.
