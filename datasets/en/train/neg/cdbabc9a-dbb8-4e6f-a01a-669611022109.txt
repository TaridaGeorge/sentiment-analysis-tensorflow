To eat a ChicagoDog outside of Chicago city limits or not to eat a ChicagoDog in AZ....uuuuhhmmmmm, definitely the latter! 

Not a fan of the hot dog, nor their "rosemary" fries. The food was SOOO BLAND. I ordered mine to-go, and there was maybe a a handful of fries in the little box and a cold dog. booo!

I took it home and doctored it with celery salt and mustard... and washed it down as fast as I could with a tasty brew... all that for the absurd price of $7.00! 

I might be tempted to go back and try a burger..but probably not....

negatory.
