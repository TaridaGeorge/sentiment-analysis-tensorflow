I went off the grid and ordered something they are possibly not known for, the chicken ceasar wrap.  I was insulted by what I got for paying I believe 6 dollars for.  When I looked inside of it, their may have been the collection of a small chicken leg as far as the portion of meat, it did not exist.  The entire thing was stuffed with iced berg lettuce.  The cost of this piece of crap may have been a dollar, a mark up up 5 dollars thanks.  I left hungry and unsatisfied, never again.  QT and grocery stores have better wraps then this place and far less cheaper.
