The staff was friendly. That's about the only thing that was good about this place.

The frozen yogurt was not good. The people working there also didn't know what active cultures were. There was also hardly any seating inside the place.

We will not be returning, especially since there are so many other great frozen yogurt places in Scottsdale.
