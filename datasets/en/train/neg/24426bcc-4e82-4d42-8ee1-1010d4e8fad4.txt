I don't know why I continue to go here and expect things to change. I've had the pizza here once and it was great. Breakfast however is entirely different.  They can't cook eggs !!!  Always runny and under cooked. The place is usually freezing cold and I think the music is played so loudly that it will take your mind off your cold food. Really disappointed as I live only a block away.  They might want to send some of there cooks to the Breakfast Club for a refresher course.
