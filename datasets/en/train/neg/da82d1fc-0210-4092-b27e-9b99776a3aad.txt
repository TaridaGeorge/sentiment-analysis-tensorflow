After contacting Bally's corporate about the hideous condition of this club in April I get a call a couple nights ago from the regional V.P. She asks me if I've seen any improvement in the club since filing my "complaint" 

The answer was a resounding NO! I had been in the club the previous two days, both times first thing in the morning. Both days the trash containers were overflowing, the front door was covered in fingerrpints as were the mirrors. It's not like they cleaned it either day. GROSS. In addition the equipment is and always has been FILTHY. 

My best recommendation is to stay as far away from this place as possible! They need to gut the place and start over again. It's disgusting!
