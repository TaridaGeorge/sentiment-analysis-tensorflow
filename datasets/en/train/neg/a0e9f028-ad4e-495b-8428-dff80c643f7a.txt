This MIchael's sucks!  We were there Friday night to get a few craft items for the baby's room.  I also needed some items to make my baby shower favors with.  

It was pretty busy when we got there.  BUT was there a team member around to answer questions?  NOPE!  2 workers were in the store...TOTAL....from what we saw.  

After trying to figure and locate eveything on our own...with no luck.  J and I dropped all the items we had and left.  

We should have just made the drive to JoAnn's in scottsdale.
