US Airways track record with me is 50%.  Flew 4 flights in the last week. The first plane, we were brought back to the gate since there was an issue with their autopilot. Then the new plane they gave us sounded like it was going to fall apart.  I overheard the flight attendant say they're about to put that plane into retirement.

Now ready to go home and flying back. The same thing happens, but now there is something wrong with the a/c. Didn't get in until 2 hours later..Get your act together peeps.  

Plus the $25  bag check in fee blows...
