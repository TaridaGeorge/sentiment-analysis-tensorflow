Guys, what happened?!?  I ordered a burger and fries for lunch yesterday and the burger wasn't just bad... it was disgusting.  The meat tasted off; I was kind of afraid that it was spoiled. Then it was raw inside. And the bun had a rancid grease smell to it. I'm not sure if it was the oil that was brushed on the bun to grill it, or if the grill was so dirty that the rancid smell transferred from grill to bun. But either way, it was just nasty. I could only get through a couple bites of the burger before I tossed the enitre thing. $10 for lunch totally down the drain. I was so disappointed. The Italian Beef I had last time was just ok, and after this burger experience I will most likely not be back.
