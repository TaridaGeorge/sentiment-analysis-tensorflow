Absolutely terrible. I am fond of wood burned pizza, don't get me wrong. But the wait was atrocious--2 hours just to get a table. Then we were rushed in and out and told to scoot our chairs in--The place is way too small! There are so many better places to go that need the money--I dislike trendy places that are too crowded were they treat you like an average widget to milk money from.
