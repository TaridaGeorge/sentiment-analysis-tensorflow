The lamb kabobs were off and the restaurant smelled like the restrooms.  The rice ran out and we had to change our order to half salad half rice.  The grilled tomato was not grilled, the pita was cold and worst of all, the rice was not completely cooked and I almost chipped my tooth on hard rice.  Probably one of the worst experiences I have had in the recent years.  The staff was friendly.  I would not recommend this restaurant.
