very disorganized, went in for my 28 week ultra sound which I was very excited about, I went in and was seen by  differant midwife, she thought I was being seen for a follow up, advised I was there for my ultra sound she apologized and said that they had me down for a follow up, they had to reschedule my appointment since the ultra sound tech didnt have any availability to see me that morning. ONLY reason I go to this office is because they are open on saturdays other than that, I wouldnt reccomend anyone going here for care.
