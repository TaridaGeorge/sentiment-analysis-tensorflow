I asked the waiter what was gluten free on the menu and he didn't know. He asked the manager and still came back with a weird understanding of what I could order. It's strange that a huge chain like this would not have a gluten free menu or know what on their menu was ok to eat. It's the only restaurant that hasn't been accommodating to my gf lifestyle.
