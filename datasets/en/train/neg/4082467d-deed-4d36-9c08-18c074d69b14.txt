Mediocre food.  Mediocre service. Sometimes you can, indeed, judge a book by its cover, and this place proves it.  I was going to write a long, detailed discussion of everything that sucked about my lunch there today, but I'll let the fact that this is my first one-star review (and I've reviewed some real dives) speak for itself.
