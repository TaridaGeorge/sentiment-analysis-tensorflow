One star for the decor.  That's it.

The food was terrible!!  Everything from the sashimi, to the nigiri, the maki rolls, the udon, and the bento boxes were boring.  I come from the San Francisco bay area where we have some serious foodies and expect mouth-watering, mind-blowing sushi.  This place is MISERABLE!

Only TWO sushi chefs during lunch hour???  What is management thinking??  By the time all our food was served, we sat there for 2 1/2 hours.  Are you kidding me?  That's just ridiculous!

Go somewhere else, any where - just don't go to Stingray for good sushi.
