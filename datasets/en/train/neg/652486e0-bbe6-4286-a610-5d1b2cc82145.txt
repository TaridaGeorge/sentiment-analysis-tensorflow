Thought this would give us the deli fix we needed since no more Miracle Mile at Arrowhead Mall.  Didn't even come close.  The pastrami was stringy, tough and all fat; their cole slaw is really carrot slaw, and they call French dressing "Thousand Island Dressing."   And thoroughly disappointed to get Ruffles potatoes chips instead of those great Miracle Mile fries.  Won't be going back to this place.
