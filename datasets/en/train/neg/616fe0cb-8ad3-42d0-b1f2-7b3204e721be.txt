I wish I could now give this place 0 stars. After my initial review of Babbo Italian Eatery I was told to contact them through an email address that they provided. I did and received no response. I then tried to contact them through a Yelp message directly, and still no response. I am now completely and utterly disgusted with Babbo for the severe lack of customer service and neglect of their customers. It was one thing to have a negative experience and state that I (may) never go back, and be contacted by someone from their establishment who "claims" to want to rectify the problem, only to be ignored. So for anyone who loves Italian food and wants good, quality service with delicious food at a great price, try Red Devil. Here's there website: http://www.reddevilrestaurant.com/
