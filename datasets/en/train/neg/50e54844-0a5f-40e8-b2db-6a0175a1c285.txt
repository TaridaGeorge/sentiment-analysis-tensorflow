I think Calamari F. pretty much summed it up. OSF serves absolutely inedible "Italian" food that is far worse than the usual Americanized Italian fare you get at chain Italian restaurants like Olive Garden. I would have rather had seafood alfredo from Red Lobster. The prices were also very high. The only good thing about our experience was the "free" spumoni ice cream that comes with every entree purchase. Avoid at all costs.
