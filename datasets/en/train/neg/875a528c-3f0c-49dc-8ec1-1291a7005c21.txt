Barcelona has the worst way of letting people know that they're closed until mid-September!

Everything was still up like they are still open, website, myspace, all with no indication of their closing. So yea, if you really want to piss me off that's the way to do it, be misleading and secretive about your business temporary closing. 

Supposedly, we were referred to PCL and someplace else, and were told to tell them that Barcelona sent us and they'd "take care" of us. Unless I'm getting free bottle service to make up for this blunder, I'm not interested!
