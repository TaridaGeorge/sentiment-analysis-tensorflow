If you want disgusting food, it can be had much more cheaply. Or for free, out of a trash bin. I suppose if you're only eating once in a while and need to stuff yourself when you do then this place is passable. Personally, I'd rather skip a meal than go here. And yes, American buffets are infamously bad, but even so this place is terrible, and rather dirty. You're better off going into [whatever supermarket is in that plaza now] and buying some food there.
