This review is based on their mini-golf and that alone. Everything else looked pretty useless as well but the mini-golf was an absolute joke. They had 3 courses to choose from and all three were very poorly designed and run down like the place has been around for 20+ years. If you want a real mini-golf experience I suggest going to Castles and Coasters.
