I was very unimpressed with my visit. I had been to a different location in the past and it worked out in a jam. I waited for over 30 mins. I went in running a fever with a very sore throat and I was hoping to get a jump on being sick. After paying $90 I was told "Just go home and sit on your porch and relax... you'll get better, if not then come back and see me if your not better in 5 days." I had to return to work was sick past the 5 days. I did not care to go back and pay another $90 for "advice".  No Thanks!
