My buddy and I needed a place to crash out for the night and found this place.  The room was your standard Motel 6 place with the 2 full beds and small old tv in the room.  The TV had your standard channels but it difficult to watch because of all the static/ snow on the picture.  The bathroom really was nothing to brag about,  the linoleum was coming off the floor, and the shower was normal, worked fine.  Odd thing was that I killed a cockroach that was moving around in the bathroom as I was taking a dump.  Luckily I was wearing socks!  Our original plan was to stay there possibly two nights, but after everything, Methinks not!
