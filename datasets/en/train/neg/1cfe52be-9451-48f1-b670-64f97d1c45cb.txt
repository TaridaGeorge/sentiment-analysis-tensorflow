This restaurant is extremely dirty.. I find it especially concerning when the general manager is helping to run food and does not care how dirty everything looks. The floor was shameful and tables everywhere had not been cleared from past eaters.. I don't know about you, but I love looking at half eaten food right before I order! In fact, we couldn't sit at a booth because they were "working on cleaning them". Very odd... the first thing I saw was a old chicken wing on the ground, which the host walked right passed... if the outside of the restaurant looks like that, its hard to imagine what the kitchen looks like (what we don't see?. Never going back! This general manager should be fired, so the business can actually thrive like their other locations.... final word: disturbing.
