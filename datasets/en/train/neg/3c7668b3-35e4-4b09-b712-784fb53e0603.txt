On first appearance this hotel is your typical franchise hotel inside and out. From the gold rating you would assume that the customer service would be outstanding and it is. Ive stayed one night and really enjoyed the clean room and free (continental buffet) breakfast.  So why am I giving them such a low rating? Management is less to be desired. The GM is the week link and the results will be the loss of their gold status. Too bad too because the rest of the staff Rocks!
