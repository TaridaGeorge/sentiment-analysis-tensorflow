I come to this pharmacy often, not by choice. The prescription for my son can only be filled here if I want my insurance to pay for it. So every other week I'm forced to reserve time I don't really have available to go stand in a long line to deal with stupid employees that can never seem to get anything right and to top it off they all have attitudes.
