This place had a few awards/articles about how they were the best Mexican food around.  All of them were from 2006-2007.  I think they may be when the meat was from as well.  I ordered a the tacos and the first few bites were pretty good.  Then I got a bite of grizzle.  I spit it out (it's impossible to eat unless you are a dog maybe) and decided it was a fluke and kept eating.  After about the 4th bite of grizzle, I decided this place sucked and I would never eat here again.  Too bad, I think they have a good cook, but need to use higher quality meats.  Also wouldn't hurt to move into a nicer facility if you're going to continue with the upgrades.  Although I really wouldnt' have cared about the decor if the food was edible.
