Monday morning, 9am: I came to recycle a toner cartridge and buy a custom rubber stamp. The sales associate in printing standard reply was "I don't know" to virtually all of my questions. No help at all - I gave up. I had to use the men's room and it had a filthy toilet, urinal that was near overflowed, broken faucet handle, paper towel and toilet paper rolls sitting on top of things instead of in the dispensers and a dead cockroach to top it off. I don't need to come back to this store. The manager needs to take a little pride!
