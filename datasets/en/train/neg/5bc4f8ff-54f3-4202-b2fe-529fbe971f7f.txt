It is time for an expedition to Tempe Marketplace. What will I need?

1.) Earplugs to block out the abysmal 1990s music incessantly blaring from its speakers.

2.) A bottle of chilled water to drink while traversing its endless parking lagoon between "District" and "Grande Boxes."

3.) An empty wallet so I don't buy all the mass-produced cr#p for sale.

4.) A full stomach so I am not tempted by chain restaurants with mediocre food, but amazing "flare."

Last, but not least....

5.) Airplane tickets to a real "marketplace" in Europe or Latin America for all the consumer drones wandering around this depressing place.

Tempe Marketplace, you are a "FAIL."
