The only thing going for it was that it was wide open, they put us in the corner of the courtyard and it was good for the children to run around. 

The food was terrible. Even the salsa was not good. The chips were decent, thin and crispy.

I got the cheese dip, just ok. My wife's combo of chicken flauta and taco was not good. Even the rice and beans were not that good.

What do I expect from a resort restaurant. Should've known better... but it is convenient if you're staying at the Arizona Grand resort and have a very large group.

Not only that... that charge 20% gratuity for large groups!
