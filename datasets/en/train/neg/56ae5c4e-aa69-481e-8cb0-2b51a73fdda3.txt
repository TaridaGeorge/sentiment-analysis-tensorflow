After inquiring about several dishes and not finding exactly what i was looking for, I ordered some really simple.  Jook (congee, rice porridge).  A staple.  Ridiculously simple to make with the ingredients of rice, water, and a bit of ginger.  It was incredible how terrible the bowl was.

The price was good.  The appearance was fine, but the taste set a new record and not a good one.  It was straight narsty.  There was no rice taste whatsoever.  The only thing I could think was that they use mostly rice flour instead of rice to make it.

Maybe I ordered the wrong things, but I don't think i'll be giving it another shot.  It is certainly not among the Best Hong Kong Dining in the valley.
