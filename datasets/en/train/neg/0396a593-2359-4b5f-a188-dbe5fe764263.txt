The last two times we have been there the girls are in the back. Trash not emptied, yogurt grates were filthy, three guys laying in chairs hanging out with the girls. This is close to our house but we will not go back. There is that feeling that this place is dirty. Also, the last time the yogurt was like soup. My best advise is go someplace else!
