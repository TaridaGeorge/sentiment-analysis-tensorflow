I went into Travelodge knowing that it wasn't going to be a 5 star hotel.

However, it was dirtier than I could have imagined. Please don't stay here no matter how inexpensive it is. You do deserve better.

The only saving grace was the location and they didn't charge me for having my dog.

The bathroom area was dirty and the carpets were gross. They were ripped, torn, and covered in many different hair samples.

I'm convinced there was a dead body rotting in one of the rooms, because the odors while walking to my room were foul and beyond ripe.

The bed was extremely uncomfortable, and the window blinds do a horrible job of blocking out the morning sun.
