Ambience= 9/10
Reaching the table=4. Had to wait to maneuver through a maze of tables at the bar
Waiter=5. Never smiled. Didn't seem interested. Thought he was in Paris or something
Appetizers=5. Stone crab was rotten. Salads Ocean Club wannabes. 
Entrees=6. Everything was dripping in butter and salt. Head chef definitely is simple minded, put more butter and salt when in doubt. Bone-in-filet was inedible. Lobster was not fresh, completely chewy. Veal was chewy.
Side dishes=2. Gnocchi was disgusting! Where was the lobster in it? Veggies could have been done better. 
Dessert=6 better than rest of meal but completely forgetful. 

Overall, for dropping about a thousand dollars I thought I could have had a better meal just about anywhere else. This place is hip, but won't last in that location unless they upgrade their food and service. Ocean club, City Hall, and Capital Grill are all better.
