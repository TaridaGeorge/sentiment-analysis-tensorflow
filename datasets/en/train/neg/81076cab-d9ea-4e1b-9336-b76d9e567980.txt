It's a company policy that you can order your burgers still medium-rare (or even rare) at any In-N-Out location, but despite being paid more than minimum wage at this location, they refuse to put in more than minimum effort and lie that they only cook their burgers to one temperature (which also isn't true, as I've received random temperature burgers here when not specifying any specific doneness). Lazy employees who are creating bad examples of what should be relatively higher-tier fast-food burgers.

If you really want In-N-Out, go to another location. Unlike basically every other restaurant, the people here just don't give a damn.
