Rude, rude, rude.  The clerk today was put out by my business.  My fiance warned me but I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt.  She failed to greet me; didn't want to count the items; delivered 2 pieces of disappointing news with a look and a tone that spoke volumes (TOUGH),
No, little girl, tough for you!  We will be going elsewhere in the future.
