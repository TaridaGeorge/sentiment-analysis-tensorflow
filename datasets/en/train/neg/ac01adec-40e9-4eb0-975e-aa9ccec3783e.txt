Worst event I have ever been to, totally beats the Oktoberfest in Tempe. The lines are atrocious, the drink booth is pretty much invisible, with warm beverages, trucks were closed (who knows why), good thing I left before I had to attempt the bathroom line.  Also we were there early and it sucked that much. Take the Kids though, probably fun for them as long as you brought food for them.
