Why for the love of God do people take small children to an adult movie and why oh why does the theater staff allow this to happen?! HOWEEEEEEVER!!!!! we are bluntly told we can't take in our Cold Stone waffle cone ice creams because of a new "outside food and drink" policy but these three small children can run and cry and scream throughout the entire movie.I hate you people! 

I paid $10.50 for my entry ticket, $13 for a soda and popcorn and you ruined my hopes of escaping from reality for not even two hours. 

Parents who poorly plan and ruin movie nights for other moviegoers can SUCK IT HARD !!!!and AMC, you get caught up in the crossfire for turning a blind eye.  

I'm done with you and I want my money back!
