Have been to this restaurant before, and it was good, however went there last night with several friends and the food was terrible, I had a patty melt & asked for well done it was very rare,  and bread and onions were burnt.  They said they would not charge me, but did anyway. Maybe they have a new cook, my friends did not like their meals either......
