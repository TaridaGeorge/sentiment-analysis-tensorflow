Poor service from the cashier and the manager. They ran out of ice. I already paid for my meal and wanted to get ice with my drink. The manager said they would not fill up the ice because they were too busy. She refused to refund my money. I had to get back to work and did not want to fight about a cup of ice. The Burgers are over priced. They have the worst fries I've tasted.I called back to try to speak to a manager. They said they could not help me.
