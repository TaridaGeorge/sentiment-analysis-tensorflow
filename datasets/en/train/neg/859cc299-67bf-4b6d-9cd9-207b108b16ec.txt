THREE STRIKES, YOUR OUT PORTLANDS!

An employee threw his DIRTY apron only a few feet from my plate as I sat at the bar. I should have never came back.

THe 2nd visit I arrived at 9:30 and was told they were closing soon and couldn'st seat me. As I go back into my car I saw two get seated.

I called and complained. I was given a comp for two and went for lunch. The fish we ordered was still frozen inside.

I will NEVER step foot in Portlands again, (Unless I have to pee during First Friday)
