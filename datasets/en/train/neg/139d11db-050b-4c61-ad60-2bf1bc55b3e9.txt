U can go there n check the car out. If u wanna buy 1 there? That's wrong move! If u even want a car service from there? U made a biggest mistake of ur life!! I had 1 time asked my girlfriend to take my car there for an oil service, guess what? They ripped my girlfriend off by lying how bad my car is now. If without fixing the problem. Might bring some serious accident. Then she did what they said. 4 brand new tires, timing belt, 4 new brake pads. U know why's the worst? All of those above I had just changed 2 months before!!! What a trashy dealer is that? People, better off go somewhere!
