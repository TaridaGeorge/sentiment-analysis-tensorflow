I visited this store after purchasing the Groupon 4pack and my kids loved it, so no complaints initially. Until I came back and tried to redeem two Groupons on separate transactions, which I was allowed to do on first visit. I was told the owner decided you could only redeem one per visit, which was not in the deal fine print. This was unfortunate since I brought a whole pack of kids. Left a bad taste in my mouth and we won't be going back, in an effort to force repeat visits they lost customers.
