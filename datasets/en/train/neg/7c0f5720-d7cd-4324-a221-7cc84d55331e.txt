Being born and raised in Hawaii this place isn't so great.   The only items that are good are the saimin, fried saimin, and the guava cake.  Everything else is pretty horrible including the spam musubi! They don't even cook the spam, it's like they sliced it out of can and placed it in the musubi mold. If you want real hawaiian food head over to Paradise Hawaiian BBQ at ASU!! They even serve meat jun there.
