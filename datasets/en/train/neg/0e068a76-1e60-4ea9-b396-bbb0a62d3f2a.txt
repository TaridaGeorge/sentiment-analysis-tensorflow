I've been eating at pita jungle for 17 years now. I love their new location downtown as it is close to where I live. Today i had lunch there, food was great and fast as always. Our server, who's name I only got off the check was the worst I have ever had- in 17 years with this company!  She was snippy, inattentive and , if you could not guess, a bit rude. Sooooooo, if you go to this beautiful pita location,  do yourself a favor and request ANY server aside from Jamie.
