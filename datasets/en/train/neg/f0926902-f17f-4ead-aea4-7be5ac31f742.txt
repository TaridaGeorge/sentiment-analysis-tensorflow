I have been a Verizon customer for many years and this is the worst service I have ever received.  I expect the prices to be higher in a Verizon corporate store than Costco, Best Buy, etc (which they are).  However, I also expect the quality of the service and the knowledge of the products to be higher as well (which it is not).
