God only knows how a company can hire such incompetent and disorganized employees.   Does Nationwide provide any training in customer service at all????   

I just don't get it.  With so many thousands of bright people looking for work, how does a national company end up with such terrible employees?

I mean, how difficult is it to do an accurate eye exam and send it to the lab to get processed?   (Based on my experience here, it must be about as difficult as flying to Jupiter, as they can't seem to get ANYTHING right.)

I've had five experiences with this Nationwide branch (eye exam, 2 types of glasses), and each one has resulted in major errors resulting in delays in receiving glasses.   The employees don't listen, don't write things down, don't follow up, and worst of all they act like they are doing you a favor by even being there.
