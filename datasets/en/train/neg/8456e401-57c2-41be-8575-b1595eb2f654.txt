The worst fish and chips I have ever had.  Do yourself a favor...go to Fry's, buy a box of Gorton's fish fillets (the square ones) and take it home and deep fry it.  Then mix some ketchup with some cocktail sauce (NO TARTAR SAUCE....THEY DON'T HAVE TARTAR SAUCE!!) and you have the Pete's experience, and you save about $15. I can't believe people think this is good.  They make Long John Silvers seem gourmet. Dang.
