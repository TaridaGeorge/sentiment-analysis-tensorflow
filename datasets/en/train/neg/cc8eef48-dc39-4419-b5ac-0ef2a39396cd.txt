Clarendon Park Apartments...SUCK IT! 

Charging me $30 to clean my tub (pahleeze, I make Felix Unger look like a slob!), $25 for a broken towel rack (which had been wobblly since day one and repaired several times) and a carpet cleaning charge on carpet that is 8 years old AND I know you replaced it after I moved out.

SUCK IT!

You'll NEVER get that money from me. 

Not funny people, but hopefully useful and I tried, oh I tried to be cool.
