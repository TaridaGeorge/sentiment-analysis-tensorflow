Don't plan to go here if it's anywhere near closing time.  They are open until 10pm and when I called at 9:30pm I was told by the receptionist Rebecca that if I arrived prior to 10pm and was signed in...my child would be seen by a doctor.  
We arrived at 9:55pm and she told me that since 2 other people arrived just before me, I was not allowed to sign in.  She instructed us to go to the ER at the hospital!  
My child had severe pneumonia and possibly needed oxygen and our information and x-rays were already in Cornerstone's computer system...and Rebecca still wouldn't let my child be seen?  I believe that all they care about is getting out of there as fast as possible...forget taking people before closing time.
