Don't even get me started with this hotel.  

This will be brief, and to the point.  If you are in a room, with an adjoining room, and even though there are 2 doors separating you, you will hear EVERYTHING that is taking place next door to you.  It is beyond ridiculous. 

I spend a considerable amount of time at this hotel, not by choice, but that of my employers.  With limited choices in the Phoenix downtown, that is just the way it is.

Anyway, if you want to stay here, bring industrial earplugs, cause you will need them!
