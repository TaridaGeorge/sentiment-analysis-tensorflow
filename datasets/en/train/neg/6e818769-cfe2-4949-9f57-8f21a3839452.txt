We heard great things about this place so we thought we'd try it.  Maybe it was a bad night....but we had terrible service and food.  They never came over to refill our drinks or check to see how our meal was.  When they finally came over at the end of our meal to see if we needed anything else and to bring us the bill.......we told the waitress that the chicken dish was terrible and we didn't eat it.  Her response was, "would you like to take it to-go"?  Um....NO, didn't you just hear we said it was terrible?  They didn't take it off the bill either which is what she should have done.   Like I said....maybe they had a new cook and waitress that night because we have heard from others that it is good....just not for us!!  Very disappointing!!
