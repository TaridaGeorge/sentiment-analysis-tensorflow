My boyfriend got me a piece from here for our anniversary. I love vintage and unique jewelry. When I opened the box, I was glad I worked on my "surprised" face.

The necklace-clip-on earring set he got me was the biggest piece of JUNK I've ever seen in my life. Here's the funny part, it cost $250! No diamonds, no jewels, JUST PLASTIC! 

JUNK JUNK JUNK!

I will be going into the store to return this piece of junk tomorrow. I hope this crazy lady who believes in ripping people off will give me a refund. 

Please do yourself a favor and AVOID!
