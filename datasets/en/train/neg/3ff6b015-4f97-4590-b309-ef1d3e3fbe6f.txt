Nothing great about this place. They could replace the sign with Subway and I would never know...except that there would be fewer options to top my sub with. They coined the phrase "Mike's Way" in an effort to allow you to order your sandwich in some special and tasty way. In reality, it means lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar...wowwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. As a vegetarian, this is one of my least favorite sub places since there are not too many toppings for those of us avoiding the meat selections.

I've only been here once and will not be going back.
