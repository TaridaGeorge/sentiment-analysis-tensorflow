Again, more issues from the employee with an attitude, Assi.  This time tried to fool my wife into thinking that Subway had closed early.  The current time was 8:45pm and they close at 10pm.  No respect and continued to treat my wife in a belittling way.  Is there a number I can call to fix this poor customer service???
