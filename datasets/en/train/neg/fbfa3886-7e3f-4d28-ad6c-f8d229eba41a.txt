Went there for our first time. Service was poor, wine list not that great and general cleanliness of the place was poor. The servers were eating food behind the bar  and then touching the glasses. Later in the evening I saw a cockroach crawling across the floor. I pointed it out to a friend and it grossed her out so much we left... Won't be back..there's so many other places that are way cleaner and have better service!!
