I was referred for an MRI of my shoulder which was injured. My initial appointment was canceled by them, because they did not get pre-certification from my insurance co. They said  they would  call me as soon as they got the ok from insurance which was Aetna. That was July 21st. Now it is Aug. 1st and NO CALL. I checked with Aetna and it was approved on July 21st. I guess they are just too busy to handle everyone. I will not go there. I am a  physician.
