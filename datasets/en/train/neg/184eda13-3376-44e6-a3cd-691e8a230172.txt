I went in to McDonalds and was greeted by the manager (i only knew it was a manager by her name tag) who was SCREAMING at the staff at the top of her lungs. After about 45 seconds she realized I was in front of her and made it seem like I was a pain for wanting her service. I will never go back to this McDonalds to support this terrible manager. Embarrassing.
