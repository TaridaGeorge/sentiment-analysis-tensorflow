My recommendation: water

We ordered buffalo wings and loaded potato skins as a "hold me over" food because nothing else in PHX airport looked open, but I'm not quite sure what we got.  The buffalo wings were chicken tenders coated with a really thin layer of really acrid/burn your mouth off buffalo sauce, and the potato skins were loaded with...oil.

Do yourself a favor and buy something from a vending machine if you're hungry.  Totally not worth the $30 that we spent here for two dishes + tax/tip...not even CLOSE.
