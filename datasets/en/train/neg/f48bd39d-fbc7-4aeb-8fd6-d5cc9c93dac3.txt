Was in Phoenix and wanted to Yelp a local place since I always have great luck with Yelp!

I was staying in downtown and was happy to see that I would be able to walk to this restaurant that had such great reviews. It was 'Open' on Yelp so I walked over there STARVING, only for it to be closed!!! WTH?!?! Seriously if you have your business on this site and have gone through the trouble of adding your hours, they had better be correct!!!!

Very upset that I could have chosen so many other places, major boo boo!!!
