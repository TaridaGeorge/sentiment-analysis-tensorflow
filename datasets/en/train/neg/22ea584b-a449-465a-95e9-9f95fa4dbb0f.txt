Ruined several of my shirts, extremely overpriced, unhelpful employees... This place is on my black-list...

If you are going to use them DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT do what they call 'fluff and fold', it's what they told me was the same as Wash/Fold laundry at other places....What it turned out to be was wash, with no fold... the folding was amateur, and that means a lot coming from someone who pays to get things folded for him haha! Plus it was expensive as shit! One of the things I miss most about SF is chinese wash/fold, it is amazing there...
