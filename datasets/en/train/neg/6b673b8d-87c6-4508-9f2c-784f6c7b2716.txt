Not sure how a restaurant who looks so fancy, but the food so poorly done can even be in a resort like the Westin! We were a large dinner party and every body's food was wayyyy over done! I specifically asked for medium rare knowing most restaurants always over cook steak...and then it came out well done along with all the others. The potatoes that accompanied it were not good either. Some of the apps were good...like the tuna tartar and the beef pastry. And the desserts were good.

The only plus was the staff was super nice...but I didn't come here to pay for a friendly face.
