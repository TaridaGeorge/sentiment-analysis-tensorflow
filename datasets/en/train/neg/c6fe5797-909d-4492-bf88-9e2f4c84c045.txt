Horrible hotel! When we pulled up there were 4 police cars with several people in cuffs. There was a pair of underwear in the corner of our room. After we came home there was a charge in my credit card for the mini bar that we didn't even have a key for! This place is run down and not worth the price. They price gouge for everything. Trust me you don't want to stay here!!!
