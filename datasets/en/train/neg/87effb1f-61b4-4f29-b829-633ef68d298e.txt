The contrarian review... from an espresso purists perspective.

In my desperate search to find espresso near my hotel (which I think is old downtown, but I get confused easily) I put this place on my list.

To their credit, when I ordered a ristretto con panna, the barista thought she knew what I meant. I clarified, which is fine, and she went about making it. However, it wasn't drinkable. I got it to stay so I could enjoy it if it was decent, so I had to drink some while the barista watched, but I couldn't get it all down, even with 3 sugars (did that make sense to anyone?). I don't think it's even good enough to make a decent latte, either, so I won't be back.

On the other paw, they were playing some Flyleaf, so the music is good.
