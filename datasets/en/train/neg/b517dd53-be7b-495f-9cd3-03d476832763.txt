This is one of the worst airlines I've flown with.  I've travelled the world on many different airlines.  Almost all airlines allow people to standby for an earlier return flight without charge.  US Airways will not.  They make you pay for any flight changes.  They'll rather let their planes fly out half empty than to accommodate their passengers.
