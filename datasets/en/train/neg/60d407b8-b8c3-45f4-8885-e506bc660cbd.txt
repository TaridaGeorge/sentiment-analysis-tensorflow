Shepherd's pie.... Processed, pre frozen, and just plain disgusting. We then ordered a hamburger to replace the Shepherd's pie. Ordered it medium and it came out well done. I noticed this place is not known for its food nor are they known for great customer service. Not much care was given towards our crappy food. We will not be returning.
