If I could give this dump zero stars I would. This particular Rosati's is THE WORST IN THE ENTIRE CHAIN. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. They frequently don't have items listed on their menu; I'm gonna take a guess that whoever manages this Rosati's has about a 6th grade education. 

Remember the "egg noodles and ketchup" Rat Liota talks about at the end of 'Goodfellas'? This is the place he was talking about.
