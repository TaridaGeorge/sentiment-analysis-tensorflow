Me and my wife ate here years ago and I am not planning on going back to update this review, so here it goes. Wow talk about bad tasting food, never and I mean never in my life have the walked out leaving the whole plate of food on the table and still paid for the meal. It had no taste what so ever, I mean I grew up in a little mexican town so I know what it should taste like and it was not even close. Taco Bell has better tasting mexican food. Oh and my wife threw up in the parking lot so you know how her experience was. Just bad food.
