My main gripe about Best Buy is that all of their products are expensive. You can usually find what you need on Newegg or Amazon for half the price. Because of this, you'd think that Best Buy would offer "personalized customer service" to stand out in the industry.

But, Best Buy's customer service is lacking.

The main concern that I have about Best Buy is that they DON'T train their employees to approach customers. "Can I help you find anything?" They used to do this, I want to say 5 years ago, recently not so much... and by that I mean never! Ha.. It's not the employees fault though, the managers seem not to give a care that all of their employees are mingling in the front of the store.
