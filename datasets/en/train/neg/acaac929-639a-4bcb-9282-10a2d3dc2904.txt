There donuts are good but the nastiest coffee ever!! I threw up!! I ordered an iced coffee. THe girl ask if I wanted flavor and milk I said sure thinking I was going to put in my own milk and get a regular shot of flavor, but all I got was iced milk that was super sweet I don't even think there was coffee in it. I don't drink milk the only time I ever use it is in coffee. Learn how to make drinks $2.50 for undrinkable coffee I am super pissed I guess I should of drank some before I left. This was the 7th street location boo boo boo boo
