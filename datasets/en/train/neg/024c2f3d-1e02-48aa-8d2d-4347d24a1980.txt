This place is a dump...plain and simple and makes my list of places to avoid. AC unit was barely operating, the deadbolt lock on my door was broken and it took two days to have someone fix it and it still was not working properly, roaches all over the place. Staff must be hired from a Boces program. Never again, would rather sleep in my car than in this hellhole.
