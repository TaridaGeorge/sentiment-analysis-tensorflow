WORST PLACE EVER, they sent me a bill the other day for $200 dollars from 8 months ago. They never looked into what my insurance would or would not cover and just screwed me over. Do not go here they are sales men and crooks and will give you an unnecessary hearing test and charge you for it, I'm 29 don't need a hearing test. AVOID at all Costs should really be 0 stars.
