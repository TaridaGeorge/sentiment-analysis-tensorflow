Tried to overcharge me for a double cheeseburger and then when I tried to explain to the manager what happened they seemed to not have a clue how to fix (I had to explain it to them about 4 times for them to understand and then i pretty much had to spell out what they should do to make it right).  The place doesnt look very clean and I would consider this to be below the standards for most burger kings.
