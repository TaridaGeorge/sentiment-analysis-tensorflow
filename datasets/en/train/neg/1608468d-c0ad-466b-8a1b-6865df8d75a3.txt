The money-gram service fee is $14 meanwhile at Walmart only $9. 

They using a phone call instead if a filling form which is I have to repeated the questions & the answers many times. 

They only accepted cash, not debit card. So when I have to take the cash from the ATM near their door, it charged me $3. 

I had to do it coz I have no time to find Walmart,  otherwise I preferred to go to Walmart. It suck.
