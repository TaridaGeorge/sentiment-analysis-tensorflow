So now I know my worth to Ace.   

I have always used this store as a super convenient Hardware store...,NEVER AGAIN!!!  I was returning air condition filters for a different size ... Simple right--- WRONG.   This exchange was not in their policy so they could not do it.  Sometimes a business manager needs to look past a store policy to retain a great client.  The filters probably cost them 2 bucks: compared to the hundreds of dollars that I have spent and  the hundreds that I would have spent in the future... I am glad to know that your appreciation of local clients is not worth 2 bucks.... ACE I am disappointed in you.
