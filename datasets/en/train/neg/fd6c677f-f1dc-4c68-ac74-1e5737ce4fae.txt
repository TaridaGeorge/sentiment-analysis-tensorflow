The food was not very good. My pasta sauce tasted like it was from a can and the salmon was fishy tasting.  I only ate a very small amount.  My husbands dish of stuffed pork also was nothing to write home about. 
The salad and app and good--but that was it.  Also the band plays in the bar where we ate and the sound system is terrible.  You can't hear the music very good and certainly can't understand a word they say.  Overall this place wasn't very good and I would not waste my money to go back.
