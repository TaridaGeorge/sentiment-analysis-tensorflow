Your typical overpriced art retail store staffed with minimum wage high school or college art students sporting ear gauges, pink hair, and facial piercings. What does that mean? Don't expect anything more than average customer service with ridiculously high prices.

Check this out: I paid $4.69 for a product that I can buy for a $1.08 online. Literally. I only purchased because it was time sensitive and I needed it immediately. If you can wait a few extra days for shipping and have an Internet connection avoid this store I guarantee you can find much lower prices elsewhere.
