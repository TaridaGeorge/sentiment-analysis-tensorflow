Tried to eat here on Saturday night.  I say "tried" because we never ended up seeing our server.  We were seated promptly in a section with only two tables full.  The thing is, our server never came.  Never.  No "hello", no "I'll be with you in a moment", nothing.  Very strange, since the place was NOT busy.  A confused busboy walked by, and another waiter walked by, but nobody every came to our table.  WTF!?  We left after 10 minutes.  So, definitely give McGrath's a try if you want to be ignored.
