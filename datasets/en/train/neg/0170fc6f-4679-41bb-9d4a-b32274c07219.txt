Was looking for a place to eat lunch, didnt want fast food...but.. yeah McDonald's would have probably tasted better. Walked in and noticed the outdated decor...and the smell. Decided to give it a try anyways. Ordered the chili burger. As soon as they delivered I was like ugh. I took one bite and it was the worst chili i had ever had! Never going back...
