never been a fan of this place. my wife and my inlaws absolutely love this place.. the pizza is flavorless and leaves ya needing a gallon of water afterwards.im from chicago and have yet to find decent pizza here in az.   i tried their lasagna the next time cause ya really cant mess that up... wrong. also flavorless and overcooked to boot. i have quit going with them and just fend for myself at the house. on the upside...the pazooki is fantastic.
