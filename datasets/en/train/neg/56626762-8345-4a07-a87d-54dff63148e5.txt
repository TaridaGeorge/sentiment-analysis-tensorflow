US Airways has ruined the travel experience for me and my family consistently for the last 3 years. We've been stuck flying with them because it's our only option, and it's always soul crushing. Arbitrary rules that force you in to hours long delays, stranded at airports, stuck in hotels overnight. Customers are cargo. It makes me wonder what they're shipping under the plane, there is so much absolute disregard for humanity on this airline.
