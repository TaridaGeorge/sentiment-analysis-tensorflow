If you're visiting Pearl for a low cost and decent quality sushi, be prepared for the horrible customer service that comes with it. For starters the food is not "great" and the prices definitely fit the quality of it's food. As a resident of PHX we have visited Pearl on several occasions. However, every time we have visited, we have had a horrible experience with the staff and owner. We recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well. She claims to be an owner of Sushi bars for over 18 years but it is VERY apparent that she lacks the education of hospitality. We officially stopped attending and have spread the word of her horrible management.  For a little more money I would definitely recommend RAW sushi or Stingray.
