I and my Wife, dined here this evening.
     I felt, the pricing is a bit over the top.
     The burgers were somewhat-OK ....... not the fantastic ...... I was expecting.     
     
For the price ....... I would of expected the burgers ..... to be hand formed.
The burgers were not dry ....... just not juicy.                

The tables that seat two individuals, are TO SMALL ........ barely room for the plates.

OUR server ......was a Young person ...  who spent her time in the backroom.
                           So our srevice was  Mediocre.

                  Overall I was disappointed with our experience.

My Ethics .... My Standards:
Every business starts with one star ...... GETTING MORE .... HAS TO BE EARNED.
