Please refer to my attached photo for why the Scottsdale Quarter gets ONE star for my review. HALF of the entire parking garage was reserved for Valet parking on a Tuesday night at 8:00pm.  And all the spots were empty. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind parking far away and walking or even parking valet, but I was just "stopping in" to grab some froyo at Menchies. The walk to and from my car took longer than it took me to get the Frozen Yogurt.  

What's the point of having a parking garage if it's completely empty and reserved for valet parking? 

Its no wonder the Oakville Grocery closed, there was probably nowhere for the customers to park.  I wouldn't be surprised if other businesses close as a result of this horrendous parking situation.
