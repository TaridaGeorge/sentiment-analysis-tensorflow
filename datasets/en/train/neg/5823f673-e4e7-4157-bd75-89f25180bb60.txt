Had dinner last night at Talavera.  Very disappointed.   Restaurant is beautiful with high end touches.   Poor marks for food quality and service.   My medium rare buffalo tenderloin was significantly overcooked.   No pink was visible.   The veggies, on the contrary were undercooked.   The carrots were warm on the outside and cold in the middle.    I never send food back but was ready to make an exception in this case.   However, the waitstaff was nowhere to be found.  After receiving my entree 40 min elapsed before anyone followed up to see how we were doing.   I don't necessarily blame the servers as they seemed to be significantly understaffed.   I expect much, much more from an expensive restaurant at a Four Seasons resort.   Extremely disappointing.
