I have eaten here before and it was very good but this morning my husband and I stopped in for breakfast and did not have a good experience.  We both ordered eggs benedict which we have had there before and was very good.  The waitress comes back 5 minutes later and tells us they are out of hollandaise sauce.  We asked if they could make more. She said no it's too busy.  I am not sure why they couldn't make more because they should have all ingredients already there eggs, butter and lemon.  We would have happily waited a little longer for them to make the sauce.  There was only about 10 people in the restaurant.
