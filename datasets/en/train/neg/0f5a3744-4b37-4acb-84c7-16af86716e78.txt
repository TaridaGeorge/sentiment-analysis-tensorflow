We were greeted at the door and the host was nice but as soon as we sat down the service just stopped. After literally 20 minutes we decided to leave due to no one acknowledging us without even the slightest smile. The food looked decent but we will never know, and due to the lack of service we will never return. If you are looking for a place to be treated as if you don't exist then Mellow Mushroom is the place for you.
