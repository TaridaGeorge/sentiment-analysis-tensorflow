Three of us came and went. If you are a fan of an overtly pretentious environment, than this is your place. The staff has no personality and the food even less. If you have any concerns - or allergies for that matter - the "chef" is unable to accommodate. The menu is so bold - offering a robust 10 basic items - that they are unwilling to offer "No substitutions or modifications...Really." Don't waste your time - or money for that matter - Really!
