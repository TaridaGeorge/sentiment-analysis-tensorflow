Ive ordered food twice here and was not pleased either time.  Once was a cheesesteak which was just OK.  Considering the convenience of the location being so close to my apartment I decided I would try them again, this time a cheeseburger, cheese fries and mozz sticks, cant be hard to mess up right? Wrong! They use spicy nacho cheese on the fries, nothing about the burger was appetizing(seemed like really cheap beef) and the mozz sticks just werent good.
