If you're looking to meet an interesting, sophisticated woman, then look elsewhere. This place is fun to go to with friends but not as a single guy. The crowd is definitely for those in their early 20s. It's full of those women who grew up with Paris Hilton and Brittney Spears as role models and adore Lady Gaga. Many lack any form of self-respect, based on what they're wearing or the frequent grinding with men of their or questionable ages. I recommend Mabel's if you want an opportunity to meet a beauty with brains to match.
