Called ahead of time to ask if they carried sushi wrappers, seaweed.  The lady on the phone put me on hold, came back, and said yes.  I took the trip there & couldn't find it.  I asked for help there to find it and a person who worked there couldn't find it.

Also, don't understand why an organic sign is outside when there is hardly an organic section to start with, and has few items in it that are not so old you wouldn't eat...
