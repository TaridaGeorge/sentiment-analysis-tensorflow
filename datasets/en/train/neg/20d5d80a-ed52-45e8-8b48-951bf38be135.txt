I was here a couple of weeks ago and got there early, like 5 minutes before they opened ... at 9am I think.  Total darkness.  I could hear birds chirping but I was like, "Okay, I'll wait a little bit longer."  Five minutes past the hour and still nobody.

First of all, what the heck at opening so LATE IN THE MORNING?!?!?!?!?!?!!  Secondly, why wasn't anybody there when the doors are supposed to open?!

The smoothies aren't bad but the servers really aren't very happy people.  I never get a positive vibe when I go in.  The service is fine just not very chipper people, which is what I expect from a smoothie place.

P.S.  We've been coming here since they opened and the smoothies are decent ... 3 stars definitely but I was just really ticked off that they weren't open ... that's just bad business.
