Just terrible - been there a few times because they're only 3 or 4 dollars, but it was money wasted. They have a very antiquated car wash, where you have to perfectly line up your wheels with grooves so narrow they barely fit. I spent 5 minutes backing up, pulling forward, again and again trying to get my wheels aligned just right. A couple times I succeeded, a couple times I didn't. If there's staff there, they'll help guide you in, but it's still hard, and there's often not staff there. For five bucks you can get a much easier car wash at any other (modern) automated car wash.
