I pulled up to the drive-thru window at 3 p.m. and someone finally came to help me at 3:12. I was unhappy, he was NOT sympathetic. I will never go back. I was the only person in line at the drive-thru, and I had the definite impression that the people in line inside were served first while I waited in the heat. I guess CVS has so much business they don't care about mine. They are widely reviled in Maricopa and now I know why.
