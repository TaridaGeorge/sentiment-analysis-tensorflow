I love sushi + My friend loves sushi + RA emails us coupons + RA is nearby our offices = Lunch at RA.

These reasons are no longer enough for me to go to this location. The sushi rolls are so dry and lackluster that even dousing them in soy sauce doesn't help. The service is so slow that we have to order our drinks, food, and ask for the bill as soon as the waitress comes by after 20 minutes of sitting. Even after telling them we have a short lunch, I still find myself leaving way too late. Good thing I have such a lovely companion to keep me company while we wait.

No more second, third, or fourth chances, RA.
