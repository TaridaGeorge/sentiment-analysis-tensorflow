Every visit I've made to Zen 32 over the years has been regrettable, but I'm the sucker who didn't learn to avoid it after the first trip. 

Sugary, soy-saucy, stale-y, mediocre-y stuff. Phoenix isn't known for good sushi but still... there are certain boundaries which can not be crossed when pricing sushi at a certain level. Better dead fish can probably be had from the Shrimply the Best truck parked on that highway near Maricopa, honestly.

Proud member of my "Top 10 non-Scottsdale location to show up in foam flip flops and badly fitted, badly washed jeans as tasteless as the sashimi" list.
