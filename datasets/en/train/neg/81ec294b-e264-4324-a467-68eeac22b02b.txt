Good fried chicken, not the best though.

DDD, you've disappoint me.  I went to this restaurant because it was featured on the Food Network channel.  I should have left when I walked in and saw the "dining room."  And when I say "dining room," I mean a dirty, take-out, greasy space with small tables that looked like they were thrown away by the public schools cafeteria.

But hey, at least I can say that I gave it a shot.
