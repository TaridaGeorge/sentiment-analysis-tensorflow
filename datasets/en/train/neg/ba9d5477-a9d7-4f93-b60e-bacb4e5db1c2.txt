I should have read the previous review before I went here! Being new to the area this cleaners is close to my house and looked cleaned so I dropped off some dry cleaning. My dress and jacket came out fine, but super expensive! (about $30 for the both) However, they lost TWO of my pricy Nordstrom dress shirts!!! And charged me!!! WTF!!?!? Will not be coming back!!!
