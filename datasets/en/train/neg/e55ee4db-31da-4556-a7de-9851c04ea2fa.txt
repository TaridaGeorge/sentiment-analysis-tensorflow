They recommended $600 worth of repairs "that we needed" including new brakes.  We took the car to an independent mechanic for a second opinion and he said the car was in great shape and did not need anything including brakes for another 15-20,000 miles.  Just get a second opinion if they recommend any additional work.  That's all I'm saying!
