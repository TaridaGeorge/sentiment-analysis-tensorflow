Okay - I am not a foodie, just looking for some decent Chinese food.  Read the yelp review on House of Yang, and decided to try it.  

To start with a positive note, the woman who took my order was very cordial.  On a negative note, the food was horrible, in both presentation and more importantly taste.  I do not put many restaurants on my "never again" list, but House of Yang is clearly in my top 5.  My wife and I will never return. 

The search for good Chinese food in Phoenix continues...
