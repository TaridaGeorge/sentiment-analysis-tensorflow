Very surprised but the margarita pizza had absolutely no taste! Not sure if that is normal for that type of pizza but we didn't taste the sauce, the cheese,? And did wait by the door for awhile before someone acknowledged us so didn't like that. We came because we had a Groupon coupon but not if we'll come back when we're used to Grimaldi!!
