I tried to return some Oakley Sunglasses that i bought from another ROSS Store and the Manager 'JOE' wouldn't do it because he said it was to "High End" (Expensive) and that he couldn't match it up even though the Receipt had the info as the Sunglasses had on it.......Very Suspicious!!!!!!!!!!  Then i took them back to another ROSS Store down the street and they returned them with no problem...
