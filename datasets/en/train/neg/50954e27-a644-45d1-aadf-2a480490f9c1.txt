Wow.. I've been to Hannys a handful of times but Saturday ruined it for me.. we just went in for the cocktails after being across to street. Much to my disappointment we were barely greeted at the door to sit at a.table for 10 minutes prior to being spoken to by a server.. we walked out. How insane? It will take an act of the heavens for me to go back.. only advice, sit in a highly visible area and make contact with your server promptly..
