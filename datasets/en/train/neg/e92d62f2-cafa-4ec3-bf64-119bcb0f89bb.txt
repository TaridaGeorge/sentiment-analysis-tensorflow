Have had nothing but difficulty with this bank, they got my business by claiming that they were a real "community" type bank. They are not, all employees we met with when we opened the account have been replaced a couple of times. Judging by the high turnover and the lack of intelligence in half of the staff, i think i will be moving to a Credit Union as soon as my partner gets back to town and we can move the business account.
