I walked in this morning. There are 2 employees standing at the counter. NEITHER looks up to even say hello to me. (Although, as what looked to be the morning shift was arriving over the course of the 15 minutes I was there, they said good morning to everyone who worked with them that walked through the door) 

This place is a "print center" and they could not print on simple card stock that my regular home printer can print on. So lame. The card stock kept jamming so they wouldn't print anymore for me, even though it was printing them beautifully, they were just jamming when they were coming out so they had to keep opening the machine. 

At any rate, 1 star because for being a print center they should be able to PRINT.
