So disappointed with babbo.  Our family has been going there since it opened up.  The pizza is amazing and I love the salads.  Unfortunately, they only receive one star based on our most recent experience.  We picked up a pizza and brought it home.  When we lifted the pizza lid, our pizza was so sad looking.  It looked like someone forgot to add the sauce and we probably had about 3 ounces of cheese, sparsely sprinkled on top.  We called babbo and spoke with the manager. He said there was NOTHING he could do unless we drove back to the restaurant.  We live about 25 minutes away and asked if they could mail a credit, or credit our debit card.  The answer was no.  So sad.  I love the pizza, but can't stand poor customer service, especially when I have been a loyal customer.
