What the hell is up with the music?!? You can't dance to it, you can't get into it. We went on 7/31 and it just drug the whole night down. I think three people sat and watched the guys playing. Really? You pay for these guys to be here? Even with the bean bag toss and ping pong and all the good things about The Monastery, the music bit big time! Ugh, it makes me not wanna come back anytime soon.
