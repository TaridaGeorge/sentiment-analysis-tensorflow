This was a very bizarre land of contradiction. It really seemed unclear as to whether this was supposed to be a bar that served food and had bands, a restaurant that had douches and band, a venue that also had food, etc. 

They then told us we could sit at the only table there, or not. They were still serving food, no they weren't yes they were. 
Maybe it was our bad for going for dinner, but what was the cover for? The alleged entertainment certainly didn't earn it.   
Food was ok, i suppose, as long  the other choice was Chef Boyardee, The staff was oblivious, over loaded, and disorganized. The whole experience reminded me why I was skeptical to begin with.
