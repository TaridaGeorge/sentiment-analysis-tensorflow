What a waste of my money!  I can pan fry a burger at home and it will still taste much better that this place.  To think I spent almost $30 here, makes me angry...I want my money back.

My daughter got the Oreo shake which was really good.  But the burger was extremely disappointing.  Don't even get me started at how gross the veggie fries were....YUCK!
