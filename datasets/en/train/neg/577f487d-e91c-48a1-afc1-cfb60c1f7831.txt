I brought in my own shopping bag & the unprofessional sloppy heavy set girl looked at me like I was crazy & made me pack my items myself. Ummmm what's your job description again?... Also what's annoying is being rushed by beggers who get nasty when you don't acknowledge them. Park close and don't go alone.
