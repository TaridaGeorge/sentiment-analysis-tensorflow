I have rarely met a pizza that I didn't like. And after reading reviews on AZCentral, and this being close to home, I figured this would be the place. 

I was seriously disappointed. I don't know if I just ordered the wrong thing, but this was pretty unimpressive. So much so that, even with it being one of the closest to home, we will never eat there again. 

Sorry guys!
