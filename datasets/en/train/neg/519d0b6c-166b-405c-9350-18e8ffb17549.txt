I was taken to dinner tonight for my birthday.  I wanted the prawns and they didn't have them. We ordered the tuna salad and the tuna was well done and tasteless. We ordered risotto and one was bland and the other too spicy. We ordered grilled bread that was truly tasteless. I would not go back nor recommend this restaurant to anyone that is seeking a tasty meal.
