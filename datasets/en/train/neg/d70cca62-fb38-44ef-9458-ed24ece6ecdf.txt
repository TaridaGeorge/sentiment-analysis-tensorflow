I would never have eaten here if not for my friends insistence. The few times I've ordered with them our order has been incomplete and wrong. They refuse to make simple adjustments such as omitting garnish/lettuce and tomatoes from their tacos. Food is sub-par at best. Temperature and time of delivery is appropriate.
