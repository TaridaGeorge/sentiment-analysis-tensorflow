Our waitress was wonderful, but that is where the wonderful ends. A girlfriend and I had breakfast here this past weekend, and the food was so awful that we literally could not eat it. A busser came by to pick up our still-full plates, asked if we wanted a box, and I responded that the food was awful and we would not be taking it home. Her response was to say "sorry" and walk away. T__T

I had to inform our server that we hadn't eaten our food and the busser was none too concerned. The manager ended up comping the entire bill seeing as we ate nothing.  Yuck. Won't be back.
