This review is purely based on service because we didn't get a chance to try the food... If there was a negative one star, that is what they should get.

My husband and I wanted to try something new. We found Eden's grill on yelp and thought we'll give it a shot.

We walked in and stood in the lack of space for about 2 mins. NO ONE acknowledged us so we decided to grab a seat. 

It gets even worst, we sat down for 5 mins and still nothing. No water or even noticed that a customer walked in. Servers were in the dining room so I can't see why at least one person couldn't have said hi.

We walked out and will not be back.
