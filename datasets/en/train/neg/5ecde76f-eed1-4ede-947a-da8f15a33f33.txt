STA Travel SUCKS.  So we planned a group trip and everything went wrong.  People flew out of the wrong places, into the wrong places, wrong days, etc.  And they overcharge.  MOTHERFUCKER.

Our lovely travel agent, Heather, forgot to book one room for the last leg of the trip, and booked the return date of the trip wrong.

NEVER EVER EVER USE THEM.  Unless you want to end up in the wrong country and city in the wrong time.  

Oh and btw, they don't respond to voicemail or email because apparently its not part of the job description.
