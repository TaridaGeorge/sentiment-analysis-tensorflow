My mail was being returned to sender, no forwarding address left...uh....and here I was thinking my renter tried to skip out on a month's rent! Nope! Her rent check was returned to her!  So I call the 480 number...speak with "Erick" I believe.  All i hear from him is "i don't know" to questions such as: Do you know why this happened? How long has it been happening?

Oh, I am lying...he did pass the buck and said to call back later and speak with someone else after they have hopefully talked to the courier.  

No wonder all I've been getting is junk mail and one or two bills!!! EEEKKKK!!!! Ahh..nothing like the efficiency of a government ran agency!

Yes, I'm bitter. I don't have a rent check because of them!
