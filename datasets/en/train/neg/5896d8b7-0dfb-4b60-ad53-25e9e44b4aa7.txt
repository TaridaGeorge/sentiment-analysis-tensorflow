Beware of the minute clinic.  Paid copay and bought $30 in over the counter drugs because they told me I had a bad head cold. A week later and a visit to an actual doctor and they said I had a sinus infection, ear infection, and pink eye. I told them about my minute clinic experience and they laughed and said they see people all the time getting awful care from clinics like this.  Total waste of time and money.
