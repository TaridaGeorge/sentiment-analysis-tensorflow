My son and his family arrived into Scottsdale Tuesday April 10 on there way to California. We decided to eat at RnR before they continued there trip.  My son and my wife ordered a hamburger and fries. The fries had no taste and my son asked for two new orders. My grandchildren ate the original fries, while the new fries loaded with Parmesan cheese. The fries were not hot, nor had the cheese melted. I had a few of the fries and did not have as severe a case of food poisoning as my son and my wife. 

I have recommended RnR in the past. I do not think I will in the future.
