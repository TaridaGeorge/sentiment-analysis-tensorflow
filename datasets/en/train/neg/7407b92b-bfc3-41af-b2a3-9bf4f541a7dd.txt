BLARK! The red pepper chicken sandwich I had was disgusting.  No choice of a side, you get a pile of kettle chips.  Food tasted microwaved and if I remember right it came on a styrofoam plate; I couldn't finish it.  I sat at the bar, and although my bartender was nice, going here is like being in an episode of Jersey Shore...the loud conversations going on between the servers and bartenders were annoying and stupid.  The drunk people across the way were really annoying too, but the servers ate it up.  This place is the trailer park of the airport.
