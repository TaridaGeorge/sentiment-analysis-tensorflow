I was really excited to try this place out with my wife.  We both got the Omakase.  Parts of the Omakase meal were good but other parts felt like a lot of sizzle and no steak (i.e. gold flakes left and right).  For the two of us, each with a couple drinks, our bill was in the neighborhood of $200.

Service was fine.  

However, my wife and I both developed serious food poisoning that night, which lingered for 24 hours with me.  I eat sushi often and have never had this experience.  Food poisoning happens but what really got my undies in a wad was that I wrote a polite email to the restaurant and never heard a peep back (for the record, I didn't ask for a refund or anything, I just informed them that we developed food poisoning from their food).  In my book, that's just unforgivable.
