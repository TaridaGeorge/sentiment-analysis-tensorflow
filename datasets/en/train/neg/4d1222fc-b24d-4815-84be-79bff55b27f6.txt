I was a customer since 1998, for two of those years I had full service accounts, (phone, Internet, Cable) in two cities.  Their regular price increases, coupled with my frustration while attempting to negotiate a reasonable bundled price, led me to finally jump ship.  I didn't want to go through the hassle of changing e-mail and linked accounts, but comparable services from their competitor saves me 75.00 a month.
