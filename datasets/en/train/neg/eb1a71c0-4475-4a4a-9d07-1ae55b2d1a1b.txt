I just moved here about a month ago and everyone said "You have to get an In-N-Out burger".  I was really digging "Whataburger" but I decided to try this place out.  I should have just stayed away.  I had to wait in the drive through for about 15 minutes and my double burger was tiny, cold and raw in the middle.  Not pink or slightly under cooked but raw with an odd char on the outside.  The fries were half burnt and reminded me of "Potato Sticks" from when I was a kid, but not nearly as good.  I let my dog have some of it because it was so gross and it made him sick for 2 days.

I'll just stick with "Whataburger" or even McDonald's. I have no idea why this place would ever get a 5 Star review.
