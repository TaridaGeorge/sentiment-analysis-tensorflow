This is the fourth time I have stayed here. I got a killer price from Priceline, so, I don't know if that played a part in the rude behavior I experienced, but my treatment was unwelcoming, to say the least.
 When we checked in Jose was unfriendly and did not listen to my requests. When we checked out I was almost in tears by the way the person behind the desk acted.
I have another reservation there in January and I'm not looking forward to going there.
If it was because I got such a good price on Priceline then I suggest they NOT accept my offer next time or treat all clients equally.
I live on Mulholland Drive in Bel Air, CA, so I don't think I am a slouch!
