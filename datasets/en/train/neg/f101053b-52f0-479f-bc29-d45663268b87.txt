Very high pressured sales. Did not enjoy my experience here. I've been drinking tea for years and have never been pressured into buying so much. I had to tell the guy "no" 6 times! I came in to sample a few and maybe spend $20... I go to checkout with a $49 tab! I should have just said no but to avoid a scene I just paid it, ugh! Walked out and got really pissed thinking back on it. Won't be back for sure! Frustrating... This tea better be good!
