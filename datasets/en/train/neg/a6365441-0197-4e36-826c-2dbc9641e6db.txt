I really, really want to like this place with every ounce of my heart. It's close to the library, next to Bunky and across from the art museum. What is not to like?

-- No sugar free syrups.
None. Nada. Ziltch.
-- No taking plastic.
You have GOT to be kidding right? Oh, you only take cash? Forget it.
-- No custom drinks.
I wanted a vanilla latte. They would NOT make it. They would only make their "honey vanilla latte"... my friend wanted syrup in her espresso over ice... no to that too. Maybe we went on the wrong day, at least, I would like to think that is why.

To top it off, they seem really small. Perhaps I am being overly critical but the only appeal is they are open a bit later than most coffee houses on the weekend.
