From the time you walk into this place - the hostess was running at about .25 speed. We got Myke with a "y" as our server. the interaction with Myke and then his manager were that of people that don't even care. Service is horrible!

I can't believe with 14,000,000 out of work Chili's Too can't find better employees. We left and I won't go back on my frequent trip through Phoenix. Oaxaca across the way had excellent Carne Asada Tacos!
