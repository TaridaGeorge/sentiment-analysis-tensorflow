Curiosity Killed The Cat?  Your Damn right it did and it wasted my gas!!

I was curious, I'd never heard of Steve and Barry's, I figured it would be a cheap way to get out of buying school clothes for my 8Th grader.
Shame on all you who hyped this place up.

It's like the Big Lots-MacFrugals-Pic-N-Save  version of Old Navy.

Not one single thing I would ever buy for myself or anyone else.....EVER!

Complete and total CRAP!! 

Boo Sarah Jessica Parker and Amanda Bynes for putting your name on TOTAL  SHIT!

Well it least it wasn't a total loss we headed over to Pac Sun and loaded up on 2 bags full of the cutest new school clothes! Way Cool!
