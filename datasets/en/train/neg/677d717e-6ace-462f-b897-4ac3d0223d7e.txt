Just read CP's review and I must add my ditto to the 1 star rating.  Of late, I have also been disappointed with the baked goods at La Grande.  Particularly the TC sweets.  After my last visit, where the coffee cake was dried out and what I thought to be "old" and the 1/2 frozen cup cake, I said no more.  
I didn't even try to return it, because I felt the superiority vibe of the place and figured they don't need me or my dollars.  The only item they offer that is unique is the english muffins.  Sorry not enough in my book to bother with.
