Wow!  If being trendy equated to a five star MEAL experience then this place would have been off the charts!!  I agree the bread and pesto were great, as was the bacon wrapped dates but a neighboring table ordered the fish, sea bass which I normally love, and it stunk so bad it turned my stomach.  I had ordered the prawns in risotto and was hoping they wouldn't smell, but alas, they did. I couldn't eat them so I tried my honey's lasagna but it was greasy. So....not real impressed. The decor was amazing, the music was bumping but I was there to eat and it didn't happen. 
Yelp...you swung and missed. Maybe next time.
