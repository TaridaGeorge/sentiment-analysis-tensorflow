This place is close to my house.  The wash is nothing special.  The service is the worst.  The final straw is that my friend bought a $125 gift certificate for me.  Turns out it has an expiration date within 30 days.  I went in a few days later than that (she didn't mention and I didn't notice the expiration) and they would not honor it.  

I would advise using this place as a last resort and NEVER give them any money before they perform the service.  They are going to look for an excuse to keep your money.
