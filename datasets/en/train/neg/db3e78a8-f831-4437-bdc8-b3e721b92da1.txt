Worst place ever! First time I came here for my contact lens fitting appointment I had to wait 1 hr + and that was with an appointment. No apologies from the staff for the long wait either. Second time I went to finalize my prescription I told the doctor about how the contacts didn't feel right, I couldn't see very clearly. I've been wearing contacts for years. Discovered that on top of all the waiting the doctor and staff are incompetent because they incorrectly ordered my contacts for me and changed my -2.75 prescription to a +2.75.  Do not go here! They suck! This is for the location at 4280 E Indian School.
