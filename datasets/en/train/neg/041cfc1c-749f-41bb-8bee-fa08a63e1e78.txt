Just called to get an estimate on roof damage from the wind.  Receptionist asked if I was already a customer.  I said no.  She said they no longer accept new customers because they are so overbooked from the hail storm back in October.  Well sucks for you cause I needed an entire new roof people!  Would steer clear of them.
