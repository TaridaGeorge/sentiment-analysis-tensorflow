Absolutely horrible customer service. They lost a key to a vacant house delivery and the owners son was immediately defensive and rude, and offered no resolution to the problem. Do not buy from these people. They could care less if something happens to you or your order. As long as your check clears of course. Always avoid this place, unless you like being treated like s#@t.
