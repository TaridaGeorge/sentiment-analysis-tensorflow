If you're looking for a place to party, the Indigo has a kick-ass business center.

That is, the business center shares (cramped) space with the hotel's small lobby bar, so while you're applying the masterful finishing touches to that crucial power point presentation (i.e. surfing for midget porn), you can simultaneously chat up whoever is responding to emails on the workstation next to you, perhaps even exchange business cards over an expensive cocktail.

Also, the ramp up to their parking lot out back is known to eat cars (sorry Kev).

Whack.
