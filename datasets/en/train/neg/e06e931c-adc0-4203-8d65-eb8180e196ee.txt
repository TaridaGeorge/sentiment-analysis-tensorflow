The pizza and service sucks here The cheese has no flaver and the pizza sauce reminds me somthing that you get out of a can and the crust was tough and reminded me of store bought..... The staff were unhelpfull and rude. The crzyiest thing was when were were going to take our left over pizza home the took our left overs and put them in a fricking paper bag yea a bag not a pizza box. I could only laugh and ask them "wow  you trying to save money on not using pizza boxes??? AS we walked out the bag was sucking up the grease i just left it by there door. I was so pist don't go there frozen pizza is better.
