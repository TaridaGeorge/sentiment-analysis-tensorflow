I've been a good customer at Fletcher's and when my 2002 Explorer wasn't handling properly I took it in. I told them that I was tight on funds and just wanted things made right as inexpensively as possible. They told me I needed new struts all around and new control arms.  $1700+.
I took it to a friend and he pointed out that the control arms are fine (he showed me how to tell) and he pointed out that the rear struts are strong (there was no excess rocking or bounce!).
I did some research and he was right!
I ordered the front struts and installed them myself for $240.
Thanks Fletcher's for your crap estimate.
I won't be back.
