Just for the record, It has been almost 30 days since Home Depot publicly said they would "look into it". Not a peep.

I have since out of habit pulled into the parking lot twice and once even got almost to the door before I realized what I was doing. I got back in the car and went to Ace Hardware once and to Lowes the other time. Not a lot of money about $100.

Bathroom cabinet, sink, counter top, toilet etc. In September. Just not from Home Depot.
