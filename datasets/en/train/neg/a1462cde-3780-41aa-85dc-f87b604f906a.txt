Good Heavens, I don't care how great the rating on hold for 15 minutes the first time then when I had time to call again it was another 20 minutes and nobody answers the line.....

I can appreciate taking your time with each person and I was excited to see Dr. Kouhri is there but I cant sit on hold all day waiting for them to decide when to acknowledge a phone call.  

I dont know if they are having phone issues or just that overwhelmed.  In any case, they cant help me today.
