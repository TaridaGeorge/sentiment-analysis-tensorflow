We usually do not have issues here and figured it was a safe bet for a quick decent dinner.  Boy were we wrong!  The service was decent but our food took well over an hour to get to the table.  I should put a disclaimer here that we have a toddler and long waits can be difficult for us all.  When the food finally showed up my tri-tip was really fatty and tough, my hubby's food was lukewarm.  The manager came by but only to tell us that they couldn't find our Landry's card in the system.  We were not expecting anything free but an apology for the wait would have been nice.  I will say that we will not be returning to any Claim Jumper restaurants..Landry's has ruined this place.
