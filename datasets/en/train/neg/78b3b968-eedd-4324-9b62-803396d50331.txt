i had synlawn installed their artificial lawn only 2 months ago in my backyard through lowes, I paid about $5000 for materials and installation. weeds are going through it already 2 months after installation. imagine what happens when it is out of warranty in a year, what am i going to do with all the weeds with roots under the artificial lawn. with real grass, you can pull it, with artificial lawn you can't. the purpose of having artificial lawn is no maintenance, it is worse than no artificial lawn. i have never seen weeds on neighbours' and other peoples' artificial lawn before, this is ridiculous.
