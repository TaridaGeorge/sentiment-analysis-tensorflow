Went in after along day of work to get a good pizza.. After watching the employees eat food with their fingers and not washing their hands after turned me off.. But thats not it..they had their own drinks on the same counter where the pizza crust lays..who knows what is on the bottom of those cups.. Dont even want to give them a star..so gross waste of 25 dollars cause we threw the pizza  away..
