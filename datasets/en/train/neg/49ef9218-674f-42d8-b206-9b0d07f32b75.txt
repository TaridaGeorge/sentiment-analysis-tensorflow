Have been to  El Chorro's many times in the past but always outdoors or at the bar. Went with good friends on Xmas Eve and had some of the worst service ever. It's not like they don't know what to expect on a holiday. Everyone had a reservation and the menu was fixed. Nevertheless, the service was painfully slow (we were there over 3 hours). They made numerous mistakes. They couldn't keep our wine or water glasses full. They even claimed to have run out of potatoes. Really!?

You're a Phoenix icon; not a fly by night franchise. Get it together.
