The W Scottsdale is trying so hard to be hip and swanky it ignores the basic reason why we go to hotels - to sleep.  If you're traveling on business and need to actually sleep, skip the W.  I had a room near the pool bar, where they crank music until 2 am on weeknights.  I called guest services several times, asking if the music (or at least the bass) could be turned down.  Requests were ignored, and it was a sleepless night.
