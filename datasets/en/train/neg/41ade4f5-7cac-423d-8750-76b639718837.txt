I went here twice and the food was good but a little expensive for the size. The first time I paid cash but the second time I used a brand new debitt card I never used anywhere before.The cashier said that the machine wasn't working right and like a dummy I let her wright down the number. The next morning I got a call from Chase fraud prevention it seems someone had tried to use my card # at 5 differn't places within hours after my visit to Americas Taco Shop. This was a brand new card and Americas Taco shop was the only place I ever used it and within hours I get someone trying to use my card now this tells me they are crooks or have a few crooks working for them. I will never go here again and if you do only use cash!!
