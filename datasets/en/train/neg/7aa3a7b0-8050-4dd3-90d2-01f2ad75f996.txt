Just wanted to write an update after receiving a call from Larry the manager.  He stated that he did not mean to deceive me at all.  But that he is old school and that in his olden days - all the belts are replaced at 100K and that it was their suggestion to replace it before it broke.  I told him that Camelback Toyota looked at the belt and told me that it was in perfect condition.  Larry then said, "well I am sure they charged you to remove the hood to look at it" and I said, No, they actually gave me a free safety inspection after hearing how Just Brakes was just trying to get money out of me.  So nothing was resolved.  I would still never bring another car there again.
