HORRIBLE!   Pretentious, over-priced, poor quality food, terrible service.  Complete waste of money.  

When I went with three friends the other night - we were greeted by no fewer than six people at the front.  The "manager's" are walking around this Mastro's copy... with earpieces like they are at some fancy club in NYC or Vegas.  They are useless.  We waited almost an hour to place our order.  The food and service would have been better at ANY Chipotle Grill.  

Also... the music!!  Hello??  80's rock with lyrics in a fine dining room?  

Do NOT GO!!  Atrocious!!
