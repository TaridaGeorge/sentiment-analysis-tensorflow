The only reason for the 1 star is that Ellie's has closed.  I'm getting a complex.  I review, they close.  I dug through my files to find their card hoping to be able to call Ellie so she could whip me up my shredded beef burrito or at least share her recipe with me!  No luck, the number was disconnected- so if any of you know Ellie- please have her send me a message!
