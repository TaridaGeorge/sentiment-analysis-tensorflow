After reading all of the other reviews, I can't help but think that I hit this place up on an off night.(?) My bf ordered some kind of chicken, that was fried and served with a clear sauce.  It was o.k.  I ordered a scallop dish, and honestly, the sauce just smelled like something that was spoiled.  It was not edible.  I am Asian, I have consumed all sorts of things, so it was not the smell of the seafood, or anything like that.  I have eaten Chinese in Hawaii, Japan and California.  I do not consider myself a chinese food snob, as I have been known to eat at Panda Express on occasion.  I really wanted to like this place, but I couldn't.  Even the eggrolls were bad.I cannot comment on the service, as we had take-out.   Sorry,  Golden Gate....
