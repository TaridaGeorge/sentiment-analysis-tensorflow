Wife and I had dinner on sat, April 30. I ordered the organic chicken with shrooms . This is a signature dish and she ordered the beef short rib dinner with Mac and cheese. Well the chicken was like med rare beef, pink and oozing pink juice. Not good. Sent back to kitchen and came back, kinda medium, still pink near the bone. Sent back again and manager came out and said what can we do, so I ordered the tuna which was good. Wife's short rib was not what I am used to for short ribs. No falling off the bone here. Just chunks of beef that was kinda dry and overcooked. Like brisket really. 

So not to good a first experience. As I tell everyone, if you want good chicken, check out Banderra in Scottsdale. They set the standard for all chicken in the valley. Sooo good.
