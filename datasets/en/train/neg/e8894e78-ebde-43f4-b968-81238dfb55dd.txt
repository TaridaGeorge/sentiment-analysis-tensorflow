Lord was the service bad. Yes, it was one of those places. It took the waitress over 20 minutes and 4 requests to get us a little balsamic vinaigrette. Seriously, I mean, come on. And you then come and tell me that no one could find it ? Like really? 

So that was the beginning of the end. When the waitress rolled her eyes in displeasure at us not getting wine the mood was set and there really was no coming back up. The service continued to be appalling.. at best. 

The food was ok. yea, just ok. Nothing to rave about. Even then it would have got 3-4 stars if the dining experience was pleasant. Avoid if you are going to unwind after a long day.
