We stopped by this bar after Rainbow Festival; the straight bartender was not friendly. We later found out he was their lead bartender. 

We bought 2 buds and 2 Bloody Marys, and he charged us for $20. We asked him how much of the Bloody Mary, and he said it was $6. That means a bottle of bud is $4. 

That's fine, but after we asked about the price he charged, he became really nasty to us. If you want to go there, better don't ask how much they charged you. 

Also, if you pay with credit card, you better make sure they don't charge you more than you drink. This happened to another friend that went with us. He only ordered one drink, but was charged for two.

We will never go back, that bar is not in a good area anyway.
