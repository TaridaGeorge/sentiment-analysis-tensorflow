Absolutely NO reason to go back. Food is bland and the portions are small especially compared to the prices, and the place itself wasn't even that tidy. As another reviewer stated, they nickel and dime you for everything. No free refills on soft drinks.... REALLY?!?!? From the reviews, it looks like this place might have been good at one time but not any more. There's so many other decent Chinese restaurants to visit that this place must surely be on it's last leg. My advice is..... AVOID!!!!
