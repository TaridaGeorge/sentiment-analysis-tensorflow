I really hate to do this, but I just can't say anything good about Wong's Jr.  I ordered Take Out last weekend from here, and I was really hoping this place would be good.  Sad to say, it wasn't.  We had 'Spicy' Orange Chicken, Shrimp Chowmein, and Egg Rolls.  The Chicken wasn't spicy at all.  Whatever kick was in it must have been forgotten to be added.  As for the Chowmein, it was terrible.  Sprouts and celery sitr-fried with a bag of canned crispy noodles.  The Egg Rolls were 'meh' at best, and the rice....well, it was just white rice.  I am not really sure what's going on here, but it appears that people either love this place or hate it.  For those who love it, I wonder if you have ever had really good Chinese before.
