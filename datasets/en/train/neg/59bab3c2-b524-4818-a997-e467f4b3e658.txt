Where do I begin....no one was in the places when we arrived. Not that it matters but sometimes it makes me wonder if no one is here is the food really that good? We ordered the food - chicken tortellini, Italian Hero, and kids cheese pizza. After telling the order taker 3 times what we wanted she still rang it up wrong. We proceeded to our table and waited about 5-10 mins for our food well some of it anyway. Pizza & tortellini arrive but not my sub. Everything is premade or frozen food. Nothing fresh! I waited about 10 mins more for my sub then had to remind them. Needless to say we left after a few bites of my "bread" sandwich. Probably won't be back here again!!! Oh ya all for $28!
