I had heard very good things about Noca, and was sadly let down.  The food was ok, but very overpriced.  The mussels were tasty, everything else was sub par.  

The kicker for the night is we had a question for the manager about our bill and apparently it was a bad day for him and we were practically escorted out of the restaurant.  I dine out several times a week and have never been treated so badly.  Needless to say I will not be heading back to Noca nor recommending to any friends of mine.  

What a shame.  I love trying new food in Phoenix and loved the atmosphere, but a bad attitude from management and overpriced food will keep me from coming back.
