the nails look great. the people are nice. but omg no scrub barely any lotion water not that hot TOTALLY overcharged me 50 dollar pedicure because they added 20 bucks for french and design.....ADDED to the 32 dollars. i was so disappointed. they also didnt use a scrub and the place smelt like horrible nailpolish and my nails smelt bad, no nice lotions or scrubs or ANYTHING!!!!!! but it was clean that was my biggest criteria.

Just realized they overcharged me here on the bill. DO NOT EVER GO HERE THEY SUCK AND I CANT GO COMPLAIN BECAUSE I DONT LIVE in the area so I am really mad.
