Still open under a new name, can't remember what it is. Haven't been there in 30 years. Used to be a place for Indians to drink until they fell down. Lots of 400 pound Indian women looking for a man. Very nasty. Had one beer there and saw a guy get knifed. Never went back. The culture here is so diverse, the liberals must love it. I'm sure the place with a new name is still the same.
