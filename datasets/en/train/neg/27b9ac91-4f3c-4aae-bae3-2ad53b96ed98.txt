My first time at Jimmy John's was today. The best thing I can say about this sandwich shop is that they have that good, crunchy ball ice. 

SERIOUSLY! That was the only good thing about this place.

The sandwiches were bland and didn't even have all the ingredients that the menu stated they came with and there was no options of a healthier wheat bread versus the white bread. How bad was it? I only managed to eat 1/4 of this tasteless sandwich.

I don't like Subway, but Subway far exceeds Jimmy John's.

You want a real sandwich? Go to Cheba Hut.
