Garbage! I wish I had never gone in here. Their food tastes like it cost pennies to make but they charge you plenty $$. Their staff is absolutely useless but maybe that is because they are all students. 

Be prepared to wait a long time for your drinks, appetizer and entree. Be prepared to have people walk by you without asking if you need anything, or you can stay away  and save your money. You will be disappointed...guaranteed!
