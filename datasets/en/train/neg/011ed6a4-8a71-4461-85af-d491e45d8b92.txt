"Customer service" interpreted by teen-aged mall employees = apathetic and barely a transaction.  

"Coffee" interpreted by Paradise = barely a step up from awful.

Why does this enormous mall not have decent coffee in more findable/convenient locations?  Nobody should have to beg for swill from reluctant youths.
