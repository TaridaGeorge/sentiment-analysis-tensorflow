Dear Breadfruit.  May we suggest one small business decision--when your customers tell you they can't eat the food because it's so incredibly OVER spiced, and beg for something to "cut" the heat, do not--may I repeat--DO NOT charge them for a tablespoon of chutney that comes in a tiny dish.  
     And while we're at it, when a customer can't eat the over-acidy and untasty, messy coleslaw, and can't eat the main dish, and has devoured the one-eight piece of corn that passes a vegetable, do not--may I repeat, DO NOT charge for a second tiny piece of corn.
    So sorry, we won't be back.
