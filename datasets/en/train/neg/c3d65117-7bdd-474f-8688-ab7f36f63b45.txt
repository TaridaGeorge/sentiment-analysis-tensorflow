US Airways has to be the most god awful airline to fly with. Forget checking in any bags if you want to save money, because they with charge you an arm and a leg if you have extra. Every time I have flown with them my flight is usually delayed due to some mechanical issue, I know big fun right? Their flight attendants are not my favorite either, they usually have some sort of bossy attitude on top of being a little lazy. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.
