Ive taken 2 of my vehicles to them for oil changes, after that, they BOTH started leaking oil! And 1 developed (very quickly) a leaky power steering hose, I had a shop I went to for years & never had any problems like this, but once i moved to chandler I had to find someone else, I will definitely keep looking!
the owner, when i tried to voice my concerns said "Im already in a bd mood today I dont need this"
