Buffalo wild wings to me is like RA. Great atmosphere and service, but crappy food. I ordered twelve hot wings and a beer. We'll get to the beer in a minute. The wings were super greasy, like soaked in cooking oil. They were more sweet than hot, they tasted like they were dipped in sugar. The ranch was mayo with seasoning, and even had the same consistency as such. It was overall gross. I asked the difference in cost between a bud lite and a kiltlifter. The guy said, bud is $3 four a tall, and $4 for a kilt, as I began to order a kilt he verbally changed the price to $5.50. I will not return.
