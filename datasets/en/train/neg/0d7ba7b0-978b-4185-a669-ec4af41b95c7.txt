Customer Service is NOT a priority at this place. Cashier had 0 respect for  an HISPANIC MALE, who happens to be US Citizen, & YES, he knew he was in a Mex Foods place. They DO NOT have the same menu items as all the other Filibertos across the valley. Our daughter just wanted chicken nuggets & fries, which all the other Filibertos offer, along with the small grape soda. Corporate Office said the manager would call to apologize; he never made that call. Me thinks they should watch the old Lily Tomlin videos on CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING and RESPECT for ELDERS.
