Horrible service!!! Had to get up to get my own water refill, wasabi, & ginger. Management was watching the Laker's game the whole time we were eating dinner. Our waiter disappered for 40 minutes. When we asked the bus boy for more water he refused to get it. I waited 40 minutes for my 6 pieces of sashmi. 
Overall management is out to lunch. Servers are rude and easily annoyed. 
The only positive was Chris behind the sushi bar. I hopes he moves onto a better establishment where he will earn more money!! 
Do NOT go here!!!
