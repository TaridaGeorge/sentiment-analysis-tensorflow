This place smelled like a urinal! The service was unwelcoming and unfriendly. There are no longer $5 martini's or $5 manicures on Monday. If it wasn't  the horrible over priced pineapple wine, or the unprofessional staff that pushed me out the door before getting a 3rd sip in, it was definitely the horrible stench! The outside of the bathroom smelt worse then the inside of the bathroom. WTF? They should allow smokers to puff inside to kill that smell! Don't waste your time here. It's over priced cocktails with sad service.  I wish some one would have warned me.
