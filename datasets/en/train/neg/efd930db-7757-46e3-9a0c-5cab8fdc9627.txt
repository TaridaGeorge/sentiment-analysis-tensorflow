Not the best Apple Store location isn't the idea that I could look before buying?  Every time I visited this location they were closed or closing.  I bathe everyday,  I have a job,  I am not homeless and had the funds to buy.  It took three years and I had to buy my iPod online and there is now an Arrowhead store where I am allowed to touch the merchandise and ask many questions.  Boo to you mister young manager who asked the third salesman if he was busy while he was showing me headphones.
