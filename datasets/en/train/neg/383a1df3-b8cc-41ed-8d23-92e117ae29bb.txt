Sorry gang...still can't recommend this place.  My reputation is on the line and I gotta be honest,  if I ever tell you go to this place; please forgive me.  I enjoy the atmosphere, but service is still lacking.  I've been a server and the last thing I want my customers to do is to chase me down.  If I start feeling like I've been a burden to you then my visit is just not worth it.  

I do enjoy the food -- the Udon noodle is good, but there wasn't any of the Japanese beer left for me to order.  Apparently, they ran out - but don't tell me you can't order more.  In today's market and economy I'm sure if you want it, you can get it.  Orion & Asahi is good, but I can get those anywhere.  -- Enjoy (I think)
