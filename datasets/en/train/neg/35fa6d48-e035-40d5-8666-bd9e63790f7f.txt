Horrible experience. We had a home emergency which forced us to move out for 15 days. We referred to them by a friend. We explained to them we're Seniors on limited income but assured them they'd be paid in full. We paid the medical and our insurance co verbally told them that once the bill was submitted they would be paid.  But, No, No, NO!!!!  "Not our policy"  They were holding our two kids for ransom!!!

Horrible, uncaring staff to deal with.
