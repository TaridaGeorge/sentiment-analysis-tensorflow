After seeing such glowing reviews, we had no hesitation heading over here for post-dinner caffeination. We ordered a dirty chai and a skim latte. Sadly, the espresso is overroasted and lackluster. I didn't make it past the first few desperate sips. I rarely turn away espresso, but even I can't stomach a burned, watery latte. The chai was overly sweet and unbalanced as well. I wanted to like this place as it has a charming atmosphere, but I don't think I will be back.
