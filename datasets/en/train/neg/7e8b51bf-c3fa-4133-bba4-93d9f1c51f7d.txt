I had ordered gift baskets for my family in Phoenix several times from this store. My last order ensured that I will never do it again. The wine and cheese basket I sent for my sister's birthday never arrived. When I finally got a hold of someone who could explain, he told me that someone spaced it. I also received a couple half-assed apologies. Awful customer service.
