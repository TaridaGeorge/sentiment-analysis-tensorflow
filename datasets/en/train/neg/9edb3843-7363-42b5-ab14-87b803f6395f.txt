Too expensive.

$5 dollar beers, $15 access to VIP section, then $20 for a 2 minute lap dance. With her only sitting on me 3 times.

Over 4 years ago i went to a strip club near the airport (can't remember the name of the club) and i got a close contact lap dance for 40 minutes for a total of $80 with tip. The woman had a C section scar but still looked good.

Can someone please tell me which strip club has better prices?
