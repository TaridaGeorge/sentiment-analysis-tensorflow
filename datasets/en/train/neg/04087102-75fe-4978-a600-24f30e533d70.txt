Oh south tempe how u disappoint. This may be the highest yelp-rated neighborhood joint but only because SoTempe's standards are so low. Worthless waitress who knew nothing about the otherwise impressive beer list. 10$ short vodka drink for the wife (more than Scottsdale). Awful soup with watered-down bbq sauce as the broth.  Bitter caesar salad. Flatbread was passable only bc it tasted like the trader joes ingredients I buy myself.  Great playlist but volume at 1 to appease all the gray hairs in the joint (on a Saturday night at 8:00).  Only part of "gastropub" this place has right is the beer list.
