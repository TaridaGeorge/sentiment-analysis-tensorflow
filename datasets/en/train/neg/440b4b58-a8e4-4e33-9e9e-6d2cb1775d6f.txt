Okay, it wasn't THAT bad.  As others mention, Counter Girl was a little icy: didn't greet us when we walked in, didn't thank us after our order, didn't ask if we'd like fries w/ that. 

Burgers were okay, and came w/ a small, floppy pickle.  

Of the 25 or so words illuminated on the somewhat tacky sign that serves as the cramped, modern/minimalist restaurant's only art, warm was the only that could be applied to the main course.  Not lip-smacking, or delicious.  Warm.

Moderate outdoor seating area off to the side.  Wheelchair accessible w/ minimal finagling.  Pricing comparable to the Carl's Jr $6 burger.

Definitely wouldn't recommend it to a friend, but it wasn't the worst place I've ever eaten.
