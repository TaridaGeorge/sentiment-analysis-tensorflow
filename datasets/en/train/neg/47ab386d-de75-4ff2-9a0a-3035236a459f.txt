I've heard about this place for the past 3 years since I moved into the area, and only tried it the other day. It's okay and overrated in my opinion. The food is mediocre, the potatoes suck, and everything tasted pretty stale to me. Soggy and stale and expensive could describe my meal. We had the cheese omlette, sweet potato fries, biscuits and gravy, and brought coffeecake and butter cookies back. I tasted some of everything but the cheese omlette which was my order was really greasy and nothing special. Everything all together was $30 but more than half the food was left on our plates we didn't even want to save it. I will be ordering my omlettes from Dennys or IHOP from now on.
