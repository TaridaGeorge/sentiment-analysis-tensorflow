DON'T EAT HERE ! This place was so dark! I couldn't read the menu! I asked both the waiter and the manager if we could turn up the lights and they just said no. They brought me a flashlight to read the menu!  Stupid and just plain silliness. The guy and his girlfriend had to get out their phones to read the menu.  
We walked out.

**NOTICE** the trending details for this place has gone down dramatically over the past 4 months.  What does that say!!  Service sucks.

** NOTICE** One of the reviews mentions that there was a COCKROACH just not once but TWICE in someone's salad. Health department needs to come out to this place.
