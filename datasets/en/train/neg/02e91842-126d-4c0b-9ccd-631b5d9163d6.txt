Really people?

Maybe the meat dishes here are good. That's the only way I can understand why this place has such a large customer base.

Initially, I was excited to see a Vegetarian section on their menu with about 6 items on it.  We got one dish with tofu & vegetables, and another dish with vermicelli and fake pork.  The tofu dish tasted like it was cooked in fish sauce, and aside from it not being truly "vegetarian," the tofu was awful and the wheat gluten meat is something you can buy in a can.  The other noodle dish was so bland that we had to add FOUR different sauces to it, just to give it some kind of flavor. 

I will give them props for being cheap...but we definitely will not be returning here. 

Oh, and their parking lot reeked of trash-juice-smell.
