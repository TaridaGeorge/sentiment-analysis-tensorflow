Went in for a pedicure, decent job.  Nice and clean.  Prices are strange. FYI they charge extra for the scrub it's 5 bucks but I recommend it, felt great!  Nothing stands out as amazing but nothing was bad.

My mom went with me got a pedi and mani cuticals on nails were cut to short. Toe nails were cut really short to the point of hurting her.
