I HATE JACK IN THE CRACK...the only time I can eat here is if I've been drinking and everyone in the car is craving it. Not like I got a say I never drink and drive :) so when we all pull up my drunken ass orders something. 

THIS PARTICULAR jack just is horrible!!!! The past 3 times!!! Drinks get mixed up...fries are missing...tomatos are there when they shouldn't...foods cold...forget my sauce for the eggrolls :( ya don't judge i tried the eggrolls and they were horrible and dry. And it's really hard to make eggrolls taste bad ,but jack in the box sure was able to do it.
