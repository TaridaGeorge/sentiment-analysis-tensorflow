Terrible.  

I remember when Scottsdale Clubs were a bit classy and at a minimum had a dress code.  We went to Suede last night for a bachelorette party. When did it become appropriate to wear baggy jeans, and side ways caps?  This club was jam packed, and seriously a fire escapae hazzard to say the least. 

The highlight of the night was the boucers tossing a chick who fought with her Pimp boyfriend while he continued to swagger back into the bar. 

Is this what the economy has driven us to?
