Good chips and salsa.

Yup. That's about it for the positives. 

We came in for lunch and the hostess couldn't be bothered to crack a smile at us or any of the other patrons. After we were seated, we were brought chips and salsa, which we happily dove into. When I got the egg, cheese, and chorizo burro I ordered, it just looked ill. And then I could only taste the bland, dry chorizo in it, no egg or cheese in the slightest. I dunked it in the red sauce it was covered in just to make it a little more flavorful, but to no avail. When we were ready for the check, our waitress disappeared. For a long time. 

Not worth my time.
