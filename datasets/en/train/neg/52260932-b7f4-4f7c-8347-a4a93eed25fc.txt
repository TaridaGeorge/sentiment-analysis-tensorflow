Amanda Turner is a thief and a con artist. We hired her to take care of our dogs and she took the mony we left for her and never came back. We had to have a lock smith gain access to our home and had a friend take our severely dehydrated dogs that had no food or water for almost three days to the vet for emergency medical treatment. We also discoverd upon returning hat she had also stolen items that she thought we would not notice. What she never knew was that our home has video surveillance and caught her not only not showing up to take care of our dogs but stealing from us. DO NOT USE HER  Amanda's Pet Sitting - AZ
