I purchased carpet for three bedrooms from this Home Depot location.  We moved all of the furniture as well as the built in shelving in one walk in closet. The problem I had with them is the installation.  Two young guys did the install and one of them was new to installation.  They scraped my painted walls, damaged my baseboards, and cut the pad too short so that I now have a flat dip into each room.  Home Depot contracts out the work, these are not their employees doing install.  I imagine they go with the lowest bidder.  I will never use them again.
