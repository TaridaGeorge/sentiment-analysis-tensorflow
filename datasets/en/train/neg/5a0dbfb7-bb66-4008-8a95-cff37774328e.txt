Horrible store! Not very clean, rude employees and don't take your car there for an oil change. I waited two hours after they told me 45 minutes only to find out that they never did it. They said my drain plug was over tightened and they wouldn't touch it. The funny thing is, I had my oil changed at the other walmart on 83rd and buckeye the time before. I can change my own oil but it's not worth it to save 20 bucks and to have someone who is supposed to be able to work on a car say they can't get the bolt off is completely pathetic. This was just one of my fun experiences at good old walmart, but I keep going back for the people watching I guess.
