This place is downright awful. I've never understood the dive bar, would it hurt to make a place look nice and not gross and creepy? It wouldn't cost that much. The layout was terrible, the entrance is right next to the stage and there's barely any room in front of the stage. What shocked me the most is that it was rated Phoenix's best venue last year. I'm sorry Phoenix, but if this is the best you have to offer, you need some new venues.
