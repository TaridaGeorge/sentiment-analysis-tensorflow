Save yourself an unpleasant eating and drinking experience and avoid this place.

My partner and I ordered the french dip sandwiches - they arrived dry and plain.  Our drink order took at least 20 minutes to arrive even though there were only a few tables with customers.  The drinks seemed watery.

We sat on a warm afternoon without having our waters replenished once.

There are too many negatives to even consider giving this place a second chance.
