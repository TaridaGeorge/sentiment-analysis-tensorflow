What do you get when you mix the smell of mold with the smell of 6-month-old sweat? This 24 Hour Fitness location

I started to feel ill after only 10 minutes of breathing in that horrible smell!

Everything from the stationary bikes to the sanitizer dispensers are in disrepair.

I hope to be updating my review soon with more stars, but things are only getting worse at this juncture.
