I took my son in for a cut here because I wanted to try them out and use one of the coupons they left at Kidspark. The stylist did not bother to wash his hair like the coupon stated was part of the service. Then, she cut his hair way shorter on the sides than I asked for with the clippers and scissor cut the top of his hair too short despite my reminder to not trim too much length because of his cowlick. Now, some of the hair close to the cowlick sticks up if I don't smooth it down with gel. To top it all off, the bangs she trimmed were not even across his forehead, but cut at an angle. Uggh. Perhaps I should have taken a picture for reference? :-( At least I didn't pay the regular haircut price for my kiddo's hair shearing.
