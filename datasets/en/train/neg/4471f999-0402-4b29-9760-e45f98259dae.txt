So I've been back to Rice Paper, and I have no major complaints with the food itself. But that's about it. The service is laughable. I actually said to my dining companions on my last visit (as we were walking to the entrance), "Okay, so we'll order some appetizers which won't come until after the main course, one of the entrees will be incorrect, and they'll rush us out the door like it's a jiffy lube." It was as if I'd written the script for our dining experience. I'm officially done. Which is sad, because the food is pretty good. But i can't take the incompetence. Plus it's really loud. Still.
