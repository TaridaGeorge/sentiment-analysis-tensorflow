This is the worst Sushi restaurant. I guess I never learn because they gave me food poisoning more than once from the eel.

Don't get adventurous here because they'll make you hate all the good stuff that you would enjoy otherwise. One such example is their uni which is not fresh and served in too large a portion.

The service is also terrible. They have a lame attitude and last time I got the caterpillar roll, I told the waiter that it tasted bad so he laughed and walked away not offering to exchange it. I ended up paying for it with part of his tip.

Their rolls are humongous so if you're a glutton who doesn't care about taste, this could be your sushi place. Most rolls contain lots of fake crab.
