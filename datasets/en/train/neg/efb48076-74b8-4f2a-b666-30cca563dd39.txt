Easily the worse course I have played in Phoenix. The round was 5+ hours and the fairways look like a fire had just been put out. The starter was awful and didn't even tell me who I was paired up with and when I was teeing off. There is a reason why the website has a digital flyby and the rate is so cheap. Save yourself the trouble and pay the extra $20 to play a better course.
