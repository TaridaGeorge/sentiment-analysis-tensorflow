Visiting from Seattle we thought we would give this place a try since the location was very handy.  Our appetizer - the Tuscan Cheese Plate - featured grapes that were a good three weeks past prime....pure mush.  Then came the wine:  I had ordered a bottle of 2007 Banfi.  Our server rushed out an already open bottle of wine.  Immediately poured it into the decanter and turned to walk away.  Before she ran off I asked to see the bottle.  It was a 2008 which was wrong but still ok but I still  have never been asked to taste the wine or seen the bottle opened prior to getting to the table.  Who knows what was on that bottle and if it was full??  Food was so-so.  Carbonara was too runny, tortellini too rich, gnocchi too meaty.  Daughter liked her kids meal however.
