Erwin's is disgusting.  The things that should be slightly fried are dripping with oil, and even things that shouldn't be are completely greasy.  Somehow I wind up back here once a year or so.  Someone must like it; they certainly continue to stay in business.

I was going to go on and on, but I just realized that in my head I liken this place to Denny's, and that should say it all.  Amazingly sweet service pushes it up from one to two stars.  The people are wonderful, but the food has needed major work for years.
