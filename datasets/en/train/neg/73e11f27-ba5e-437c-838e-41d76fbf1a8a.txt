All the restaurants I went to in Japan consistently impressed me with their superior quality of service.

Long story short, this pseudo-Japanese joint in Arizona (aka land of where you should be getting mexican food instead) seems to pride itself on consistently shitty service, horrid issue-resolution, and perpetually menopausal waitresses.
