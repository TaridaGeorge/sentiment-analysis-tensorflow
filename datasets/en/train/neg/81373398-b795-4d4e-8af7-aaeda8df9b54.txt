So I went to Lola a few days ago thinking the local coffee shop would be great considering all the people in there. BOOOOY was I wrong. All those "people" in the shop were just pretentious little hipster kids and the staff (one confused looking girl) didn't know ANYTHING about coffee. She was stuck up, non interested and just plain rude. I ordered a large vanilla late and received a medium regular late, no vanilla. It wasn't a friendly place, I felt unwelcome there and I'll NEVER go back or recommend that place. If your looking for a good coffee shop downtown hit up JOBOT, the people are friendly and the drinks are a million times better.
