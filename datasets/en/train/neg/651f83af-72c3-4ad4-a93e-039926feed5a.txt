I think I was in here for 10 mins. The guys that own/work here are idiots. Sorry, but I really don't understand the concept of being rude to customers as a working one if you want to continue your business. Just so strange. Don't know what the food is like, but "d'lish" or not, I would never want to give business to senseless people.
