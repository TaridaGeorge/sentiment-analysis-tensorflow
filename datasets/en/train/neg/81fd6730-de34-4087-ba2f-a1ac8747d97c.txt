The yogurt is good, but the prices are not!  At .45 an ounce, the price of the yogurt and toppings adds up quickly.  Plus, the gargantuan-sized cups are there to trick you into buying more.  I fell for the trick, and wound up with a cup which cost me SIX DOLLARS.  At check-out, I was not offered a loyalty card either, which I see other Yelp reviewers have somehow obtained.  Not impressed, and not going back.
