This place was right off the main street and looked like it might have been promising. The restaurant was decorated in a country style which is ok but it was kind of dingy.  The booths were very worn and it just didn't look well kept. I had the guacamole cheeseburger with fries and it looked like I could have made it from home. The burger was under cooked, the so called cheddar was nothing more than a kraft single and the guacamole tasted like it came out of a bag. The fries looked like they came out of the frozen section from the super market. The food was sad and unimpressive. The service was ok and the people seemed friendly enough. All in all this place was a disappointment and I will be skipping it next time.
