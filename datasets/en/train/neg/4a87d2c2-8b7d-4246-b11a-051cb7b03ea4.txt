Great food I love the encore sandwich but the service is a joke..I am not sure quite what the deal is...but it's like the people behind the counter are bothered by customers...(Indian school location) They just they are too cool and the bankers hours are a joke...! Honestly the sandwiches are good but the "too cool" attitude needs to stop and they need to realize the customers are what keep them in business....
