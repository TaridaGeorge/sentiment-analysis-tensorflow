with the number of nail salons in this world you would think that they would at least try harder to earn your business. i walked in and had to watch her for a minute or two to count the 47 in her hand.  its not hard lady.  then i asked to see their design tips.  she pointed to a shelf with man made tips so i had to ask to see the premise and she said they didn't carry them  im okay with getting either or French but with the lack of hospitality i can find someone who wants to earn my money.  this shop is ran by rude orients.
