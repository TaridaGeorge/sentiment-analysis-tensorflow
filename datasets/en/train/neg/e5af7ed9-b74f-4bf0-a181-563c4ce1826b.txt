This place is awful! the service is barely so so and the food is always over cooked and not worth the price! I went with friends and got the 2 for 20 deal we tried two different kinds of barbecue and hers was so greasy it was running of the plate and my was so dry i could not even eat it. They did take it back and took it off the bill the chips and salsa were the best part of the meal and that was only 3 bucks!
