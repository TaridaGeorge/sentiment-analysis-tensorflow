ever been to dick's last resort? you know, the restaurant we're the servers are intentionally angry and mean because its funny (kinda) and its the theme? well, this should be majerles theme cuz the service is horrid, horrid, horrid. ive never had even mediocre service there. in fact, most of their "servers" seem to lack a pulse...something that should be manditory for the position. how these people survive on tips is beyond me...americans are just generous people i guess.
