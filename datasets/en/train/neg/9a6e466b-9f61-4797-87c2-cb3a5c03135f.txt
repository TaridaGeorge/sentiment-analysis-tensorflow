Dreary, dirty, smelly.  Got off the elevator to see bags of garbage.  Room and linens stank of cigarettes, despite assurances it was a no smoking room.  Not sure linens had been washed. No amenities, not even shampoo.  The staff kindly moved us to a better room which was only available that night.  I might have tolerated that room because the price was right.  But that was not to be.  No other effort beyond that was made to help us. Left at six in the am and would never return.
