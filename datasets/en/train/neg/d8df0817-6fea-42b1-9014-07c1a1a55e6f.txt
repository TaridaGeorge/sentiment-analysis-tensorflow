Being in the mood or not.

You know if one is not in the mood one might not buy as much as those who sell might like.

Moods can be altered with outside stimuli.

This mall Scottsdale Fashion Square really missed the mark with its holiday d√©cor. In fact one has to actually search for any decoration at all.

Bah Humbug seems to be the lay of the land and that is really too bad.

I want the whole experience when I shop for my gift and the only place that really put an effort out is Nordstrom, nice it was.

I will find somewhere else to shop that has the spirit; but this mall sure is not it.
