Came here for lunch on a weekday.  No karaoke was going on, so there was NO REASON to come here!  The service was absolutely terrible.  We spent over 90 minutes, most of it waiting for service, the bill, and for the waitress to pick up the bill.  I gave up on using a credit card and used cash instead so we could get out of there!.  I had a bowl of chili, my wife had a salad and Mom had soup and a wrap.  Although the food was not terrible, it was nothing special and, combined with the lousy service, we were very disappointed.  UNLESS YOU WANT TO DO KARAOKE AT NIGHT, DO NOT EAT HERE.
