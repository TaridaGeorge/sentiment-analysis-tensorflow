worst tuna sandwich i've ever had.... and i use "tuna sandwich" loosely, in that i had to check to make sure there was actually tuna in the damn thing.  i don't eat at subway often, but when i do, i order the same thing; tuna on italian with the works.  

and theirs SUCKED.  i'll never step foot in this subway location again.  who wants to pay 5 dollars for stale bread and a shit ton of lettuce?
