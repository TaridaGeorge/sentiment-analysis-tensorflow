You turned off my utilities by accident at my current resident when you were supposed to turn off utilities at a different address I informed you off..then it takes you 12 hrs to turn it back on..while my wife and 4 month old baby have no electricity  and all the food has gone bad..no way of getting a hold of her while I am at work cuz her phone won't charge.
