Can someone tell me if this is the same filters that Arizona Environmental Progress charges $77 for and then adds labor on for a yearly charge of $168?

This kit sell for $33.21 on Amazon
HIGH-PERFORMANCE 50 GPD SYSTEM
STAGE 1 - 5-Micron Sediment Filter: Reduces Dirt, Sand, and Rust
STAGE 2 - Carbon Block Filter: Reduces Chlorine Taste and Odors
STAGE 3 - 2nd Carbon Block Filter for Added Protection
STAGE 4 - 50 GPD RO Membrane: Separates Purified Water From Rejected Impurities Down to 1/10,000 Micron
STAGE 5 - Granular Activated Carbon Final Polishing Filter Enhances the Taste of the Water.

Anyone know a reliable plumber that would install these filters for a reasonable amount?
Thanks
