I have called THREE times and left messages so I could schedule an appt. and redeem my Enamor deal. I'm still waiting for them to call me back ... but I doubt they will. I call during business hours and it always goes straight to voicemail. That's a little shady. 

I paid for a service that I'm not receiving, which means I totally got screwed. I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone.
