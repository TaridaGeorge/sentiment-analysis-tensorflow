This is my uncle's favorite Chinese place in Phoenix...and I have no idea why.

It's a little junk Chinese food spot...but it begs the question: "Isn't Junk Chinese at least supposed to taste good?"

I mean, I know what I'm putting into my body isn't actually good for me, but Gourmet House of Hong Kong makes the act of eating it not even pleasurable...so what exactly is the point?

The spot isn't very clean (the bathroom=complete ew).  The noodles are gummy, the tofu is rubbery...The sweet and sour sauce was kind of good, but I think it added to my stomach ache (which began mid meal).

The crunchy things they'll give you if you ask--those are good.

Crunchy things and a semi-doable sweet and sour do not a restaurant going experience make.
