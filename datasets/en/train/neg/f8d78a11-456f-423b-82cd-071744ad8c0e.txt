As far as gluten-free eating, this airport is TERRIBLE!  We were "trapped" in this airport for over 10 hours and searched it from end to end.  The best that I could do (to prevent starvation) was to attempt to eat at the Fox Sports Lounge.  The waitress had no idea what gluten was and I would most certianly not have eaten there if I didn't feel as though I had no other choice.  I ended up with a chicken breast (about 2" by 2" in size) with two onion slices and two pepper slices, and 13 pickles on the side (charged full price though).  WOW!  I was feeling healthy after that "meal".  Boo to this airport and its eating choices, Boo!
