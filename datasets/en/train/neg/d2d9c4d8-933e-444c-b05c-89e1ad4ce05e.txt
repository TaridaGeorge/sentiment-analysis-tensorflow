Awful chocolates!!!!  
This is perhaps the worst chocolate we have ever eaten.  Beautiful, yes.  But the chocolate ganaches were so bad I had to spit them out.  My husband and I agree they are inedible.  They have a funky chemical taste to them that hits you pretty quickly.  The truffles and caramels were OK but all of the flavors of the ganaches are just awful. 

I splurged on the holiday assortment in a red hat box, which is a lovely box but pointless if the chocolates are inedible.   I am going to have to throw away most of these.
