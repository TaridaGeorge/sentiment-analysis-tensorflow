Just bad business, Greyhound!

The people who work here are extremely rude and the majority of their clientele is a bit on the scary side. 

I normally use their parking service and every time, except for once and I believe he was a manager, have the individuals that handled my parking decal transaction been very rude or lacking customer service skills. 

Thank God I don't ride their buses or use any other services of theirs. I can't imagine what that would be like! 

Someone should call corporate on these people! Only one person at the desk 4 out of the 5 times I've been here. And a long line out the door. I have a feeling that most of the desk staff hangouts in the back to avoid doing their job and dealing with the crazies.
