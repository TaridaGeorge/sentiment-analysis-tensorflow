Great for beer specials......HORRIBLE if your hungry! They put 1-2 slices of meat on each sandwich(apparently, they ration it in the kitchen) only order if you like sandwiches that are completely ALL BREAD. Even after I mentioned to the manager, the bartender & the server how disappointed I was last time I was there(with the amount of meat), my sandwich still came out with only 1 slice of meat...huge disappointment, I will not be back.
