They don't cook the fried rice in front of you.  The scallops are the sandiest I have ever tasted...almost not edible. The vegetables tasted like...vegetables...minus flavor. The soup was salty. The salad was...ok. There is nothing desireable about the teppanyaki experience. The sushi looked good. I won't ever know if it is because I have no desire to go back there. Since there are other restaurants that have amazing sushi...I won't be back. Last, the server, was sub par and didn't deserve the tip we gave her. Don't go here...there are so many restaurants that are better in Scottsdale.
