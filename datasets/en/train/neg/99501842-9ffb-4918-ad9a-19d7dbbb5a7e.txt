I do not recommend this practice. The staff seems friendly and helpful however the "bed side manner" of Dr. Leonard in unacceptable. He refused to speak to me about more than one subject per office visit (even though all was related to one greater issue) and required me to schedule additional appointments just to talk about blood work results. These results should have been explained in detail, instead he rushed through them because that was not part of the "well woman" appointment. Scheduling appointments has been a constant struggle due to the restrictions placed on what you are allowed to talk about in each appointment. I would not recommend this practice to anyone.
