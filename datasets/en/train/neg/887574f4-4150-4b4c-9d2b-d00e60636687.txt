I hate having to take an extra half an hour each way just to get my car and drop it off.  This is one of the longest/worst set ups for car rental options in the USA. It is even worse than DFW somehow.
Unfortunately, this is not National's fault but they have to deal with the repercussions and the bad reviews.  National generally has decent selections for Emerald Elite members so overall I have been happy with them.
They just cannot overcome the location/transportation challenges to/from their rental center.
