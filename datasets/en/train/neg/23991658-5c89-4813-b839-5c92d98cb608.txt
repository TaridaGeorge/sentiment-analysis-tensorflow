Wow, another negative experience at the 16th St. Verizon store today that I have no choice but to write about it.  The customer service is horrible - the man who helped me was RUDE and smug when I explained a problem I was having with my phone.  He actually laughed at me...  wow.  I don't appreciate to be treated this way in any situation, especially in a customer service situation where I am the paying customer.  It may have been Apple's fault that the phone had a malfunction, but Verizon sold me the phone and they should be more accommodating to paying customers.
