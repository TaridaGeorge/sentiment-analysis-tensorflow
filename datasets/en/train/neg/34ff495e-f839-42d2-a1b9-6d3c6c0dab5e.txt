Okay people; this takes the cake. 
The greedy owner of the Marquee is now charging fees that he is not sharing with the band on TOP of the fees the Marquee was already charging. 
Oh yeah, and when I went to check out, the total was $25.00. Picking up at will call was noted to charge me $0.00 in convenience fees. Guess how much effing showed up on my charge card? $34.50. That's right. $9.50 in fees that were undisclosed. 
Ya feel me? It's the principal~! Oh, and about 1 days worth of food. B*stards. I'm still going to dance. And then never go back there again.
