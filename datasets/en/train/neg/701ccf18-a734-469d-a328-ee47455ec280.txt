I have no idea how this restaurant has such a high rating. We have gone 3 times with high hopes since the reviews are so great but each time we have left disappointed. 
Today, we received burnt, cold food with sub-par service. The manager who is great by the way, said he would take 50% off after seeing the burnt food. After waiting a very long time for the check, only one meal was taken off (not 50%) which made us even more dissatisfied. We won't be giving it another try.
