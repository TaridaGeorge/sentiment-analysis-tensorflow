Crooks, fake and phony!!!! Between my husband and I we paid over 8000 in work, to only have to have it redone a year later because it wasn't done correctly. My crown fell out less than a year after because there was no tooth left because they did it uncorrectly. My husband had a ton of work done that didn't need to be done and it "wasn't" covered under the insurance even though they were billing both of our insurance companies for it!! Please stay away for your own good.
