A group of men went over here to get some beer and wings last night, and a few customers gave them a bad look because obviously there were two gay couples. They ordered some food and drinks, but the bartender immediately started being rude to them when asking for their IDs. They did nothing but want some food and drinks. One of them was asked to leave immediately, and the group asked why they needed to leave. The bartender just kept getting ruder and ruder. Eventually the group got up to leave without eating, as the bartender told them they weren't wanted... he said that Native New Yorker is a "straight bar" and they weren't wanted there ever.
