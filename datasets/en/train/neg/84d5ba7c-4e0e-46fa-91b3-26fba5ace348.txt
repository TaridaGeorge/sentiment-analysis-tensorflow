We had a party of 4 on Saturday night, arrived around 9:30 pm for dinner and the restaurant was almost empty. The cheese quesadilla we ordered for an appetizer was ridiculously small for $6. After sending back an awful mojito and a overly dirty martini we were disappointed by boring meals. The fish tacos ($22) were dull and tiny, the chicken roll up could have been okay for a lunch option, and did not come with the sweet potato fries as advertised. Dinner for 4 was $138, we kept saying we could have been at FEZ or Cibo having great food and atmosphere for half the price. The roof bar was closed, the men's room out of service and only one stall in the ladies room available without toilet paper.

This was our first time at C4, and our last. Their web designer deserves a raise.
