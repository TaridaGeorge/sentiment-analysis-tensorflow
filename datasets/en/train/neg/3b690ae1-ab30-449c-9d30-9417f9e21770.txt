The food isn't half bad. The service is just seriously getting to me. Last time I went to Mucho Gusto it took nearly 25 minutes for a waiter to come to our table. Then another 20 to get my Diet Coke. Seriously? My stomach nearly ate itself. This place is like a baked potato. Go in before you're hungry because by the time you get your food you'll be starved.

Let's just say we showed up at 5pm and didn't get out of there until after 7pm. 2 people. No margaritas. Just 2 plates of food, a soda, and some chips.
