You can get a better cake at Safeway for half the price (and I am not really a big fan of Safeway cake, but you get my point).  This place is a joke - don't believe the hype. Stay away from the overly-sugary nasty baked thing that does not deserve to be called 'cake'. Don't eat the free tasters, don't fall for the packaging and the fancy looking bakery. If you are this desperate for cake, seriously, just go to Safeway.
