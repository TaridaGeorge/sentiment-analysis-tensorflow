The food was average Wendy's fare, the service was ok. The thing that got to me was the ladies bathroom. 
   There was hair in the sinks. Both sinks. Not a stray hair. A bunch of hair. Like someone who was balding had brushed their hair while leaning over the sinks. I actually gagged. The hand dryer wasn't working either. 
   You can tell a lot about an establishment by the state their bathrooms are in.
