Went for food, not drinks.  We didn't know the prices were inflated to compensate for coupons they apparently regularly offer, so it seemed a bit steep.  Food was fine.  Service was thoughtless. Also, they may want to check their plumbing or get some sort of filter. Their tap water had a horrible smell and taste.
