I usually go to the one at fiesta mall but this one was by the theater so I decided to try it...big mistake, they changed the prices but didnt change the menu price...but the main reason I only gave them 1 start is because when I got home and started to eat it...a 1/4 of the sub was so soggy I had to cut it off :( what a waste!!
