A restaurant with "fish" as part of it's name should know how to cook fish perfectly.  I ate there twice because I wanted to give them a second chance...mistake.  The fish was overcooked and dry (both times) and the lobster was rubbery.  It was such a let down.  The lobster bisque that Costco sells is far better than the bland version at Kings.  They did have a decent California roll though.  I was disappointed and will avoid this place in the future.
