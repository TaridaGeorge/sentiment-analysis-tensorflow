Horrible service and experience. Went to this Edible Arrangements to get my friend a birthday bouquet. It says online AND on their location's door that they close at 5pm on Saturdays. I arrived at 4:30pm to pick up my bouquet, and the place was closed - door locked, no one inside, and NO NOTE on the door or on their phone recording explaining WHY. Needless to say, I went to my friend's birthday event empty-handed and will NEVER return to this Edible Arrangements!
