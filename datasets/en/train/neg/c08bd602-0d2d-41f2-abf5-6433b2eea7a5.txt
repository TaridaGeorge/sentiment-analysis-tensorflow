One star, and that's one too many.

Flew once, will never make that mistake again. 

Rescheduled a return flight home ( was told it would be no problem ) was given confirmation number and everything... showed at airport and was told they had no flight for me. Had I known I would have taken the original flight home. 

Had to purchase a last minute additional ticket at inflated rate.... no compensation due to their error. 

No customer service within their so-called "customer service"

I learned my lesson...Stick with and only fly Southwest!!!!!
