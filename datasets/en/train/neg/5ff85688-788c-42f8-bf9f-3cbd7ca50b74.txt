We decided to give this place a try for lunch as we were looking for some place different as we were downtown checking out the half Marathon.  We were excited to hear that they had 40+ beers on tap, but the price of beer was pretty high, $6.00.  We then ordered garlic bread which I hate to say but it was the equivalent of cardboard. The sauce on the side was decent but the bread is something they should be embarrassed about.  We then ordered a cheese pizza for the table.  Ehhhh, is all I can say about it. I kept wishing we went some where else and felt bad that I thought this place would work for us. A

Another odd thing I thought was they said they don't do refills on Root Beer.  

To sum it up, overpriced, food is very under whelming and service was Ok.
