Another in a long line of eateries in Phoenix that have gotten me really, really sick due to cross contamination. 

I'm highly allergic to fish, so I understand the risk in going somewhere that 1/2 the menu revolves around fish. However, when I order something made out of, oh... beef, then I expect them to use proper food handling procedures to avoid cross contamination.

And yet, there I was, 1/2 through my sandwich, throwing up to beat the band in the bathroom stall. 

I guess this isn't a point that the local Departments of Health like to stress. However, this is also the sort of thing that can very easily kill someone. Fish, peanut, and other allergies of the like are the kinds that can end someone quicker than a bullet. 

Won't be going back there, no matter how much the GF needs a sushi fix.
