Not sure who I spoke with, some supposed  manager.  All I needed was to get a pipe cut for a ceiling fan.  This person said they only cut and thread pipe they sell.  Fair enough,  I kindly offered to pay for the service.  All I got was a repeat of what he initially said.  I will now drive to Home Depot every time I need something even though this store is a half mile from my new home.  Great way to lose a brand new homeowner with many needs in the future!
