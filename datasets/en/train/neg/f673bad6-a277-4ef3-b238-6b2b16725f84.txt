Sorry, but something must have happened to this place since Ellen J. and Monica B. wrote their reviews.  My girlfriend and I went there tonight for our monthly sushi fix and to catch up.  It was nice to have it so quiet - we were the only ones in the restaurant for an hour - but we understand why.  The service was attentive but the food was poor.  The portions are small - you get twice as much at most other places for the same price - the happy hour offered nothing of interest - and they do not have a full bar as is listed - only beer and wine.  Imitation crabmeat?  Sorry - that's just not authentic fare and definitely not serious sushi.   We were very disappointed.  Fortunately the conversation was good!  But we won't be back here again.
