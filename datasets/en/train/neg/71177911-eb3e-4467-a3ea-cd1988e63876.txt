I really hate this company - someday there will be competition on the grid, and awful for-profit monopolies like this dinosaur will die a quick death.

I switched banks, so there were two months where the autopayment I had set up with the old bank bounced because I hadn't yet set it up with new bank. An oversight that was my fault, to be sure, but as punishment they started making me pay with cash in a machine at the local Circle K for one full year. I appealed, and after speaking up the chain through two levels of supervisor over the course of an hour, they agreed to give me a second chance, though required a $350 deposit. FU.
