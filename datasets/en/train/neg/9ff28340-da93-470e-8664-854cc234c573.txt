I'd personally not go back here.  I went with some girls after visiting european wax right before my recent trip to Hawaii.  I wanted to get gel shellack.. and a pedicure.  The lady who did my pedicure was really rude.  She was making faces to her coworkers in response to me not wanting to spend extra money on designs and upgraded pedicures.  It was comical because my girl friend was there watching it happen.. but if I was by myself, it would have made me feel very uncomfortable.  If i was going to pay for upgrades, I'd go to a spa to get a real mani/pedi.. not this place.
