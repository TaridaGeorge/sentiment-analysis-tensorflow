Both times I have been to this place, the fish tacos tasted fishy. Both the Salmon and the Pollack. Avoid. The only good thing I can say is that the service was friendly and the salsa bar is decent. Maybe if I do ever decide to go back to one of these places I will just go with the  chicken or something. If you want great baja style shrimp or fish tacos that will truly blow your mind, go to La Condesa on 16th ST. in Phoenix. For the same price you will get the best tacos you will ever eat, artful presentation and a cool little romantic location. Sure, you will have to drive to Phoenix which I know is kind of a hassle if you live out in Mesa or Tempe but hey, It's much better than the fishy taste left after eating here.
