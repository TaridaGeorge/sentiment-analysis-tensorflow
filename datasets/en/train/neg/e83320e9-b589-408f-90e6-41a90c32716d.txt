Gay, gay, gay, oh and did I mention gay?  I really wish 0 stars was offered.  This place is terrible.  Pretentious people, over priced drinks, and a terrible vibe.  If you don't have money, you wont get anywhere in this place.  It's not fun and I will never go back.  The only thing that saves this place is the fact they serve booze.  I would never go to this place on my own, but I have been twice because of birthday parties and I had to get wasted just to deal with the crowd.  I don't want to write anymore because it's really pissing me off!!
