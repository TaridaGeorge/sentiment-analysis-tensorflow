Too bad I had to give even one star.  This place is obviously in a very bad financial bind.  We had our living social voucher and were using it last night on our anniversary.  The place was eerily quiet.  There was a note on the door-they decided they were no longer going to honor Living Social, Groupon or two other pre-purchased coupons.  We went inside and there was no one in the place but the hired help standing around.  I asked about why they no longer honored the voucher and the guy said something in a very soft voice which I am assuming was a reason.  I don't care how good the food supposedly is---let this place go under which it will undoubtebly be doing soon.
