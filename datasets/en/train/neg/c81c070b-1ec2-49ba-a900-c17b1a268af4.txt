First off I thought I had already review Lai Lai but I guess not. 
Had I reviewed it I would have given it a solid 3.

Now I want to give it a zero. 

I don't know what happened but the Mongolian BBQ no longer exists. The hubs and I went in there this past Friday and it was all ripped out. 

They tried to get us to stay to order off the menu, which was just Chinese food...I reallllly wanted Mongolian BBQ. 

So sad. They are right down the street from us. No more Lai Lai for me.
