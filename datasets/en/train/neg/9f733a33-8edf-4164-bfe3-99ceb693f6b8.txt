I don't quite understand why this place has 4 stars or so. I've only been here once and that was enough for me. The service is not the greatest, we had to wait  for a while before we got our food. The sushi rolls were ridiculously small and not fresh enough. On top of all that they charged a lot. I dont know if they were holding back on some fish or what but 4 or 5 rolls equal $50? kinda sounds silly if you ask me, especially if the sushi is half the size. The rice was kinda of hard and the fish wasn't the best. Im a huge supporter for the mom and pop businesses but this restaurant did not meet my needs.
