Started out nice.  Seated right away on a Sunday for lunch. The menu seemed limited and generic.
Once we ordered we took a look around at all of the art work and were immediately offended by the "Last Supper" picture with dogs in place of the people staring me in the face.
Don't understand why the owner would hang offensive art work like that and alienate potential customers.
Won't be back.
