There are much better and cheaper options for gyms in the tempe area.  My biggest complaints are the lack of cleanliness and the overall condition. The lobby and general areas all look nice, but I've often found the locker rooms to be dirty. Additionally, the cardio machines are often sticky and sweaty. Gross!

On the plus side, the pool is great, and it's large enough that finding a machine isn't a problem. 

My biggest complaint has come after I cancelled my membership. I get almost weekly calls, letters, and emails asking me to re-join. I've asked to be removed from their mailing list, but it doesn't seem to work. Somehow the message of "Leave me alone... I'm happy with my new gym" isn't getting through!
