Made a point to stop by here whilre driving through because of my fellow yelper ratings. Ugh! What a terrible hot dog and brat. Chili dog was just bad and so was the brat that my husband ordered.  He absolutely LOVES hot dogs, so for him to lnot even finish eating eat and want to leave to go to in n out is a BAD sign.  The only consolation is the onionrings which by the way are excellent. What a shame.
