Horrible service. As many other reviewers have stated, if you are not a regular expect to wait close to an hour while others around that arrived, after you, are served. Completely rude and unapologetic staff. Charged us for a roll that was never even served, after waiting over an hour.
After coming here frequently a couple years prior, any fond memory is destroyed with my most recent visit in addition to multiple other reviewers.
