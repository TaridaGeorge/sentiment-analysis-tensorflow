I bought a brand new book recently and did not notice it had some damage to the pages. Went back a couple of days later as I was busy throughout the week. They told me that the damage was my fault. I was shocked that they would blame me, I didnt notice it until I arrived home. And to top it off I had to pay the original price to get a exchange. It was on sale when I bought it.

I tried shopping here previously before this experience and always had high hopes. But im sad to say I will not be back. I will be taking my shopping elsewhere.
