All I know is that this place smells like old tuna. The cheap kind. There's a bunch of old bald dudes giving me the eyeball at the bar, and the waitresses are less than stellar, even for a dive establishment. I don't care if it's inconsistent, but just be nice. I also question the projector screen that is twice as big as the actual picture. 

As for the drinks, there's a fine line between strong and just disproportionate. If you're mixing drinks, just follow basic principles. That's all I ask.
