I really don't like giving bad reviews..but really, I need to.  The food is fine, not exceptional, but the service is pretty poor.  I could be spoiled though.  We used to go to Panara Bakery in KC, which owns Paradise Bakery here in the valley.  I was expecting the same sort of service and food. We went to Paradise one Sunday afternoon and  I was trying to figure out what to have, and well, yeah, I do count calories.  I asked how many calories in a specific item and the guy behind the counter said he didn't know, and said, "Here", and pushed their giant book of calories over to me.  He really was rude.  Anyway, not everyone there is like that, but honestly, it left an impression on me. There ya have it.
