My friend from out of town and I came here on her last night because i was recommended by an associate of mine. I was incredibly disappointed. It's a monday night, three tables in the dining room (as far as i could tell) the server never told us his name, and seemed frazzled from the get-go. That should have been our cue to leave, but we decided to stick around for a bit. The service was simply awful, and I'm pretty easy to please, as I've waited tables for over five years The food was mediocre at best, the caesar salad was probably the best thing that we ordered. 

i will not be returning.
