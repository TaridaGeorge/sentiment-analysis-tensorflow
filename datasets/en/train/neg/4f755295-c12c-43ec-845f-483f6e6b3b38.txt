Wow, I was.expecting a 4-star resort, but that's what I get for reading reviews on priceline and not yelp.  While the staff was mostly great, the room was not.  Over powering smell of air freshener - seriously like being in a laundromat in Mexico.  You know that detergent smell?  That was our room.  And they couldn't move us from it because supposedly they were booked.  Seriously, every room?  Even leaving the window open for six hours didn't help.  I have no idea what an asthmatic would do.  I suspect it's because we booked via Priceline.  For the money, Gainey Ranch would be a way better bet and you won't need eye drops or to wash your clothes when you leave.
