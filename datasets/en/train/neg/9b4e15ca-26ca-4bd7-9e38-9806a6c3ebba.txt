Where, oh where, is the Coffee Plantation from the 80s?
What a disappointment!  I have been going to the Coffee Plantation for years, and I always enjoyed their hip attitude and non-corporate atmosphere.  Now it could be called Coffee Plantation Starbucks.  The coffee has gotten worse, and now its just a place to be seen.  Going there was like hitting a bar, except in daylight.  What a complete mess.
