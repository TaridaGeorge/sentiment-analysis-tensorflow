Staff was friendly and eager to please, despite some difficulty with communication across the language barrier. 

Drinking glasses had lip marks and flatware had fingerprints. My husband found a hair in his dinner. 

We REALLY love Vietnamese food, and I particularly love finding a hidden gem of a restaurant. Unfortunately the lack of cleanliness and ambiance (not to mention the hair!) left me feeling nervous about the food quality and hesitant to complete my meal. What I did eat was mediocre.
