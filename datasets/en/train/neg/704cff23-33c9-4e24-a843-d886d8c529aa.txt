Fly here a lot on TED.  The terminal sucks.  When you are hanging out layed over there is nothing to do or eat.  They did remodel but it is just as bad as before.  I am stuck flying into here everymonth.  One of the good things is there was a smoking room but that got demolished so now you can smoke post checkpoint outside.
