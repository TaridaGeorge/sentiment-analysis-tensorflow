I love the 5 and diner over by the 10 off Ray Road ans so we decided to check out this one at the Chandler Mall.

A disastrous breakfast decision. While the service was friendly enough the food was terrible. I have no idea how one location can be so bad compared to another a few miles away but we will never come back here.

There were hardly any diners on a Sunday morning when most other breakfast joints are jammed so I guess that should have been a warning sign from the beginning.
