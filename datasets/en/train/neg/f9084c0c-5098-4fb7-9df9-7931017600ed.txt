How backward must a local channel be, to have the rights to broadcasting the biggest television event in America, and not be able to stream weather warnings across the bottom of the screen without interrupting the HD signal?

And just for the record, I don't give a rat's ass that there is winter storm warning in Northern Arizona, and even if I did it wouldn't matter since I'm busy staying indoors, watching the Super Bowl.

A station this awful should really be the partner of NBC so we could lump everything that is terrible about major network television together with the hokey, backwoods morons at channel 10.
