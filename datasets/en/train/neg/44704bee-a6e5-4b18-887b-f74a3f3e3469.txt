Food got ridiculously expensive over last couple years. Price raise ~20-25% but food didn't get better, in fact the portion gotten smaller.  You can find better egg rolls at 25% cheaper in Saigon Pho a couple miles away. The Pad Thai is watery with only 5 small and really frozen shrimps and relatively small portion for $10, ridiculous!  Place might feel better at night cause you will not see how cheap the furnitures are when it's dark. Overall, overprice and not worth it, coming from an Asian who knows about Asian food!!!
