We came here to eat lunch. The server gave our pizza to the wrong people; a family with kids. Once the mistake was brought to their attention, they simply brought the pizza to us - something which is against health code! I'm sure the family picked through it and touched it - slices looked freshley pulled apart and returned to the plate. After a 40+ minute wait, I was unwilling to wait for a remake. They offered a refus. Frankly, I can't return to a place where they would violate health codes like that. The other people in my group are more tolerant of germa and whatnot than I am; they said the pizza was terrible. I'm sure they will be serving the slices we left behind to the next customers to order a pepperoni pizza.
