I'm sorry to say that I bought my fiancee's engagement ring here. While it was initially a pleasant experience (with a gentleman named Charlie who was very patient and accommodating), after the purchase the staff was unwilling to be of any help. 

We returned to Kay the day after I proposed to see if we could get some work done on the ring, and a young woman there, who will remain nameless, was very cold and dismissive. I felt like, "I just gave these people HOW much money, and this is how I'm treated?"

It's a real shame that while proposing to my soon-to-be-wife, I also committed to a life-long relationship with this jeweler. Be sure I will at least go to another location.
