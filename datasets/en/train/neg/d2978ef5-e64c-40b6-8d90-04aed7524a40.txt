My husband and I entered the Steaks R Us building and were suprised to see it empty.  The advertisement stated it was dine-in, but we were directed by the staff to order our meal at the front counter, even after I stated we wanted to dine-in.  The gentleman took our order and added a 18% tip onto the check for himself!  I did a quick math in my head and asked if he added a tip on the check for himself.  With a straight face he said, "We are supposed to add a tip on the check."  We had just ordered 2 Porterhouse steaks!!!!  He gave himself a over $11.00 tip for making us order our food at the counter!!!!

BEWARE!!!
