This place is so lucky I gave it three chances to score a good visit.  Each visit scored a zero, but this system made me pick at least one star. I think they skimp or short you on product through the auto wash, overcharge...guess what?  For $6 you don't even get the dryer!  This is the worst car wash I've ever been to.  What really gets me is that the wash doesn't even get to all parts of your car, each time I left with soap all over my windshield and some mirrors.  This last time prompted me to write a review as part of my pledge to never return; my car actually came out looking dirtier than when I went in, and I lost my $6.
