I wanted to love this place as it's adorable and tucked into a corner at Harper's Nursery. The gentleman staffing the bar seemed a bit gruff, but a good caffeine fix will help me forgive even the orneriest grump.

That being said, my iced mocha was among the worst I have ever experienced. It was bitter and full of grounds. A few sips turned my stomach. This will definitely not be a repeat for me, no matter how many times I wants to skip about the lovely plants at Harper's.
