Will not go back, ever.  The trouble started when I booked the appt.  I didn't want to give my address to join the mailing list, this was apparently was a huge issue.  It should not EVER take 20 minutes to book an eyebrow wax appt.  Then I arrive 5 minutes early for a 1:00 and the women I had the appt with, Grace,  wasn't even there yet.  She finally arrived 5 minutes late and had to set up the room, this leads to another 5 minutes.  I had someplace else to be so finally I left.  Totally ridiculous.  If I had been 10 minutes late it would have been a big issue.  Real sick of a total lack of customer service around town lately!
