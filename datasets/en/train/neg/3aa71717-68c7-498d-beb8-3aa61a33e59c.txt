NO LONGER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! Won't be going back and you shouldn't either!!!

 If I can give 0 stars I would! My family and I always go to Rigatonys for the past 6 years since before they moved BUT today marks the last time! Don't bother going! All I have to say is they are very rude. They don't care about their patron like they use to. Service has lowered as well. I'm extremely disappointed.  

Save your money, don't spend it here.
