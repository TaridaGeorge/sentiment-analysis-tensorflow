I would prefer to give them a zero

The food had zero taste. The whole point to eating BBQ is to taste the unique flavors considering everyone has their own recipes. No way this place has been around since 1941 serving this watered down food. The brisket sandwich was tasteless, the mac and cheeses was not cheesy. My friend had the potato that was topped with chicken, she said it also had no taste. The Ice cream was watery like a milk shake. Never again. Anyone that eats this stuff and gives a 5 stars must be family or has extremely low standards not just for BBQ.
