Went here on a Groupon and had a terrible experience. 

After waiting 15 min for a table to open up, waited another 10 for menus, flagged down the waitress, asked for water, waited another 10 for water, she shoved water glasses on our table, left, waved her down, said she'd be right over, she seated, menu-ed, and watered a group of four that had just arrived. 

With the already horrendous service, we figured service would be faster if we ordered items we could cook on the table top. When we the food arrived, we received only two sets of dishes and silverware for 4 people.

The remainder of our meal, our server never stopped by, after trying to wave her down for one thing after another, I resorted to going behind the counter myself, even taking their water pitcher to refill our waters.
