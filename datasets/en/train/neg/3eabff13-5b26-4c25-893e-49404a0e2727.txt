i was very disappointed today. when i found out from the sporting good manager..RICK..mention they do not carry buss worm bedding.
i was just ready to leave the store, when i came across  an older gentlemen name JIM, in sporting good. I ask him if they carry buss worm bedding. he answer yes and took me to the section. He was very nice and helpful and was able to answer all my question.
