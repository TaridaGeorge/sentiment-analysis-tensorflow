I wanted to transfer two of my dog's RXs from another store to CVS for the $25 promotion they offered with these transfers. The pharmacy assistant refused to honor it at the pharmacy because I didn't bring the coupon. I asked the manager if they would honor the gift card without the coupon and he said, sure, "Tell the pharmacist I said it was fine." I did, then the pharmacist stalked over and chewed out the manager and came back and said, "He shouldn't have told you that!" 

Customer service rule #1 violated: Don't argue in front of customers.

#2: Don't be rude to customers.  

My other prescriptions will remain at Walgreens.
