Trying to capitalize on the Hooters gig, Tilted Kilt fails.

The waitstaff is OK. Having to prance around in those little outfits may please the male clientele but I don't know... maybe I'm getting old (or maybe it's because I have daughters that age) but it's kinda degrading... Our waitress had to be no more than 19....she still had braces. Looked at my receipt when I got home and she even charged us for too many beers. 

Food was typical bar food. I had a burger and it was no better and no worse than any burger I've had in any sports bar in America. Nothing to write home about. 

Lots of TVs. I even got to see my beloved Phillies on a screen right in front of me.

All in all, it's a gimmick. Stay away.
