Where do I start.  

The burgers - All  were over cooked.

The fries - they were soggy.  We told the waitress that they weren't edible and sent them back.  She brought out a new order and they were just as bad as the first.

Warm Jumbo Bacon Salad - It's listed under Starter on the menu and that's how we ordered it.  It came out after all the burgers and fries.  The bacon on the salad wasn't cooked.  It wasn't edible.

Chocolate Bread Pudding -  It was cold in the center.

We thought they had a great concept for a restaurant and we love burgers, so we were excited to eat there.  We will never go back.
