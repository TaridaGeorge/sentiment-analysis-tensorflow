This place was shut down by the health department today.  Drink there if you can, but they ran out of beer this weekend.  And I peeked in back to find them pouring $10 vodka into the Grey Goose bottles.  Kins of a blatant violation of anything ethical, but what do you expect from a hangover.

Hopefully the cool crew like Doug, Snyder, Alicia, and Linda do better in Old Town.

Visit if you dare, but I visited years ago and it was much better.  Word is out that they did not pay anyone who works there, and they are selling the place.

Shame, cool spot, hopefully someone buys it and brings it back.
