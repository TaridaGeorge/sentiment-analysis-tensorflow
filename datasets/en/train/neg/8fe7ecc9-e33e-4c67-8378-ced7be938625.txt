I'm not going to take the time to re-write the same story as Bri D. but I will add this -

If you can't manage to get food in front of someone 40 minutes after they order it, you should not be in the restaurant business.  

It is breakfast.  It should take 10 minutes, TOPS!  I could have waited for a table at The Good Egg, been seated, and served in less time than it took for me to finally give up on this crap-tastic joke of a cafe.

No thanks.
