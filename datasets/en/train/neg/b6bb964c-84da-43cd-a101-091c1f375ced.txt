Soo - should have read these reviews before booking a consultation!  Booked a 2:30 - showed up at 2:15, filled out paperwork...waited and waited in the front room, alas taken back to the next room to wait and wait, now an hour later I finally ask where the Dr is.  The 'hostess' had no idea that I had not been seen, then started running in circles looking for the Dr, never found the Dr...told her I was leaving.  She just said o.k. and continued fluttering around the office like a chicken with her head cut off.  That was a nice waste of time!  Save your time, save your $ go somewhere else!  Be forewarned.
