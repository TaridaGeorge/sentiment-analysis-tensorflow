Consistently disappointed with this Starbucks.

My coffee has been made wrong on more than one occasion. Additionally, my spinach feta wrap has been cold in the middle now 3 times. Who likes to bite into a cold egg in the middle of a supposedly warm spinach wrap?

YUCK!

The drive thru is always chaotic with at least a line of 7-10 cars wrapped around the parking lot. 

Additionally, if you walk up to the window for the outdoor seating they are not any faster. Your order is still in line with the drive thru cars.

I'll find another location to start my day.
