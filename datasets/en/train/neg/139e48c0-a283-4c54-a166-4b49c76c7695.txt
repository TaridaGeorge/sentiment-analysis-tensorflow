ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! The owner and sales rep (same person) is a nasty woman with a horrible attitude. When you have 1k to spend and you ask a question and it's answered with an eye roll, it really goes to show what their customer service is really like. The other shopper even commented to me how rude she was. I will never return or recommend this shop to others. The customer in front of me was African American and I'm gay and the bigoted sales woman was nasty to both of us. F rating, if your a decent human do not shop here!!!
