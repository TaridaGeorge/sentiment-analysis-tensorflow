Extremely unprofessional. Called ahead to see the latest time for rental and was told 2:30. Also inquired whether the water was high enough to float and was assured it was. Arrived at 2:20 and was told the last group went out at 2:00.  This is way too far to travel for the staff to close up early. Disappointed the staff would not honor what was told to us over the phone.
