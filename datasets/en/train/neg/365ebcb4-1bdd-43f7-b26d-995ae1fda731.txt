The first 2 times we went it was great! ...then something changed. Not sure if new owners or what ? The price was waaay high in comparison to Ocean Blue up the road, our family on a budget gets way more yogurt for our buck. You don't wanna feel like you got robbed at a Cold Stones.  And things were wierd... Their napkins were from dunkin donuts, I asked the owner if he owned the Dunkin next door and he said, no we do trade-offs for each other to save money.... Really a large franchise like Dunkin needs trade-offs from your place ?! Wierd.  We will go to Swirl It or Ocean Blue. Neither make you 'ask' for sample cups, or over charge!!!  Goodbye U-Swirl
