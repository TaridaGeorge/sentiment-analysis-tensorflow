I was from out of town visiting for Spring Training, saw this Bar & Grill place and had the worst experience. Long story short, I'm a woman that got punched by a "man" RIGHT IN FRONT of the security guards and they did not do ANYTHING!!! A security guard is supposed to protect you when there is an altercation but apparently not at Acme Bar & Grill. There were two guards who stood there and let it happen. It took them about 10 minutes to call the cops as well. WORST PLACE EVER! First of all, what "man" hits a woman and what kind of "security guard" are you if you're not doing your job. The police department wasn't any better. Would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.  

My dad works for the SJPD and is looking into the security system down there as well.
