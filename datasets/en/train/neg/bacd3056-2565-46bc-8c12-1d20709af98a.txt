This place was very disappointing. When AA Wholesome used to be located inside Super L Ranch it used to be lot better than this place. I bought whole bag full of bread & pastries and only that was pretty decent was the custard bun. Others were pretty bad and bland and end of throwing them away. I just want some good Asian baked goods! Guess I gotta make another trip out to Cali....
