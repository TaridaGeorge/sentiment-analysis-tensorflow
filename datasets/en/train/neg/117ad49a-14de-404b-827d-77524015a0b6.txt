Alright, what am I reviewing here? I wish I was reviewing the decor, which is sleek and very cool. The service which was great, the wine which in this area is incomparable....but I'm not reviewing any of that, I'm reviewing the shrimp scampi pizza, and the linguini with white clam sauce, one of which gave me the rumblies in my tummy, which would not go away until I "moved" them out. So yes this review comes from the bowels of my hear...well no, just my bowels. You made them very unhappy. I give you 10 stars for the decor and the wine bar itself, but on the seafood, my bowels give you -9. Insert mad face here...the bowels, not me. It actually tasted pretty good going down.
