This place just keeps going down, and their prices keep coming up. Their sushi used to be good. The rolls were obviously from another day, or frozen, or something. Bad bad, My drink didn't come until after my second helping of cold fried rice. Who messes up fried rice?? I was so pissed I left without ice cream, then got my bill. 18$ are you out of your mind? I could have eaten three times at Golden Eggroll for that! Garbage. Crab legs, garbage. Sushi, garbage. Chicken, garbage. Service, you guessed it trash. Never going back.
