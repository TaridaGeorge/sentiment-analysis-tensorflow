Plus's  - Free WiFi, no arms on seats.

Minus's - Long distance between terminals. Bus service between terminals slow. Have to go thru security again between terminals. Security checkpoints REALLY slow. Three columns for going thru security, regular coach, first class, parents w/children and wheelchairs. What this means is that for regular coach passengers it takes more than a half hour to get thru the damn security screening checkpoint so Good Luck if you're trying to catch a flight in another terminal.

  Also, hardly any screens that show flight/gate information. If it's not on your boarding pass or if your boarding pass gate # is wrong, good luck finding what gate you're supposed to be on.
