Il be honest i love all the vets and the vet techs here they are great but I am probably never going back there because of the one front desk girl. I have never experienced such rudeness and disrepect. we lost our great dane less the a month ago and she was so rude i was flabbergasted. The disrespect was out of this world, for all the money we pay and what my family had just gone through she is lucky I didnt lose it right then and there. I will NEVER refer someone here until that girl is gone, they need someone witha little more ethics and who is more mature.
