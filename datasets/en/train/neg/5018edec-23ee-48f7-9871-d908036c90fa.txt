Terrible flight. Unaccompanied kids crawling on me, spilling drinks, throwing games. Contacted US Airways repeatedly, wouldn't offer _any_ material compensation whatsoever for 4.5h of discomfort. Their official policy is that if you get from point A to point B they don't care what happens in between. Avoid, awful.
