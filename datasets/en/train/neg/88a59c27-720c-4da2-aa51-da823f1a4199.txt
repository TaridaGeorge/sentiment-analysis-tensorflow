This was our 4th rainforest cafe we have visited. My son picked it for his 5th birthday dinner, worst rainforest expierence ever! Our waitress was very rude, our order was incorrect twice, and she kept making it worse, by screwing it up more, I didn't realize a plain cheeseburger was so hard! For a $200 bill I didn't realize we would have to beg so much for re-fills and correct food. My son enjoyed it, and at the end of the day that was what was important, however next year I'll talk him into something else!!
