I never give a one-star rating unless it's duly deserved, and this one IS. Went for something to eat and whatever it was that they brought (we ordered their "famous crunchy pork tacos") was stone cold, tasteless, and a disgrace to the country of Mexico. Couldn't even eat it. The "salsa" was probably, no it WAS, the worst attempt at salsa I've ever had and the only way I can describe it properly would be weak tomatoey something put in a blender and whipped into a foam with plenty of water added. No taste and another disgrace. Disinterested waitress added to the fun. A total waste of time and money and you couldn't drag me back screaming. I never thought you could screw up a taco, but this guy "cooking" did it. Even Chipotle can make a taco that puts this crap to shame. Go anywhere else.
