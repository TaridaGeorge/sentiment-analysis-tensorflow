I've been back a couple times and the food has consistently gotten worse.  Last time I ordered a dorado taco and a carne asada burrito.  

The taco tasted like it sat out and they threw it in the frier when I ordered it.  The meat in the carne asada was burnt and stale.  It also must have sat out for hours.  

You can seriously get better mexican food at the filibertos down the road.  I wont be back.
