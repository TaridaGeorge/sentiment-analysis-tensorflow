I would give less than 1 star if possible. Ordered lunch to go for a group and we arrived to pick up we were told by the bartender that the order had been canceled, as they got busy between the time we ordered and drove over to pick up. 
He may as well burned cash on the bar. We will not be returning and had our group lunch at another establishment that actually wants business! 

Try another place for burgers, there is a Wineburger on 16th st and Bethany that rocks!
