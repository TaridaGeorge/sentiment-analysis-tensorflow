If you're a fan of sushi (who isn't) don't even waste your time here; awful!  The calamari was like seasoned tire, and the sushi chef must have practiced his rolling skills at at a sandwich shop because the rolls did not stay together; they were peeling apart.  It's an upscale atmosphere (with rude patrons to match) and downscale food.
