Gross, gross, gross!  Did I mention GROSS???  Seriously, every single surface in this place seemed to be sticky or dirty.  At least half of the tables hadn't been cleared and the booths were covered in half eaten pizza and soda.  About a third of the games/rides weren't functioning and just ate my son's tokens.  And the pizza was the pits.  Seriously, Little Caesar's $5 pizza tastes better than what this place served us.  We went on a Thursday evening (around 5pm) and were totally disgusted.  I do not recommend this place to anyone.  The $30 that we spent here were a total waste and we wound up grabbing dinner somewhere else after leaving.
