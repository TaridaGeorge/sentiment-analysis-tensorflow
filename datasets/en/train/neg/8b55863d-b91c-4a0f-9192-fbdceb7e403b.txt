I have visited here for lunch on a sat afternoon. After waiting for a  very long time , having to ask if we have a server, a kid came up who , i hope, was on his first day. We ordered drinks and lunch. 

Caeser salad , dressing on side. add chicken.

I ordered coffee and chicken kabob things. 

Dressing came on salad, ALLERGY!!!
chicken things came deep friend and gross. 

PLUS THERE WAS A HAIR IN THE SALAD. 

We had high hopes for this great sounding spot with such a good location. We were very much let down. We have tried to try a different spot in scottsdale alomost every weekend we are in town and cannot say a bad thing about any except this one. very disappointing. 

having read another review I may steer clear of fusion.
