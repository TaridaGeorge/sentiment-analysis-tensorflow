Ok, here is a true review by a unpaid commentator. Subway should have never allowed their chain to be "franchised". This shop at 27th Ave and Thomas is in a tough area and they only have one employee per shift on the weekends. Super slow service by worker with an attitude problem that happens to be friends with the manager who is also cozy with the franchise area manager. Evenings and nights are dangerous in this area unless Phoenix PD is taking their lunch break there at night. Sometimes, there will be 5 to 8 officers on their lunch eating outside on the front patio. Then I feel safe to go in. Otherwise it's hoodrats, tweakers, and employees with attitudes. On a different note, Monday through Friday day shift they will have 2 or 3 staff working and all smiley and courteous because they now corporate managers are roaming.
