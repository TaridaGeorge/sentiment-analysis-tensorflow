The biggest mistake Solis made was when they noticed a spot on my mammogram and then didn't inform me about it.  I later felt the lump, which turned out to be cancerous, and only then did I discover that the lump had been noticed by Solis 9 months earlier.  I advise everyone to get copies of all your records and look at the images yourself.
