I just checked into this motel for a 4 day long weekend.  First I asked for two wine glasses fromi the restaurant for my room and was told no.  After a lot of complaining they finally relented and gave us the glasses.  Then we looked in the refrigerator to store some wine we brought but it is completely stocked with no room for guests to use.  I also noticed that a small bottle if water is $3.00.  Then I wanted to go online and noticed that it is almost $10.00 for 24 hours if use.  In fact everything costs here and the prices are high.  Unfortunately I paid in advance through Expedia.  This place is very, very overpriced.
