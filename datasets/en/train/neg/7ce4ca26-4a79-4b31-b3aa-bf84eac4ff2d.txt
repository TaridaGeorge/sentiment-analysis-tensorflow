This place is so overpriced it is amazing that they have any customers.   You can go to any mom & pop pet store or bigger chain store and find anything that is here... but for about 30% less.  For the same food I buy about a mile or two away at Sunflower Pet Supply,   Choice charged an extra $15-20 more.  Not even pretending to be competitive.  

Yes they have a good selection but when it comes to price, this is the worst pet store in town.
