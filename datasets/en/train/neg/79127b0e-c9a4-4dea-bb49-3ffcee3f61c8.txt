THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE, THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. SAFTEY of most rides are questionable. My son was allowed on a ride once and denied on the second time!!! Employees don't follow the height restrictions which could end up in hazardous situations. I am considering filing a suit case against the manager of the park for being careless about the services and safety of the park customers.    RIPPOFF!!
