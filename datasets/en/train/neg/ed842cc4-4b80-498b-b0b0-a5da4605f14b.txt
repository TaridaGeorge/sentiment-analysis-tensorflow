Just finished breakfast and I have stomach ache. Had eggs benedict. First off the wait was terrible, 40 mins is crazy. secondly it took another 40 mins for our food to come out. Third the 3 of us had Benedict's, my eggs were runny and the other 2 plates the eggs were hard. Terrible chef for the plates to be that inconsistent. Overall recommendation, don't ever go here!
