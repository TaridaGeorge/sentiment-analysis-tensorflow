this kashman's is closed - as of Sunday June 20, 2010

Their summit location is still OPEN - however, this is a little farewell to the Pinnacle Peak location.

What used to be my favourite deli turned into a nasty neighbor. It's nothing personal, but really - they did everything to drive my business away, so when I say their doors closed, I was actually relieved because they left a sour taste in my mouth. While their food was decent, it was overpriced and I never got over just how cold and unwelcoming they were to not just me but everybody.

I will not even bother to drive further north to visit their other location because really the farther away they are, the happier I am!
