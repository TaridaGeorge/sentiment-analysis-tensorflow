I purchased a Groupon on May 6th for 2 dozen cupcakes at Bitter Sweet Cake Boutique. Went to place my order today and there's no place to order on-line and a recording saying that they will be closed from May 9-15th!? Really, who closes after you've placed a Groupon. Not only that, but they are not taking orders until the beginning of June. When I purchased the Groupon, it said it was able to be redeemed the next day. Not happy with this company at all. Returning my Groupon and will never use this company in the future.
