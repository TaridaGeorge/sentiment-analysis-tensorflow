I used to think this place was amazing till I tried Nordstroms in the bay area. Customer service here is very judgmental. I was actually asked if I was just looking or was actually going to buy something. I walked right out. I wanted to return something once and was told I did not have a receipt, never had that problem anywhere else. 

You will get great customer service if you dress like a Scottsdale snob flashing your money worse than Rodeo Drive. Otherwise, expect to be shunned. They take advantage since they are the only Nordstroms in Arizona and Scottsdale is just a wanna be Rodeo Drive with not as much money or class, and worse plastic surgery.
