Well thanks to all the unhappy people leaving.. they warned me and my friends to not waste our time standing in line. We stood in line for about 5 minutes before we decided that we weren't going to wait to go in a building with the 50 or so other sweaty people to possibly drink some warm beer. Luckily our half priced from Deal Chicken was refunded!

Lucky for all the other bars in Old Town that we graced with our presence because of this failed event. Maybe next time they shouldn't curse their event by calling it Winterfest when it's 130 degrees out in the sun.
