I had eaten here a couple times prior with a decent experience.  This last time it was horrible.  The place was dirty, the service was worse then ever.  They were decorating the tables with dirty used cans of some kind of energy drink.  I ordered iced tea to drink and I swear I got a swig of mold chunk.  I spit it out and then shoved bunches of altoids in my mouth.  I was almost crying as the taste in my mouth was so bad.  We promptly got up and left.  I will never ever return.  YUCK!
