This place has some of the worst food at ridiculous prices.  The fries were soggy and seemed as if they were sitting around for hours.   The steak in the steak sandwich was greasy and grissley.  It had like 3 leaves of lettuce with a few drops of mayo on the roll.  Man it was bad!!!  and I had the privilege of paying $17 for it....WTF!!

To top it off, The food caused sickness about an hour after leaving. 

The service is slow and oblivious.  The place is dirty....there were tables and floors left unclean the whole time we were there.

This place is really only good for going and having a few of their beers on the patio and people watching.
