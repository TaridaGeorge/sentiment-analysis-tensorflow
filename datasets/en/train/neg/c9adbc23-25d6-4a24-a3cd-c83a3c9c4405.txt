Garbage! This place was not "Classic 50's style" at all! The burgers were so dry and flavorless, I'm amazed people still would even go here, you might as well go to Carl's Jr, Wendy's, or Jack in the Box instead of this place! Don't waste your time or your money. If you want good classic 50's style restaurant go to Chase's Diner in Chandler waaay better!
