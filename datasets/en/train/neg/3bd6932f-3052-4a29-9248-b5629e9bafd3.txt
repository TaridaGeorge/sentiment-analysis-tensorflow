sheas is a hydroponics retailer in south scottsdale, the store is very small and i would bet that i have more equipment in my laundry room than the entire store has in stock. The owners are from norcal and have managed to bring the dreaded mutated humboldt spider mites with them, be careful they sell clones as well and they have all had mites. Tj the owner does custom room installs and many customers have reported mite infestations very soon after . These mites will destory entire crops!!  Be careful people, these people are only in it for themselves and they are putting a bad taste in the mouth of az medical marijuana.
