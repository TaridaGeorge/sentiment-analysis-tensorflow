I live on the outskirts of Cave Creek and stop here occasionally.  Every time I stop, I ask myself why in the world did I stop here again?  The staff/owner are rude and the stuff isn't worth the money.  If you want service with a smile or any service for that matter, DON'T stop here.  There are plenty of other  stores in Carefree and Cave Creek who will treat you with courtesy and have better prices.
