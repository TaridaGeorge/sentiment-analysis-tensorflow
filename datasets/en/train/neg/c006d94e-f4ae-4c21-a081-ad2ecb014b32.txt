Wish I had followed Jayd's advice and specifically requested Jackie. I felt a proposal from my long term boyfriend was eminent (I was right) and wanted to get my nails done since I (finally!) stopped biting mine. I was fairly pleased with the look of my French tip manicure for the first two days. However, my tech (can't remember her name) was really aggressive with cutting my cuticles even though I jerked my hands back, "Oww!". Now, not even a week later my polish is hideously chipping and I have little skin tags above my cuticles due to her roughness. In spite of this fabulous ring on my finger I shun at showing it to people because of my gross nails. And I was charged $17 for a natural nail French tip?! Locating my polish remover now and will NEVER return!
