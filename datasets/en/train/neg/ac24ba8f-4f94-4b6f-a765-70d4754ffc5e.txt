Sorry sir that will be a 5 1/2 hour wait!!!!!  NO pizza on this planet is good enough for even 2 hours....come on.  What do they put in the pizza for people to wait that long for?????  You look at the place and it's the size of a postage stamp and the lemmings are lined up outside wanting some of their pizza......I don't get it!

We went across the walk way to The Rose and Crown sat right down and had wonderful beer and fish and chips.  Wait=None.  We kept sitting there looking at the people waiting and wondering what else do they have to do in their lives but wait 5+ hours for a meal.

I'm from Seattle and we have LOTS of great pizza places to go to that we don't have to wait HOURS to get into!
