This place is terrible.  The inexperienced front desk people care about nothing other then SELLING.  Some of them are busy doing personal texting.  They  have let go of teachers, the classes are too crowded and they make you do a membership if you want to use the equipment.  The teachers, at best, pale in comparison to LA instructors I have had.  Corporate America at the expense of personal attention and staff that really could care less.
