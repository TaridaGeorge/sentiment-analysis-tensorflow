I'm gonna have to disagree with Mandi on this one. RTO Sullivan's is misleading and disappointing. You think you're heading into a cool Irish Pub, but it's more of a trashy Mesa sports bar with horrible music and a generic and bland atmosphere. 

The people are the worst thing about this bar. It's ok if you go with a huge group of friends, but if you're just dropping by it's like a trip to a trailer park. 

The only redeeming qualities are the good happy hour menu and the leprechaun in the ladies' room.
