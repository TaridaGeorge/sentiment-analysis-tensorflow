I will never come back to this location, the service was horrible. I was not greeted when I walked through the door, and the area where people sit was extremely dirty with dried on ice cream. When I went to order I noticed the ice cream was melting, and then I wanted to order a waffle and they told me they were all out, then I told them I wanted bananas... and guess what... they were all out of bananas also! I have always enjoyed Cold Stone, but whoever owns this location better step up their game because I paid $20 for a horrible experience...
