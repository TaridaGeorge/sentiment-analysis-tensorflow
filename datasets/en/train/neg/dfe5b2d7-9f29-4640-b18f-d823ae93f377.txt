If you really like Indian food, it's very hard to enjoy this place. One of the appeals of good Indian food is their use of various spices and flavors. Their sauces (at least the ones we tried, tikka masala, curry, korma) all tasted bland, as if they either left out  many critical ingredients for taste or simply didn't put enough. It just all seemed very one dimensional. Unfortunately, their rice is also served very dry, which does a good job of absorbing what little sauce there is left with your meal. 

The restaurant and the food has a nice presentation, but when it comes down to it, the taste isn't there.
