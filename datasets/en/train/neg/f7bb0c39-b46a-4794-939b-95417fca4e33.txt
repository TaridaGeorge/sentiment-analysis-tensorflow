I went to this studio for about 3 months. The classes were ok, but the atmosphere was annoying. They only pay attention to people they know. They would say hi to their friends in class and not anyone else. If you know someone that works there it is a great place, if not, you are an outsider and pay for overpriced classes and don't get any help doing the workouts better. They are totally full of themselves. No thanks.
