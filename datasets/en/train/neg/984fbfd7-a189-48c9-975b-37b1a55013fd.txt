Ate here tonight with my fiancée.  Service was good.  But the, "security", randomly slid a garbage can (I wish I was making this up) into our table in the middle of dinner.  Then 5 minutes later (same huge bald security guy with a goatee) walks into my fiancées and elbows her in the back (she was sitting at our table).  No apology, not even an acknowledgement in either incident.  It was like going to a restaurant run by the TSA.  Will not be coming back...
