WAY OVER PRICED for moderately good ice cream. not accommodating for kids in that you have to spend an extra 50 cents for all the "fun flavors" (which consists of a squirt of syrup).  they only offer the medium size for the fun flavors, as well. the atmosphere is boring and doesn't offer much seating. i'd rather spend my money on a simple yummy vanilla cone at cooperate mcdonalds.
