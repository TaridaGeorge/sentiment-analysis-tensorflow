Place is alright but for the waitress, poor service and things sent over we didn't order.  We sent them back but had  additional items brought and not brought on the tab anyway.  She said me "that couldn't happen" and refused to take it off. Waitress included autograt. 

I have been here a dozen times and never get great service but enjoy myself.  This time will be my last.
