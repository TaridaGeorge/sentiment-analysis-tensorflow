This is my least favorite bar that I have been to in Old Town for one main reason.  THE MUSIC IS TOO LOUD!!  WHAT IS THAT??  THE MUSIC IS TOOOOO LOOUUUDDDD!!  I CAN'T HEAR YOU?? WHATTTT??  HUHHH??  (Hand gesture to the door) and you leave.

The biggest joke I was told was that this is the "#1 Lounge in Scottsdale".  There is no way that is the case.

I can't stand this spot.  The bartenders are good, but they can't even hear your order.  I have yet to have a good time here, and don't think much about coming back to this spot...even if it is busy.
