Stopped in to buy an item and receipt was supposed to be emailed to me.  Never received it.  Called back, provided email address again and still not receipt.  Called AGAIN.  Was told that it had to be an error on my end.  I provided email address again and it's been two hours and still nothing.   It's apparent that customer service is not high on their list.  They would not mail me a receipt and since I'm out of town I lose.  NEVER AGAIN.  Sales persons high-tech scanner did not work either.
