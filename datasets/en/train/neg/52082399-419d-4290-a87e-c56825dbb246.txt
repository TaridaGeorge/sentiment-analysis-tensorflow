Seriously?! $60 later my family still has empty belly's because their food was so terrible. We left all 3 of our plates full on the table. The presentation was sloppy & the taste left little to be desired. I would hardly consider their food authentic italian. Its a good slogan though. Honestly their food is more like over priced & overcooked slop. When we spoke to the owner about our food we were insulted & told that we don't know good food. My husband ordered lasagna, my son spaghetti, & I ordered the gnocchi based off of the snobby waitresses recommendation who said I would not be disappointed. She promised. The owner did nothing to resolve the situation. I would not recommend this overpriced, pretentious, dump to ANYONE.
