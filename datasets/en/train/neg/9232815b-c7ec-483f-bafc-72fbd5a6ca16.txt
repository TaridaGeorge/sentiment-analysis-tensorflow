Went there tonight. (1/3/12)  Got a "Humboldt"--veggie and avacado sub.  The sandwich only two very, very thin slices of provolone and I asked for more and they added two more very, very thin slices of provolone.  Avocado was so thinly spread, you virtually cannot see or taste it.  I asked for wheat and ended up with white.  Asked for extra onions and she again added so little So in the end I had an iceberg lettuce and vinegar sandwich on white bread.  I tipped a dollar at both ends of the line and did not help because the service was terrible.  NEVER AGAIN!
