I ordered the Nachos which is just a huge try of fried wantons with cheese, pepperoni and some type of meat. That tasted interesting but it was a huge tray for $10.00.

My friends ordered a Sausage Pizza which had hot dog meat for sausage. The Chicken Alfredo tasted like the hot dogs which some weird cream. 

For my waffle fries I was given cocktail sauce instead of ketchup... wtf.

i'm never going here again.
