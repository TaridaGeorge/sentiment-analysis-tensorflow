Bad...just really bad!

Was excited to see something different other then "burgers and fries". I thought, "Oooh, Hawaiian food, great! Something different!" I was so wrong. First off the place was filthy and I had to wipe down my own table. Staff was rude and obviously hated their jobs. And the worst part ever and why I will not be going back, they do not properly clean the shrimp. That to me is unforgivable. I couldn't even eat the rest of my dish once I saw that. If they don't clean the shrimp and devein it properly, what else do they not clean?!! Never ever again!
