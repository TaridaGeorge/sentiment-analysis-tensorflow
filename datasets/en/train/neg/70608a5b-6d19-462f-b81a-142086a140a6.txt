Rude and watered down tea... I've never been here.. Today must have been the worst day to come. I was the only one ordering and I didn't get helped... Why is this place so popular!? I live nearby and I'll make sure none of my guests have to bring this place business, either! Sorry for the trouble in asking about your damn menu!!!
