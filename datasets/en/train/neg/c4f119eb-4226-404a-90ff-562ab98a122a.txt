This was the worst experience that I've ever had with a refi...run away as fast as you can!  We opted to not go with the VA 4.25 they offered us and wanted a conventional refi....they tacked on fees that were in access of 16,000 dollars at a 4.5 rate...and that is with excellent credit.  AND they won't even give you true quotes unless you give them $400 via credit card to start the process.  
We ended up using DLJ financial in California....they were up front, professional and DID NOT require crazy fees.  Our interest rate is way lower than what quicken quoted us and they responded to every email and phone call quickly.
I have no idea how they got rated #1 by JDPowers....RUN AWAY...and use a different company.
