I've got some good news, and some bad news.
The bad news is that the soda fountain was broken (so I couldnt get my cup of water), the service was the slowest I've seen at a BK, and the Jr. Whopper tasted like sh**.
The good news is that it'll probably be a long time before I go back to BK so I won't get fat as fast.
