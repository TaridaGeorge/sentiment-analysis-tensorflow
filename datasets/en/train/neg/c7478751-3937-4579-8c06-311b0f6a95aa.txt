No, I simply cannot put in a good review for Miracle Mile. 
A coworker recommended this place to me. Actually, two coworkers did.
However, upon inspection of my pie right before I was about to eat it, I noticed that there was mold in it.

Yes, mold.

Sorry Miracle Mile, your fries were bland and while your chicken tenders were decent, I can't forgive mold in a pie. I did take a picture of it so I will be adding it to this review as soon as I can.

Who knows if I will get my 2.95 for moldy pie back.

*ETA
MM has been notified and I am to receive a gift certificate for my 2.95. I was given the option of returning it but it's over a 40 min drive.
