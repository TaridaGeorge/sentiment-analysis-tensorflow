We were excited to find out this outlet mall was opening.  Unfortunately, the developers did a very poor job in designing the parking lot.  We were directed to park behind the buildings in a row that paralleled the interstate. We loaded everybody up, including the stoller and a senior citizen family member - but found ourselves unable to walk to the mall because there were no sidewalk paths created in the sandy areas separating parking lot rows.
