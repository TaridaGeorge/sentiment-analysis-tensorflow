Eek! Methinks not is right! I dont know why or how i keep finding myself at this place. I haven't had one good experience. One time, the place is suppose to be open at 10am and was still closed at 11am?!?! WTF Another time, they over steeped the tea and release all the tanin, the tea was soo gross and dry. Train your staff to know different teas have different steeping times AND temps. I really have no idea why i don't just go down to the coffee bean.

The staff seems friendly enough. The decor, LOVE the teas in the drawers, feels very chinese herb traditional. They have such huge potential to become a great place, but have been lacking everytime i go. I really truly hope they can get there one day, i love their concept.
