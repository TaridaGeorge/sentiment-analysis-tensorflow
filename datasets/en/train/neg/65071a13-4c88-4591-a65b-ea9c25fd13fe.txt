This is some place you only want to go to if you have to. The atmosphere sucks, the food always seems bland, the building feels like it's in disrepair, and the staff are lifers and kids passing through. There are few places which can make you feel even worse about grabbing fast food and unfortunately, this is one of them.

 The BK on Broadway near Hardy is a million times better.
