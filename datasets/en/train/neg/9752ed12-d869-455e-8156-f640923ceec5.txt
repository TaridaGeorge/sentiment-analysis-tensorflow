I would have to say ALL of the negative reviews here are true. I'm a SPG member and stay at many SPG hotels for work and play. I have stayed at the the W in San Diego, LA and Seattle many times and always had a good time. 

I had 10 people in town for business and fun for a weekend and booked rooms at the W Scottsdale (I do live in the Phoenix area). The attitude of the staff was unbelievable and very rude. 

It was so bad we left this hotel and stayed elsewhere leaving our rooms at the W empty while still paying for them.

I will do the "I told you so dance" when this place shuts down. This review is just for The W in Scottsdale and not the others I have stayed at of any other SPG hotels I've stayed at.
