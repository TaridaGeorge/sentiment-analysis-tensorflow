High priced DOG food. The boneless chicken wings were barely edible and made my stomach gargle for hours. This was the first time in a long time that I was actually concerned about getting violently ill. The bartender was terrible to say the least. Perhaps working New Years day was too much for her. Gallagher's is a sad establishment; with better management and improvements to food quality it could easily become better than Applebees. Management: Stop offering discount wings during happy hour, your staff gets rude to people who order them because they believe they aren't going to get a descent tip, your not helping yourself.
