First admission: we ate a LOT of sushi, sitting comfortably at the modest sushi bar with attentive, over competent chefs.  THEN a waiter with hair to his shoulders (not tied back) ducks behind the sushi bar to get a dish. The 2nd & 3rd times, the waiter, with the unkempt hair - behind the sushi area, essentially ended our meal. Tucking his hair behind his ears then grabbing for a plate. Gross and unacceptable.
