I would give this place a 0 star if I could. The short rib is salty and overcooked. We ordered the sample size ahi tuna and they charged us full prize. The prime rib was tough and half was fat. I will never come back.  This place Is scam. The waiter Eddie accused us of receiving the larger size ahi.  Unbelievable service
