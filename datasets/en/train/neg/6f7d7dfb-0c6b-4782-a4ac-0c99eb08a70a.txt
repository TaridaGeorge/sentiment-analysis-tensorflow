This was my my second and final time here. I really wanted to like this place. As I love any kind of Asian food. 

My life partner warned me the first time we went here that all was not well. I know how things are supposed to taste having made my own Bulgogi from scratch. 

The meat here has absolutely no flavor. I am not sure how you suck the flavor out of meat. 

The last time I went here I ordered the Mongolian beef and it was yellow. Where did they get this unnatural color and why in my Mongolian beef. I do not appreciate coloring in my food especially if it isn't supposed to be that color. My boyfriend hated his food so much that he didn't finish. We will never be back.
