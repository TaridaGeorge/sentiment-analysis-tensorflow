I new this place sucked from the last time I ate here but for some odd reason I was tempted to eat here again well I was right it still sucks I had a hankering for spagetti and meatballs first I will say the sauce was watery and had very little flavor the meat balls tasted like a lot of filler and also had a strange flavor the bread stick was ok ...
