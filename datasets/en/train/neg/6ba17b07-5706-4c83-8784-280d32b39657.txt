We made the mistake of showing up at 4 o'clock on a Sunday afternoon. Live band was incredibly LOUD. Surprising that there was an open table on the patio, but were not greeted for at least 15 minutes. Saw lots of servers LOOK RIGHT AT US with no acknowledgement. Finally grabbed a busser and said, "we have not been greeted, 3 waters please." When she finally came over I asked for a reccomendation on perhaps a house cocktail? She said, "All of our drinks are listed in this menu." I know. I just had 15 minutes to read it. Had a beer and left. Really awful. Never again.
