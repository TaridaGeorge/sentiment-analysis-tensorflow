I spent half my life at Coney Island and wanted a NY hot dog. It wasn't here. Try Nathan's at the AZ Mills Mall...and even that ain't a Coney Island dog.

I seem to remember the very sweet and helpful waitress saying Jim wasn't from Coney Island, so I gave her a good tip before shootin' her.

Don't be fooled by the name. Looked like it was out of business last time I drove by. Maybe somethin' happened to Jim. You know what I'm talkin' about!?
