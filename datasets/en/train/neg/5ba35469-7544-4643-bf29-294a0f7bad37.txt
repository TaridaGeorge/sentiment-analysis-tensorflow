Worst KFC ever! They never have any chicken pot pie and something is always going wrong at this location. We had to wait 45 minutes to place our order because there was a problem with their computer system. We were unable to leave since we were stuck in between 2 cars. Most ghetto KFC in AZ!! Aargh! That is all!
