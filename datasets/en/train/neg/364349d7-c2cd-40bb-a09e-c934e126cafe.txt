I stopped in the retail store today to check out their selection of China Glaze nail polish colors. To their credit they did have a good variety of colors. However, after receiving an initial greeting I waited for someone to ring me up, for someone, ANYONE, to help me and out of at least 5 employees NO ONE helped me. Oh - and there were no other customers in the store. I must have waited around at least 10 minutes which was ridiculous. Finally I just walked out. Here's a huge customer service hint for this business. If you are a sales associate and you are STARING at a customer who needs help -  do your job!
