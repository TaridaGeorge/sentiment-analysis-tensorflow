OMG four and a half stars?

Apparently if you want a four and a half star performance from a sandwich, you can go to dilly's deli.  Alternatively, you can:

Go to the store.  Buy a loaf of bread.  Make your sandwich with four slices of bread, instead of two.  Put mediocre meat on it.  Serve it with a side of potato salad that has too much dill in it and will stay on your breath for a month.

Don't drink the water here because it tastes like sewage.  I could be in the minority here but the witches were in the minority during the salem witch trials and upon further review, who was right?  I rest my case.
