I would never go back.  It isn't anything special... it is just a store space with a bar and like 4 tables.  The DJ is HORRIBLE!!!  It is the same song over and over and over again, with the occassional lame ass 80's song thrown in.  The drinks are watered down and over priced (so unusual for Snotsdale, I know) and the waitresses and bartenders and BIIIIIIITCHES!!  There is just no vibe or atmosphere at this place other than "meat market".
