Look, I don't have a problem with the concept. Bring on the fun and sexy girls in lingerie. I'll eat crappy food, I'll put up with bad service, I probably won't even notice the dirty restaurant. But if that's your thing, if fun and sexy girls are your gimmick, you better make damn sure your girls are fun and sexy. Which the girls at Fantasy Grill are not. So what have you got when you remove fun and sexy girls from the equation? Crappy food, bad service and a dirty restaurant. F'in gross, man. Stay away.
