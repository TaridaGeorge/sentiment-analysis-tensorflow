Bad food. BAD service.

I ordered Cheeseburger Sliders and Tots. The sliders were a joke and the tots tasted like they were fried in very old oil. 

While I was chatting with friends while waiting for the food,  our server came over and slammed my plate down in front of me, which actually scared me and made me jump. Later on, I asked for hot sauce, and when she brought it over, she of course walked by quickly (without any eye contact) and also slammed it on the table. Everything she said to us was lazy, slurred, and unclear. On multiple occasions, we would have to ask each other "What did she say?". It was clear that she didn't want to be there. There is no reason for that bad attitude, especially since we did nothing that could have annoyed her.

Trust the negative reviews! Don't go here!
