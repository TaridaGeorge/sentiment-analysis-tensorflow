although it may look like a groove place from the outside my first visit will be the last. 

sad to think that so many people think this place is good. 

Food was below average, service was OK but i asked for my drink and got it 20 minutes later. i use to bar tended so i understand how busy it can get but wow! they didn't even care that it happened
