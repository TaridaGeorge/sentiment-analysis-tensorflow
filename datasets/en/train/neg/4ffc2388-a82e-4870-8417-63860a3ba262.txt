was a fan until recently.

I got hit by a car and had to drag the bike that I  bought from them to the store to get repaired.. well the kid that helped me was just  a prick in my tubes. gee whiz, a real douche. 

After all the money I have spent in that store, not to mention they kept my bike light after wrapping my handlebars one time.. no wonder every time I go in there there is absolutely no customers and tempe bicycle has a steady flow. This Schwinn is anything but a win- a real rip off. I hate this place now, and you should too.
