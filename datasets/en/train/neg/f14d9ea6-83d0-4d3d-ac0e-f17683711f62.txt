Don't forget anything on the table, the staff will steal it! Hope the busser enjoys the new Oakley's! The 12 year old hostesses have trouble seating and communicating with guests! For a second I thought they were gonna pass me a note and make me check yes or no if a booth was ok! And don't address the manager about anything substantial, as long as his high school staff thinks he's a cool boss, his self esteem will be neutralized! A little adult interaction might do him good!
