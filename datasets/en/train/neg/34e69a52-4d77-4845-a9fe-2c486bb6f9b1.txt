WAY over priced. They have the nerve to charge the same prices as Safeway across the street when they have a fraction of the operating costs.

The location is a dump. We're talking OLD. They have no more than two checkers on at any time - even prime post-work shopping, with a extra they can call in when the lines start working their way down the aisles. 

Deli food is meh and mostly dried out by the time you get off work. Bakery is horrible. Everything tastes like it came from a box mix, a bad box mix. You'd think with a whole store of ingredients like real flour and real milk and real butter, a store bakery would actually bake real food. (Pet peeve of mine.)
