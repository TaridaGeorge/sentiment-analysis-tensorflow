This is solely a review just on the bar:
Paid $17.50 for a washington apple and a redbull with vodka. 2 drinks, small cups, about 12 icecubes in these cups too making it about a 10 sip drink. Definitely never going back here to drink at the bar...could have bought a whole bottle of vodka for that. No wonder we only saw 2 other couples there haha, should have guessed.
