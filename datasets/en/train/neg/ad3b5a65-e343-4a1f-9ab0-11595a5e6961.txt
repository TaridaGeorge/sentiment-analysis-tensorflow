Pride is just a time to get drunk and hang out with friends. It would be a waist of time and money if you went alone. I own a gblt pet business so it may be good for advertising one year. I mean pride is for glbt people so its nice to have a place to all hang out for a weekend. It's nothing big. The parade is a different story! I would definitely recommend that!
