I've been down to the Grimaldi's in Tucson, which was much better but still a tad overrated. This one, though, was not good at all. It was lunch on a weekday (i.e, not busy at all with maybe 10% of the tables occupied), but our pizza took more than 30 minutes to come out, and our server was slow and unattentive. When the pizza finally came, the crust was soggy  (so much for "coal-fired pizza) and there just wasn't much flavor. With drinks and the (undeserved) tip, the final bill was over $40, which is pretty steep for a subpar meal.
