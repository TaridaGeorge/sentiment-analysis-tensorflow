Walked in for a drink late on a Saturday night.  There were probably 30 douches singing bad karaoke.  Bar tending services were so poor that after 5 minutes left to a local dive bar across the way that was douche free.

That said, I have heard they have good food here and maybe outside of late evenings it might be worth going to.  Will have to give them another try at a later date.
