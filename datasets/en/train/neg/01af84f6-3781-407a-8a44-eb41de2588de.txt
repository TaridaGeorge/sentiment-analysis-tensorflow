I love love love Jason's Deli and when they opened this location I was thrilled.  But, unfortunately this location is really sub-par.  They didn't give us what we ordered and then acted as though we didn't know what we ordered.  It was really unpleasant.  Jason's Deli is great just don't go to the Chandler Fashion Square location, bleh!
