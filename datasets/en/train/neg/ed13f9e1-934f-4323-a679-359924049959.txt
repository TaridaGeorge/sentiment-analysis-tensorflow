My first, last and only experience to Great Clips - Tempe, McClintock was absolutely horrible. I was asked by my stylist if I wanted my hair razor cut. I replied, "no it doesn't do anything at all for my hair, don't use a razor". She proceeded too use the scissors to essentially razor cut my hair. IT is the WORST hair cut I have ever had. By the time I realized what she had done it was too late to do anything about it. I have four more weeks of haircut hell to live through. Please dont go here. 

When I got home one of my room mates told me he had had bad experiences twice at this location and wont return either. 

Sadly, Great Clips are franchises so there is no main office to lodge a complaint with.
