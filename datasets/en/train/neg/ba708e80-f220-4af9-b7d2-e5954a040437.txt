I was in this Starbucks yesterday and ordered a frappicino. I asked for 2cups to help keep it insulated and frozen longer in this AZ heat and the girl at the register snapped. She first said I could only have a sleeve and the when I said I would pay for the second cup she preceded to tell me how un environmentally friendly I am. How inappropriate and out of line.  I will be sending a letter to their coroporate office
