I would give less stars if I could. Came here several times and seemed okay, but in the last two trips I have found hair and a sharp piece of metal (I was told was from a cleaning bristle - yuck!) in my ramen. Totally grossed out and terrified of how much it would hurt to ingest metal like that. Never returning and advise that they are seriously looked into by the health department. Even more aggravating, the lady just said "sorry guys" to the last problem with our order - no refund. Horrible place.
