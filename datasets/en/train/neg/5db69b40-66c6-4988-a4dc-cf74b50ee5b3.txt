Really disappointed.... the owner "sharon" was rude and unhelpful. She was getting almost hostile when we questioned the prices of some of her "precious" angels. Didn't get a good vibe from her just because she was so focased on making the sale didn't really care about what we wanted... go to Devotion Christian Store if you want a helpful staff with reasonable prices
