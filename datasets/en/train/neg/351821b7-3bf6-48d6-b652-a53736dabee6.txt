No more $1 beers and lowered crown credits! Don't bother going to this shit hole. It has gone way downhill in the last few months. Machines are outdated and now my favorite quarter machines that actually have a bonus feature were changed to a penny denomination. Won't be back! Poor return for what your bet is. Virtually impossible to even win a little to keep playing. Take your business to Casino Arizona!
