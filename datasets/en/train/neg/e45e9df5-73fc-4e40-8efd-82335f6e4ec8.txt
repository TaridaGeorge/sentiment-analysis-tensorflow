Another popular place in Phoenix but I gotta say why? The food is the average run of the mill type you find all over Phoenix and what a disappointment that is after waiting 2+ hours to get in. The atmosphere is nice but the services lacks and the attitude reminds me of a restaurant better suited for a Scottsdale location. You defiantly get a sense from the place that they think they are the cats meow. Totally over priced for what you get and the quality. Try the Parlor or Cibo less attitude better food.
