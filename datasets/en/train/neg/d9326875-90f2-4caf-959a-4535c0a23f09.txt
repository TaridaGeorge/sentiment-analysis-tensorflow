We received a flier for this restaurant through the door and decided to give it a chance.  I was extremely disappointed with our food. Our order was missing the starter we ordered but the main problem was that  the food was inedible. It smelled of fish upon opening, I got beef and my partner got chicken both smelled horrible and tasted disgusting. The entire order had to be thrown in the trash as it was completely inedible.  I would never order food here again.
