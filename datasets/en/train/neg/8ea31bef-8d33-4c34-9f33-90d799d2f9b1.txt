-This place SHOULD be CLOSED for many reasons, but it's still OPEN for business.

-The decor and merchandise looks cheap and low quality.

-The service is CRAP! Why is there ONLY 1 cashier in K-Mart? 

-Prices seem higher than T & W.

-The (other) cashier in the Garden dept put my merchandise on the dirty counter BEHIND him instead of just placing it in the plastic Kmart bag after ringing up...what a douche!

-Half of the parking lot was unpaved with pot holes and gravel...WTH? Was I in a rural area?

-Before Target & Wal-Mart, there was K-Mart (remember ICEES & blue-light specials?)...next time you want to complain about Wal-Mart, visit your local K-mart store and you'll appreciate Wal-Mart even more!
