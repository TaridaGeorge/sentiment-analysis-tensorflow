Wow I can't believe how disappointing our meal to go was.  I've never ever seen such small portions. I ordered veal piccata and it was tiny there was two small thin medallions. I also ordered calamari specifically for the lemon butter sauce and I never got it I got marinara. Sad state of affairs at this place never ever again even if it was free.
