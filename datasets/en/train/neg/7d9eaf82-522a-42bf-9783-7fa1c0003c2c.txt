We went here on a lunch break one day just to get dessert.  Little did we know that after ordering a malt and a shake, we would wait in the drive through for literally 15 minutes.  About 5 minutes into it, we started looking for escape routes.  Just as I was about to back up a bit and sneak around, another car boxed us in.  Its not like they had a huge line either.  That 15 minutes was spent second in line.  They didn't get anyone through.  I cannot speak to the quality of their particular chocolate desserts since we just peaced out.  We ran out of time waiting for them.  Next time we'll go to smashburger just down the road.
