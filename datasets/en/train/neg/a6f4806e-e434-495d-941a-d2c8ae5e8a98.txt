Eewww. I don't like being in a room where it's standing room only, unless you shell out big bucks to sit in a booth. Mediocre guy candy unless you like short guys in Affliction or douche bags in pinstripes. Alas, that seems to be much of Snottsdale these days. I guess I'm a dive bar kinda gal.  I'll save my skanky dresses for Vegas :)
