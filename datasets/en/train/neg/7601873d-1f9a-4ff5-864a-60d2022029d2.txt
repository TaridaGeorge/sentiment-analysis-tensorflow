WORST FOOD EVER!! 

I went there for their lunch specials and got the sweet and sour chicken. 

The egg roll was great, but the sweet and sour chicken was horrible. The sauce had no flavor and ruined my entire dish. Depending on your liking, the there were very thick peices of chicken within the dish with very little breading. I personal enjoy breading with my sweet and sour chicken.
