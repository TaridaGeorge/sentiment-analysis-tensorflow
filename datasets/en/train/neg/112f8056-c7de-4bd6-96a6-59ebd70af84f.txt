Worst spaghetti and meatballs ever, bar none.  It's like they were trying to make me send it back (it worked).  The pasta was overcooked and tasted like it was out of a pack of ramen; the sauce was reminiscent of Chef Boyardee; and the meatballs were...odd...

On the upside, the service was very prompt and friendly.
