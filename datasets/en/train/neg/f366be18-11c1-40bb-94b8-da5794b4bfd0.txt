Meagre selection. Terrible service. Never again.

I've been a few times and have never received stellar or knowledgeable help (about what I expect from Home Depot), but they're fairly close to my house and have a larger selection of potted plants than the big boxes.

This last time I went I asked for assistance from two separate associates to try and find seeds and was blown off rudely by both of them. They just shrugged, told me the seeds were in alphabetical order and walked away. I pointed out to one of the associates that the seeds weren't even close to being alphabetical, he tried to argue, pointed at the seeds, then shrugged and said "well, that's as good as it can be" and walked away. Neither associate knew if they had the seeds, nor did they know where they would be. Both were surly and rude.
