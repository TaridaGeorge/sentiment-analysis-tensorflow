I was here a few days ago to pick up some coffee and the Arizona Burro. I went through the drive-thru and there were tons of flies flying in and out of the open drive-thru window (and into my car as well) and landing in the open peanut butter container I could see. Having flies everywhere is not a good sign of cleanliness at all. This is awful.
