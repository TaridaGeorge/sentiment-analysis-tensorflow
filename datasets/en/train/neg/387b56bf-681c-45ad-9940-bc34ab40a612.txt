I have for many months tried through common sence verbal comunication to resolve the issue with the outdoor Maintenance / Landscapers that will not stop using leaf blowers near the parked vehicles. The forman [Lewis , a total retard] has either decided to ignore polite requests or just does not give a sh!t that he is doing damage to the MEMBERS CARS!
On a side note: These incompetents can't seem to pick up the broken glass, trash, dead birds [three have been in the parking lot for months], tree limbs that litter the lot, but they can blow dirt and crap on every vehicle in the parking lot.
In closing it would be a nice change for 24 Hour Fitness to actually resolve an ISSUE, making excuses is not RESOLUTION! I won't hold my breath!
