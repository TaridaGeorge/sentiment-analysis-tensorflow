First impression: This place smells like a locker room. YUCK!  After visiting other gyms to price shop, I immediately noticed the odor here compared to the other gyms I visited. The General Manager was rude and pushy and ended up giving me a lecture about how to look for gyms when I didn't like the $199 initiation fee he wanted to charge.  I won't be frequenting this establishment any time soon.
