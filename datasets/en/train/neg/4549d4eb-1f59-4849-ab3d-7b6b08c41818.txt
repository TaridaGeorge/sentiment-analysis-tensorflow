OK: what happened?

Several of us stopped by this 5 & Diner location (Arizona Mills) around 7 PM today (11-10-2012) and they are CLOSED!

There was a handwritten sign on the front door stating in essence 'we're closed and thanks for the memories'. I'm guessing Val threw in the towel. :(

I'd give this store 4 stars since I've eaten here in the past but the sudden and unannounced closure earned it a single one.
