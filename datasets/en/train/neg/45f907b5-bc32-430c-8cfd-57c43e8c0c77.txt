I have been coming to this place for lunch for the past six years I have worked downtown Phoenix. The food is actually pretty good, but they get cheaper and cheaper on their portioning each time I go. I ordered a large pasta bowl to go, and it was barely half full. For $9.00 I expect to get what I pay for. I won't be surprised if they start counting out the pasta pretty soon. There are fare better places I can go for lunch here in the downtown area, that I don't need to spend my money at this place and get half of what I paid for.
