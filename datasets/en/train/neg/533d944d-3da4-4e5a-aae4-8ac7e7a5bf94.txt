I purchased an iced coffee and they put so much ice in the cup, you could barely keep the lid closed. Basically, I took one sip and my drink was GONE. I complained to the staff, but they said they only put 6oz of coffee in there. Give me a break!!! $3.00 for 6oz? Ridiculous, I will never go back there again, the place is like a money grab and I feel like they stole from me!!
