We were seated and our drink order wasn't taken for a good 5 minutes. There were literally 6 girls standing in the front talking, 2 at the bar talk and random girls just pacing back and forth. We get our expensive appetizer and all the sudden there is like a family of flies hovering around our table. I order a ceaser salad and I get this wilted mushy bowl of greens with three croutons. Gross.
