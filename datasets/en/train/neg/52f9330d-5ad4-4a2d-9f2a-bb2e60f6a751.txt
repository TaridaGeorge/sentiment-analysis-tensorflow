This was, by far, the absolutely worst Thai food I have ever had the displeasure to eat. The meat was very tough and just not tasty at all. I could have done a much better job and, believe me, my cooking skills or, rather lack thereof, are nothing to email home about. I was extremely disappointed with their food. Obviously I won't be back!
