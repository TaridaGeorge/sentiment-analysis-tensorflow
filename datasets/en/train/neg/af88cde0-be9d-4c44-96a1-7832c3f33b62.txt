This practice is great at everything: till they get your money, then GOOD LUCK! Refused to reline my denture unless I paid almost $800.00 and it was WITHIN THE SIX MONTH time period as stated in treatment plan. Letter and phone call got me nowhere. Proceed with caution and hold back a little $ if you can or you may NOT get what you need or paid for!!!!......still walking around with NO top teeth two years later!!! Thanks  for nothing!
