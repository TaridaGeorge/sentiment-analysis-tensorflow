Never will I go to this again. There was NO organization. We waited in our car for over 45min to park(should have left then) We then paid to park $5. Then it was $10 to get in. We waited in line for 2hrs and moved 30 ft and still had 50ft to go. We left at that point with out eating one thing. DO NOT GO TO THIS EVENT NEXT TIME.
