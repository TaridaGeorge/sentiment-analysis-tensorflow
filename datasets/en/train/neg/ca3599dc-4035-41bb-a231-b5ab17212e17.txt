Have to agree with Brandon. I've been to this Taco Bell 3times since it's closest to me and I get sick everytime and not just upset stomach I mean really really sick. Their food doesn't taste right here, after going to culinary school I'm guessing it's the way they handle it that makes it taste weird and make you sick. Stay away!! I'm thinking of writing corporate about this location, every other one I've been to is fine but this one...something just isn't right! Take the extra five mins and go a little further to another location and avoid getting sick!
