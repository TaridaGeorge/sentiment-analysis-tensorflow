Awful. Like, really awful.  Prices are extremely overpriced for the products they have-- as expensive as Whole Foods, but not even organic!  The staff is very mean and definitely not afraid to yell at their customers.  The only thing that is good about the store is the organization of the products.  Everything else stinks! I will never go back to this store.
