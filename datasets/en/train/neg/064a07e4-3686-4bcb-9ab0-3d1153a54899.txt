How the hell you gonna trust a place to be authentic when they don't even know the difference between "parmesan" and "parmagiana," so they just combine them into a made up word. (WHAT THE HELL IS PARMASANA?)

"Parmagiana" is a style of cooking. "Parmesan" is the cheese you sprinkle on your spaghetti.

God! People can be so stupid.
