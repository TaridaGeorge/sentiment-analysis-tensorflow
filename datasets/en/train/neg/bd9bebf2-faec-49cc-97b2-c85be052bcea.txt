This place does not fulfill the "ultimate ice cream experience."  The manager is completely rude and inconsiderate to the customers requests. I go to this Cold Stone several times because the other ones are too far from where I live. I have found hair, bugs, and even broken finger nails inside my ice-cream. The place has cockroaches and the lobby is never cleaned. Every time I walk in, it is a disaster. The tables are sticky with ice-cream and so is the floors. The workers all tell me they dislike their boss and all want to leave.

What kind of franchise is Cold Stone running?

I do not recommend this Cold Stone at all!  I stopped going last month.
