This place seems to have a nice selection of linens but somehow they never have IN STOCK what I NEED. I came in here for a Bed-In-a-Bag Set and they had tons of them but none in the size I needed. I asked the employee if they had any other sizes in the back and she said "no" and walked away. She didn't offer to locate a store that had it or anything, lol! On the way out she had the nerve to ask if I found what I needed... "ummmmm No!"
