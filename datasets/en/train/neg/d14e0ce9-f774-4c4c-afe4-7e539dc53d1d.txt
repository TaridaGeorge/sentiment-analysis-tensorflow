I chose this place for somewhere different and the reviews were mixed.
 
The website's view of the inside of the bar is taken from a wide angle lens and it was smaller than I expected but I liked the eclectic feel. 
The music was good but the drinks were horrible (watered down and tasteless) the saki was watered down too. 
We just went there for appetizers and drinks and the food was less than average, like supermarket sushi at Trader Joes, bland. 

Quite a few guys with guys, so if you are a single lady or a married one who's husband got hit on like me, then pass this place up. 

The toilet was the only nice thing about this place.
