One star for the raw chicken they served me. Nice Pizza Hut.  My bad for going here I guess.  Hope I don't get sick from it.  I take back any good experience I may have had with them because of this.   

They did take 50% off the meal, but I was so grossed out it was hard to eat anything else and I think if you get served RAW CHICKEN you should be comped the entire meal.  Sounds fair to me.
