Well, I'll never get that 20 minutes back.  The bad and ugly..not sure there was a good.  

I phoned the 7th Ave location of Edible Arrangements thinking it was the closest to my client's office.  There is a $12 delivery fee to drive less than 3 miles.  Seems a bit much to me.

I was on hold for over 10 minutes. I think the poor guy on the phone was the only employee working at the time.

Overall, the entire experience was unpleasant.  The product seems overpriced, along with poor customer service.  I'd rather give my client a fruit tray from AJ's.
