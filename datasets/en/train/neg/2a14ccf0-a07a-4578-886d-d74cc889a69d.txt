Been going to 6 since it opened. Always gave it thumbs up because it was always classy and you meet some cool people in there. Especially during the week.
BUT in the last year or so it has taken a nose dive. Yeah sure it packed, with the  population growth this area has seen in the last 5 years any club in the Stetson rd area will be packed.
The lighting in there sucks, it's so hard to see who you are talking to. The DJ's typically play the same stuff all the other clubs do, so it basically the flavor of the month. I like clubs who have balls to play something totally different. 

If something changes soon they may hold their good rating but for now I got to go low.
