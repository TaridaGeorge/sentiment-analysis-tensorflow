Sorry, but I HATE this pathetic place! usually full of total losers, yet it gets pretty crowded. Poor phoenix, people just don't know better in this city. It's kinda sad, actually. Then when an a super cool & totally fun Event comes to Club STRATUS on 23rd Ave near Grand, hardly anyone goes! It's way better, more modern & no rif-raf losers. It is more 'Circuit party-ish", which Phoenix lacks, otherwise, you would have to leave the damn state to attend a Circuit Party Event, which is pretty much nonexistent in AZ.
