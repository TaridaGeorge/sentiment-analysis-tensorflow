I've only been to Jugheads for Sadisco, the goth/industrial night, and I wasn't impressed. Jugheads isn't as much a bar as a series of fences, ramshackle walls and bits of trash. I don't know what the drink prices are like, because I've never felt comfortable enough to have a drink there.

The parking lot is a mess, and I'm surprised there isn't a crash every night. There isn't much room to move, and it's poorly lit. If you do go, try parking in a lot west of the bar, near the Delhi Palace. There's lots of parking there.

During the last Sadisco Fight Club, an amateur brawler was knocked unconscious and couldn't be revived. That resulted in a visit from the cops and paramedics. The bar was shut down, and my $15 cover went to waste. 

I likely won't be back.
