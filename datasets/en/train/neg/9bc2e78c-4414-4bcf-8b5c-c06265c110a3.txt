I just received a delivery of flowers from here. The petals are falling off the daisies  and the other flowers are half dead. Some have brown curling tips. Two flowers have no petals at all.  It looks at least 5 days old. I tried calling the florist and got a message that the mailbox was full. You may get fresh flowers in the shop but, delivery flowers are old.
Changing to 4 stars for customer service. I called again and spoke to Judy. A new bouquet was send and the old one taken.  
Changing back to one star. The "new" bouquet was just as old and will have to be thrown out today. Flowers from a florist should last up to a week and sometimes longer if you change the water every day and trim the ends every second day.
