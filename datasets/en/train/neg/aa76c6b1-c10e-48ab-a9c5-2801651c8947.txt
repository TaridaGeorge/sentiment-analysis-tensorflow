The WORST WORST WORST place in town.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN !!!

The dryers didn't work leaving my clothes sopping wet and the 2 extremely RUDE women working there, REFUSED to refund my money.  

The place was filthy dirty and crowded and there were not enough laundry carts. 

Moreover, the women working there had a HORRIBLE ATTITUDE toward the customers.

There's hardly ever any parking spaces available and homeless bums, drug addicts and drunks hang out in front bothering customers for spare change...

DON"T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE PEOPLE.  

THE WORST !!!!
