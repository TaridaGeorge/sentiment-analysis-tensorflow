Not going back. I made an online web order and appointment with out the door price for $134 including all disposal fees taxes and installation. I sent my 17yo son in to get a tire replaced and upon completing the work they told him it would be $160+. Luckily I had told him how much it was going to be and he told them it was supposed to be $134 and the clerk quickly changed it back. Very shady...My son had a learning experience, trust no one and get a price up front.
