I wouldn't even give this place one star! We researched on the Internet and decided to check it out. We drove an hour and when we reach the place it's freakn CLOSED! There was nothing on the Internet about that. Sign said closed for reorganization. So we called to see when they would be open thinking that hopefully the would be open before I leave Phoenix in a week. But guess what? The freakn phone number had been disconnected! Go figure! Even if they were to call and say we're open tomorrow I wouldn't go back.
