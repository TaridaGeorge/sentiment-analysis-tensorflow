We went to Brio for our 4 year anniversary and were very disappointed. It was our first time ever at Brio and we've heard good things so we thought we'd try it. Our server was great, but the food not so much. We don't mind spending extra money on good food but we ended up spending extra money on mediocre, bland food. My boy friend got raviolis which were 16 dollars and came with 5 bite sized raviolis. My pasta was bland and I ended up adding extra pepper to it just so it could have some flavor. We ended up spending over $100 on bad food.  Needless to say, we won't be going to brio ever again.
