This is one of the worst grocery stores I have been to.  It's hard to tell if its a really nice Food City or if it is a very bad Bashas.  The store is always in shambles and looks like it has never been remodeled since opening day back in the 80s.  The floor has crap stacked all over all the time and looks like hell.  Then you go to check out and there is one line open and the cashier chats it up with the people in front of you.  HELLO, I have stuff to do and places to be!  I can not stand this Bashas and hope it closes soon.
