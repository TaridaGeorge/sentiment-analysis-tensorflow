THEY DESERVE ZERO STARS!  Unfortunately, that's not an option.  I've never seen a business that provides such HORRIBLE customer service.  Danny's has the worst car wash service in the valley.  I would rather wash my own car or pay a mobile detailer, before giving them another penny.  After they dented my car and then wouldn't take care of it, I will NEVER visit another Danny's Family Car wash or convenient store.....Everyone if you really need a convenient store you should visit the Newer Circle K on Happy Valley and 19th Ave.
