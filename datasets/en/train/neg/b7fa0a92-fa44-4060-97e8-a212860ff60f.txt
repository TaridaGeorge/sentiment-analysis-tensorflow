I never write reviews.  But then I went to Armando's and felt the need to share.   I had a breakfast burrito, and i'll admit it was good until an uneasy feeling hit my stomach a couple hours later.  Food poisoning.   One of the worst experiences of my life.   Even my dog, who sniffs her own shit couldn't stand to be around me for 2 days.   I will never go back to this place.
