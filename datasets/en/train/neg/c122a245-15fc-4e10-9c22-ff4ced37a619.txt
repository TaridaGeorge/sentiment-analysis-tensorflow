The place is a joke.  It thinks it's about 5-6 miles south in old town, but forgets that it shares a parking lot with Safeway and a bunch of other stores.  This was the first time (and hopefully the last) I paid $10 cover and $10 a drink while parking next to a shopping cart return.

They make a feeble attempt to prop the lace up as a destination, but once you're inside, you tend to wonder why there's a dress code.  Are they really that offended by toes?

Thankfully, there are several places nearby that are more fun- with no cover no less- so location saves it.  You can have far more fun at Sand Bar, Ernie's, Tapino, and Dirty Dogg.
