This is a very frustrating store. Even though it opens at 6am, the deli, the bakery and the pharmacy are not open until much later. The current ad had a deli rotisserie turkey breast on sale. Instead of making my grocery run at my usual 6am (when it is reasonably cool outside) I waited until 10am in case they needed to make up a fresh batch (surely that is sufficient time to roast a turkey breast) and guess what----I was told it would be another HOUR before this advertised item was available! REALLY??? It is is over 100 degrees outside at 10am and will just get hotter as the day wears on. NO, I am not interested in coming back to your store.
