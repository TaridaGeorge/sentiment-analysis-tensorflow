CityNorth is a failure, quite frankly.

It's a great idea, with a large budget...

But it jumped the gun and was swallowed by the recession. North of Deer Valley is still largely undeveloped still, therefore, CityNorth isn't the "city-center" it aims to be, it's an edge of the city catastrophe. 

There's one "street" open, as all the other phases have yet to be completed. Bloomingdale's pulled out, Nordstrom pulled out, etc. The entire project just blows.
