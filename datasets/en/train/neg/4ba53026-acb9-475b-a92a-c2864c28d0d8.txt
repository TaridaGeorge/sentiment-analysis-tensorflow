About 6 months ago, I left a comment on the McDonalds Corporate website describing that there store at this location had a dirty dining area.  Soon after that, a manager called me apologizing.
Well, a few days ago we stopped here, order some food, and went into the dining area.  The internal disposal areas were over flowing with trays and food wrapping.  I watched as patrons wondered where they should put their trays and left overs.  Also, one area was inaccessible because there was standing water in the dining area floor.  Yet, there must of of been 10 employees behind the counter taking orders. I would guess the speed in which they process orders is paramount - cleanness in the dinning area is not.  Never again.  (These comments refer to the McDonalds on Estrella Parkway - not the McDonalds inside Wal-Mart.)
