This place is the pits.  I  would imagine NYC pizza would taste like their pizza if it was mailed to them via ground shipping then microwaved. In other words, their pizza is horrible.  I also had wings.  They were red in the middle.  I asked the server what what was about and he said they were not raw, they are pre cooked and flash fried.  He also said the quality of the meat is also the reason it's red.  I wish he just told me they were raw.

I should have known this place sucked when Oreganos next door has a hour wait and this crap hole has no one in it on a Saturday night.
