They really need to get a better drive-through speaker.  I had to repeat my order 5 times after waiting several minutes to even get someone to take my order.  When I went to the window, my order was still wrong, which was then fixed.  I got home, to discover that even with the correction at the window, they gave me the wrong shake.  I've had problems ordering from this drive-through almost every single time I've been here, but this was the last straw.  Never planning on ordering from here again.
