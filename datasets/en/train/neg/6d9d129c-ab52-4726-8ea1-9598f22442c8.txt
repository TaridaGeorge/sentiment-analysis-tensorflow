One of the worst experiences I've had while dining out. It took 14 minutes to get greeted and our drink orders took another 18. I didn't like my margarita and I didn't drink it (it had no flavor) and ordered another drink yet our waitress didn't take it off the bill. The food was good but nothing outstanding. We waited way too long for our drinks and dinner, and the waitress knew nothing about the menu so we will definitely not be returning. Try sauce though! Another Fox concept around the corner. Much better!
