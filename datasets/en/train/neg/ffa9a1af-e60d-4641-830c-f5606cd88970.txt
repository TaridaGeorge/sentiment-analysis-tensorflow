I don't know if it's because it was a Sunday night...but I thought that the rapture had happened or something.  Not a soul was to be found in there...it was actually kind of creepy.  Games were on TV but I got the whole Resident Evil vibe from the place!  I figured it would pick up and I figured wrong...two beers and I was outta there....felt like a dumbass for even staying for one beer!

FAIL!
