i'd been coming to them for a year now, i went one day & the regular nancy they call her was sooo BEGGING & RUDE to me! she kept asking me to add services upon services which i didn't want, she then started speaking her language to other workers (very obvious she was complaining about me) i pay well & tip so im not understanding this sudden urge of adding MORE services, i felt VERY uncomfortable & let the owner know i'd probably NOT be coming back again!

this shop needs to be GRATEFUL to regular customers & NOT brow beat or downtalk the customer VERY BAD HORRIBLE business practice!!!! well they WON'T see my hard earned money anymore & i am VERY wealthy as well as budget and allow my wealth to grow! they need to improve customer service skills!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
