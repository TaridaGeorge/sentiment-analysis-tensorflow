If anyone thinks this place is authentic... I wonder what they consider Taco Bell to be? Heaven? I had the bland Chicken Burro which was very disappointing. Then I also had 2 Tamales with Rice and Beans. My friend had 2 Cheese Enchilada plate. When we opened them, we couldn't tell the difference. They were both swimming in the same canned sauce. The only way to tell the difference was finding the maize from a Tamale. As for the rice, I never knew Spanish Rice was supposed to be crunchy and undercooked.... Just over all a let down. AZ should open the border back up and get real food here. If you are a true foodie, don't bother with this place.
