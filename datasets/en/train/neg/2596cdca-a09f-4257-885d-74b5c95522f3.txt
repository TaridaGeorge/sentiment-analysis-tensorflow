I had been looking forward to dining here for some time.  I liked the bar alot but once we sat down for dinner things didn't go so well.  I had one of the fish, I forgot which one, that came with a lemon sauce.  It was tasteless.  They were very nice and I sent it back and got the Veal Piccata.  It wasn't good at all.  The veal was more 4 thin McDonald's hamburger patties and had no flavor.  It wasn't just me, I had 3 others at the table try the dishes.  One of my guests had the Artic Char and it was nice.  The other person had a steak and it wasn't cooked properly so he sent it back at which time it came back fine.  Overall, not impressed.  I'll go back to the bar for a cocktail, I won't try the food again.
