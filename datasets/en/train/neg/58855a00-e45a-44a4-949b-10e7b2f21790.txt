Wow, what a letdown.
To start, service was not very good.  Nobody seemed to be in charge.  Waiter was not attentive.

I ordered Granola Healthcakes With Blueberries And Strawberries.  My gosh, could you be a little stingier with the fruit?  They sprinkled the tiniest handful of fruit on top, so little that there wasn't nearly enough for a little fruit in every bite.  More of a suggestion of fruit than fruit itself.  The granola is obviously not made in house - it's very industrial - uniform, uniformly tasteless nuggets.  

The menu says pancakes are served with "maple syrup and honey butter."  Not so!  Maple syrup isn't even available!  It's just "pancake syrup."  Ewww.  I suspect the "honey butter" likewise isn't real butter but probably margarine.  Ewww.  

Breakfast potatoes, allegedly made from fresh, were just okay.

Definitely will NOT return!
