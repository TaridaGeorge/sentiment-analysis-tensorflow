I am giving up on AT&T/Singular.  As long as I stayed with the cheapest cell phone I think known to man, they worked fine for me?  Three phones and a few years later I am giving up.  l am a caregiver for a lady who is older.  I can't tell you how many times she and other people have told me they can't get through to me when I haven't left the city limits.  If I am going to have a stupid cell phone-I could live with out it, I'd like to get at least 60% of my calls.  Verizion is always rated the highest in virtually every study I read.  It is also the most expensive which I can deal with if I can get my calls.  I can keep my same number and get better service-I Hope, I hope, I hope.
