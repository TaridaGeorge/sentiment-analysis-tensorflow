Stay away unless you like huge crowds and hidden fees. They say their membership is $19 something a month, billed bi weekly (so $9.97) every two weeks. This is a good deal, but what they don't say is that you are billed an extra $40.00 a year for a rate guarantee fee. Plus since they've drastically lowered their prices the place is crowded all the time. Not worth the hassle or the hidden fees.
