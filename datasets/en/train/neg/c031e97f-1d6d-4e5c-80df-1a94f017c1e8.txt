Flew out in February and it was the second worst airport experience I have ever had (first was the airport in Burbank CA... what a dump!!!).  It took over an hour to get thru security with maybe 20 people in front of me and all 4 lines open.  And the agents were the rudest, nastiest, dirtiest, foul mouthed  people I have ever seen in my life.  Yes, they were cursing at people and shoving us and yelling at us like cattle. I couldn't believe it! I was floored!!  I'm still in shock.  And what are we to do?  NOTHING!! Because if you say anything then you will get arrested.
