Wanted to try this since it was close to home. Went midday and got the pulled pork, corn soufflee, cole slaw, and Dr. Pepper. 
Meat was not at all warm.
Corn dish was fine, but tepid.
Can't screw up cole slaw.
Dr. Pepper ONLY came in REALLY small bottles, like 6 or 8 ounces. Had FOUR.
Had pecan pie for dessert. Typical commercial type, so nothing special.

OH -- and ONE slice of almost stale white bread.

Cornbread would have been a better option.

Will NOT be returning there.  SORELY DISAPPOINTED !!!
