The reviews here are true! Also, there are 2 review pages for this local. Don't be fooled! I pay to have my car detailed. They DONOT thoroughly clean the car before the fax your vehicle causing HUGE swirl marks throughout the paint. They are lazy and expect you to believe their BS when they say the car looked like that when they started working on it. My car was 2 week old and just came off the boat from Japan when I had it waxed at this facility. It have 200 miles on it. I had to threat nearly everyone to lay down compound and fix the swirls they put into the car. Needless to say I will never come back. If you do not value your car.. feel free to have them touch it.
