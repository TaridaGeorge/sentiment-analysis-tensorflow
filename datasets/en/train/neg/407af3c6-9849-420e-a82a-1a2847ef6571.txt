First time, ordered the turkey.  The sandwich was plain, cafeteria style.  The tomatoes were mushy and the turkey tasted like it had been refrigerated for a long time.  I only ate half of the sandwich before I couldn't stomach it anymore.

The staff was friendly, and they did get my order right.  However, the music was too loud.
