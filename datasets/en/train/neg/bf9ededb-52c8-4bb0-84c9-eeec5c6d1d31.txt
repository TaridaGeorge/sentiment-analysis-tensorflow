A real tragedy. A place that once excelled in concept, food and service as has taken a real nose dive. In the past, the food and atmosphere were wonderful. My latest experience went as such: Upon arrival, we waited for waitresses to stop chatting and seat us- a few minutes. Another 10 minutes to get a menu. Another 15 to order. About 20 to get simple breakfast food. 2 bites to determine my food was bad- rancid bad. Another 15 minutes to send it back and ask for the menu to order something new. Another 10 minutes to receive said menu. Another  15 or more for waitress to come and ask if I actually wanted to order something. At that point, I can honestly say I didn't. 

I won't be going here again unless 1) hell freezes over or 2) there is a public proclamation of new ownership/staff.
