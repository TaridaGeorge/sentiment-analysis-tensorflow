I recently moved from an Equity Property and was charged outlandish charges. I went to them to correct the bill, which they realized the mistake. They told me to wait to get a new statement to pay. In the mean time I got a letter from the office manager threatening turning it over to collections and my social to some housing agency they all report to so I would have a difficult time ever renting again. I would recommend not just paying them but go over your statement. I would also never recommend you renting from them. I was in Crown Court; which my sales person Lavina was and is amazing, at least they hire some quality people. If they could only get their companies ethics in check.
