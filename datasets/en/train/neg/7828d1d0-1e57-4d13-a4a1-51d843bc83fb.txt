I really don't like this gym for many of the same reasons other reviewers have given.  Old building, old broken equipment and machines, no sanitizers, small TVs that never waver from MSNBC and ESPN, uninspiring music selection over the speakers (sometimes TOO LOUD), employees that don't give a damn, etc.   

The only reason I go here?  My husband likes it for the location (centrally located to work out with his buddies) and the racquetball courts.  I tell myself we're carpooling to save gas.  I'm sure these (along with the outdoor track and pool) are the only reasons why people bother to come to this gym.
