Fail!

After having an okay dinner on a Sunday night, we ordered dessert here. There was an all new wait staff and they kept changing the music from Indian to Korean. 

My husband ordered the dessert called Ras Malai. He started to eat it and then it kept tasting worse and worse to him. I tried it and I threw up in my napkin. It was awful! 

When I called the waiter over to tell him that the Ras Malai had gone bad he said that "I thought that it looked a little iffy, but brought it out anyway." WTF!!!!! Even our kid had taken a bite when we first got it. Husband spent the night in the bathroom to say the least. 

What a bloody awful experience here. I am really questioning the freshness of ALL foods here now. Yuck!
