Terrible car wash. They are so busy that they let the vehicles air dry instead of wiping them down but when they do wipe them it's with a wet towel.   Worst car wash ever. Streaks where they did wipe down. Windshield dirty inside and out. Road and bug residue all over the front after the wash. Outside rubber and plastic treatment applied with many missing spots.   They may do good elsewhere but don't recommend this place at all.
