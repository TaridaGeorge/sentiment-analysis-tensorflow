Played here today. Course is in terrible shape. Greens are burnt and most have weeds growing on some portion of them. As well, many greens are mis-cut with varying depths of cuts across the greens. Collars around bunkers in most places are at least 6-8 inches deep of tough, just ridiculous. Tee boxes - some were burnt out, some were cut no less than two weeks ago. Most tee boxes are angled and not flat, horrible. because the course sits in a flood plain, when the monsoon rains accumulate water, it has nowhere to go, so the course smells like raw sewage. Doug in the pro shop is rude and unprofessional.
