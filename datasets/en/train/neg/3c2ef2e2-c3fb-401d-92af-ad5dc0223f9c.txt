We had absolutely terrible experiences with this company. We called many times, leaving messages because no one answers the phone -- EVER. After an extended phone tag, we finally reached them. For example, it took over 2 weeks to get a phone call from the owner! They don't even ask your name, they file everything by "your cross streets." I agree with the other reviewer - this fellow is in way over his head. Anyway, we finally had one scheduled and then the cleaner calls and wants to bring a 2-yr old child along for the three or four hours she would be in our home. How unprofessional this outfit is - stay away!
