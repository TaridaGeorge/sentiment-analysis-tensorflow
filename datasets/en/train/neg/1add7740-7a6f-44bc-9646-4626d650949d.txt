Just checked out of this hell-hole hotel. Don't blame the staff for this mess, however...they were both friendly and helpful. The problem is that this place reeks of cheap. Yes there's a pricey Kartell Ghost Chair here and there, but other than that the negative reviews people have mentioned about the run-down conditions of this place are true. Think IKEA meets Howard Johnson's and you've got the idea.

They did upgrade us from our $300 king pool view room to an apartment...an enormous space with a separate living room, dining room, and three private terraces. But that only meant there was three times as much that needed to be gutted and re-done. Shame on you, Morgans Hotel Group, for misrepresenting this property. Next time I'll be staying at the Sanctuary at Camelback.
