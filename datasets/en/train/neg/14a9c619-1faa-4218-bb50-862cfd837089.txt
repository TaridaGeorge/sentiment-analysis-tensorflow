I am preparing to travel with small dog and need pricing for health certificate.  I called a few places....when I called here I was told "no pricing over the phone".  What?  Are you kidding?  Not even for the document? How about price for office visit?  NO...she told me no pricing given for ANYTHING over the phone.  I suspect it is on the same lines as a restaurant with no pricing on the menu...I can't afford it.  This was the ONLY place that could not give me a price for a simple office visit or health certificate.
