Customer service was really bad.  I didn't want to ship a package, so the "fedex" guys just brushed me off to go do my own thing.  I just walked out the door.  

What happened to Kinkos?  It's been awhile since I used them and no wonder.  Kinkos use to have great customer service and a variety of paper to choose from for your printing needs.  Not anymore.  They now lack in service, quality, and variety.  No bueno!

I will not be going back.
