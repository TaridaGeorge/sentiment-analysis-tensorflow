I almost choked to death on my free water when I saw the "Like Infiniti on Camelback" for Facebook. This was probably the worst car buying experience of my life with the exception of Pinnacle Nissan. These dummies let me walk from the bargaining table not once but twice. Unwilling to budge for under  800 dollars their negotiation skills are total crap. Best to stick with the smaller car dealers  for pre-owned vehicles. I was not surprised to find out that the company that owns Pinnacle Nissan also owns Infiniti on Camelback. Word of advice salesmen, don't let the customer leave angry. They will probably delete this post on their Facebook Page so I will also put it on Yelp.
