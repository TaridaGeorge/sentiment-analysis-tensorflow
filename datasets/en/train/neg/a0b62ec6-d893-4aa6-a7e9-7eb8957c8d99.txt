GROSS! XP 

I had lunch here with an office group at a coworker's recommendation. It reminded me of Panda Express. I ordered the catarpiller roll for $7.49. It took FOREVER to arrive, which was ironic for a fast food place. If I have to wait 20 minutes for a roll, I'd rather get good sushi. My food was served in a styrofoam box, and it was disgusting. It was warm and squishy, and fell apart when I tried to pick it up with chopsticks. 

My friends ordered teriyaki bowls for a little more than $6. I tried some, and thought the meat was dry, and the teriyaki sauce was sloppy. The portions were small, and not worth the price. 

I will never go here again.
