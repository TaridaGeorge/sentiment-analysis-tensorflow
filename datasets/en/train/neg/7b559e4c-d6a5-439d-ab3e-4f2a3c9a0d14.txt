I lost the screw in my glasses.  I went to COSTCO and they could not fix them and gave me a card for this place.  He told me I needed a new arm because the hinge was cracked; however, I had already put in a temporary screw and did not see what he saw.  He wanted $38.00 to fix them.  I decided to get a second opinion and went around the corner to an optical shop and he said I only needed a screw and fixed them for nothing.
