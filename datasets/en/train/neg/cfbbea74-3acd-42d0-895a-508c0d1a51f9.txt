Worst.food.ever..uck
Our usual place is closed on Sundays, so we decided on Autumn Court for delivery.  Haven't reviewed on Yelp for awhile and this food made me have to log on for sure!  We had to reheat the chicken and beef  dish on the stove and even then... it just sucked:(  Literally, the food tasted like frozen Chinese food that has been inside a freezer for too long, then flash cooked.  Save your self time and well earned cash! I warned you..:)
