Okay, Im seriously like not picky when it comes to this, i just want a good paint job and no dry skin left. 

Seriously, I asked for french tips on my toes and OMG it was so hurendous looking i just asked for all over color, then she painted my toes, yes the SKIN on the side of my toes, looks like my 12 yr old niece could of done better for cheaper. The lady that did my toes did not say a word to me the whole time and it took 15 mins. I thought pedi's toke atleast .5 hrs? I will never go here again!
