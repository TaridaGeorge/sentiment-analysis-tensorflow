I have given this place a few chances over the last month or so, (twice with my man and once with the girls). The female servers we had are so RUDE. It's like we are interrupting their day. I don't get it. Maybe they want a different kind of clientele(older?families?boring?). We aren't demanding and tip well. They would rather stand by the bar and talk with each other and the manager. What a joke. The drinks (when we could get service) and ambiance are pretty good. We have had three different servers, and they all seemed to not really care. Too bad, so sad. Next!
