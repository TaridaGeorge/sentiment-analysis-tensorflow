I LOVE Baskin Robbins but I can NOT understand THIS store CONSTANTLY being out of the staples like MINT CHIP!! On 3 separate occasions I've gone in and asked for MINT CHIP and on all occasions they are OUT!!?? Many many excuses from it didn't get delivered, to we forgot to order to we didn't realize we were out!! Either FIX the problem which is self inflicted or sell the franchise to someone who actually cares!! I'm done with this store even though it's right by me and will go to another Baskin Robbins.
