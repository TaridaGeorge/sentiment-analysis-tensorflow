2nd try here..(no more) Staff lacks prof makeup/color AND cust service/sales skills!  No greeting,  no product info, oblivious pissy make up gals who act like the customer in the way. Im new w/ mac -to see 3-4 options in colors, texture, some info--THAT is IT!  NO staff explains MAC coding efficiently. THEY put more effort repeating about how they sell & the colorwheel instead of ACTUALLY doing!  All staff here seem irritated/pissy to help.  Had me sit (I dont need to sit..) then roughly poked powder on my face/in eyes! I didnt want a not a full makeup re-do-hello.  Wont buy MAC because of the bad experience here.  What happened to sales people who know how (and like) to talk about their products, focus on right color for customer...Waste of time. ALSO-do they clean the brushes? (doubt it)
