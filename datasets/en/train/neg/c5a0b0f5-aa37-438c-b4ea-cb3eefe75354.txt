We have read the reviews on yelp, and decided to check the place out. Problem number one is that the menu is too big. The short ribs were tough. The snake shitaki was good. The shrimp fondue was fatty. Needless to say, the place did not live up to its expectations. The kitchen service was wretched, though the waiters were very nice and tried to compensate for the slow kitchen. The main dishes were served 10 minutes apart for each person so by the time one person finished his entree they serve the next persons entree. You feel very uncomfortable eating while the other person is still waiting for their food. We will probably not be coming back.
