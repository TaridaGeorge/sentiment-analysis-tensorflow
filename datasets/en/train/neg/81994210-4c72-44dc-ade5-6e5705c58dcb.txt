Strike three- you are out!  This is the WORST dry cleaning service not only in Arizona, but possibly the United States.  The ***ONLY*** reason I have gone here was out of pure convenience as it is (luckily) located next to Trader Joe's.  Today marks the third time I have order 24 hr service to not have the order ready-- always an excuse.  Todays excuse was "I don't know what the girl in the back is doing."  I have a suggestion: How bout getting my clothing pressed on time?   Shame on me for giving my hard earned dollars to a business that is crap, poor customer service, and always late.  Do yourself a favor and find another dry cleaning service.  This place is not worth the overpriced dollar they charge.
