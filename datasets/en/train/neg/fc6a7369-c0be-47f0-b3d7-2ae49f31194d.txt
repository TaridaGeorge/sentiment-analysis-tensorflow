I truly believe this is the worst bar in Arizona, maybe the Southwest. It's soul-killingly bare and soaked in ammonia fumes. The warm clutter of the former Ivan's Caravan has been replaced with an uneven formica bar top, stripped concrete walls, linoleum floors and all the ambiance of a jail cell. The bartender told me they don't provide toilet paper in the bathrooms anymore because the clientele kept stealing it. Ouch, my soul hurts.
