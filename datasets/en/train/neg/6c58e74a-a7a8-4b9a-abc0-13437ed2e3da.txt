I love the food at Yogis, great taste at a good value.  I've been to this location twice and had bad service both times. The young girl that works the counter seemed very annoyed that I stopped in, no greeting, no thank you, just a sigh and role of her eyes.

I now drive a little farther to the Chandler Blvd & Kyrene location to get my Yogis fix.
