I wish I read the reviews before we went.  It is overpriced, mediocre food.  I got a "wrap" that was institutionalized and tasteless.  Server didn't even notice when he removed the 3/4 of the uneaten thing from me.  We weren't offered boxes for the kid's food.  The drinks were OK but not good enough to get me to go back.

Side note - I find it ironic that a place that is built for kids goes and scares the crap out of them every 20 minutes with a thunder storm.  I think my kid is scared for life.

$100 for lunch.   Jeez.
