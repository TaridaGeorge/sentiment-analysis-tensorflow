A Rest Area with overpriced vending machines, the ambiance here is hectic, you feel like you should go to the bathroom and then get back on the road.

Parking is scattered and confusing. The food was average and overpriced. I don't see what the excitement is. Place was loud and small with most of the seating outside...including the soda machine..again like a rest stop vending machine.

If you enjoy eating your meals in the rest area bathroom..this place is for you
