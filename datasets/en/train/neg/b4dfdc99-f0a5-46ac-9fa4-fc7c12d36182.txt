These guys are a total fraud. I had a problem with the starter in my car and I towed it here. They fixed it with glue and charged me USD500 (claiming that they replaced it). Within less than a year the starter gaveup and I towed my car back to Midas (since the starter was under one year warranty). They did not honour the warranty and they gave me absurd reasons. 

I have never been to these fraudulent people after that. DOnt take your car hear, if you want to get a "real" repair done.
