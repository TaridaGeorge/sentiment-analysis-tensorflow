Ate here two days in a row, lunch and happy hour, and ordered the same thing both times- ribeye paco with red onions.  BOTH times they were served cold!!  Grease congealed on the plate cold! I ate them anyway, bad decision but they tasted good- not worth being sick the whole next day tho...Too bad because it is a nice place but with bad kitchen issues.
