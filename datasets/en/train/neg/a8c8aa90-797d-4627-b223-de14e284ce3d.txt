It's rare I give anything one star as I tend to be very forgiving.  And I like food.  And I really like island food and boba.  And I gave this place about 12 chances.  But...

The food is always semi-bland and the boba drinks are a complete bust every time.  Sometimes you get a cup half full with ice and the other half something resembling syrup.  Other times the consistency seems ok but there is no flavor whatsoever.  And the boba is crunchy in the middle half the time - I wonder if that's what happens to really old boba...  Anyways, go to a real boba place and avoid this one.
