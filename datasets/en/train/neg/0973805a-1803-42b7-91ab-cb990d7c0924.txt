You know, I am with you Thomas.
Everyone's looking for any relief possible from the ridiculous gas prices, you pull past the Arco and shriek "MY GOD!!! LOOK AT THOSE LOW RATES"  (as anyone from Chicago can hopefully appreciate :)
So you pull in and whip out the debit card and oh-WTF??!?  You're gonna CHARGE me extra for using my debit card??  Well, haha, I got one over on you, hello Mileage Plus Visa...WTF YOU ONLY TAKE DEBIT!)(*#UR(NFP)G&_(@&$GFBIPU.  This is a very deceptive business practice, IMHO  Plus, they only authorize for fifty bucks and my frickin' ALTIMA was $75 last time to fill up so plan on visiting your local AM/PM for quite some time on your next fill up.  I only hope your surroundings are better than this sh!thole...
Despite the low prices I'm afraid I will no longer patronize ANY Arco stations.
