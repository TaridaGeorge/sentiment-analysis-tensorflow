Those who desire home delivery beware.  After 1.5 hours and several phone calls regarding status, we finally gave up and called to cancel the delivery.  We were told it would have taken yet another 20 minutes.  We have eaten here numerous times and this is too bad - the food is decent, but the home delivery is not at all reliable.  If seeking delivery, move on to a different restaurant.
