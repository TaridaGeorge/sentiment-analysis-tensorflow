Honestly, the food here was decent. But in my opinion when the service is so bad, sometimes it overshadows the menu! This is that instance. We waited 20 minutes to be greeted at our table. Another 35 for our salads. And our waiter was so arrogant and distant that my manager actually left him a note saying "it appeared we were bothering him by being there" Anyway, the waiters and waitresses seemed to be more concerned with each other in the back corner of the restaurant, but unfortunately in plain sight of patrons, than they were with their customers.
