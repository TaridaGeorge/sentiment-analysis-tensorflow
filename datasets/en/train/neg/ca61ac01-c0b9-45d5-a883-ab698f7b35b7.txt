This place is great if you bring a group of friends and ignore everyone else 'cause it's a meat market. Everyone there seems to think they have the right to stare...even touch.

The only times I've ever been is for a bar crawl or because someone wanted to meet there.

Honestly? I'm not sure what the appeal is. Much more interesting gay bars in Phoenix have closed and yet this one keeps truckin' along. Perhaps they have loyal patrons, some look like they've been coming for decades.
