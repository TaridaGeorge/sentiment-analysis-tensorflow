Bad...very bad.  Went to this place for dinner on a Sunday night.  I felt pretty comfortable when I saw how crowded it was inside.  It doesn't look like much on the outside.

The sushi tasted pretty good, and it was cheap.  One of my dining partners and I both suffered the next day though.  I felt like crud.

I don't know what it was that got me but I suggest you run, don't walk, away.  I should have known that cheap sushi is generally (not always) cheap for a reason.
