We decided to check out this place for a drink or 2 while waiting for Bianco.  Eh...the inside was so hot..they couldn't find the remotes to the ceiling fans, (really?). My husband got a draft beet and I went with bottled, both were room temp. We gave them another chance or ordered another round, both were warm again.  The limes for my beer were crusty and gross.  I didn't even want to think about eating here if they can't keep the beer cold what is the cooler like?

Next time we are waiting at Bianco we will stay at Bar Bianco where the keep the beer cold!
