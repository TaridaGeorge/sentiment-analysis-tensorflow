Terrible customer service until you get to a manager that actually cares. It's as if they don't understand, care, or appreciate who their competition is and what business they're in (customer service). I would be surprised if this store even existed a year from now. My advice: Have the assistant managers visit a few competitors to see who they are being compared to.
