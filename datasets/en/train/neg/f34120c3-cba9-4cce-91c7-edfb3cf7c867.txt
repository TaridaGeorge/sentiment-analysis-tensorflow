The pharmacy here is very incompetent, and I have run into countless problems here that I have never experienced at another Walgreen's or any other pharmacy.  Every time I have a prescription filled or transferred, they make a colossal mistake.  Today was for sure my last time using them (or TRYING to use them).  I do not recommend going here, especially with so many other options nearby.
