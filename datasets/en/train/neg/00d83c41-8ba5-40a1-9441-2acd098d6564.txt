well it was my birthday, and arrived with much anticipation after reading the glowing reviews! we were told 15 min wait(took 40 min) 32.00 buckaroos for a waffle a stack of griddle cakes  and a side of eggs choc milk and a lemonade seems steep to me!  griddle cakes were a bit underdone, and waffle was soft and tasteless ( treue belgin waffle should be crispy and light inside, the place was packed with trendys, service was hap hazzard at best   eggs came a good 5 min before the waffle i believe there are much better breakfast options in town and less expensive ! they got me this time but never again
