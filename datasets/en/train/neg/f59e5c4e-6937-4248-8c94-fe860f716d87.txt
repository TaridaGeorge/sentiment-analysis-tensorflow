I bought a groupon for these and wish I'd have saved my money.  Even if they were good, they are overpriced.  However, they weren't.  I am a big brownie eater...but only the home made type.  These tasted like packaged brownies.  I actually left them on the table at work so that other people would eat them...since no one in my house would. I only ordered the walnut but I doubt the other ones would be any better. Ice cream couldn't even save them (now that's bad).
