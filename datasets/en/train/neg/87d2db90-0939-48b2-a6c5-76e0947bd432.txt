Oh man this place smells bad. No it's not that "old lady" smell. It's more like a dirty diaper smell.

I quickly scanned the home goods. Plastic containers that sell new for $1.00 at the Dollar Store were being sold for $1.50 at this thrift store. Really? It just seemed that everything was just a smidge overpriced, reminds me of the Salvation Army in that respect.

I really hope they fix the smell soon..then I might try this place in the future and update my review.
