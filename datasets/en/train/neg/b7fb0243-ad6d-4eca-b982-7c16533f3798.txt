We literally walked in with ONE case of a six pack of beer and their security followed us from the moment we walked in. It was harassment. They had no reason to follow us and they did. I complained to the front desk and he did nothing. I don't want to stay somewhere where they can't trust their customers. Better believe I will write corporate.
