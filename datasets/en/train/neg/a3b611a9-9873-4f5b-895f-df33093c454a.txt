BEWARE!!!!.......This place is a scam, and they sell garbage, I bought a tire at the end of July, and the tire fell apart in September. The car sat most of the summer, I called "Mike" and he proceeded to tell me that it was my fault his tire was crap. He had the audacity to tell me that the tire was ran to low of pressure, when my car has a built in gauge that measures tire pressure, and then proceeded to tell me that my car computer was wrong..... This guy had a BS excuse for everything. And he was extremely RUDE. Their customer service was horrible.....BEWARE!! 
AVOID this place, i tried to save a couple bucks, but in the long run, i will be paying MORE!!
