Just purchased a $400 vacuum cleaner from here. Get home, open the box and more than 50% of the parts are missing. Really!? We return it 25 minutes after purchase. Guess what, that was the only one of that model. Yay, we can spend more on an upgraded dyson or go to another Home Depot. How convenient.
