awfull!!! portions are small, its not too expensive which made me feel happy at the end of the meal cause i would be really mad if i had to spend more than $25 for that awfull meal!!!
this place is for old people! nothing exciting. i had fish sandwich on a very soggy bread, sides were very small, mac and cheese i had better from the box.
the food is very southern style, not much of a healthy stuff on menu and for sure no choice for vegatarians or health concious, maybe thats the reason why everyone thats overweight is there.
no! we will not be back!!!
