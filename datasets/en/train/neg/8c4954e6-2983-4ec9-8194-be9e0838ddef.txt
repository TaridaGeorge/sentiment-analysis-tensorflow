Very disappointing. I will not be back nor will I recommend this restaurant to anyone. 

Everything here *looks* really good, but didn't live up to it's presentation. Ordered the spring rolls to start, Pink Lady drink (mixture of pomegranate juice and soy milk) and the Chow Mein. Sadly, nothing tasted good. 

My friends I went with were also disappointed with their food. None of us finished our dishes. 

Oh well. Too bad! 

Go to True Foods in the Biltmore area instead. It's worth it!
