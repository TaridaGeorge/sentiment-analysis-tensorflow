I use to shop at this place all the time. But since they changed management and the way I was treated there was unacceptable. The people there really need to have better customer service skills especially the Manager. You will never see me there again and I usually drop $300 to $500 every visit. But they don't care if you spend a $1... Asking for help is like pulling teeth.
