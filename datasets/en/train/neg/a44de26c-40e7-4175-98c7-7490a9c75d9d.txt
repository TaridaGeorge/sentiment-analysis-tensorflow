Fees, fees, and more fees.  They get you coming and going, and then are understaffed so you get to stand in line for at least thirty minutes.  You'd think with all these fees that they'd be able to have a couple guys frisking people, or hose the floor down more than once a month.  Apparently not!  I'd considered giving them two stars, but then I remembered the fee to PRINT OUT MY TICKET AT HOME, and realized this place is truly evil.  Not that these crazy fees are such a rare thing, but I don't have to give them extra stars if they're evil.  

I'm just waiting for the inevitable "fee to administer additional income related to fees" to pop up.
