Totally disappointed!  I asked for "patis" (fish sauce) and lady said she didn't have any?!  She offered me soy sauce with vinegar instead!!!???  Anyway, the fried bangus wasn't all too good and my husband simply swallowed his way through the pork barbecue... WILL NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE ON THIS UNIVERSE!!!!
