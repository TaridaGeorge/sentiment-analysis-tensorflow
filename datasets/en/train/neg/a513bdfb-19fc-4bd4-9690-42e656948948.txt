Don't go to this store if you are looking for 45s. They give you a book to look through and ask you to tell them what you want and tell you the prices will be $4 upwards. They then price them up using various price guides. If you have found something that is priced highly they hide it then put it on Ebay rather than sell it to you. You do all the work (the books have a total of more than 300 pages) and they reap the benefits. If I hadn't had picked out a certain $300 record that record could have lain there forever. I wasn't even offered it at any price and I would have given them a good price.
