Beware of these shady rip off artist storm chasers!  

A guy from Jasper came knocking on my door and tried to sell me on how they would essentially rip off my insurance company by claiming my roof has wind damage.  My roof is fine.  There are no leaks and I check it myself inside and out regularly.  

He claimed it would only cost the insurance deductible.  And I would get an additional benefit if I had their ugly sign in my front yard that let my whole neighborhood know "I committed insurance fraud! "

I would never "buy" a new roof from someone who knocks on my door and gives a drive-by assessment.
