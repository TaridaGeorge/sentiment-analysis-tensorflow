I had previously been a fan of Chipotle, however, I discovered that grabbing dinner here on a late Friday night with a Soviet-bread-line-long line had consequences beyond the longer wait.  I ordered a barbacoa burrito, and noticed that when I took a bite it felt chunky rather than shredded, and also a bit hard.  I didn't think anything of it until I gradually developed an intense headache, stomach pain, started getting goosebumps and eventually nausea and dizziness.  I figured this sort of thing might happen after eating at *berto's, but not Chipotle.  I'm certain this isn't typical for them, but as it seemed pretty hectic in the kitchen that night, it wouldn't surprise me if a few corners were cut.
