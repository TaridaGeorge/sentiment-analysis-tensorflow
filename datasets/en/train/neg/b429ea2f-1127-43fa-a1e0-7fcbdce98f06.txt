Dined at Crust on a slow Friday night.  My wife and I ordered an app  for a starter, and two entrees.  We received the app soon after we ordered, but the entrees took over 45 minutes, maybe just under an hour, to arrive after we received the app.  I asked the waiter where our food was, and how soon will we get it.  He said 3 minutes, it took a lot longer then 3 minutes.  At one point the waiter asked us what we ordered.  I'm guessing he asked that, because he forgot to place the order, or lost the ticket.  We have had a few good meals in there, but the last 2 have been terrible.  

We won't be back!
