Please don't waste your time and money. The portion size was satisfactory, but the food was mediocre at best. The majority of people in Anthem seem to have fast-food taste, so of course they find this place adequate. This is a tiny restaurant; the evening we were there, a woman and friend were there with their 2 small poorly-disciplined children, who allowed them to run everywhere. Great. That's what we want on a night out - mediocre food and running screaming kids. The staff did nothing. We haven't gone back and will warn others away.
