There isn't a prayer in hell that you could find a worse bunch of mechanics than this place.

You would be better off asking your maiden aunt Matilda to take a stab at fixing your car or maybe your three year old child.  In fact, I'm pretty sure my dogs are smarter than these guys.

Then, add the fact that it REEKS of cigarettes and they blow it in your face while you're forced to put up with it.

If I could give negative stars, this place would be a negative 10 for the mechanics and a negative 1 for the cigarettes for a total of 
negative 11 stars.
