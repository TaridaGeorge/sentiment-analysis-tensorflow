Arizona is like the red headed stepchild to the BBQ industry.  Open a new restaraunt and people will stand in lines for hours and pay rediculous prices like $6 bucks for a half pound of meat.  You must be high, for the price you just paid to eat at Rudy's you could have bought your own smoker and 10 pounds of Pork Butt..  Rudy's prices are outrageous, if this place actually smoked their own meat and had a guy tending a smoker all night long I would go back.  But no I digress, all their meat is already cooked and shipped in.  They just warm it up and sell it to you for 6 - 9 dollars a HALF POUND.  LOL Suckers.
