We did a carryout here last night and it was awful. I have no idea what everyone is raving about. Obviously they've never had good  pizza. We got the cheese, sausage and mushroom pizza. First off, there was only cheese and sausage.....no mushrooms. I also ordered the cheese garlic bread, which has to be the worst I've ever had . The bread was definitelly stale and they put mozarella and an orange cheese that I think was cheddar. I've never had cheese garlic bread with anything but mozzarella and a butter garlic spread under the cheese. I would definitely not recommend this place. FWIW -The best pizza I've had is at Pizziarea Bianco. It's a bit of a drive from Scottsdale but worth it. Vino's in Scottsdale is pretty good too.
