Go bowling here with caution. Before I talk about the caution, I will say this: Previous times I've bowled here it's been awesome. But....tonight when i gave my two hour 29.99 coupon at 12:00am (i know...it was late) my lane was shut off early (1:55am).  I totally understood but when I asked the question to the manager, "We didn't get the FULL value of our coupon?" he said (and i quote) "Better luck next time". Hmmmmm. Never going back.
