Gross! Gross! Gross! Gross! Gross!. Need I say more? How how HOOOWWW do you ruin chicken nachos?!?!?! I mean, if that isnt the EASIEST appetizer to make, then I dont know WHAT is. They were cold but the cheese was burnt. WTF?? The chips were stale and overly disgusting. Needless to say, I told the "waitress" that I just could NOT eat them and she took them off my bill. I wound up paying about 4 bucks for a glass of coke. -_- And to top it all off, the customer service was non-existent. Never AGAIN. Save yourself the horrible experience and just visit the express Pizza Hut or Burger King across the way. BLAH!!
