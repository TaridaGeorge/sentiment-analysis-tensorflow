First time have eaten there. The food started out ok until we cut a boudin ball and found a whole fly. The response from the server was let me take it back and take a picture of it????   They said sorry and they will give us a discount coupon for our return.... Really, we will not be back. I guess the kitchen is in the same disrepair as the front of the house.
