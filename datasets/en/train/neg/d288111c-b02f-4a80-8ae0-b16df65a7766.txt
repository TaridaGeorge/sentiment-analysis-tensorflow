The dish I had, the wasabi crusted ahi tuna was awful and it was served twice, both times unacceptably.  The "crust" is really bread stuffing on the outside and the miso glaze was a miso cream sauce, huh?  How can you call a rich, greasy sauce served on the plate a glaze.  Very confusing, unappetizing and this dish should be chopped.  Not a good experience.
