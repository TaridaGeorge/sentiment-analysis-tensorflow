Had Mexican food with thousand island dressing. It's not chef style food but more upper class white trash. We were worried about our car and the parking so didn't stay too long. If you just want to try something new but dont care if it looks like old and run down style as if your in an outdated apt courtyard, this place would be interesting briefly.
