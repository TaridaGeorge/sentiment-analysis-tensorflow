Brought 4 pair of slacks in, 2 zipper replacements and 2 to be hemmed. When I went to pick them up, only one pair was ready for pick up.  The pants that needed to be hemmed were not done as I had requested. On one of the pants that was going to have the zipper replaced, the didn't have a matching color but no one bothered to contact me to see if I wanted to do something else instead.  I'll never go there again!
