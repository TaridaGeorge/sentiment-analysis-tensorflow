We are new to town and furnished our entire room with West Elm, spending nearly $3,000. After we got over the sticker shock for stuff that looks like a cross between Pier 1 and IKEA we were just happy because we could get the items delivered before we left town. We had the furniture delivered but no one told us at we would be responsible for assembling the furniture. This store is a rip off. If I wanted to buy stuff to assemble I would have gone to Target. We are great customers and now we will never go there again. Ever.
