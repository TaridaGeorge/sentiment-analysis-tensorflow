BUYER BEWARE!  I purchased a daily deal for 3 rooms plus a hallway for $59.  After calling THREE TIMES and leaving messages to schedule an appointment, I emailed them with my concerns that they had taken my money and wouldn't be providing the service.  They finally called and scheduled me.  Then when they finally got to my house (40 min late and stinking like cigarettes), they did a decent job.  HOWEVER, after walking thru my house after they left I noticed that they DID NOT CLEAN THE WHOLE ROOMS!  They only did the high-traffic areas.  So basically, about 1/4 of each room and only the very center of the hallway. And there are places that still look dirty.  What a scam.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.
