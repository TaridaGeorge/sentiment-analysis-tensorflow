Before I elaborate on the one star I do have to disclaim that the staff is extremely nice and helpful. However that is not outweighed by the ridiculous highway location.  Not to sound dramatic but it sounds like a NASCAR track outside and it doesn't matter if you're not on the side that faces the highway. Also, there's a weird "wet" smell in the hallways- that humid pool-like smell even though there isn't a pool.
