ATMOSPHERE: Fun, if you have kids or if you happen to like a fake Disneyland environment like a modern day Tiki Room.

FOOD:  Really bad and WAY overpriced!!!!

SERVICE: Very poor...I think they hire Food Servers with no common sense or any people skills.

OVERALL: Save your dime...mosey on over to the Food Court after you stand there ogling over the animatronic alligator and fake fog. Paying for overpriced, crappy food with bad service is NOT worth it.
