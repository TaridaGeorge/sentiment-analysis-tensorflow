I gave this place a 2nd shot a few months after our 1st experience.  Service was terrible both times.  No music.  the movie outside was distracting because it was complete silence and this bright movie.    Cocktails are VERY over priced especially for the amature "mixologists".  I will not go back or suggest this place.  I am shocked they are still in business.  Sad because it could be very cool.
