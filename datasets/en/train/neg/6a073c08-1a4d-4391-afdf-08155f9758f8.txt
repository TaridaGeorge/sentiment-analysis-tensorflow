Don't waste your time. We came here trying to get a quick bite to eat after a concert and we waited what seemed like several minutes up front despite there were only two tables of customers in the whole restaurant. Finally the hostess shows up with no apology, a look of distaste on her face and I know they knew we were there because the door chimes in the back for them to know they have customers in front. But I gave her my two cents before I left out the door to go to Denny's instead. Did we really expect good service after that? I think not.
