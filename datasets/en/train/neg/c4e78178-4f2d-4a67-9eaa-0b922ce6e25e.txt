Overpriced, overrated, HORRIBLE SERVICE!  

When asked for a spoon with which to eat my pasta, they actially gave me an iced tea spoon!

No bartender, I sat for 15 minutes without a greeting, anything. The grey-haired manager stomped aroumd the restaurant avoiding all contact with customers.  What's the point/benefit on that?

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY AT THIS AMATEURISH OVERPRICED DUMP!  INSTEAD, GO TO MEATBALLZ IN THE SAME CENTER,ON CAMELBACK. MUCH BETTER FOOD, REASONABLE PRICES AND NO ICED TEA SPOONS!
