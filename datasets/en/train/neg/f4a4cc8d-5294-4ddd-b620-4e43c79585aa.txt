First time here, but service is okay so far. :|
I  actually had Awful customer service, my dad suggested to take my car elsewhere for new brake pads on my front side.
This other shop that I went to instead was much more friendlier and they did a fantastic job too in exchanging my brakes pads!! 
# Oh and I just got a text message from Brake Masters today and found that to be annoying since ( A.)  I didn't take their services and (B.) I did not check off the box that agreed to accepting emails!! How rude!!!!!!!!!!! :(
