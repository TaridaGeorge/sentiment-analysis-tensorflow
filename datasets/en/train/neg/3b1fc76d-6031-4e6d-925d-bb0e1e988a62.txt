One word comes to mind....ish. Ordered the Pu Pu platter, don't bother, way too much money, no dipping sauce,(unless you ask) and the shrimp, well I have no I idea what was in that formation...I ordered a beef dish that was so dry I had to dump chili paste and soy sauce on it to wash it down with the overly dry rice. My friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken, same thing ,very little sauce.I will NEVER eat here again.
