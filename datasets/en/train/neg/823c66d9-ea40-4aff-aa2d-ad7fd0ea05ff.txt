we went to STFK for the first and unfortunately the last time tonight. I'm not sure if they hired an outside company to come up with this concept or they thought of it internally, but they can save a ton of money by NOT remodeling the remaining stores, and will stop losing long time customers like us.  I always finished up with their chili, but now it's an additional $3.49, and no more hot chocolate chip cookies. BTW, no more coupons either, so it's time to look for another place to have a healthy meal...
