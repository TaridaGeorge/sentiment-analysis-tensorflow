I agree with Yuck.  this is a boring loud terrible place to eat.  the food is below average and a waste of money.  Much better places to eat then here.  My dad had the meatball sub which was huge but nothing special about it just ordinary.  I ordered the Gluten free pizza - but it was not good - the sauce tasted like Hunt's tomatoe paste - maybe if they had a home cooked sauce it would have been better.  Plus there Gluten Free pizza is not really Gluten free because they make it in the same ovens as their wheat pizza.  and it was terrible, we sent items back and threw stuff away.  if you are looking for good NY Pizza try NYPD much better than this place by far.
