This place makes me sad. Thingz has some pretty nice lookin' decor but their prices are OUTRAGEOUS. If I had the money I would maybe consider buying a bar stool here or something but I just can't see how this business is still around with our recent economy. Here is exactly what I mean. This giant apple costs $425!!!!!!!!!!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/goSD2ufNVQDgqpb6FmUt5A?select=p2aidd2YC_WLUTMNJE5Jlg
No, I'm not kidding. Do you want a giant apple? I would maybe pay 10 bucks and put it in my classroom as a joke...
