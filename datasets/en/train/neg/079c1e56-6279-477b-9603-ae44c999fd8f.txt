I'm truly glad to see someone has had a better experience at Al's than myself.  Based on this latest review, might I go back there now?  Absolutely... the first day we have a blizzard in july in Phoenix with 32 degrees below zero wind chill.  (No offense to Cookie who wrote that review is intended.)
