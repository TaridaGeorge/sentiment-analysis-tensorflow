Yuk.  A small group of us went there before the Tour de Coops.  Einsteins was packed, so was Duck and Decanter, so we went to Zoes because it was empty, and when we left, we knew why.  Food was grocery store stuff, and the pita had genuine Oscar Meyer ham in it straight from the package.  A place that supposedly professes health stuffs stale pitas with iceberg lettuce and nitrates. Whats worse us that the person at the register acted like we were irritating her.  Like she was busy!  I really regret going and wish I stood in line at any other place in the area.  For $10, I could have bought enough stuff at Safeway to pack 5 of Zoes second rate pitas, including quality ingredients they didn't, or a great meal anywhere else.  Cheesy, bland, corner-cutting and rude.  Dont bother.
