If you want to be robbed go to Gammage. I went to participate on the Wicked lottery and lost. Therefore we were told that we could buy the remain tickets for 35 dollars plus 3 for handling. I got tickets which price used to be 82. I signed the voucher for $76 for 2 tickets "on sale". Funny enough I was given a voucher for me for $167. I asked and the girl told me that it was because of the system, but I would be charged $76. Days later my bank statement shows that they charged $167. I asked Gammage what happened and they now pretend that I did approved this transaction, and there is no way they could know I did participate in the lottery. GREAT SCAM!
