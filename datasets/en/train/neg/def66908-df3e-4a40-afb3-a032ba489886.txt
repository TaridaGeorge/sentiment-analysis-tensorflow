Just finished our 1st and our last meal here...the food was average like a denny's or  IHOP. I won't say I won't eat there again just because the whites of my husbands eggs weren't cooked it could happen to anyone. The reasons we won't eat there again are because we watched the cook go into & out of the restroom with his apron on GROSS! The staff was not rude but I have no idea what our servers name was because she didn't say more than 10 words to us the entire meal. The restaurant is very outdated the walls and floors could use a good scrubbing and it is very poorly lit...my 1st thought was they need Robert from Food Networks Restaurant Impossible!
