I am surprised by the good reviews for this salon. My experience has been unsatisfactory. The owners, Carla and Donna do not respond to e-mails, phone calls or hand written letters. They never made me feel comfortable or welcomed. I visited the salon three times, and will no longer give money to a business that simply ignores the customer. I will find a salon that values my business, cares about me as a customer, and listens to my concerns. The owners should be ashamed.
