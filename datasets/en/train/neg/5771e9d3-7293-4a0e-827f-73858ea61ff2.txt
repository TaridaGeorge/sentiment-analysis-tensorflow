This review is for the SanTan Honda Service Dept:
I would not recommend them.  They failed to fix my '08 Civic.  Turns out there was carbon build up in one of the cylinder heads on the engine!  A dealer out of state fixed it because San Tan lacked any expertise in problem solving.  They just depended on my car's "computer" to tell them there was something wrong.  Too bad the car's computer wasn't that smart. Glad someone else fixed it by working hard with the Honda Tech line.
