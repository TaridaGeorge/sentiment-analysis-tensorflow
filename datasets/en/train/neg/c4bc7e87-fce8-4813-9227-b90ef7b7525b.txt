BS West has not changed. It is still an overpriced, unfriendly, cliquish place where anyone who does not frequent the place will be stared at and commented about by loud drunks in the dark corners. This is the kind of place which reinforces negative gay stereotypes and gives straight people the feeling they are at a zoo, observing gay people in their natural habitat. The best part about going here is leaving and not looking back.
