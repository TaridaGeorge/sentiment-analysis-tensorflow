I USED to like this place but I went this weekend and was so disappointed. My "hot" sub was cold and the meat was watery. My soup was also cold and I literally only walked a block home. The worst part was the service. The girl that took my order was so rude! She never smiled and she acted so inconvenienced by me when I was THE ONLY CUSTOMER there. They handed me my sub, soup, and bread and had me bag it myself. They've lost my business forever - from now on I will make the walk to Jimmy Johns or SAKS (always worth it!)
