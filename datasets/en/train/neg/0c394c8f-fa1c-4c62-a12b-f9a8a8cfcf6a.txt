I haven't had much time to write reviews lately, but I felt a need to post a quick review of siamese cat because the yelp review is way too high and very misleading.  My girlfriend and I stopped here because of the high yelp review. We go to a lot of thai restaurants around town, and this was by far the worst that we have been to. It has an inconvenient location in a somewhat rundown strip mall. The decor inside was not great and it was very empty on a weekend night which is a bad sign. The noodles were overcooked and stuck together in our pad thai. 

Thai Basil or Thai Elephant are both better choices for quick easy places in the same price range. Tott's is also really great and highly recommended.
