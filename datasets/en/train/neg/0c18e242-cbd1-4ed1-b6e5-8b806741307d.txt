Lipstick on a pig.  Nice atmosphere, attractive staff.  But being cute only goes so far in life and in the restaurant industry.  I gave the bartender (Marissa, I think?) a second chance after she was a snob on my first visit.  Strike two and Majerle's is out.  Getting conversation out of the barstaff is like pulling teeth unless you have a popped collar and a Jersey Shore tan.  Exactly what a bar should NOT be.
