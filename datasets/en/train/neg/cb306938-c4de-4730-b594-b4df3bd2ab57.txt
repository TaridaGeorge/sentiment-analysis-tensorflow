Recently 'redecorated'. All beauty and charm has been surgically removed. The banquets, thick green comfortable replaced with wooden slate chairs and rickety tables to match. The tasteful gating removed. Replaced with what appears to be giant tire rims with tiny fruit trees. 
I am totally over all fox restaurants. They can't even be trusted to redecorate without wrecking the place. Bloom is fugly as can be. 
The managers are good at apologizing, which is good- they will doing plenty of it.  Their new menu ideas are equally bad, I can see their getting ready to go public, buyer beware this chain is over.
