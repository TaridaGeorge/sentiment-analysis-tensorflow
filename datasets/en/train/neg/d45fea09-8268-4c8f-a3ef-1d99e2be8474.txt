Service: Great (hence the 1 star)

Food: Utter disappointment. 

The tortillas for our tacos were tough. As a cook, I know this only happens when tortillas are reheated. My wild guess is the cooks heated the tortillas ahead of time for a busy hour and then reheated them once we ordered; second possibility is the tortillas were left unwrapped in the fridge getting a tough edge then were used for customers. This is completely unacceptable.

The carne asada was underwhelming. The horchata had a watered down taste. 

Decor/Environment: Decorated on a low budget. No issue if the food is at least good.

This restaurant may be others' five star dream, but we gave the restaurant a fair shot and voila, here we have this review.Overall, our search for a good taco restaurant comparable to our favorite in Dallas will continue.
