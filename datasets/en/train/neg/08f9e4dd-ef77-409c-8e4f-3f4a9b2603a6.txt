WORST AIRLINE SERVICE EVVVVVER!!!!!!!! I arrived at the airport only to realize that our check in bags weren't coming out of the carousel. WTF??? So everyone from our flight went to US Airways bag claim/ customer service and find out OUR BAGS ARE LOST!!! Numerous customers in line who have flown with US Airways before said this always happens when you fly US Airways. So I decided to wait patiently in line like the rest to give my 2 cents when randomly boxes and bags began to trickle in and "they claim they don't know how they got there or where they came from" So how did some of the passengers get portions of their belongings????  Oh and the employees with company apparently know how to talk back at frustrated, angry customers. Well then....
