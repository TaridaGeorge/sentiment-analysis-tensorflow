Terrible service.  We made a reservation and ended up seated at a bar. Forget enjoying the company of our out of town guests because we couldn't ear each other. So They thought they could buy us off with a complimentary glass of champagne. I guess I'm fickle - wanting to be seated at a table when I make reservations.
