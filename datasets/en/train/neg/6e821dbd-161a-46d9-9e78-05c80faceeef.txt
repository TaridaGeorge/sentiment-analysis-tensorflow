This place would get a 0 if possible.  The lady was rude and mean and followed us around the crowded store.  When asked why she just looked at us, gave us a stare down and eyed me up and down like a criminal.  This place is over priced, the lady is rude and I would never spend a dime in this store.  I have heard nothing but awful things from everyone I know who has gone into this store and don'tk know how they are still in business. Now that I have experienced it myself I say move on, save your money and time and frustration.
