I took my puppy to this Banfield a couple months ago. The whole experience was bad.  They made us wait almost one hour ( I had an appointment), then a lady doctor showed up. She was nice but not reliable enough. Everything she said was like she was reading a text book. Their vet tech woman promised to call me later the day or next morning about dental inquiry, but she never called me. Now I found a nice vet and started taking my dog to her.
