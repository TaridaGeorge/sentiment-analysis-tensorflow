For the past three months I've been receiving unsolicited spam text messages from these clowns, so regardless of how nice a place this might be, I'll never stay with them or any other affiliated property for that reason alone. I've complained to the hotel (I was blown off), blocked them from my cell phone account, and filed a complaint with the feds. So...since the hotel continues to find it appropriate to light up my cell phone at 3 am with spam texts, I hereby award them a generous one-star rating.
