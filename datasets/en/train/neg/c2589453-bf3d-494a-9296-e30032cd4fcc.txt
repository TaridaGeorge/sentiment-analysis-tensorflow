One word.  YUCK!  I picked a pepper steak pita to go.  I know, some people will say that the quality suffers when you take it TO GO but seriously, it's a 2 min drive, and even if the food would have been slightly less disgusting 2 minutes earlier it still would have been disgusting.  First of all it was soggy.  Not slightly soggy, wet.  Liquid was running out of the foil before I even unwrapped it.  Not juices, liquid.  When I held it more liquid came out of the pita itself, like when you squeeze a sponge.  Sick.  Which also describes the taste.  I tried just taking the meat and peppers out and eating them but they lacked any spice or flavor you would desire  and the meat was chewy and tasted like fat. Even my dog wouldn't eat it.  Never again.
