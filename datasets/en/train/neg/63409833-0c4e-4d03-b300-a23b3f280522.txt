These guys wasted a lot of my time today. First, I called to check to see if they had a certain part. They said they did, I asked a follow up question, they went to double check and came back and said they had it. I drive there, they dont have it, haven't carried. We talk to the manager, David, he says oops sorry. He offers to special order it. We ask for a 10% discount, he says no. We tell him we will never go back and he says I understand and I am sorry but there is nothing I can do.
