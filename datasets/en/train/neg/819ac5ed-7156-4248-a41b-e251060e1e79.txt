I have always enjoyed dining at Hillstone and Houstons prior to that for many years until this last weekend.  I am on a very strict diet because of numerous allergy issues, and can only eat fish and vegetables.  I ordered a fish sandwich and asked that it not have the thousand island dressing on the bun, as I am allergic to tomatoes.  I was told that the chef would not prepare it that way.  I was very disappointed and skipped dinner.  In our society with so many issues with allergies, I think Hillstone should make accommodations for its guests. I will not be eating at Hillstone again!
