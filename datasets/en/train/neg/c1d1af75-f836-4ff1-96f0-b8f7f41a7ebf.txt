DISAPPOINTING - I went there on a Saturday night and the food was mediocre at best.  Party of four - we all received our appetizers and entrees at different times.  The pizza (Italian Stallion) took over 30 minutes to get to the table and the pizza was not the same that they made for Guy (maybe I was expecting too much).
Service was non-existent as the waitresses appeared to be going through the motions and seemed to be pretty tired (no personality and acting like zombies).  Reading some other reviews maybe I went there on an off-night? 
Regardless I never plan to return.
I wish the owner best of luck motivating that staff and living up to the fame of being on TV.
