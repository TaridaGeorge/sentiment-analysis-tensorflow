I'm writing this review mainly to say that this location is now CLOSED.

Which is quite sad, not to mention perplexing, why TJ's would close one of their best-stocked and busy TJ's in the valley. Not a good move, in my opinion to force West Phoenix customers to drive either out to Arrowhead, 20th st/Camelback, or various other locations in Tempe and Scottsdale.

Bad business decision, in my opinion.
