I don't understand the appeal of this place. Fries were bland, the patty on my burger was the size of a small McDonald's hamburger, and incredibly, for being so thin, it was bright pink in the middle! Do they use the grill just to heat it up? Because it certainly wasn't cooked. I'll stick with Five Guys.
