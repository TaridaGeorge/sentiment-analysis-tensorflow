We are very local to this little place, My fiancees son goes to the karate school a couple of doors down and we shop weekly at Safeway.
 The last two times we have tried to go go eat here, they have been closed before the posted hours and this past weekend we were there @ just after 7:00 pm to be turned away at the door by staff because they had a large party. STRIKE 3. 
Sorry, thats very poor customer service for any place let alone a small one like this. There were plenty of tables and room and we could have waited longer for our food no problem. Not an option. Worse part is people were leaving as we were turned away.
So I took my business over to Smash Burger on the other side of the parking lot.
