There is nothing "Fantastic" about this place.  I used a money mailer coupon to try it out.  Immediately when I walked in I felt a bad vibe.  Seemed the girls there weren't too happy, and apparently the new owner was there (to observe?) and looked like she just ate a %&it sandwich.  No smiles or friendly attitude at all.  Worst of all was the haircut itself.  Forgot the stylists name, but she was middle aged with straight dirty blonde hair.  I don't know if she was distracted by trying to talk during the cut, but she seemed to have no idea (or seemed to care) of what style I wanted.  One of the worst haircuts I ever had.  Never going back.
