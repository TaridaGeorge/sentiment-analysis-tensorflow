I am an art lover but don't dig the overkill by the people who are "guarding" the art from the common folk.  After having a run-in with an over-zealous guard and then discussing it with Heather the manager, I will most likely not return.  They are many friendlier art installations in the valley...I will give them my hard-earned support instead.
