Worst theatre ever. No wonder they are willing to only charge $5 for a ticket. I don't know if we got a "bad theatre" but my fianc√© and I sat in OFFICE CHAIRS, yes non reclining, wheeling, no arm rest OFFICE CHAIRS! Oh and our "tables" or shall I say "linoleum office cabinets". What the heck?!? Oh and get this! The lights to illuminate your food aren't really blue, THEY ARE WHITE WITH BLUE PAINTERS TAPE OVER THEM! Most ghetto theatre I have ever been sat in. I'll never go back and hope I get a good theatre.
