Never going back.  First of all it's way too expensive for the crappy food we received.  The fries were nothing special and tasted worse than the kind that come frozen that you bake in the oven.  Customer service was rude and very unhelpful.  There's also a sign there that says they make all burgers medium well and mine had lots of pink in it (which I hate of course).
