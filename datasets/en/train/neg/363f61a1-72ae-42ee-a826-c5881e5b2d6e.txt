I wish i could give zero stars. Had the torta cubana. Meat grissly no flavor, fish taco horrible...Salsa bar and chip stand very unsanitary. Tongs and scoop lying in food. Flies in the place and it had to be 90 degrees in there. How does a place like this stay in business is beyond me.. Stay far away..
