This gym is in a great location, the staff is generally friendly, but it is really not well maintained.  The carpets throughout are filthy, the equipment is often off line or maladjusted. The locker rooms are really poorly cleaned and often smell horribly.  I have had a month to month membership, and I plan to cancel.  This summer the poor conditions finally pushed me and some of my friends over the edge and we will look elsewhere.  Do yourself a favor and find a cleaner gym.
