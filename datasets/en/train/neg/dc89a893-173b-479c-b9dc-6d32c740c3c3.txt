Have you ever had the feeling like your wife might be slipped something while ordering a drink, or molested on the way to the can? That is how I felt while celebrating a birthday here. 

The place was down right creepy. 

Don't get me wrong, I love me a dive bar. I can eat on the curb in Mexico. I am a very trusting person. 

I hated this place. 

The drinks were ok, ther servers were not attentive, the decor and outside sitting area was cool.
