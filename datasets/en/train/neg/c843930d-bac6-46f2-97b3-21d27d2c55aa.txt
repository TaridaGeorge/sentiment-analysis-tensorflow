Very terrible service. People have screwed up EVERY order i've made. Three times they've handed me a drink that opened and spilled all over my door in the drive thru after I've asked them to make sure it was secure. Once I waited for 25 minutes for 10 cheese burgers I was taking to a group of people who were helping me at an event.

I've asked them specifically not to put things on my food and still they do. I told the girl I was deathly allergic to pickles (not true, but told her this so to make sure they were not on the burger) and yet my burger still had pickles.

Luckily this McD's has made me not want fast food anymore. If I go to McD's I get a parfeit or oatmeal.
