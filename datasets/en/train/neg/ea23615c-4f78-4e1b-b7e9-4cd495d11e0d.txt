I have been to Chompie's many times, and have never been thrilled. However, after our last visit, I will NEVER return. 

I have never been treated so poorly in a restaurant as I was at this location last Sunday morning. We were quoted a 20 minute wait. Even with a 1 year old child, we thought we would give it a shot. After waiting for 45 minutes, I went up to see what the delay was, as they had seated many people who came in after us, before us. They were working for of 3 seperate, handwritten lists and had NO comprehensive system. (And this was one of the MANAGERS) When I asked when we would be seated, she practically yelled at me, and told me she had no idea. Seriously? Needless to say, we left. NEVER AGAIN.
