I pre-paid for my order for a party of over 50. I went to pick it up and they didn't have any record of it. I suppose it is because they take the orders on a white sheet of paper and not on a computer. Needless to say I was driving around frantically trying to find centerpieces as well as roses for a tiered cake. Andrea wanted to offer me huge lilies or purple roses. I explained that the cake was pink. Her nonchalant attitude, like it was my fault didn't help my stress level. 

I don't think the few bucks you save by going here is worth it. If it were my wedding, I would have been DEVASTATED. She didn't offer anything to compensate for the error on her part. I would stay away from this business unless you like to gamble.
