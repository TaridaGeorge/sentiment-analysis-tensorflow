Had read great reviews of Five Guys so stopped by with my husband for a burger and shakes and some crunchy fries. 
They do not have shakes (that was a deal breaker right there), the burgers were being cooked up on a very filthy griddle instead of grilled over an open flame like decent burgers are. They were pulling some soggy fries out of the grease that looked gross. 
A cheeseburger goes for $5.99 (no cheeseburger is worth more than $3). 
We were so grossed out by what we saw that we left without ordering, so I have no idea how this stuff actually tastes.
