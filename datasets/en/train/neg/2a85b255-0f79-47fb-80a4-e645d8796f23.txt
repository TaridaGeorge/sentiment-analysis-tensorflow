We just got take out from here after seeing it on Yelp. I didn't even have an account and felt compelled to sign up so I could write a review. We both got the falafel pitas. I think it was cooked hours earlier and re-fried and given to us. Little hard rocks of  falafel, disgusting. The hummus was not very good either, and some of our favorite Mediterranean places we go to just for the hummus. Considering it was also empty inside I would say that this is one for Chef Ramsey to visit. Would have given it 0 stars if possible.
