Really terrible experience. We waited about a half hour to be sat for a party of 4, which wouldn't be so bad If we didn't walk past 4 empty tables on our way to be sat. There were at least 6 open tables in the restaurant while we were waiting. 

Our food took forever. Our appetizer came out with our meal and was cold. Our waitress was supposed to tell us about the gift cars deal which she did not, and the card on the table said if they forget they'd bring a free desert, and it never came. 

Wouldn't return solely because the service was AWFUL.
