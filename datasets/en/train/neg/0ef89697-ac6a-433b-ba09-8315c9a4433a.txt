Sixty minutes after our reservation we were seated.  N o other expensive restaurant I have ever been in ( NYC, Europe, San Fransisco) has ever treated us so shabbily.  fish portions are half the size they used to be with higher prices.  the waiters are actors trying to promote poor and expensive food with clever worrisome.
