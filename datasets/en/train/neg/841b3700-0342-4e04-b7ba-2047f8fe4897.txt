Hellooooooo...... :echo... echo...:

Myself and three other customers were waiting in line for about ten minutes with no one behind the counter. 

Not a sign, not a shout from someone in the back. Just a counter and delicious donuts mocking me... Just out of reach. 

What a frustrating experience. I even left, went next door and came back to see that people were STILL waiting for assistance. 

I eventually gave up. No donut for me.
