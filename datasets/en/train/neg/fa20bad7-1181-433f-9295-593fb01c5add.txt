DO NOT GO THERE...GO TO TO AN ER OR THE URGENT CARE JUST 3 BLOCKS NORTH of them.  The actual MD's are OK for basic stuff but are questionable on other things.  Their OFFICE STAFF ARE RUDE AS HECK!!!  Not helpful, really pushy, and think their XSHTX doesn't stink because they are on power trips.  Do not give these guys any of your hard earned $$$ unless you are in a super bind

If you are the owner of this practice, please fire all of your office staff in Gilbert and you may make it in business before you guys lose all your customers.  Hire some people that care about children and the parents that are working so hard to make the kids comfortable while we wait for up to 2 hours sometimes. your office staff don't care about the children and give parents a hard time.
