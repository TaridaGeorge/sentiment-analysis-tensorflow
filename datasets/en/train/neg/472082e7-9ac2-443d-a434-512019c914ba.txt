We were excited to try this place as we have been hearing alot about it.  Lee's smells like a hospital and it's a bit of a turn-off to the appetite.  We tried to get past it and try a sample...the girl gave us barely a speck of ice cream and the bit we got tasted stale and freezer burned.  The girl kept saying you want some ice cream with alcohol? Come on we are adults it's not some big deal to get alcohol...ugh we left ...I give the place only a few months:(
