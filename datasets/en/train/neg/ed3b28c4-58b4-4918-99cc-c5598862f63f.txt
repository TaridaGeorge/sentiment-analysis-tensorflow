Just went there today and bought an iced mint mocha. I wanted to see how it compared to Coffee Rush's iced mint mocha.  I was dissapointed.  First of all, Copper Stars 20oz iced mint mocha is $5. One dollar more than Coffee Rush's 20oz iced mint mocha. 

Second off all the iced mint mocha was very dissapointing. Hardly could taste any mint. Not worth $5 maybe $3.
