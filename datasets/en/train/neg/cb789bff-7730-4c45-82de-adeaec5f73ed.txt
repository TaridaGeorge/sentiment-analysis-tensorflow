The Meat Shop is great if you're a high-end restauranteur but don't count on them to treat you with respect if you're not.  I ordered a ham for my Dad's 89th birthday and when I arrived to pick it up the said they "forgot to write it down."  Since I had already told my Dad about the ham (and played it up, since it was such a great place), I had to accept $50 worth of random ham end pieces rather than the beauty I was expecting.  We'll prepare the pieces in our traditional way and I'm sure it will taste great.  But the Birthday story will be about how I was "ripped off" and not about the family get-together.
