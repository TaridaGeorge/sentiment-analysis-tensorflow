Do not go to this office unless you want to be ripped off. I have been going to this group for 12 years. I have seen dentists come and go and never once have I had one cavity or had any spots even 'flagged'. I saw a new dentist this time and she not only talked down to me as if I was a child, she told me I have two cavities that needed filled.  They chose to show me "pictures" of my teeth and not the X-rays trying to make the case. Really?! I can tell you where I WON'T be going for my next cleaning.
