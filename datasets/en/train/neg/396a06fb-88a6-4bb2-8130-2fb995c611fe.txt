Maybe it is cultural, but I do not like the food here. I want my own food  and not have to eat what everyone else wants.
We had a chicken dish last time with capers that was so dry that drinking water with it at the same time was a necessity. I felt like a raccoon.
It was too loud for us to have a real conversation and I didn't want to yell.
