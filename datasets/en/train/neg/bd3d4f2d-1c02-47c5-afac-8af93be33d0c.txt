I want to clarify that the Tatum and Cactus location is great, but this one really needs help. First, the service was horrendous. Young people who are clueless as far as serving goes.  Is this a training location for their employees???? Come on, folks. And...vacuuming the carpet while customers are eating is just gross. Going back to the bathroom, I noticed a stench and a big hole in the ceiling. What is going on with this location??? Thirty minutes after eating, I had to visit the bathroom with urgency. This is unacceptable for a Chompies. Get with the *&^(%(!  program folks.
