Fred's at Barney's has a lot of pressure to live up to New York and LA.

It failed miserably. 

We ordered the calamari which was "ok" for some reason the calamari Fred's at Barney's New York is so much better! The Belgian Pomme Frites were soggy and overly seasoned. Then we had the Robiolo with Truffle Oil. For two girls who drool at the thought of truffle anything, this was the most disgusting thing we both have ever eaten! I don't think, no actually I know for a fact, we will probably never come back here again!
