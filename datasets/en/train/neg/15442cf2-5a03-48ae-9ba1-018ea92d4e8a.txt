This place is a major dump. Looks nice from the outside, but super dirty elevators, hallways, walls, carpets, rooms. Unbelievable. Not sure how it can be this bad. It looks like 20 years of neglect but is less than five years old. Bring your black light and Purell. Be sure to wear shoes in your room. Nasty.
