started going to logans some years back and I really enjoyed it there, everyone was nice and the food was good. I'd say in the last year it has made a real turn around, the people are nice but just like others have said, you wait and wait for service and when it does come its not very good.The steaks that I use to like here now taste like mush. it doesnt even taste like your eating a steak and I like mine med. rare and thy cant seem to understand what that is. Have ordered fish that was so over cooked I couldnt eat it, not only was it over cooked it was cold, not warm ,COLD. If you want a good steak try Texas roadhouse off of I 17.
