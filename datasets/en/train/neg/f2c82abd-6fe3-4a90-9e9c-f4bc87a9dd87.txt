I went to SunDevil Auto a few weeks ago to get an oil change. It turns out my car needed $2,000+ in repairs. I took the car to two other mechanics and it turns out my car is fine. I do not recommend anyone going to this place!!! They even had the nerve to point out where the repairs were needed by putting my car on the lift. I took a picture of where they said was a leak and part needing replacing. The photo I took proved useful in catching this shop in a huge lie.
