I was very excited to try Majerle's several years ago.  I am a huge Suns fan, and we usually eat dinner near the arena before games.   Needless to say I was so disappointed. The food was not great and while we were eating a HUGE roach went crawling up the brick wall next to our table.  I couldn't finish my dinner and I hightailed it outa there!!! Never ever been back!!!
