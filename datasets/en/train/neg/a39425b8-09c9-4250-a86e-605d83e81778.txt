This mall is a heart attack waiting to happen . I went to AZ Mills this past weekend, oblivious to back to school shopping. Every store was jam packed with people and trying to navigate without bumping into angry parents and their pissed off kids was just not in the cards. I went to Pretzl Wetzl for sustenance and $13 later walked away with 2 pretzels and 2 lemonades for my and my husband.  We could have gotten a crappy meal for that price. Needless to say I probably won't go back to AZ Mills, at least not on the weekend.  No matter how many screamin' deals there are it's just not worth my sanity.
