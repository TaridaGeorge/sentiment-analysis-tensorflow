We tried, we really tried. We walked in and got sat with a friendly waitress. As we were purveying the menu, hubby thought it was really stupid that everything, (no really, everything) was a la carte and bite size. The waitress explained that the burger were just a few ounces, and we were like, "for $5?".... Uhhh..

We probably looked like terrible cheapskates but we walked out soon afterwards since there was no way we were paying 3 tiny burgers to for $15 when it would amount the the size of a McDonald's Big Mac. ON TOP of paying extra for fries, drinks, or anything else for that matter. I guess this review is mostly based on the pricing- and quantity of food, or lackthereof.

Nice. Nobody tried to stop us on our way out either. Showed how much they cared.
