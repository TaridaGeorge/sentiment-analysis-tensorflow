What can I say, this place is the worst!  I have eaten at this Arriba on many occasions, raw shrimp tacos and hairy ceiling fans were the nail in the coughin!  I talked to Jerry who introduced himself as the new General Manager, his resolution was a free meal next time I came in.  NO THANK YOU!  This is probably the dirtiest restaurant I have ever eaten at, the dust lingering above the booths was appaling.  If the restaurant is bad, imagine the kitchen!  If I could give it 0 stars I would.
