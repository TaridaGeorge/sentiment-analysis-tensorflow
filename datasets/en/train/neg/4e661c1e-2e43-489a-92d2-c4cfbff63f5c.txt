OH GOSH, OKAY...If you are searching for an apartment DO NOT choose this one.  My boyfriend has lived here for almost one year, and since then there has been nothing but DOG SHIT EVERYWHERE, trash on the premises, two nights ago there was a drug related shooting, and not to mention the PARKING SUCKS.  If you do not have an assigned spot good luck finding parking.  There might be 6 uncovered spots near the front, but lots more in the back.  Which is unfortunate because if I park in the back it is a good 1/2 mile walk, and I do not like doing that every day.  Definitely needs more guest parking.  Overall, my thoughts on this place...dirty, unsafe, GHETTO.
