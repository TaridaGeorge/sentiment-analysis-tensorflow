CHECK YOUR RECEIPT!!!  My tab was correct ($ 34.86 for 3 drinks), but when the server ran my credit card he entered $ 64.86.  I do not think it was an accident. He avoided me for at least 30 min after bringing me the check.  Finally had to go to the bar to take care of it. 

Pretentious staff and clientele.  Whatever the DJ was mixing it sounded like middle eastern music...felt like I should have been smoking a hookah.

On a positive note, my martini was good and unisex bathrooms were clean.
