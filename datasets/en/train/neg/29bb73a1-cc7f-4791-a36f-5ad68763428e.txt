My husband and I decided to stop in and check out this boutique to see what the hype was all about.  First of all, we weren't even greeted and we were the only people in the store.  This place is great if you're into spending tons of money on novelty items.  Their clothes are ridiculously over-priced.  I can see if you're paying for good quality, hard to find fabrics but that's not the case at France's.   If you really want these type of novelty items, you're better off taking a drive to Tucson and hitting the shops on 4th Avenue.  Same stuff for A LOT less. Another alternative is eBay.
