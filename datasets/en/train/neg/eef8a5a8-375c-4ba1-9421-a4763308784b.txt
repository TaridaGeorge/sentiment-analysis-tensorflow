Brought my 4 year old daughter here. They scratched her 100 times s she cried. I had too tell them to stop. My fault that i didn't know what to expect and let out go too long. There fault that they are supposed to center their practice around children and have no compassion our common sense when dealing with children. I think perhaps they should stop taking new patients if they are so busy they can't take the time to care for there patience.
