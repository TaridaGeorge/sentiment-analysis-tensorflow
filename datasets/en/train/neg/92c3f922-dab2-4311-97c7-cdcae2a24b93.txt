Thought I was the only unlucky person who got a brined turkey FULL of quills! :-(  Turkey day was soooo much more stressful because of it and it totally threw my prep/cooking timeline off - not to mention the sore fingers!  Tweezers didn't even help :-(  Even had to pull them as I basted the turkey while it cooked!  First time trying a brined turkey which tasted great - but the unpleasant surprise and stress that it caused (made me hit the wine even earlier) wasn't worth it :-(
