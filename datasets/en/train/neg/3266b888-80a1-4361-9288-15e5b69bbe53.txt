The only reason I go to Bashas is for the convenience. First of all make sure you have some extra time to run an errand there since you will be waiting in the checkout line. The checkout clerks are maybe a little outdated like the store itself. Oh and make sure you check expiration dates on the products. I bought some crackers for work and they were 6 months past the expiration date. Don't forget your Bashas card if you have one, they won't give you a courtesy swipe. 1 star because i can't give 0.
