I was very excited to try this place after reading the reviews, but I must say after trying this place I will never return. We ordered the pan pizza to go and it was so dry and over cooked we asked for a replacement pizza. After returning to exchange our pizza, the lady complains that 5 slices have been bitten into.  There was 4 of us eating, and we all agreed the pizza was awful, so we stopped eating our slices half way through.  The lady at the counter was so incredibly rude, and when I informed her we would not be returning she responded "good." The pizza we were given next was average at best.  The crust was dry and hard, and the cheese and sause was average.  Very dissappointing for a place this is above average in price. Will not return.
