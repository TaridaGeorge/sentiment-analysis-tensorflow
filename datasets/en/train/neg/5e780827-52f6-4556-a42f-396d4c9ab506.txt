This place was amazing when it first opened (hence some of the older reviews). But it has gone seriously downhill. I don't know if it is because of the economy or what. As others have mentioned, there are never any customers in there. Their selection has deteriorated to only what others would not buy. You cannot get a sales rep to even acknowledge you. 

I almost wish it would close down until the economy allows it to reopen in its full grandeur.  It is sad at this point.  I was in the flooring department for an hour and couldn't even get the attention of a sales rep who almost ran into me on their way to go hide in the backroom.
