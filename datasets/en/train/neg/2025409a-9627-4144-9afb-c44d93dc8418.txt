This place is crappy. What's stupid is I can go back to this place and my husband can't. He is not allowed back because of his fathers screw up. He has never been apart of his dad's life and never shared a room at this hell hole.We didn't know he would be our neighbor when we stayed there.  This affected us if we ever wanted to move there in the future and thank goodness we don't. Check out Legacey Suites at 83rd ave and mcdowell. They are much better and cleaner,
