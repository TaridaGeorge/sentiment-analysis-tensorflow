I had a craving for pasta so I stopped by. Since this location was close to my house and I had heard they have good food I gave them a try.  I ordered a "safe" choice the spaghetti and meatballs. As I waited I saw some awards on the wall so I was hopeful. I was greatly disappointed! The dish had no flavor to it. I like big flavors in pasta dishes. This tasted like they opened a can of tomato sauce and warmed it up. Maybe their pizza is better, but I wont go back.
