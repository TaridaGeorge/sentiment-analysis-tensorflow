My experience here was not so great! The sandwiches lacked meat, cheese, ingredients and worst of all flavor!!! They were out of the kids meal items so instead of fruit she had a cookie and larger drink!! The sandwich I had was bad! And the sandwich Jared R ordered was loaded but he was not told that the 6 extra toppings were going to cost him over $2 extra!!! His medium sandwich was over $8!! Thats insane! Makes me see how much subway or even quiznos can be such a great deal!!
