A crying shame... the other Flo's restaurants are really impressive. However, in truncating the menu and making it quick and airport-friendly, they did away with everything good about their other restaurants. Just a bad bad move. I have to agree with Mysterious Q, I'd hit up a Panda Express first... and I've driven half-an-hour (and would again) for Flo's other restaurants.
