We stopped by for our first experience of Indian food a little more then a week ago.  There was only my husband and I and one other couple in the whole place.  The one waiter spent the entire time talking to the other couple.  We ordered drinks that we never actually received.  At the suggestion of our waiter who was friendly in the few minutes he actually spent speaking with us, we had the buffet. It seemed very very bland.  I was really excited to try Indian food because I'd heard such wonderful things about the flavors.  We will be trying Indian food again, but never from here.
