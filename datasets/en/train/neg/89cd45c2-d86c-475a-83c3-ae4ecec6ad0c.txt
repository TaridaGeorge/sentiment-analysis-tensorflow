Went here for breakfast today. Horrible experience. Came in and waited for a bit for someone to acknowledge us. Said to sit anywhere. Sat down and waited 5-10mins just to get a menu. Waited another 5-10mins to order. Wife wanted bagel sandwich. No bagels left. Ordered pancakes w/chocolate chips to share, breakfast burrito and egg sandwich. Took about 30mins because they screwed up the pancakes she said. Finally got the order and no chocolate chips in pancakes. Pancakes were mediocre at best. Was supposed to be 3, only got 2. Burrito was not that great. Orange juice was from Kroeger.

Very disappointing to say the least. Will not go back.
