This is just plain awful. One of the many one and done spots that I have hit in the valley over the years. It was quite a while ago, but it was so bad that it is impossible to forget.

I love chile rellenos. Not sure what they think they are serving here, but it looked nothing like what I am accustomed to. Admittedly I have partaken in festive Hispanic family events where grandma was in charge in the kitchen, and of course I was tied to her apron so I have eaten some top notch versions.  But this. In a nutshell it was possibly  half of a canned pepper, laced with some foul cheese-like gloop, and triple dipped in copious amounts of batter. It comes out looking like what I would imagine would be a golden brown silicone breast implant. Though the implant might taste better.
