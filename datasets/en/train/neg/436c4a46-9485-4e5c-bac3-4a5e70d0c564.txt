Not a fan.  I was in the Biltmore yesterday shopping with my dog and decided to go and buy her a few treats.  As I picked out a bag of about 20 baked treats, my total came to be about $3.00.  I did not have any cash on me so I took out my "plastic money" the debt card and they wouldn't take it telling me that I needed to buy a few more things because they have a $5.00 minimum.  What store has a minimum nowadays???  

The customer service was also very lack luster.  The dogs of the store employees were jumping on me which I found a bit annoying. 

Needless to say a store that I used to like, I will no longer be back.  There are so many other great dog stores...
