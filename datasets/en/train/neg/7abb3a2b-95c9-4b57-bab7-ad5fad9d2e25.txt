I use this location since it is so close to work. However,  I will no longer be using this location any longer. I have given the store many chances to make up for slow service.

I typically use the drive thru. I always have a long wait, Friday was the last time I was there and I waited for 10 minutes. I will use the coffee shop across the street (Dunkin Donuts) for now on. The coffee is just as good and they are extremely fast.
