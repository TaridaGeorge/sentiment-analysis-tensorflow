Based solely on the previous reviewers good experience with this landscaper, I decided to give him a call. He was very nice on the phone, however he never showed up at my house to take care of my yard. No phone call, nothing. Either his business is so incredibly booming right now, or his phone and vehicle were swallowed up in a space-time vortex. Regardless, he successfully lived up to my expectations regarding landscapers.
