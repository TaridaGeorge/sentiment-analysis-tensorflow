After a few visits where I was quite happy with the food I went again today and was hugely disappointed.  I don't know if they're focusing on their upcoming 2nd location or what but the quality of the food just isn't the same, nor was it for my dining companion who was also disappointed with the brisket he ordered.   I got the 'special' of the day, a 3 piece fried chicken dinner w/one side for $9.95, white meat costs $1.00 extra.   I've never seen such small pieces of chicken, looked more like cornish hen.  I received 2 wings & one drumstick..what..no thigh available?  The side was a very small serving of what was supposed to be spicy beans.  The beans were not spicy and they were also lukewarm.  We both felt totally ripped off and I'm taking this place off my rotation.  Benched!
