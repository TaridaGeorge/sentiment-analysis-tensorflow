Have you ever gone to a sandwich shop that won't give you anything on the side with your sandwich?

Well then visit the JJ here on 15425 Scottsdale rd by Kierland ,and when you want your hot peppers or vinegar, or anything else on the side you just won't get  it here.  

What kind of Cheap JA owns this place. Also owns one on Pima and Raintree. Same thing there Wont give you anything on the side. LOL
