Dude. Why are they such jerks? Total attitude from the time I walked in to paying the bill. I ordered a sandwich and the guy behind the counter gave me some meal deal with half a sandwich. Then when I asked why I only was given 1/2 sandwich the woman at the register said something to the man in a different language, he said something back to her, she rolled her eyes and put out her hand to accept my credit card. I was almost going to tell them where to stick their 1/2 sandwich but i had read good things on here about the food so I took it and left.

Food was meh. Bread was cold and stale. Pastrami was nothing special. Don't bother.
