Terrible first experience.  We were so fired up for this place, but dinner was a total letdown.

1) One person's dinner showed up a half hour after everyone else's.  Inexcusable.
2) No Pho.  "We ran out."  Whaaaaaaat?
3) Overpriced.  Significantly.
4) Out of way too many items on the food/drink menu.

Positives: really cute place, great menu with lots of variety.  Some fine-tuning might be able to fix the problems.  Good luck, Rice Paper.
