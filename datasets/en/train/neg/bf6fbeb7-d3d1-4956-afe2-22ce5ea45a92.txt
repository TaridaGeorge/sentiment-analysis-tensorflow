This place consummated with the Golden Goose being featured on the show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. It's overrated. If you think this place is worth standing in line and waiting for your food for an hour on the weekend, then you easily fall for hype. The inside is really small and couldn't be any louder, it also has scattered outside picnic tables. After you order you get to wait in another line to get a drink on a single fountain area. The food is above average. I think the salads are borderline bad. I realize it's all organic and local, I've been to plenty of places like that, and most of them are far better.
