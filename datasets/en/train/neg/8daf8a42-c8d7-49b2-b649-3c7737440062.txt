more like sugar deaddy's.

this place slid and slid fast. when i moved here 5 years ago, it was a great place to grab some beers outside on the patio. on a thursday thru saturday night, you'd actually have a hard time finding a parking spot.

now, it's like driving by a cemetery. after the tax deal, then all the fights that happen there, you couldn't pay me to go to that place. ghost town would be how i'd describe it. so, i will. it's a ghost town.

total waste of a great place. put a fork in it.
