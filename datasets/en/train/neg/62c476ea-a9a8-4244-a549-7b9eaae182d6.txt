The Worst Haircut I Have Ever Grieved Over Was Here!

What is it about cheap or inexpensive?  Does that mean they are all rejects from the Hair Cut Academy or what?....I think I could have cut my hair better if I could have stood behind myself and had sheers.

I guess in this case, I got what I paid for...The haircut was a disaster, even when I explained to the woman to just cut a 1/4 inch off everywhere for shape, she cut the hair down to 1/4 inch from my scalp!!!!!$#@@!##@!#@  I was soooo P*SSED!  

But I learned a valuable lesson!----The difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut is about three to four weeks growth time!

There was one good thing though!---LEAVING!
