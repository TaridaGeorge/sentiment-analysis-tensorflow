Seriously, people. MBFGR is "Mediterranean" food capitalizing on a hokey movie that for some reason some people liked. There's a lot better to be had out there- try Pita Jungle, Flaming Kabob, or Byblos, for examples. I have also eaten once at the Mill avenue location and both places have been a testament to mediocrity-and that's being complimentary. Every server I have had here has been....well, let's just say "special"- or maybe stoned. The food served and what the menu describes are seldom the same. Please, I beg you, avoid this chain and get some real food at a local establishment crafted and served by people who know where Greece is.
