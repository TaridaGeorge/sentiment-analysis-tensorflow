Worst customer service I've ever dealt with.  My upgrade was available and I wanted to switch to the iPhone 4s.   He told me that not only is it on back order for two weeks but the apple store in the mall was flat out also and I had no reason to check there.   I not only got my phone at the apple store but they had no shortage of phones.
