Baja Fresh, more like Baja garbage disposal and swept up floor stuff wrapped in a tortilla!

Baja Fresh's name is only appropriate if its opposite day.

They even put hydrogenated oils in the kids meals and the guacamole.

I wrote them an email telling them how wrong that is. 

They wrote me a semi defensive/aggrasive email back saying it gives a consistensy customers want.

Nice try to make it seem like people want it.

If they were aware of what it does to your body they wouldnt care about the stupid benefit of consistency.

I hate you Baja Garbage
