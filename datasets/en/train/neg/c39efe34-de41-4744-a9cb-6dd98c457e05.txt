This is not against CVS but this location.  The staff is AWFUL AND MEAN.  Not patient and considering there is a Walgreens right across the street, you would be better off going there.  If I could give "0" stars I would, the experience is always that bad.  

The pharmacy is not any better.  I called in a prescription and was told when I went to go pick it up that I had not done it correctly.  I had a mini altercation with the pharmacist who insisted I must not know how to use the phone system.  I have no interest in experiencing this location's employees, especially considering I am empowered with options, just as convenient.
