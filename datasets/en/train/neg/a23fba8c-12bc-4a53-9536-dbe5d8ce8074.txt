Beef Brisquit sandwich was not brisket it was chuck and it has TONS of fat on it, the baked beans were crunchy and not good at all. The pork rib ends were not tender and tasted  horrible "dry" , the meat was not smoked at all. I thought this was a smoke house?? Worst restaurant ever will not be back, and I highly do not recommend this place to anyone. For seeing this on the food network as being on the top 10 restaurants this place is far from the top 10.
