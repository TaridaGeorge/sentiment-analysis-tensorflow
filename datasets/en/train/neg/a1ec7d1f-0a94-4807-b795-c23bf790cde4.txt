Very disappointing and expensive.  We went there on Sunday and didn't realize our only choice was the Sunday Super menu for $35. That is way too much for fried chicken, especially when 2 of 3 pieces are wings! I've had better at KFC! The menu on their website was also different than the one we got in the restaurant. Had I known we couldn't  choose from the regular menu, I would have gone on a different day.
