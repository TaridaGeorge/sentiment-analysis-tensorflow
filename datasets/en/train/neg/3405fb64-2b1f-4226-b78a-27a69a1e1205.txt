After recommending this car wash to everyone for years now, I am sorry to say that I was treated like crap by the heavyset girl at the register.  My wife & I brought both our cars for a wash & oil change.  When we tried to pay, we said that we will be paying some on one card & some on another card. The girl got mad & said we cant do that. I said, why not & she got very stern & rude and said we just dont split up bills, they wrote it up on one ticket & that is the way it is. I asked her why she is being so rude? She answered,That's the way I talk I cant slow it down for you any more than the way I talk. With the help of a manager we paid & will never return!
