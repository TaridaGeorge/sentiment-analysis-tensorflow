This is not about the store it is about Cox via telephone. There was no account for Cox Corporate. 

We have been trying to get an I Pad to work with the Cox email. To say this is the worst possible service wold be an understatement but judging from the rfeveiews Cox does not care anyway.

First - we have been on hoild for ovefr 30 minutes now. Is that music as annoying to everybody else as it is to me? 

Next - we have called several tiems now to adress the I Pad issue. So far Apple, our IT peple and Best Buy have advosed that we drop Cox for email because it is notoriously bad.. I guess my comment would be if they get so many complaints would you not think issues like terrible music, incrediblly terrible service and just beeing generally annoying might not be adressed?
