Sent me home with a chicken meal instead of the vegetarian one I ordered and I didn't notice until I got home. Couldn't eat it and it was like 118 degrees outside so I decided to not go back. 

Called and let them know about this and the girl I talked to apologized and expressed her sympathy for me and told me that a manager would call me back to take care of this...

Never happened.  Seriously can't stand when people or businesses say they are going to do something but don't. The food is not awful, but this is a part of the "Service Industry" not the we forgot about you after we effed up your order industry. 

won't be back.
