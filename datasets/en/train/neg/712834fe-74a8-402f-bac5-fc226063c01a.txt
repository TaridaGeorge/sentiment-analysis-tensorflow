This is in reference to the bar at the Buttes.

The place is the worst bar imaginable compared to what it was supposed to be.

The staff is cranky and downright hateful.  The bartender was a sour, grouchy, horrible girl who acted like customers were a pain.  

As for the bar, they have heaters for outside that supposedly don't work.  The aforementioned cranky little girl told us that, personally I think is she just didn't want to turn them on.

As for the drinks...super expensive!  $16 for a mimosa.  Hilarious!  

I don't recommend this place to anyone, especially considering that a 10 min drive gets you to Mill Ave to far better places.
