This place and service is terrible. The facility itself was dirty, the tables were not wiped down people were literally standing waiting for their orders to takeout..the racks in the back were empty the staff were clueless as to what was going on...I didnt see a manager anywhere, I did wait on my order as it was already 715. The meal was horrible..I will go elsewhere and it wont be KFC~
