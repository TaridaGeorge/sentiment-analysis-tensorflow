This is one of the worst service I ever had. 
1. Had to wait a few minutes until someone greeted and seated me.
2. Didn't offer any drinks or silverware
3. I know economy is bad, but the place is way too hot.
4. Took forever to get my bill.
5 . Finally, I paid with credit card and they charged me extra $ .50 because it's under $ 10.00. There's no sign about paying extra if under $10.00.

Will never come to this place ever again.
