This is a great place to rent if you are a felon, are single with terrible credit, extremely poor, a registered sex offender, or an illegal immigrant. They don't do background or credit checks. That's the only thing to take away positive, as I know these types of people have a hard time finding somewhere to rent.

Keep in mind, however, that if they don't do background and criminal checks on the tenants, they probably don't do them on their employees either.

Please don't do business with Bennett Property Management Company if you have a family or things you care about.
