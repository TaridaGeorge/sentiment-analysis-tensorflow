I am extremely disapointed with the service offered by the office. Shannon was extremely unkind and did not treat me like a customer should be treated. Shannon scolded me for calling to touch base on ETA for the technician twice in one day. She was rude and I wasn't surprised to find other reviews about her specifcally online. I think she is doing the owners a majoy disservice.
Shannon said that when the technician is on his way I will get a call to let me know and that I don't need to keep calling her. Guess what?! I never got a call and the tech showed up. Luckily my neighbor was around.......I highly advise against the company only because of the service in the office. Rick, the tech was great!
