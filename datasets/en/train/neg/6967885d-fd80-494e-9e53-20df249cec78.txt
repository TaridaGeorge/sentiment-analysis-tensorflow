I've been a regular customer for about one year now. I've come to learn that the owner is the main issue. When he's at the store (not always) he seems to be put off by providing assistance to any customers. He doesn't seem to know how to use all of the store's equipment. And he's particularly rude on the phone. It's too bad, since I actually like most of his staff. Don't waste your time at this store.
