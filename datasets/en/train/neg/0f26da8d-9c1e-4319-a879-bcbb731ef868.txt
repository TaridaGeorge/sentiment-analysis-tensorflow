After waiting 10 minutes for our server to approach our table on a very slow Tuesday night we ordered our drinks and entrees. My husband a taco salad and I wanted to try something new so I went with fajitas. Whenever I see fajitas coming out they are engulfed with steam and you can hear them coming, well not my order it was barely hot. The beans tasted canned and guacamole was awful. We have been going to the one in Phoenix and Scottsdale for years and always loved it. It seems like the food and service is going downhill fast!
