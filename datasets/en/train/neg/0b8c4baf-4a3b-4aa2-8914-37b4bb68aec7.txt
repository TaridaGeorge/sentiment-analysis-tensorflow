Im not from around here but im sure common courtesy is something not practiced at the Martini Ranch. The bartender passed me up a shitload of times and I was charged $50 on my card for a $5 Stella. Maybe thats how they do it in Scottsdale to make sure a card is valid. I dont know. It would have been nice to know that. A $1 charge would make more sense

And try and talk to the door man. He is way to cool for you

May change rating after I find out about this $50 charge
