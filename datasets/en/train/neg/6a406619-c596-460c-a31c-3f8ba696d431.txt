We had resevations but arrived about 50 minutes early.  There were AT LEAST 20 empty tables that I could see.  We were told they wouldn't seat us until our reservation time.  We waited about 15 min. & asked again could we please be seated.  No.  LOTS of empty tables.  The  2 girls at the podium were rude, unpleasent & just plain awful.  We left & will never go back
