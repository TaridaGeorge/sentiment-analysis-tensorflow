I was so pissed off.

I ordered the Coronado Enchiladas, the special they had last week. They were awful. If I wanted undercooked tortillas with a veggie filling, and taco bell sauce, I could go to Taco Bell. But nontheless, I paid $9.

And they did not replace my crap food for free. I ended up paying $17 total for the Mongolian... Which is good, but not $17 good.

Make sure that you are going to enjoy what you get, because them not owning up to shitty food is a bad idea.
