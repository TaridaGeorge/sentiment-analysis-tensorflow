Terrible service the general manager was rude and his guard dog attacked our dog while they were just sitting on the grass with their leashes on. With management like that I'm surprised this place is still in business. Customer service doesn't apply here. Find a better resort elsewhere. I'm sure a 30$ a night hotel would be a nicer place.
