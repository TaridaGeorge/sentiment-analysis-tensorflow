I used Petsmart for the grooming services. I took my dog in there to get his claws cut. the lady from rude from the beginning. She asked if, for $2 more, if I wanted to get his claws sanded down also, for smoothness. I said yes and then left my little guy in there to get groomed. All she did was barely sand the tips down. Didn't cut anything off! So I paid $13 for my dog to basically have nothing done.
