Well as I predicted in my first review for this place, it did not last. Today I stopped by Li's bowl next door and Shakey Jakes was closed, good news is that there was some people looking at the place so maybe they'll reopen and create a better joint then the other owner. BBQ should have bold flavor, and that flavor should come from the meat, not the sauce that you might get lucky enough to find meat swimming in. I'd be glad to be an official taste tester before a possable reopening. Shakey Jakes didn't close becasue people didn't want BBQ, shakey Jakes closed because they didn't deliver in the taste catagory.
