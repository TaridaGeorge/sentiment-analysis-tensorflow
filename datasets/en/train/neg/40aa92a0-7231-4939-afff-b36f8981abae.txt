Same goes for our experiences in the past.  We will drive all the way to Tatum and Shea than go here. We had sent Christmas packages for overnight and paid a bunch for overnight shipping to CA. The packages arrive over a week late and this store was not helpful at all for the reasons for the delay. I can't believe that they are still in business. The elderly man who works there is so miserable when he waited on me that I left there in a bad mood. No thanks.
