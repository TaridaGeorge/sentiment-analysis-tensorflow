Los Dos Molinos - Home of the $20 itemized burrito.  The food is on par with any other Mexican joint but this place receives a single star because of the prices and rules.  You want guac, it'll cost you, you want sour cream, it'll cost you, you want anything besides meat and lettuce, it'll cost you.  One refill on the drinks, no splitting checks, cash only...I'd like to audit the books on this place.
