Do not take your car here. They charged me $52 for an oil change on a yukon - extra cost was for their supplies and an extra qt of oil. Then told me i have a leaking rear differential seal - $300 to repair. I said no thank you to the repair and got a second opinion. Second opinion said there is no leak. Also, the person who helped me was less than pleasant.
