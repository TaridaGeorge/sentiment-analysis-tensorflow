Really bad experience.  We prepaid for several batting cage TIS and were told that we could use some the next day if we needed to.  My 9 year old was hit by a wild pitch and we left.  We returned the next day in spite of the mishap and were told by Jason that we could not use our Prepaid tickets from the day before.

Their operations director was not available to,speak to me...Sharee Swander.

The place is very run down, many of the games don't work and the overall environment is very dirty so bring your gloves to keep away from the germs.

We also learned that someone had been seriously burned at the go kart track.

Ugh!
