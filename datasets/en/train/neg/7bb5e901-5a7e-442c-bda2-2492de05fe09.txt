I really wanted to like this place s the owner was very nice but at the end of any Gustatory  transaction the thing of importance is the food. Maybe I should have heeded Aileen's suggestion of going really early but instead I went there during lunch time (12:30 ish). I must say the Mung bean pastry (mongo monia??)  was horribly dry and hard which was the only baked good I tried. Of their fresh cooked fare I tried the Pancit Palabok and the Vegetable Lumpia. The noodle dish  was seriously bland and the noodles soggy. The vegetable Lumpia was dripping in oil. Such a disappointment... sigh have to try a little further .. maybe Jeppens...
