If you want a professional looking document printed, DONT GO HERE. Quality service is terrible. Screw up an order once, shame on you, screw it up twice, shame on me...I don't know what you say after a third time. I will never come back here again. 

This last time I was very specific with what I wanted. I asked for a full bleed. I set to normal parameters then made sure Rey understood and left. Four hours late when I came back my project looked terrible. When I said it wasn't acceptable, they said it was my fault. They knew what I wanted and when they saw a problem, instead of calling, they just ran it anyway. Then the girl helping me walked around continuing to mutter under her breath. 

Great people you've got working for you OfficeMax!
