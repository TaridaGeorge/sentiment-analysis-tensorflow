I was really P'd off, I was on a date and the girl didnt take my date's order and kept telling me it 9 bucks for my sandwich and a coke, honestly when is 9 bucks a good deal, it isnt. I actually had to tell her to also take his order and that he was treating, I mean how embarrassing. I love the chicken walnut but the people are too young and inexperienced here.
