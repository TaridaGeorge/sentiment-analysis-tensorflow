Had one meal at Crazy Earl's, the booth was unsafe with a sagging and slipping seat.  The food was fair.  Second and third time I TRIED to eat there, we stood for over ten minutes with the waitresses looking at us several times but failing to acknowledge us.   They were not even busy, so there was no excuse.  We finally sat at a booth and waited several more  minutes and were ignored.  I have never seen such crappy service.  Never have I been to any restaurant where the staff would not even acknowledge my presence and continue to ignore me for over ten minutes!  I would advise people to stay as far away from this lousy excuse for a restaurant and go to Taco Bell, the food is better.  And I am not a big fan of Taco Bell.
