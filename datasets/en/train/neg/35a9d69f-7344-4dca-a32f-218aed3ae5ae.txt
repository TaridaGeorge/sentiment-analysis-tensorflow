The reason why I am giving this a 1 star is that I cant give it a 0 star. My husband and I were stuck in their elevator for 20 minutes.  Ok I know things happen, but for the emergency call button not to work was TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE! I am in the food industry, and knowing that their elevator is the on way for disabled to get to their restaurant is via elevator. I was very pissed and I am still broken out in hives and traumatized from the experience last week.
However, the food was good. And the presentation was beautiful. Yes, we still dined there, despite our mishap.
