I've been shopping at Last Chance for many years. It used to be a place of great finds, treasures and the thrill of a great bargain. My past few trips have been so bad that I will not return. This entire place has gone downhill. The only thing that has improved is the women's dressing room which has been remodeled to include more private dressing spaces. The prices have gone up, quality down, and the incredible sales that Last Chance used to boast are long gone. About the only thing that has been consistient are crazy women shoppers- I've seen them push eachother and get thrown out of the store over a designer handbag. Individuals who shop here to re-sell things on ebay are what caused the demise of this place IMO
