Love Hooters, great reputation nationwide. The one in downtown Phoenix is unfortunate for the business. Most of the regular girls look sickly or are likely using meth judging by skin conditions and lack of composure.  Their boyfriends are seen often hanging out, giving jealous looks, yelling their names across the establishment, demanding constant attention, demanding free food or drink and these girls have no problem with being distracted from customers by them. I believe the best time to arrive here is lunch time or during major sporting events when the girls are motivated to work for a large crowd while their boyfriends are asleep at home or make themselves scarce.
