I just picked up an order from the Scottsdale restaurant and found it uneatable. 
 
The pot stickers were dried out, cold, and torn up; and had clearly been sitting around for sometime. The orange chicken was sooo bad we couldn't eat it and gave it to the dog. It made McDonald's chicken McNuggets look like haute cuisine. The chicken chunks were cold, old, and rubbery. The fried rice wasn't even fried, it was white rice with a bit of egg and oversized veggies in it. I could go on and on. 

i recommend if you want Asian food go to Pei Wei or PF Changs not Flo's
