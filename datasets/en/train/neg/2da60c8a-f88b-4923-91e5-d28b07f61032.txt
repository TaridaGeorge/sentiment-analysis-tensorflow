WOW - maybe I'm too old or we weren't dress up enough but with a bunch of empty tables we were told there would be a 20 min wait - there was. Our server ignored us for the next 20 mins since we asked for the happy hour menu. Too bad cause the food was a little better than ok. We asked about the bottomless mimosas and were told there was only  half hour left and it wouldn't be worth our time. OK so what do I want to eat, great swami who knows all......
