My stomach still hurts 8 months later when I think of this place.

I had dinner here when I was 7-8 months pregnant. For some reason they don't serve veggie fajitas here like most other restaurants. I asked the server if they could make them anyway, I figure they have the veggies on hand grill 'em and slap on my plate please. He said sure they would be able to accomodate my request. What I received was nothing but a giant pile of grilled onions. I shit you not. Our server actually brought this to me. No green pepper, no tomato, no nothing. Just onion. WTF. I was starving, nothing else appealed to me so I stuffed my tortillas with onions, rice and guacamole. Had the worst heartburn ever. Oh, to top it off they had the balls to charge something like 14.99 for it!

Never going back.
