Bad news for any regulars here.
Silvertouch is no longer. 
They've sold and are operating under Arizona Car Wash.
Bobby is also no longer there.  
Props to the Weiss brothers and Bobby for many years of cleaning my rides, and the great personal touch. 

As for the new company? 
Rude order taker.
Bad vacuum.
Half-assed cleaned.
Inside not cleaned.

I wouldn't give these guys the air out of my ass to cool their soup, let alone another dollar. 
Time to find a new car wash.
