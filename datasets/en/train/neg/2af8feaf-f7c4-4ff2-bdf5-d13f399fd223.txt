This is NOT, I repeat, NOT Mexican food. This is a poor imitation for Amercans and tourists who have never eaten real Mexican food. This stuff is garbage. Refried beans out of the can, Spanish rice that I am ashamed to call Spanish rice. The quality of the entrees was horrible and almost inedible.

The wait staff is rude at best. The hostess didn't acknowledge us when we walked in. My wife had to get her attention and then she simply grabbed the menus and grunted "follow me". 

I would not eat there ever again. Because it is in "North Scottsdale" and people think because of it's location that it must be good are being duped. Find a good little hole in the wall where you don't have to dress to impress to eat some junk like this and enjoy good food. 

Shame on you Jalapeno Inferno!!
