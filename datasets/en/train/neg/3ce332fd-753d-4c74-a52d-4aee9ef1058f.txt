What a bunch of douchebags.  I booked an appointment for my dad.  When I booked it they said, we've got slots open right now, he can come right in.  I told my dad this and he said, oh well, I'll just go in.  He gets there and instead of taking him next in line they make a 70 year old man wait around for 2 hours because he had an appointment.
