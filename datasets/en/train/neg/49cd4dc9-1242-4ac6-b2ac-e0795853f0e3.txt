Went there for lunch with 5 coworkers. Nobody liked the food and the atmosphere was horrible. Sat under a TV blaring Chinese news at a table with an off kilter lazy susan that pushed our dishes into our laps. 
The staff had to be flagged down several times - to bring forks, to fill water, to ask for the check, etc...
I had the orange chicken which was overly wangy with a cloying citrus sauce and large chunks of orange peel that I accidentally chewed on (and spit out) a couple times. yuck.
10 bucks (including tax and tip) for chicken, white rice, diet coke, and a headache.
Not going back.
