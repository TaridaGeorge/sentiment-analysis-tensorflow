The food was OK.    Buffet style. 

What really left a bad taste in my mouth was
a.) Having my complete credit card number left on the receipt
b.) Getting hit with a $100 phone call charge to my credit card.  When I called my bank to investigate, it turns out somebody had charged a $100 phone call from London to INDIA on my credit card.  
c.) It turns out it was somebody from this restaurant.  

Stay away from this shady place.  There are plenty of other honest Indian food businesses in the metro Phoenix area.
