What? Am I in East Oakland? 

G.H.E.T.T.O. 

Horrible customer service. 

I walked up to the deli counter and the worker behind the counter walked away. WTH. 

What's 'service with a smile'? No, 'have a nice day'? So I sarcastically said thank you as I was walking out and I get a 'you're welcome. I was thanking you for doing nothing, bagger. WTH. 

OH. I guess I should feel safe since there's police that frequently hang out in front of Fry's? WTH. 

I would nevereverever go to the Wells Fargo here because it attracts crazies and there are panhandlers in the parking lot. My experience with the Wells Fargo is for another review.
