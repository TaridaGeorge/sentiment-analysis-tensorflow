Stay away!  Many billing issues - front office is not customer helpful.  You must keep track of your own balances and insurance.  They will not help.  I was even billed for services they never did, but even with copies of my walk out statements as proof, they state they can bill per the estimates and do not have to prove they did the work via the walk out statements.
