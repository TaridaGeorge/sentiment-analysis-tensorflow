Went to Line Thai tonight with visiting relatives. It was not busy but we stood over 10 minutes just to be seated. Then we waited 15 minutes without seeing a waitress. No water, no order taking, no nothing. Finally just left.  I have no idea if the food is any good but the service is terrible. Many people were complaining. This restaurant is understaffed and needs a professional manager.  I will not go back.
