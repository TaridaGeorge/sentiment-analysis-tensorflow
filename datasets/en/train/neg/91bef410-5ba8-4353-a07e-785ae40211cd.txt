Full of Great food IF YOU COULD GET TO IT! the placed was packed and full of CHAOS.

The SuperFarm Super Truck was one that made an extra effort to treat people nice running food to people in line. (maybe others did but I couldn't tell)

Band that I heard was good.

Bricks were on ground that people could trip on. (not too far from short leash dogs) this area was SARDINE SQUISH CITY.

AT LEAST WE WERE GIVEN WATER so you wouldn't choke on food. 

Hopefully next year they will get it together but I'm skipping it.

we left early and went out to eat

Nov.2 slight update,
after contacting them we received a refund
