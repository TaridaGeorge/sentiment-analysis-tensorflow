This Paradise Bakery makes all the others look awful! The people that work there do not even care when customers are around and will just say inappropriate things, its okay with me, BUT NOT IN FRONT OF CHILDREN! I was very offended and they weren't even my kids! This was honestly the last strike! 

The second strike was a HAIR in my fruit salad. I mean, that is just gross and made me wonder why everyone behind the counter weren't wearing hair nets. 

The first strike is they are always out of something or another like edamame! That is what makes the Asian salad! No point in getting it. 

Its a shame that this Paradise Bakery is so awful because it is the closest one to my house! Guess I will have to drive all the way to Scottsdale and 101 if I want Paradise.
