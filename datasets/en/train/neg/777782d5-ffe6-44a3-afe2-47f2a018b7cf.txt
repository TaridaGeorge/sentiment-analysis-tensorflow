I'm still searching for good Chinese food here in Phoenix, and this restaurant did not complete my quest. I have to admit, I was initially excited by the decor as it reminded me of the fantastic Chinese restaurants I would visit growing up in Sacramento. But the food did not measure up: Canned mushrooms. Bland, runny brown sauce. Flavorless egg roll. Overcooked and stale fried wontons. After a few bites, I was not inspired to continue eating. Disappointing.
