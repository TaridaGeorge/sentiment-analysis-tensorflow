My boyfriend is crying. 

Seriously. Not hyperbole.

Okay, he's had a long day, but the awful pad thai and sweet-and-sour seafood curry just pushed him over the edge. I don't forgive places that hurt him. If I say I want this place to have an accident in a back alley, can that be used against me in court? 

There are half a dozen decent thai places in the area. There's no excuse to go to Thai E-San.
