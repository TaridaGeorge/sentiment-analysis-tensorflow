Family have been seeing Dr. Edgecomb for over four years. As mentioned by the previous poster, he has left this office. A "Dr. Thomas" had an available appointment for a family member last week. No bedside manner, didn't listen, had an attitude-COLD as ice. Wow, if she's already like this as a new Dr, just think what she'll be like in 10 yrs. No thanks! Get your laptop out of your face and actually smile and ask the patient what you can do to help them...not just a number..it's a human being looking for a caring Dr.
