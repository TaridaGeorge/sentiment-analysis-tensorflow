Yelpers beware.  Unless you are into loud awful music and bad beer this is not a good spot to go to. In a remote part of north Phoenix we stopped in on our way back to civilazation after visiting Flagstaff.  I ordered the wit and thought it was simply disgusting. My girlfriend ordered the Red Ale and it was almost just as bad.  Paid for our beers and left them almost full and headed to Mellow Mushroom instead to get the bad taste out of our mouths.
