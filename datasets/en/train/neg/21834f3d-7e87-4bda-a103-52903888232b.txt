Sunday was the 3rd chance I've given this place, becasue I like the decor and the music.  But the fact is, the food is bland, over-priced and the service is bad.  This last visit, the waiter only showed up to take our order, and pick up the check.  The food was delivered by others.  I watched the waiter walk around aimlessly like he had nothing to do, and was even standing on the main floor watching TV a great deal of the time.

I had a house margarita, which I know is not supposed to be quality, but I have a low resistance to alcohol.  It tasted like lime-flavored water and no alcohol at all could be detected.

I'm done!  Sorry Jimmy!  Better call "Bar Rescue" !
