DO NOT ENTER INTO ANY BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS WITH THIS FRAUDULENT COMPANY.

I ordered a door from Dynasty five months ago and am STILL waiting for my door to arrive. I called on numerous occasions to find myself dealing with rude, unhelpful, and incompetent people. The ETA for my door has been pushed back twice already (5 weeks each time). I kept receiving the same response from the "manager." Apparently, they're going through "hard times" and cannot have my door shipped from China. However, I found out today from an employee that they have not even started production on my door. I believe this is a fraudulent company and that I have been scammed. 

Be careful!
