Skip this place. Spoiled fish in sushi (ruined my appetite before my first bite), room temperature crab tasted funny (wife didn't eat afterwards), cold food in the hot trays, and hard chicken that had been under the lights too long. Six of us went and none of us ate a third bite. Pepsi was good though.
