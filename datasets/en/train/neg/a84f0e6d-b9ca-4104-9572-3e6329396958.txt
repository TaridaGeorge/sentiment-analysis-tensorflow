Never going back again. Ordered a hamburger "medium" and when we received it "well done",we requested to speak to the manager. Craig the manager explained to us with his racial slurs of how his Latin cook must of cooked it too long. He finds that "The Latins" tend to over-cook everything. Thanks for your ignorance Craig. We will never return.
