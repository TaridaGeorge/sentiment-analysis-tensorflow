I was invited to an event here for channeling/meditation. I agree with all the other post - the grounds emit a peaceful atmosphere and great energy abounds. But all that good feeling came crashing down when a woman from the church, huffed into the area and very rudely let it be known that we were not welcome there. The funny thing - I was the only one there! I was waiting for the group of people who had just arrived. Geez, talk about being made to feel lke I somehow personally offended this person! 

The person coordinating the event told me she and others met on the grounds all the time and never had a problem.  Who knows what this woman's problem was that day. All I know is I will never step foot in that place again.
