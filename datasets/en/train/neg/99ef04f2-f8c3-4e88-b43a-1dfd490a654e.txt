I did not have a good experience AT ALL. There were was a very limited color selection, which was the first disappointment. The girl that did my manicure was playing with her phone the entire time and distracted. When she was working on my cuticles she hacked at them haphazardly and, what do you know, cut me. TWICE. As I was bleeding all over she just looked at me sheepishly and said, "Sorry." 

She did a rushed job on the polish and it looked terrible. Not impressed. AT ALL. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. My friend had a pedicure at the same time and her experience was not a positive one, either.

Stay away.
