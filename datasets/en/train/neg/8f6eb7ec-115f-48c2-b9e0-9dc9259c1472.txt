Oh god what a disaster.  The only thing that redeems this place was the cheap prices.  I've been to plenty of Chinese Buffets in my life and I drive by this one every day.  We finally had to go in and let me say - the quality of the decor matches the quality of food.  

The wallpaper is peeling, the floors look unwashed, and the tables are like something out of your work's lunch room.  

The waitress isn't bad, the cook seems to refresh the food often, and some of the dishes aren't disgusting.

Most are though.  Too bad.
