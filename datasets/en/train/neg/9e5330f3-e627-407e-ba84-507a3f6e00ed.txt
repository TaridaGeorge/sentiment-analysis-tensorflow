I found Embelish Home online after searching for home decor botiques.  Their website advertises as open on Saturdays.  I drove 1/2 hour from Chandler to visit their store on at Saturday only to find a closed sign on the door at 1:00pm. Long wasted drive for a Saturday afternoon. Even the door says open on Saturdays.
