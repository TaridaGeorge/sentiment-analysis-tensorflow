Larry the manager needs to go to customer service school.  If I treated my customers as rude and abruptly as he just treated me I'd be unemployed.  Glad I have a choice of where I take my business and assured it will never be there again.  Should have known when I picked it up based on the lack of quality customer service that the return would be equally challenging.
