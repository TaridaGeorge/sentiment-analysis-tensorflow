I really want to like this place. Their food is delicious - the crab puffs are addicting and melt in your mouth.

Unfortunately the service is terrible. It takes forever to get a drink at the bar on weekend nights, which is the only time to go since it is dead during the week. On First Fridays they don't take reservations past a certain time and then you have to put your name on a list. Each time I've put my name on this list they have crossed it off without trying to locate me, as I sit waiting for my party's name to be called right in front of the door. I then have to argue with the hostess to get back on the list to wait again.
