Man what can we say about this place? Karen and I went there of course due to seeing it from Travel Channel and we were both excited but left so disgusted and very disappointed. The lard on the burger buns? Wow that's just nasty and don't get me started on the smell of that.
Pretty cool place to visit and take photos though but dont eat there if you don't have to.
