I came here for a weekend brunch. At first I was sort of confused by the deco, then my friend explained that the building formerly belonged to PF Chang. Inside it looked no less than a highschool cafeteria. I totally agree with AMber W's comment that this place really has no personality.
The food was mediocre. I didn't order anything fancy, just strawberry belgian waffle and a side of sausages. The waffle came out bland (apparently they forgot to add strawberries), kinda cold. The sausages were good size but over cooked, thus pretty tough. 
The service was bad. Our bread finally got to our table exactly 2 minutes before the food arrived.
Maybe it was just a very busy weekend. Maybe I should have ordered something else. All in all, I don't think any item in the menu particularly stood out to make me want to come back.
