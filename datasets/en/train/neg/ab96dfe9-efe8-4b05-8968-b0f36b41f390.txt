Royal Flush Fail!  Your new concept "Asian Market" was a very bad move.  We used to go to this location at least once a month.  Since, your shift  to market concept we drive right on bye...:(  It sucks because it was a fall back restaurant in our neighborhood. Its now one step up 'maybe" from Panda Express. NOT!
