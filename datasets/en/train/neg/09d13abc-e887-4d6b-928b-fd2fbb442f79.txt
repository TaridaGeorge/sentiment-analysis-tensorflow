The customer representative at this location needs to learn how to deal with their customers. The person with whom I dealt was Stefanie and she has no idea about what is meant by customer satisfaction or service. once the car is sold to you, you are no longer an important person to them. There is only one guy in the whole dealership that I found is very nice. His name is Iain. Thats it. Thats the only good thing about this place. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Stay away from here....
