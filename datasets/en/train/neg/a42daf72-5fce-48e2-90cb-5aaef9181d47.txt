Holy crap. First of all, the place is in a slummy neighborhood. I showed up for my first (and last) appointment and literally did not feel comfortable just walking through the parking lot. I waited for 30 minutes in the non-air conditioned lobby and finally asked the receptionist how much longer it would be. After five more minutes, she informed me that the doctor wouldn't be available for at least another 20. I lied and said I'd reschedule and scrammed out of there.
