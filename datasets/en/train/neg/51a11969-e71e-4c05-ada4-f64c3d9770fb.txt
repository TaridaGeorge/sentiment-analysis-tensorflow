Last night 11/9/10, 6 of us went to what used to be a top rated Happy
Hour here.  Let me tell you, cross it off your list! They've changed the appetizers, raised the prices and service was non existant now that their
business has picked up!  We could not get waited on on the patio and
actually went in twice to find our server, who announced she was really busy inside and didn't even attempt to apologize.  We ended up leaving
after over and hour and a half and went to another restaurant. 
Cross this place off your Happy Hour list-they no longer want our business!
