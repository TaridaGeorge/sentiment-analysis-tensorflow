Went here for a manicure after previously having a shellac manicure elsewhere.  Instead of soaking my nails in remover for 5-10 minutes to take off the old polish, the nail technician pried/chiseled the old polish off with a fake nail.  It hurt and left my nails brittle until they grew out (over a month).  

There are plenty of great nail salons in the area that provide top notch service at an affordable price - don't waste your time here.
