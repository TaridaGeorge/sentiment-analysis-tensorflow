Don't go here! We looked up tons of reviews before deciding on Mile Auto and had a horrible experience! I dropped my husbands car off at 9am and by the time I went to pick it up at 4pm, there was a huge dent in the drivers side front panel! The dent was SO bad that the door can no longer be opened all the way. With this being said, the staff vehemently denied that the dent happened while in their care. They did everything in their power to make us look and feel like con artists that intentionally brought our dented up car there to blame on them. I never knew that I would have to photograph my car before taking it to get REPAIRED! What a lesson to learn!
