I was hoping for finally a good Philly but didn't find it here. They have the meat correct with exception of its quality. The bread seemed old and tasted stale. Finally their fries were a disappointment. I recall going to a Charley's in a mall and they were awesome! Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here :-(
