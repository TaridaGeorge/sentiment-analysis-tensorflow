Unbelievable. We stood here waiting for 20 minutes to get to the counter. While at the counter it took yet another 30 minutes before we were given a rental car that we had already paid for and confirmed on line. I cannot understand how this Avis rental car inside the airport is still in business. It must only be in business because people coming from another location have never rented from Avis rental car before.
