Today was my second experience with this salon and it was probably the worst customer service I have experienced in a salon, ever. I am not even going to go into all of it, but the worst of it was that the receptionist had to shampoo me and blow-dry my hair while the stylist fit in her friend. The stylist never even came to check how the color turned out. I left with damp, unstyled hair, needing toner and a cut (which I was scheduled for). I am just so surprised. I better find a new salon to fix this fast!
