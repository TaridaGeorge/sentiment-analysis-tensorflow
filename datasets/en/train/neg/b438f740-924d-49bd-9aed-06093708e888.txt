HORRIBLE! Awful service, burned food, dirty restaurant and cooks, ants on the tables, limited seating, the list could go on and on. The "Meal Deal" includes fries and a drink which is a can of Safeway brand soda. STAY AWAY! I will never go back to this place. If you want to overpay for food from a what looks like a dirty crack house, this is your place!
