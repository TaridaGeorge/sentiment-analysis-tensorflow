I've rented through Bennet for almost a year and read some pretty bad reviews before hand, but I thought my experience might be better considering I pay rent on time if not early right? WRONG. Any time I have an issue that maintenance needs to deal with I call and they transfer me to my "property manager" I never hear from her and ever since signing my lease have yet to speak with her. I wait days on end and call her voicemail hoping to get some sort of issue resolved with this woman instead I call the office back and eventually they just deal with it for me. If I decide to deal with this company again in the future I will find someone who actually does their job instead of this Ginny person who doesn't even have the courtesy to call someone back.
