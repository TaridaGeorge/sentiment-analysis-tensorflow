I am writing review so other people become aware about the cheat the owner is doing. 3 of us went there for dinner buffet. Honestly, Food was not bad. 

First issue was with pricing; there website says 11.99 for dinner buffet, even restaurant menu says 11.99 and they actually charge 12.99/person..  BEWARE!! . They didn't change after I highlighted issue because web/menu says 11.99. He said they just changed it last month. He is probably doing same thing for lunch buffet aswell.

Second, they add 18% graduaty even for Buffet without my permission (for 3 people it is not mandatory). I think that was too high for buffet. He didn't change that either. Overall it turned-out valley's most expensive indian buffet. I WOULD NOT GO THERE AGAIN.
