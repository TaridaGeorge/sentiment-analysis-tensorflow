If you do get served (15 minutes after you seat yourself, hello?) your pizza choices are thin "New York style" or extra thin and crispy. I wanted "New York-Style" and what I got was thicker than Hungry Howie's with entirely too much cheese and the red sauce was strangely hotter than the crust and cheese - I burned my mouth, even after waiting a few minutes for it to cool down.
There is no way in hell you're going to be able to hold a slice and fold it lengthwise with one hand - the crust is entirely too thick. This is NOT a New York style pizza.
