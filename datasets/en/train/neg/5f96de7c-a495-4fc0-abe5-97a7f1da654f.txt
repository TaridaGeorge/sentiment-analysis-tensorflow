The website should have something saying if there is rain they are not going to open.  We drove 45 minutes from a hotel to find out cowboys don't go outside in the rain.  When I called to see if they were going to open, they said the following day.  Since this is a tourist place, most people can't return.  At least make a daily voicemail, and put on the website to call to verify hours and if the place is open.  Too bad you can't give negative stars.
