Ok, can someone explain the fascination with the cheese crisp? Flour tortilla, cheese, hot oven. Am I to believe that this is a reason to go out to this place, or any place for that matter? 

Went to this place once, Glendale location. Food was not only less than mediocre but the only thing that was temperature hot was the plate. A good recipe for getting sick.
