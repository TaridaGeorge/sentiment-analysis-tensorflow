Very disappointed with this place.

I'll just highlight to make things easier:

-The service was quite poor and we were ignored most of the night(partly due to all the issues with our food).

-Cheese plate:  Hair on the platter, plastic still on the cheese(WTF?).  How do you mess up a cheese platter!!!!

-I ordered the steak:  Everything came out COLD...and I mean cold.  I sent it back and  it was comical when it returned...the portion size of everything shrunk in half.

-In general everyone's food was not that good.

We did not even get an apology for any of the issues we had.

This place is totally not worth the price.
