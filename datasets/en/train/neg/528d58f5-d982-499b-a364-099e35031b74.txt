The food here is tasty enough, but nothing you couldn't find elsewhere. That is literally the only good thing I have to say about Chloe's Corner. I have been here several times and each time I have been here the staff has been incredibly rude and unhelpful. 

Their menu is a little pricey for the mediocre quality and limited variety of their menu. 

Also, the last time I was at Chloe's corner the roof was leaking on the table. Not cool.
