I went to Bombay Spice not long after moving to Paradise Valley from Scottsdale.  I knew that it was a 'healthier' Indian food, but I didn't know that meant they didn't use salt.  AT ALL.  Got a cup of lentil soup, and while I could taste the spices in it, it was watery and bland.  The texture was really off-putting.  The chicken tikka masala with cauliflower was no better.  It was a huge portion, but bland bland bland.  The 'naan' I liked, even though it is clearly non-traditional and clearly not homemade.  I will never ever come back here and waste my money on bland food again.
