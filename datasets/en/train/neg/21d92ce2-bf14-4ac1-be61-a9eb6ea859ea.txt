Very unprofessional staff and the salon is small and tight. It is not clean and I even pointed out a cockroach out to them. She just picked up a broom and swept it up, no apologies or anything from the girl. Brushes, combs and scissors were all dirty with hair. Very disgusting! The floor had hair all over and it started making hair ball, that's how old it was. EWW! 
Please don't go here, you will waste your time and more importantly your money. 
Just don't go....trust me!
