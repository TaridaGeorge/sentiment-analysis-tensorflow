The server was so terrible I can hardly remember the food experience.  She failed to return to give us water, or check on us at all.  Failed to clean our table as we finished appetizers and our main course.  The brownie dessert was a major fail, the brownie was too hard.  My daughter had the apple crisp and the apples were all clumped together.  We'd never go back again.  The pizza was 'meh" for $13.50 each.
