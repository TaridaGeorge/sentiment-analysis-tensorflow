Over rated dreck. Its about time we call a spade a spade. Come on people, its a mediocre burger joint with not a lot of options. The fries don't hold heat at all and are good for the first 45 seconds and anytime after that they are basically cold mushy potato chips. The burgers are alright but go to Dairy Queen and get the mushroom swiss burger or the Flame Thrower at DQ if you are looking for a fast burger. Oh yeah, the shakes are foamy crap, the ones I have had were barely chilled and gross. The animal fries my wife gets looks like someone threw up all over a plate of fries. No thanks.
