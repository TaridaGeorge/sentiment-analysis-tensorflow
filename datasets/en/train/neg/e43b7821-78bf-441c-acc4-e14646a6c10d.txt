Is there a NO STAR rating?  30 minutes, 20 dollars, car came out clean on the outside, just as dirty on the inside.  When I asked them to clean the inside since I paid for it, they did it pathetically again.  I just went home and cleaned it myself.  I also enjoyed the guy's swastika tat, great place for the kids.
