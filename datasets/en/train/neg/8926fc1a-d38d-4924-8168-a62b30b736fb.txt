The drivers door window would not work.  In taking the vehicle to Pep Boys, they replaced a $244 part that was not needed and the window still doesn't work.  After the fact, they told us they could do a $44 diagnostic check to see what might be wrong but would not credit the $244 nor return it.  What a rip off!!!  
They lost me and my friends as customers.
