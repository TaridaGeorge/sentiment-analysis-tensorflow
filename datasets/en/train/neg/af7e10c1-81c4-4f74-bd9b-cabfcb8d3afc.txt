These people are crooks.  Do not go there unless it is for tires or wheels and at that double check their prices and work.  We j were upsold several unnecessary $750 of repairs that did not fix a problem.  My husband told them what to do and they would not even make a small repair.  He did it himself for only $2.99.  That some week I had them check the AC on my car.  $400 later for a tube from China for $136 plus $95 labor and the freon they did not refill I had to return only to be told the compressor was bad and needed to be replaced.  I went to my dealer who filled the freon and everything is fine.  We will NEVER go there again.  Shame on them.
