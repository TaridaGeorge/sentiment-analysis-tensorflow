I really don't like this gym. I haven't had much luck with ever coming in when a friendly staff member is working. Most of the people seem either uninterested in their job or uninformed about what their job is. It smells sweaty when you walk in. The locker rooms are not good- no tv's, no swim suit dryer, and no privacy if you need to shower. Please renovate and hire a more enthusiastic staff!
