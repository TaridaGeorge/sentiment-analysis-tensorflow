WORST USPA EVER!!!!!!  Rude, old, angry women.  Very slow.  One sat and chatted up with her home girl for like latterly 30 minutes while people were in line.  Im not over exaggerating at all either, I had to leave to the Walgreens down the street to by tape (because the USPA charges for clear tape) and when I came back, she was still talking to her friend.
