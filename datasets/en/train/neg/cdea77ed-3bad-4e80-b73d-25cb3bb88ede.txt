First of all, this address is located at Gilbert & Germann on the north/east corner (the map attached show is north of the 202; it isn't!)

I work locally with teens who go in there all of the time and come back to my crying that they are treated poorly or meanly by the employees. I've worked with a lot of booksellers myself over the years, and so I went in there myself. I was with my young child and treated terribly. I was accused of being a liar and cheat by a bookseller who demanded my ID card while trying to buy something with CASH. It was terrible. 

I later called the manager who was just as mean and noncaring as her employees. Forget this place. I now send all my business to the Chandler Mall Barnes and Nobles!!
