Decided to give this place a try since I found a gift certificate on Restaurant.com.   Had the ribs, pulled pork and chicken.  Rest of the party had about the same.   Ribs were really dry and didn't pull off the bone, but just flaked off instead.   Chicken was tender, but flavorless.  Pulled pork, well, they served us brisket.   Service was good, but luckily we were one of 3 tables on a Friday night so she didn't have much to worry about it.  Not really for sure how they think they can stay in business with zero repeat customers, at least thats what it looks like from the Yelp reviews.   Probably would have thought otherwise if I would have read reviews prior.
