I went here while on vacation visiting my friend. Neither of us had been there before, but I know they have lots of locations on the west coast, so we gave it a try. 

The staff was totally rude. Before we went, we called to check the hours. The guy on the phone was patronizing and acted inconvenienced to have to give any information. 

The pizza was blah - totally generic and nothing special. If you're going to have mediocre food, you better have exceptional service. Double fail.
