This is for the Event Planning services department only: TERRIBLE.  My fiance and I were due to get married here in October of this year and we had to cancel in March because LeAnn wouldn't return emails or phone calls.  So we had to start back at square 1 in March - it was very hard to find another location to have our ceremony and reception, so we had to split the locations.  Now i have to deal with finding rentals for chairs and tables, worry about space for musicians and my photobooth, and parking - thanks Palm Valley Event Planning!
