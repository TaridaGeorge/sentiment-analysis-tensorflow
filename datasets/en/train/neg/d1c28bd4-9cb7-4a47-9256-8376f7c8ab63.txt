This is terrible sushi. If you're a huge fan, I'm guessing you also frequent Applebee's, Papa John's, and other crappy chain restaurants that don't focus on food. This, like many other places of the same caliber, are good for one thing however -- cheap happy hour. Enjoy. 

For something edible? An authentic environment? See 'Hiro Sushi in N. Scottsdale'. You're welcome!!
