I love Pita Pit. I used to eat at the one in Syracuse all the time. Unfortunately, this location has some serious issues. I called to order a pita for lunch today for delivery. I was put on hold for a couple minutes and then apparently the phone was picked up but no one was there to help me. So in the end, I wasted five minutes of my life listening to their employees take other people's orders and completely ignore that I was on the phone. I would have possibly gone in here or ordered from here again, but now that will not be the case. The management should teach their employees phone etiquette.
