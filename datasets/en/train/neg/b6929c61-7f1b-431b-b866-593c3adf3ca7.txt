This is a hangout for "bros" "dudes" and "guidos" that miss their football coach from high school. The food is decent (even though they gave me the wrong sandwich) but it is so disorganized with the owner trying to make guys that look like arnold schwarzenegger feel okay because they can't pass English 101 for the 3rd time. Overall the whole process sucked (I'm not kidding, verbatim he was complaining about taking english 101 for the fourth time).
