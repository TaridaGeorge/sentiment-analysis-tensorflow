I wish I could have tried Sweet Republic as it looked phenomenal when I stopped in. Unfortunately after two groups came in after me but were helped before me, I decided to leave. I had already been there for 15 minutes and did not want to wait any longer when the staff clearly wasn't paying close enough attention to their customers.
