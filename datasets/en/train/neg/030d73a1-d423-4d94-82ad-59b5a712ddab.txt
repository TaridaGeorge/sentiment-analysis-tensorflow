So I got off work at around 9...Pissed off cuz I didn't bring a lunch or eat anything all day and got off late...I decided to hit up Panda Express right by place since I wanted something "cheap" and quick.

I'll never eat here again...I had the bowl of noodles and broccoli beef served on top.
I had about 4 slices of beef and my noodles were skimmed...ALL veggies! WTF! I paid around $5 for the worst meal of my life and it left me hungry still.

Never going here again...if I want fast Chinese food I'll go to Yum Yum China at Tempe Marketplace or go to an actual authentic Chinese place.

I hate you Panda Express
