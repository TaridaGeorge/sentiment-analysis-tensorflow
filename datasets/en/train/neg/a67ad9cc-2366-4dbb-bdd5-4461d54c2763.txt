Why do I keep returning to UNO restaurants??

Oh yeah, because I am a borderline alcoholic and I like their happy hour specials, but that is where it ENDS.

I always thought the one by my house was just poorly managed and probably not indicative  of the rest of the chain... WRONG.

This place has the NASTIEST restrooms, consistently, and smells like shit throughout the restaurant. Never again.
