I have to agree with Ray.  I use to go at least once a week and regularly enough that when I walked in, they prepared my pho before sitting down.  The last time I went (last week) the staff was different and the pho tasted different.  It was a bit greasy (you could see the oil floating on the broth).  It was flavorless and I added the hot sauce but it didn't do much.  Hope they bring the old kitchen staff back because it was the best pho in phoenix.
