I agree with A.B:

Overly pretentious clientele
Food does not deserve the high prices
Snotty staff

I think the only redeeming factor for this place is the patio.

If you want French-inspired Bistro food head over to Coup des Tartes.
If you want REAL French food, go to Vincent's.
If you want to be insulted, overpay for your food, and regret your evening, go to Zinc.
