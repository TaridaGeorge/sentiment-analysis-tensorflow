This review is based solely on service - we came here at 730pm on a Saturday night and it was empty. So why did the hostess ignore us when we walked in? Shouldn't they have been estatic that they had customers? And why did our waitress act like we were inconveniencing her with our order? We couldn't get any service so we tried to flag down a staff member and she just shrugged and said, "I'm not waiting on you guys". Then we ordered a few rounds of sake bombs and the waitress wouldn't give us clean glasses for each round. What is the deal with this place?
