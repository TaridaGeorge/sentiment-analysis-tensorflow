Took my Fiancé here as she loves sushi -- I don't enjoy it, but you have to bend sometimes. I didn't eat the sushi, but let's just say she left a third of the plate there. I ordered chicken and shrimp w/ white rice and vegetables. I didn't know five ounces of oil came with my food -- I ended up using the rice to soak the oil from the food. My Fiancé and I are having real stomach discomfort and haven't felt well since about two hours after we ate... I think it was the oil for me, but her issues are worse then mine and it's been a rough evening for her. Beware-- if you eat oil by the spoonful you'll be good... just hope my Fiancé feels better.
