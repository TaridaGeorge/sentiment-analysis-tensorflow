This place looked so nice on the out side and it was so elegant , but the food really was horrible . They should spend more money on chefs and service and less on the  looks of the place. Service was awful and the food wasent good. The waiter chanced us out to ask for a bigger tip . Talk  about akward. Would never go back.
