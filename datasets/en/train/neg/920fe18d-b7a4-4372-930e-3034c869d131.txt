I haven't been here for awhile since I moved to central Phoenix and either my taste buds got more discriminating or I got used to the pho restaurants in 
Phoenix. I ordered pho tai: the soup tasted salty, lacked depth I.e. sweetness, cloves, something..and the beef in the soup was tough, overcooked, and bland! I also got the barbecue spring rolls but it was small, thin, and also tasted salty without the sweet kick.  I also got Vietnamese coffee but it came "ready-mixed" in a plastic cup with ice and not in the "fun to mix little coffee canister" that most Vietnamese restaurants give you. I give only one star for the food and I'll stick to Da Vang restaurant on 19th Ave.
