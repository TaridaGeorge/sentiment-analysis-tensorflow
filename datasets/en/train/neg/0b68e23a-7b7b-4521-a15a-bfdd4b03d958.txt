My wife and I have been looking at this place for a long time and finally decided to give it a try tonight.  She ordered the fillet w lobster tail, garlic mashed potatoes and green beans.  I choose the 16oz porter house with baked potato and dinner salad.  Both steaks were very tough.  For the "prime" cuts of beef that they were said to be, these didn't come close to what you'd expect for a top quality steak house.  The dinner salad was close to frozen, the bread was very dry, the lobster tail was good, but nothing special.  The service was average.  All in all, we were sorely disappointed and I'm sure we won't return.
