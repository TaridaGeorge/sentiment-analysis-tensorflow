I wish I would have read the reviews prior to taking my party of five, especially since this was highly suggested from a friend that used to live in Phoenix.  

Similarly to the other reviews, service was unspeakable slow, tall-giant woman was extremely rude (of course she finished her meal at the bar prior to taking ours), literally got our meals one at a time over a 30 minute span, mac and cheese for three of the four meals came well after all the meals arrived, etc., etc., etc.  

If I didn't feel really bad for the owner just losing his daughter to a long battled illness, I would speak to their unacceptable standards even more.  Don't waste your time; their heart is not into making sure your experience is a pleasurable one.  I don't care how good the food is.
