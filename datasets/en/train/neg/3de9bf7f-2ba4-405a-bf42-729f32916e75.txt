I have eaten at Ticoz over 20 times since it opened. Over the last year each visit was more disappointing than the one before. I have decided not to go there again after the last disaster. The elimination of the free  chips and salsa, the less then professional service and the rude manager (Joe?) and the changes in my favorite dish (it now tastes bad!) make it a restaurant I do not wish to return to. I loved Ticoz; I took my parents and out-of-town friends there, went on dates there and recommended it. I know it changed hands recently, but it began to decline awhile before that.
