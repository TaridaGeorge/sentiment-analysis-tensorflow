My wife and I went our of our way to go to Burger Factory to get a pastrami sandwich.  When we tried to eat them, they were so tough, full of sinew/gristle that we could not chew them.  I took them back to the manager, challenging him with one of the pieces of pastrami to try to chew through it, or possibly make a belt out of it.  It was that tough!  We will not be going back.
