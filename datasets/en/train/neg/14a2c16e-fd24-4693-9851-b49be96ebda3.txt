Very underwhelmed. So I met a friend here for dinner the other night and I have to admit I went somewhere else after we left to get something to eat. I ordered the garlic and soy edamame which was ok, the salmon sashimi which was not so good, and a cucumber roll which was the best thing I ate there (pretty sad to say). The place is definitely a bar and not a real sushi restaurant.... nice atmosphere though. The waiter was a little over the top and we waited for 40 minutes for the check after asking twice. I think I will have to be pretty drunk before going here again LOL...
