First off don't buy the $40 for $50 deal. I did, they would not honnor the yelp voucher but told me they would still give me $10 off... So I spent  $40 on a voucher I can't use. They told me to call yelp and cancel the voucher.... That's not easy... So as we speak I'm out the $40 for the voucher and $73 for services. Also I got the base manni peddi package, they kept trying to tell me I wanted the more expensive manni & peddi. I didn't want that. So she asked me how I would like the nails on my hands, I said buffed, no polish. Guess what, that's an additional $3. Really?? That's the first time that's ever happened... Anyway, I'm not happy with my experience and now I need to contact yelp to get my $40 back from the voucher....
