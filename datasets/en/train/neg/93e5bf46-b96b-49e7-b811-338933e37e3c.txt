The staff was nice but they gave me a procedure (Vitamin D testing) which they did not tell me was not apart of the appointment, or warn me that insurance does not cover this procedure.  I was nailed with an unexpected $300 bill for this.  Secondly, I found out later that this test shouldn't be given to healthy women in their 20s because it is not necessary. So, then why did they give it to me in the first place? Lastly, it took me almost two weeks of numerous phone calls before I was able to discuss this billing issue with the office manager, which they were unable to help me out in anyway with this unnecessary bill.  I will not be returning to this practice again.
