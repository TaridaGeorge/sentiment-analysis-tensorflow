This place was a huge disappointment. After hearing how it had been recognized on the Food Network, I went there with a friend on a Sunday evening and found the food to be mediocre and overpriced. The waiter also tried desperately to get us to purchase wine and sides. I finally relented to an order of garlic bread, and was served plain, stale bread. For this stale bread, we got charged $3. I will not be going back. If you want Italian, Red Devil is a better deal with a nicer atmosphere and better wait staff.. Oh yeah, the bread is good and complimentary.
