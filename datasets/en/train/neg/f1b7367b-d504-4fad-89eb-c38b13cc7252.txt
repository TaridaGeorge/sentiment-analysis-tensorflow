First let me say that anyone giving this place more than 1 or 2 stars are either family members or friend  of the owners. I lived in Illinois and have been to Indiana numerous times and never have I had this bad of food. I went here for breakfast and order basic eggs, sausage, biscuits and gravy, hash browns. The biscuits were tiny, gravy is terrible, sausage and eggs were like I could have cooked at home. This place is comparable to places like denys and waffle house. If you like those places go to there and not here.
