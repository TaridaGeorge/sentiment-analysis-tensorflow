It's always surprising to find yourself on the wrong side of the zeitgeist.  Such is my experience with Mary Coyle.  I've gone to MC several times over the last couple of months and only one time could I bring myself to actually sit down.  The place is filthy.  On top of that unpleasantry the bus staff is likely to be found smoking in the back parking lot while un-bussed tables piled with half eaten sundays and used napkins run amok.  The last two times I visited there was a strong and very obvious sewer issue.  How people can eat here is beyond me.  Maybe I was just unlucky and my three experiences were not the norm.  I certainly hope so but I can't bring myself to give them a fourth chance.
