This was a horrible experience.  I walked in knowing exaxtly what I wanted, and it was an item behind the counter.  I had to wait, and and inconvience an employee to help me.  When I went to pay for it, there was 5 employees up front (with 1 register going) and a few customers waiting in line.  The employess were complaining that some of their shifts were over, and were also complaining that they don't get paid enough to work past their shifts.  So again I was inconveniencing them by try to purchase something from their store.  If I owned this place and heard or saw the staff acting like this, I would fire all of them and start over with staff who would appreciate the job
