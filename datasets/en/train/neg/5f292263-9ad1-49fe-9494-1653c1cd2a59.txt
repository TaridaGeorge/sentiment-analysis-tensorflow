We flew with Southwest, which was running 2 hours late due to weather on the east coast, hardly Sky Harbor's fault.  So, we didn't get there until 8:30PM on a Sunday.  All I needed to make me happy was a frozen yogurt and an open book store.  I had finished Game of Thrones the night before, and was hoping to find the sequel, or even just a magazaine to keep me occupied.  I struck out in both regards.  And then, they managed to lose our luggage.  So, in all, Sky Harbor, you disappoint me!
