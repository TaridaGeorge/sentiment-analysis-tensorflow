Called in to place delivery order , person who answered must be new because she had absolutely no clue about the menu or prices, provided incorrect info about the price of toppings..  

I ordered a "CHICAGO DEEP" , waited about an hour and and was delivered a thin crust pizza,  driver said keep the pizza, took one bite and the crust was UNDER COOKED..  I called them and they sent me the deep dish I ordered and that too was very undercooked. Not enjoyable at all..


Can't give them even one star because the service and food sucked. Only plus would have been of that free thin crust I got was edible.  Ive ordered here before, don't know what happened to this place.. I'll go to le grande orange next time.
