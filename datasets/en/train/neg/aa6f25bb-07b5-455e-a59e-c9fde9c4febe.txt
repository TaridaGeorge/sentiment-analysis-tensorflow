I really want to rate this place higher. The 1st thing you notice when you walk in here is how gorgeous this brewery is. The avocado colored paint job works well with the dark wood of the tables and bar top.The glass panels reveal shiny brew tanks which always add to the decor of a brewpub. 
I ordered the Quesadillas with steak, onions and mushrooms, tasty with extra hots sauce. Very tasty!
I paired it with the their seasonal ale which was supposed to have toffee notes, but it was bland! What a buzz kill! The service was good though.
I sampled the IPA as well which was unbalanced.
Had the beer been good this place would have gotten 4 stars. But, what do you go to a brewpub for? The beer 1st and foremost! That is why I cannot rate this place as highly as I would like.
