Wow?!  Is this the new Barcelona?!  Yuck!  Old scuzy men and middle aged women with fake boobs that are falling out of their painted on dresses.  All bars were completely under staffed on a Friday night.  We waited 7 minutes at the front bar until being ignored continuously and we became so frustrated that we made our way to the round bar and it seemed just as understaffed.  What's the point of only having a few bartenders on probably the busiest night of the week for bar-goers?  We even approached the blond manager to ask for service and she was completely rude and had a total lack of desire to help us.  We will NOT return due to the lack of service and efficiency.  This place has GOT to staff more bartenders and needs much more help.  Welcome to North Scottsdale Barcelona.
