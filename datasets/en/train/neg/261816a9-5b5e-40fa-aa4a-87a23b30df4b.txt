Despite delicious food and an impressive wine list, it hurts my heart to say that this place isn't worth the trouble. The staff is pretentious and unaccommodating. I have been here a handful of times and every server I have had has an excuse of why they cannot meet my requests. I understand a policy of not splitting checks, but then please let us know that when you are taking our order. One of the servers also told me that they cannot seat parties of five without a reservation. I understand having to wait for a table, but the place was just opening and nearly empty at the time. The menu also gives very vague descriptions making it nearly impossible for anyone with specific food allergies. I love my wine, but I am pretty comfortable with the fact that I will never go to this place again.
