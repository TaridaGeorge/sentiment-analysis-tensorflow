The stereo i wanted wasnt in stock. They ordered my stereo and then they called and said  it came in but someone sold it, then it was ordered again and lost. I called and left a message twice for a guy I spoke to and was never called back.  They made it very hard for me to spend my money. I finally gave up and went elsewhere. For the amount of money I was going to spend, they treated me like crap.
