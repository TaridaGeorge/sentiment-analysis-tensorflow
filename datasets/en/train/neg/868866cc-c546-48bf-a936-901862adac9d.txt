Wow.  This could possibly be the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant.  First, they seated us in a back room that had a completely different ambience from the main dining room... this was like a bad addition with high-watt fluourescent spotlights and rickety tables crammed into the corners surrounding a party of ~20.  The worst part, however, was the insanely loud party of Scottsdale douchebags that were having some sort of party in the room.  The staff acted like they didn't even notice and made no attempt to quiet them... I'm talking slamming on tables, screaming across the room at one another, and just general douchebaggery.  The food was mediocre... the appetizers were cold and my pork chop was certainly nothing special.  

Do yourself a favor and spend your money somewhere else.
