Great museum, IF IT'S OPEN! Pretty disappointing to drive here to find the place closed on a Saturday afternoon. Web site, near as I can tell, makes no clear mention that they would be closed or why. Only when you click the tiny and seemingly innocuous "Gala 2011" link does the story unfold. Disappointed kids, frustrated parents.
