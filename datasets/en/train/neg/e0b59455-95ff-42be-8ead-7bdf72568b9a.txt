It's bad enough when you get poor service, but when the manager lies about sending the waitress home? That's just tacky. Two coworkers and I had dinner this evening at this location and will not be returning. 

Drinks (water and a beer) took a good ten minutes to arrive after our waitress took the order. Food was likewise slow- partly because she made a second trip to the table to re-write the orders again. When food did arrive, one buddy didn't get his steak. At all. It was comp'd but still...

At the end, our waitress came by and asked about to go boxes, water, etc. She ignored the checks and cards on the edge of the table and left. I had to take the bills up front so we could pay and leave. .
