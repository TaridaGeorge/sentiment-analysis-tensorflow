Conversing with the manager has reiterated my initial impression - which I'll keep to myself.  After informing me that he, unlike Corporate, would not have refunded me a dime (re:  one month "courtesy" refund), he had the audacity to suggest I join a 24 Hour Fitness near my new place of residence.

Sorry but 24 Hour Fitness is not even a contender on the short list, or any list, for that matter.
