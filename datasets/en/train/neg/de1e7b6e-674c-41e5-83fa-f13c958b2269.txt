Worst food experience I've had in long time...this is my first 1 star rating.  Every dish we order was wrong or terrible.  Almost half of the steak was fat and non edible.  Just trying to hard....Over priced period!!!!  Stay away from this place.  Better off going to place like Sakana or Yasu and pay fraction of the price for great food.
