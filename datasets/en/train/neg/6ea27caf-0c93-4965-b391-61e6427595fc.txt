Let me start by saying that the food here is fine...nothing wrong with it at all, other than it being not particularly notable. Why one star? Well, I've been here three times and every single time the service has been terrible. One visit I actually had to get up from my table and find a server (we'd been seated for about 15-20 minutes and no one had said boo). The other two times we sat in the bar and it was about ten minutes before anyone appeared. In my mind, at this price point, this is simply inexcusable. The bad service was so extreme that it dominates my complete memory and impressions of the restaurant and bar.  It's probably a fine place to go if you are traveling, staying in the hotel and don't know any better, but otherwise, central Phoenix has much better offerings!
