First of all, there is this one employee there that I can't believe they haven't fired her yet. You have to ask her for a box even though you just purchased 5 or 6 bottles of liquor totalling $200 or more. Ya think??? What an attitude this girl has.

Next, we stopped here yesterday to pick of a bottle of the 1.75 liter Milagro Silver Tequila and to our surprise it was $63 and some odd cents. I thought at first that maybe I was just comparing to Costco's price of $39. But then we went to Total Wine and More at Desert Ridge and found it for $38!!! Geesh! Don't you think that's a bit of a mark-up?

So we won't be going back anytime soon. I'd rather not get ripped off thank you.
