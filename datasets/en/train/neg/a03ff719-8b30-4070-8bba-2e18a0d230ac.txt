We regret to say we found the Ristorante Tuscany overpriced and underwhelming.  We went for the Easter buffet.  The staff "wrong-footed" from the start.  As we were seated we noticed the chairs had not been cleaned.  Crumbs and food debris were still on the seats.  Next "wrong-foot" - the hostess advised us to order the entree before going to the antipasti and  salad buffets.  The waiter arrive and told us to do the opposite.  The food was adequate and mildly disappointing.  An order of lamb arrived that was a disaster of fat and gristle - inedible.  At the price we paid that was unforgivable.  The much touted dessert buffet had only one high note - the almond brittle on the creme brulee.   We are now sorry we cancelled a previous reservation at another restaurant to go to the Ristorante Tuscany.
