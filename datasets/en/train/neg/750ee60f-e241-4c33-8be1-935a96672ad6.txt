Just left the Arena Sorts Grill. I give it one star as the service was excellent. Very attentive ladies behind the bar. However, that it where it stops. The food was absolutely awful. The place smelled of bleach from wipng down the bar area and tables,there has to be something different that can be used. The bathrooms are far from what you expect in a North Scottsdale place of business. Like I said, the bartenders did a great job but that is where it stopped. Never again would we go to this place.
