So, I had a $10 "Welcome to the Neighborhood" gift card that I received, granted 7 years ago, but never used.  I kept it because it had no expiration date.  I decided to go there today for the 1st time to watch some football, drink some beers and nosh.  When my tab came, I gave the waitress my gift card.  The owner came to my table and said verbatim, "Come on folks, we sent this out 4/5 years ago.  We don't accept these anymore" and tore up my gift card/coupon in front of me and my friends.  Last time I ever go back there.
