It drives me crazy how many of my friends are tricked into going to this dump. I hate this bar. If I wanted to pay scottsdale prices for drinks....I would go to scottsdale. I know its crazy. Oh? I have to pay cover to get into a bar in tempe, ha what a joke. People, please stop being duped into going here. The only people who should be going to this pit are kids for their power hour or people taking their parents out to drink when they are in town cuz your mom would like it.
