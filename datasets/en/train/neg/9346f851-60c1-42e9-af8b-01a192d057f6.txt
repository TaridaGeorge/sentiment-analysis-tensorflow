What a disappointment. The service was super slow, and they were out of all of their ribs (pork and beef) and coleslaw. It was a Thursday night at 7pm! I also thought the food was way over priced. 7.99 for a BLT sandwich ? I ended up getting a house salad because they were out of what I wanted. Of the two cherry tomatoes I got, one was shriveled and gross. The three other people in my party got brisket and all said was very fatty and gross. One a positive....the beer was ice cold and the strawberry margaritas were good. Can't say I'll be back.
