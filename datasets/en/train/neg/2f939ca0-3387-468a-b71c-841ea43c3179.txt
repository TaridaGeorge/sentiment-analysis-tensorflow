Had to write this review.
I had been to Pho Avina quite few times and thought it was good not great in comparison to a few other places in the area.  
The convenience in location brought us back, even though it seemed like their portions were getting smaller and smaller.

Today we ordered a takeout and I found a a cut fingernail in my noodle soup.  I can't tell if its a finger or a toenail, but it still makes me sick thinking that I ate some of it.

Its too bad because the mom here seems like such a nice sweet person, but somewhere along the line, whether its the cook or someone by the takeout boxes, someone is cutting their nails where they shouldn't.

I obviously will no longer go there and suggest no one go there either.
