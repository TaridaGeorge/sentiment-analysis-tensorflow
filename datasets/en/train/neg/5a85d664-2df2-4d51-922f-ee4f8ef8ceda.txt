This used to be my favorite restaurant for special occasions.  Such a dissapointment when we went there in July for our anniversary.  Service was just teriible.  So understaffed.  My fish was overcooked and no apology made when I had it sent back.  I used to just love this restaurant - all the history and fine service  Not anymore.  The matredee stood at his desk gossiping with 2 friends while we waited and waited to be acknowledged.  Sad......this used to be one of the best.
