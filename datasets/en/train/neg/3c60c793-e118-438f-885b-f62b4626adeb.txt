I had the shrimp scallops and calimari. It was pretty bland. We had the only japanese cook and he was the only one who couldn't spin knives. Throw things in the air etc. Was dissapointed. The waiter couldn't speak English and charged me fir a vodka on ice that we didn't order. Trying to get them to take it off the bill was more frustrating and stressful than paying the 7.50 for it. Next time I think I'll try an authentic Japanese place if I have the urge for Japanese cuisine.
