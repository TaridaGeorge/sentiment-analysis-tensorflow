Highly recommended by some folks while visiting Scottsdale. Hubby and I arrived at 12:55pm. The waitress 'Rachel' brought menus and a carafe of water to the table. She never returned. Her main interest was setting up empty tables. Putting out napkins and silverware, she never made eye contact, never told us she'd be with us in a moment, nothing. There were 3 other tables with a couple people at each. We finally left at 1:20...went to eat elsewhere. I will not go here again.
