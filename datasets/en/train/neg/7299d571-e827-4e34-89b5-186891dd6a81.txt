$79 dollars down the drain and not even worth the drive. The on staff nurse practitioner couldn't help me with my symptoms. I got my blood pressure checked, was told that I didn't have strep throat and to go see a real doctor if my conditions did not improve within a week. She even printed me out a paper with the local family clinics in the area. Talk about buyer's remorse. Not helpful at all. Waste of money. Not recommended.
