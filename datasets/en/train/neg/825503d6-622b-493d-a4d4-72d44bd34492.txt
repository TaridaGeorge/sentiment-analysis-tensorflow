I really didn't expect much from this place, since Fountain Hills has an unfortunate shortage of good eats. (not saying that there aren't good places, just that they are few in number)  Anyways, I had a feta and walnut salad with a vinagerette.  It looked nice, but the taste was something else entirely.  They used iceburg lettuce that it tasted like it was out of a Fresh Express Bag.  There was also so much feta that it would have been overpowering had it not been for the sickeningly sweet vinagerette.  The place does have a view of the fountain if you are there for the tourist thing, but I would recommend going across the street to Euro Pizza.  Euro Pizza sits right on the edge of Fountain Park and has pretty decent eats.
