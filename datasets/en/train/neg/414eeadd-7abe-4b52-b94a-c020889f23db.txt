You walk into a Chinese restaurant on a Saturday afternoon for dim sum and you expect the place to be PACKED.  Well, walking in to a pretty much empty dining room, it's a VERY CLEAR SIGN.  But my friend insisted and I was very hesitant for good reasons.  Another indicator, the majority of the patrons were NON Asian.  

Food: You walk in and you see carts of the food by the entrance to the dining room.  Umm, I thought dim sum should come right off the steamer and into the carts and they roll it around, not sitting around.  The dim sum was garbage.  It had the typical selection, but at minimum.  

Service: It's ok.  But it doesn't make up for the horrible food.

Bottom line: NO WAY!  Stay away!
