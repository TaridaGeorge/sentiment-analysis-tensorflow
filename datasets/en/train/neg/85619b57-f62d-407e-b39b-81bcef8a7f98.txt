It's like a motel 6, but with very trendy decor
And of course the Sheep.

The hotel rooms are terribly old, the grounds are terrible old, all if very reminiscent of a Motel 6.

The clubs are crowded but fun.

Odds are you will see a celebrity or two, I sure did.

Don't think I'll be back anytime soon though...
