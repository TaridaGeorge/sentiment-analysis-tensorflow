I recently visited the US Airways Club in the Lower Number A Concourse.  I was travelling with my wife and my little dog who I had paid $100 to travel on the airline but was turned away from the Club which I had also paid for last year as a Dividend Miles member.   I find it distasteful that my liittle dog in an appropriate travel bag is excluded when loud, unsanitary children are allowed in the Club.  If they make me pay for a cabin pet, I would think those same pets should be allowed in the airport facilities. US  Airways makes it more and more difficult to fly every day
