Poor welcome.
Poor service.
The phad thai came without tofu!!
The lasy at the entrance didnot even have a smile.
The waitress seemed in immense hurry and even forced me to talk when I have foof in my mouth!Aas if we are here to impress them!!!
Quantity is way too less for 12 dollars!!No soup free no salad free nothing!!!
The people in the neighbouring table were beavhing like wild animals and talking loudly but nothing was doen to stop them
I promptly rewarded them wth ZERO tip!!
