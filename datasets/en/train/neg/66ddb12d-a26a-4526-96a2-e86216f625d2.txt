First time back to Serrano's in several years.  Not a good experience...food took about 40 minutes...one person in our group could not eat it because of too much spice.  Server told us that the slow service was because they only have a small grill in the kitchen and one of our group (me) ordered a plate with a chicken breast which takes extra time.  Finally, the "credit card system" was down.  Overall, food was just okay...Nando's is a much better choice in my opinion.  I think it may be a couple more years before we return to Serrano's if at all.
