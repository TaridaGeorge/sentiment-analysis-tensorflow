Ok, clearly the writers of previous reviews are desperately hungry for entertainment.  I just went through this "zoo" yesterday, and I found it nothing more than a bunch of displays with 1 or less animals in them.  The animals always huddled towards the back of the areas making them completely unviewable.  I guess it was a zoo of Rocks n Sticks.
Furthermore, the prices for food (this isn't a suprise) is not just a ripoff, it's nothing short of thievery!  No one item of food was worth what they wanted.
Plain and simple - go find somewhere else to entertain yourself...
