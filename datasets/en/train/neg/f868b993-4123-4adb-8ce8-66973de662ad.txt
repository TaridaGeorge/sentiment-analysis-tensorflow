Oh my God. Whoever the people are that are giving this place good reviews must be used to eating poop covered dog food. Worst tacos I've ever had, salad bar seemed like it was set out sometime in the 1970's, pretty sure the mashed potatoes were soaked in urine instead of butter and the marinara sauce was cooked in a boot instead of a pot. Couldn't wait to get out of there and go brush my teeth. GOOD BYE, RUBY TUESDAY!
