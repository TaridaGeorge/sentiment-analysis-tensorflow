This was my first experience at a local farmers market and I was disappointed to find out very little of it was from AZ.  Isn't that the purpose of a farmer's market?  If you aren't a farmer why are you there selling goods from Asia and South America?  There were 2 booth that specifically advertised locally grown.  I bought some decent items from them.  One of them was selling a bunch of eggs but the cartons were from Hickman's (enormous commercial egg producer) which isn't what I envision at a small market.  Maybe they just bought the cartons from them, who knows.  

There was a person selling salsa (locally made) but it was more expensive than Whole Foods where it is also sold.  I have only been once and plan on trying other markets before going back.
