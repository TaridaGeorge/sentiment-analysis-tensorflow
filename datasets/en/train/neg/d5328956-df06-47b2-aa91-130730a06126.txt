Visiting from out of town and went to the breakfast club. Worst breakfast experience ever. Your experience in a restaurant starts from the time you are greeted and usually sets the tone of everything to follow. We sat at the counter and the black girl working it looked at us like  she wanted to know what the hell we were doing there and what do we want. If she attempted even the slightest smile it woulda cracked that pretty smooth face for sure. Why do they hire people to work with the public that have absolutely NO PEOPLE SKILLS. Ok, on to the SECOND impression. The coffee. Its horrible. Luke warm light brown dirty water. They should be ashamed they're selling it. LASTLY, the food. It was ok but served to the table almost immediately after it was ordered, cold. 3 strikes Breakfast Club, yeeeeeeer OUT!!!
