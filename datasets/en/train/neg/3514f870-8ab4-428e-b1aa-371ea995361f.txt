Horrible.  The tools were shared between customers, she squirted oil on my toe nails, and immediately placed them in the water, didnt even rub the oil in, at all.  She got up three times in the middle of my leg massage to answer her cell phone or help other clients, the actual massage probably only lasted 30 seconds because she kept getting up. and to top it off, the paint on my nails arent even even!  I am going to redo them.  I got robbed.
