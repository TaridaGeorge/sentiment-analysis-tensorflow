I checked out the web site - made plans with my wife for a date night - for her birthday.  Show up at tuck shop at 8pm on a Saturday night - and we are greeted with a sign that the place is reserved for the night!  Checked the web site and no message nothing - so off we went to find another place to eat.

Would it kill then to post something on their web site...
