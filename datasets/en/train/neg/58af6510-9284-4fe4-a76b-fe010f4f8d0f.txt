The Alternative Copy Shop is just that, an alternative. Should be the last alternative on anyone's list. They take forever to deliver and when they do, its all wrong. They messed up my thesis paper and then were completely rude about it. They did not offer to fix it or help at all, no sense of urgency. I will not take anything there ever again.
