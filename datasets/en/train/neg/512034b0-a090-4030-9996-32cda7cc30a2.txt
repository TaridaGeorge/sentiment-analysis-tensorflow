This place is a cattle call.  I had an appt for 9am and did not leave the place until 11am.  Was not called back until 1030. Then they messed up my mammogram and want me to come back, pay them again, and have it repeated.  Could be because they rushed through it?  Even I could tell the position did not seem right and I was hardly in the machine at all but the tech said it was fine.  My doctors office even commented when that it looked like the mammogram was just poor quality.  That is Simonmeds mistake, not mine, yet I have to take off another half day from work, pay again, and go through this how many times???
