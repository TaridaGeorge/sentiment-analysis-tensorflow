Why bother? My only question I have for the owners of this place. 
  Out of pale ale, out of IPA, doesn't offer growlers to take out their beer, employees could care less if you were in there (and we were the only ones in there). Cute Marketing approach with all the Dog names, Dog bone shaped platters to hold the tester beers and TV with rotating dog photos....but you forgot to MAKE the BEER for people to buy and drink!!
Who runs out of Pale Ale and IPA?  
Sorry but I think we will soon be calling this place Dead Dog Brewery.
