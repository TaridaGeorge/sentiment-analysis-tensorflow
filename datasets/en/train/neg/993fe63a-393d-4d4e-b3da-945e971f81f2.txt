I learned my lesson not to use Budget.  I made a reservation with Amex services to later get a bait and switch upsell with an inaccurate quote.  Only rent from budget if you like getting a pressure upsell job at the counter.

Further, they later $25 charge for the administrative services to provide my contact information to the AZ robo camera nazis.  I suspect all the rental people charge for this.  However, they certainly didn't have to charge me.

Last, arrive at the airport early.  They only had one guy checking in dozens of cars in five lanes.  CHEAP...
