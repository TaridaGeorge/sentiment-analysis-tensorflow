Save your time and money and go to Dry Bar at the Scottsdale Quarter across from Kierland or Kimberly's dry bar on Lincoln Drive in Phoenix.  You will be glad you did.  This place has poor customer service and the receptionists are snotty and unprofessional.

The facialist, Linda, is extremely unprofessional, rude and condescending.  She does not give a good facial.

Enough said.
