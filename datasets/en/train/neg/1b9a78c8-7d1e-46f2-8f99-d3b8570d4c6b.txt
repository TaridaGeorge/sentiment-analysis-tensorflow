This place is HORRIBLE!! Ive gone in here a few times and every experience is worse than the last. The food is mediocre and always cooked incorrectly. But what always gets me is how absolutely RUDE the waitresses are. I don't know where they find them but they are the worst surly human beings i have ever had to interact with at a restaurant. I could not help but give this place a 1 star because of how horrible I was treated and talked to in there. I will NEVER go back for the rest of my life.
