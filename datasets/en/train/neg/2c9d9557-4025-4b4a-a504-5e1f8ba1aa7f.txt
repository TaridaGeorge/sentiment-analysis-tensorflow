Very unhappy with my alterations here. Almost everytime I've had pants shortened one leg was shorter/longer than the other. My dresses have had one side hanging on the floor and the other side perfect. I've had to go back and have things fixed many times. The last time, 3 different pairs of pants were completely uneven and Jose said he would fix them for me. I picked them up, tried them on at home and absolutely nothing was fixed. Either he didn't want to be bothered again or thought maybe he had done it. He seems like a sweet man but he can't sew a straight line. I've been going to Nadya at Frank Llyod Wright and Thompson Peak and she is AMAZING!! She fixed everything for me and it's all perfect!
