This place on two separate visits, months apart, had forgotten my order and somehow lost it after waiting over 20 to 25 minutes each time. Employees rather text on their phones and lean against counters rather than serve their customers.

Culver's has awesome frozen custard with creative flavors of the day. This location also is very clean and well maintained especially the bathrooms which are a plus. You just have to make sure to check in with the front every 5 minutes if you don't want them to forget your order.
