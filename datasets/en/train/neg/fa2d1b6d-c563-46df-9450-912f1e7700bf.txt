This place is a cute, kitschy place to have lunch with an extensive menu, but sucks when it comes to nightlife.

If you want to be surrounded by fake boobs and Affliction t-shirts, then come here.  If you want to pay $10 for a margarita with Jose Cuervo as their premium tequila, then come here.  This place is beyond lame and so are the people who go here.  Not even the mechanical bull saves this place because it's a bunch of creepy guys watching really drunk girls ride the bull.

Highlight of the 3 times I've been there: Tranny-looking girl on her cell phone, "Why would you tell me I look like a transvestite?"  Umm, because you do..?
