When I first heard of this restaurant I was soooo excited especially due to the fact that that the owners father is a owner of a nello's pizza. So I thought this would be the younger modern fusion of pizza. I loved the location and decor of this restaurant it was very inviting and I loved the fact that they carried LUX coffee since that is some good coffee. The pizza is another story I really didn't feel they matched flavors well duck with citrus and and too many herb mixings on all the pizzas we got. we also found hair in one of the pizza's which I got really grossed out after that and I didn't want to continue eating anymore. Overall great decor/ambiance, music and coffee is great but I will not be back after the whole pizza incident.
