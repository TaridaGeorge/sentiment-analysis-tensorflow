Bad service.  Got an iced green tea.  The barrista didn't ask me for unsweetened or sweetened which every other starbucks has asked.  When it came out, it was sweetened.  I politely asked for them to remake it unsweetened.  Some girl then told me that I had to say it when I ordered, then rudely banged around some things by the sink and acted as if she was doing me a favor.  No smile.  Slammed the drink on the counter and walked away.  I think the unsweetened thing was a simple mistake (not sure by who), yet the girl behind the counter seemed offended or put out by my request.  They should try to be a little nicer, not jerks.  Won't be coming back to this location.
