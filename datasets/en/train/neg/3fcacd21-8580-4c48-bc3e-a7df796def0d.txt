The food, drinks and service at the bar during happy hour on Friday, April 13th were HORRIBLE.  The supposed "corporate trainer bartender" made the WORST drinks, jam-paced with ice-you only got about 2 drinks out of the glass before it was empty.  The bar was filthy dirty and she did not clean up after customers and we waited a long time only to get cold food.  The place was not busy as it was only 4pm - absolutely no excuse.  If she is a "corp trainer" then they are in trouble !!!
