So disappointed. I'm new to the area and very excited to see a salon close to my house. On my first visit I was passed from one technician to another and then overcharged but the work was good, the technicians were at least friendly.   I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I went back yesterday and the young lady at the front apparently was upset that I didn't want a pedicure "just a fill" so she informed me what I would be having done instead of asking me, was so rushed that I felt like my fingers were on fire from the drill. I finally had to stop her because she was being so rough. When it became apparent that she had no intention of doing a proper job I left.  Definitely will not go back, nor would I recommend.
