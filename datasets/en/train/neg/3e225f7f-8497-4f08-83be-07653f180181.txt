Well I have been to this place several times in the past.  The past is where my visits will stay.   Visited one last time, got sick and the portion size has gone from too much food to a 3 forkful amount of sides.  Too bad for Changing Hands Book Store- hope their business keeps up in spite of the bad food being served next door.
