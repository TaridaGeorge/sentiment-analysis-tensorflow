More like Bad China, I say. 

Got take-out. Kung Pau chicken, curry shrimp, beef brocolli 2 egg rolls. 

Kung Pau was 90% celery and the chicken that was there was very very poor; tough, just crappy cuts...awful bland taste too. The beef brocolli was also bland, and the beef was poor quality...very tough. The curry shrimp was "ok". The eggrolls sucked!! 

I paid over $30 and will definitely not be back.
