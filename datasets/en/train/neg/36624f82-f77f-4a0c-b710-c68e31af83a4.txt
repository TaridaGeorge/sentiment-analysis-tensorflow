All I have to say is......W.....T......F?

Scene: 6 people in their early to mid 20's walks into Barcelona. Half of them from New York, the other half from San Francisco (or San Fran as the folks in Scottsdale likes to say). Their mouths have dropped and they sit in udder amazement. A band from 1994 gets up on stage and tries to get the crowd of 40 year olds going.  With every song played, the folks from separate coasts, just stand there in complete shock....and then THEY DRANK because THEY HAD TO!

This place is oh so bad! OH SO BAD!!! Go if you need a good laugh.
