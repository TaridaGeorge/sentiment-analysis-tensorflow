This is really NOT outlet shopping.  Many of the stores have closed and are gone.  The remaining ones do not have any outlet pricing.  Mgmt has built a new wing of high end shopping - BCBG, J.Crew, etc. but they are definately not outlet.  They are high price.  SO it is a mis-conception with the term "OUTLET".  I believe what they are doing is to change to a high end shopping area and phase out the outlet concept.  Waste of time. Especially Dress Barn and Karen Kane.  Awful stores-lousy people there. Don't go.
