Ummm...  This is NOT a 4 Star resort as many sites suggest.  2 or 2.5 perhaps?  Never - NEVER a 4.  Our room was dirty.  The tub didn't drain.  We found bugs.  The fridge didn't get cold.  The floor was filthy/carpet stained.  No patio furniture - as all the hotel photos suggest.  Did we have a private balcony?  Yes, no chairs though....  Old fashion - non-HD TV's.  Very dated and in need of TLC.  It is weird, because the website said it was newly remodeled?  Maybe 10 years ago.  I wouldn't go back, and would not recommend it.  The water park was nice though, but the onsite restaurants blew.  Terrible food, terrible service.
