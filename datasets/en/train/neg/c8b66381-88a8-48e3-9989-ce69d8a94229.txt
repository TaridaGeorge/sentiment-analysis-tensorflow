where do I start?  Here goes.  Rolled tacos--hard, half rolled, SALTY-did I mention hard, like break your teeth hard?
chicken burrito-go up the street to  El Cerrito-they make it right. This was a gluey, wet, super-duper salty mess with a sour flavor.
The bean burrito? weak, floppy, and kinda bland. AND they charge 65 cents for cheese, then barely give you any.

This place is TERRIBLE.
