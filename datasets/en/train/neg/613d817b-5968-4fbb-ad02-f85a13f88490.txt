We bought a 2011 Lexus at Bell.  Our sales associate was very professional and knowledgeable.  Unfortunately, the finance manager was right out of a movie.  A typically use car salesman attitude and persona.  He tried to take advantage of us both on our trade and lease.  I will never buy another vehicle from Bell Lexus.  Next time Scottsdale Lexus.  Buyer beware.
