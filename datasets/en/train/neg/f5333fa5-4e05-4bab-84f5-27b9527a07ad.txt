Is it possible to go below 1 star? Seafood, even in Arizona, shouldn't be this bad. Soup was cold, scallops smelled like they'd been rotting in transit from the ocean and the lobster tasted almost as good as overcooked styrofoam. The saffron had a hint of dirt flavor. I was embarrassed for the chef. I've never walked out on a meal until eating at the grill.
