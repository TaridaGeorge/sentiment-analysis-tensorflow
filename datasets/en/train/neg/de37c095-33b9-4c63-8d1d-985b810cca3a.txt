The fried calamari was as cold as the reception by our surly waitress, and the chopped Greek salad was as depressing as the actual Greek economy. If this place produced food as good as the decor I would return but it is not to be. 
The employee eating next to us received far better and friendly service, and given his ample girth, that is something he's taken advantage many times. This place only pretends to be a restaurant.
