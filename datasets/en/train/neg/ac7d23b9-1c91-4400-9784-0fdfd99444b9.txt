SO DISAPPOINTED.  Stopped in on a Monday night, we were one of 5 tables. My first impression was the staff could care less if me and my family were in there or not. My kids were excited with their "build your own burger", so we went in. 

Waitress forgot our appetizer, the build your own burger wasnt anything bigger than a McDonalds hamburger (good enough for my kids tho).
I ordered a ceasar salad, which came with NO DRESSING. Waitress only came back to give us the bill. No check back, no drink refills, no "how is everything?"
Just another bar on Mill Ave, passing the time until Friday and Saturday. Keep walking if your looking for a place to eat. This might be good for bar hopping, just not to eat.
