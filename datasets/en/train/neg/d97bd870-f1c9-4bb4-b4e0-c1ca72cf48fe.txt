I didn't bother checking in to this place after my experience.  There was a special tournament going on and it was after everyone was getting out of Sunday services.  It took 20 minutes before someone came to our table which was the manager.  While waiting for another 10 minutes an older couple sat down next to us.  Within 2 mintues a waitress stopped by to take their order and walked past us.  At that point we left a few dollors for coffee and orange juice then proceeded to walk out.  I will never go there again to eat !!!
