Last time I went in, the girl told me, "Oh, hold on, there's a note on your file! Oh.... it says I can't validate your parking." Wow. Just in case there was any confusion over how to to treat their members, thank goodness there was a note in my file to make me feel extra special! P.S. She was sweet and made sure to stamp that validation anyhow. Thanks, awesome front desk girl. :)
