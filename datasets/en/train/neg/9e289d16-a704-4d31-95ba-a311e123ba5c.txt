This place sucks. 

I have seen a few bands here. The sound quality sucks and the shows are expensive. Why? I wondered the whole time because its cheap...they have concrete floors, horrible bouncers, and a lame patio with broken plastic seating. 

Oh and for parking just walk across the bridge park in the public parking lot. They rip you off. 

Drinks are a rip too. 

and for the most part crap bands play here.
