I won't be going here again for dinner. 

The waitress hardly came over to check up on us. I could understand if she had other tables to attend to...but she only had one other table besides ours! It took us over 20 minutes for us to actually pay for our bill. When my friend and I both asked for refills (we both had the same drink) she came back 5 minutes later with one refill...then asked if I wanted one too. Well obviously...I'm the one who asked in the first place...

The food was bland. I have been here one other time and figured maybe it was just an off night. But...this time around the food was just as horrible. We hardly ate our meals. 

All together...not a great experience. I'll stick with Oregano's if I want Italian.
