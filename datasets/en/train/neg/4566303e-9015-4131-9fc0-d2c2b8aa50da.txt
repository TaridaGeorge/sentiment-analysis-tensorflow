This place is Terrible. They closed the bar at 120am on new years eve.  It took 1.5 hrs to get my bag after checking in and  a half hour to get an item from housekeeping bc 1 guy was working. The waitresses have attitudes at the bar and it also took 50 min to get food from room service. The landscaping is amazing but the service ruins the experience.  Also no coffee maker in the room which makes things inconvenient as well.
