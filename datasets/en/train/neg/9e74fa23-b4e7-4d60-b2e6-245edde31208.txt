Do NOT go to this restaurant if you can't use stairs. The dining room has about a dozen stairs (for everyone) and does NOT have an elevator or wheel chair lift. The restaurant manager wanted to send our group OUTSIDE, and re-enter the dining room via the back door. In addition, the restaurant staff has no training on ADA compliance.
