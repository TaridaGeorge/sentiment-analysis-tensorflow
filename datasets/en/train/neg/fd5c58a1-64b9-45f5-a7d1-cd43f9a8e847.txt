Google mediocre and I imagine Smashburger will pop up.  Overcooked tasteless burgers.  Dried out chicken breasts.  Soggy flavorless fries.  The only thing we had worth ordering was the Nutter Butter shake.  The shake wasn't enough to save it from the 1 star rating.  Might be the worst restaurant burger I have ever had.
