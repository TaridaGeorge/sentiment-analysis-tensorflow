The service was BAD.  
The food was BAD.  (My salad was old and wilted I got the fried pickles and they were rock hard the waitress didn't even bring ketchup for my son's fries, I went and grabbed a bottle from their stock for him because she disappeared.  

At least is wasn't freezing in there this time.  I only went because my boyfriend likes it there, I don't really know why, its horrible every time we go.  I certainly will not be back, he can go by himself if he really wants to.
