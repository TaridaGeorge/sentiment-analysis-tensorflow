If you are looking for an over-priced dorm like atmosphere then this is definitely the place for you.  Loud parties, underage drinking, and plenty of side-stepping the puke left in the elevators and resident floors from above mentioned guests.  This place is treated like a toilet and management has done nothing about it except raise the rates.
