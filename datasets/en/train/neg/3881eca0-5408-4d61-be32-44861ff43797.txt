Horrendous from beginning to end, I had an appointment for 8:00 AM to get lab work done, it was 1 hr and 15 minutes after my appointment time before I was called back, close to 3 people who came in after me went before me. The place itself is dirty, crowded, and noisy. 

I wonder what is the point of making an appointment when it still takes over an hour to get in? There was a man who came in without one and they told him it would take an hour. So really what is the point?
