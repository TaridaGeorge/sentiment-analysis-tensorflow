Cox is pitiful. After the 3rd receiver broke and I went back down to get another one they actually blamed it's failure on me. I think their equipment is absolute garbage and they will not give you a new unit but only beat up, used, refurbished crap that breaks. Also, the user interface for the box is slow and always freezes. Try Dish Network or DirecTV.

P.S. You should see what the installation guy did to my house! I had to have them send another guy to come and fix the walls and redo all of the wiring lol. Good luck!
