Ride to HELL, negative 5 stars, ever fly to phoenix with no air conditioning and only one operating bathroom and lineups down the isle? An old mother tried to pick fight with me as we tried to get off, I ignored her as we all were suffocating in hundred degree heat waiting on the tarmack with no oxygen. I am lucky to be alive. 
My husband rode AW to LV one way and wanted to buy another ticket with another airline going home even though the company paid for his ticket, he was amazed he made it home alive, I made sure I paid more for United instead of flying with him on the same flight.
