I was sold on loving hut until I recently discovered they don't even use organic vegetables!!!!! All the glitz and glamour of "saving the planet" "going green" and advocating forks over knives but they use the cheap pesticide filled veggies everybody else does or possibly worse;GMO! It is a sham! I just assumed they would be organic since thats what being vegan and healthy is all about but it's just more tricks from a business trying to turn a profit from people looking for healthy alternatives. Just call and ask and they will tell you they don't use organic!!! UNACCEPTABLE
