I am usually pretty fair on my reviews but this company was AWFUL.

Here was my experience:

Called to schedule a cab ride to the airport 2 hours before I needed to leave. The operator, whom had a very difficult time understanding English , took down my information. Two hour came and went, no taxi in sight. Called the company, same operator as before, to have them tell me that they "ran our of taxis and cant pick us up". He was not apologetic, his response was "call Yellowcab" then gave me their number.  

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!
