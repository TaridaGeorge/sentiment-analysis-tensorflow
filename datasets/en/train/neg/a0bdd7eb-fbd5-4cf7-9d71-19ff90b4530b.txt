I wish I Could give this Avis negative stars!  Terrible service, didn't get the car I made a reservation for, rude staff.  Not only that, they gave me an explorer with over 30,000 miles on it, breaks that grinded to the point I felt unsafe, and the car was terribly dirty inside.  The worst of all though, sitting in the cup holder was a BULLET CASING!  When I returned the car and let Avis staff know, they just laughed.  They also tried to charge me for the rate of the explorer which was double the price of what I had booked.  They acted like they were doing me a favor by giving me the rate on my reservation.  Avoid Avis, Hertz is a million times better.
