I stopped in one day to take a look at their used bike selection. I approached the young man at the counter and explained that I needed a used bike because mine had been stolen a few days earlier. He said that used bikes were out front and then he said "I don't mean to be a dick but if you find your bike out there we're not giving it back" 

Well, sir, by starting off your sentence with "I don't mean to be a dick" you do actually, in fact, mean to be exactly that. And yes, if you did have my bike I would be getting it back, as I had already filed a police report. 

I simply wanted to shop for a different bike, which I did somewhere else. What a terrible way to treat a customer.
