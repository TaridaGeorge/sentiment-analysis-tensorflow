aaaaaaaaaaack! 

I just stopped by here for a slice and salad combo. I hadnt been in for a couple years, and man things have changed.

first up was the salad. I was so psyched on life when I saw how huge it was! One bite and I quickly knew I wouldnt be eating much more. I got the ceasar salad and the dressing tasted "off", the salad itself was pretty warm. Not a welcoming salad at all. 

Then came the pizza. The pizza here used to be really good. Not so much anymore. It was all dried out and crusty. 

I tossed my lunch and am thankful I had an apple squirrled away in the fridge. $8 down the drain.
