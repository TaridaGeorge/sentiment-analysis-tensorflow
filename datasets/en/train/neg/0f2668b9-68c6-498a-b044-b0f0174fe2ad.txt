I don't know how this place got a 4-star average.  We showed up later in the evening, but they were still open and seating.  Out of 4 rolls, one was good.  The other three were pretty disgusting.  They were made sloppily, everything had TONS of mayo and not enough spice.  They smash up the salmon for their spicy salmon, which leads me to believe it's not very fresh, and it makes for a very mushy texture.

The miso soup was good, at least...

Anyway, they turned on the bright lights and started stacking chairs before we had finished paying.  Sorta rude.  As a server who has worked in restaurants for a long time, I think that if you take tables until 9:30, you should expect to properly wait on them until they are finished.  Otherwise close earlier and don't take the table.

I'm NEVER going back here,  Ew.
