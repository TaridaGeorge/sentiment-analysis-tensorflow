At first we thought it was a good place to go for BBQ but each time we went we found something that just wasn't right.  We would mention the problem and made to feel like we didn't know what we were talking about.

When the last order had more fat than meat and again the management seem not interested in replacing our order with one with meat, we have never been back and never will go there again.
