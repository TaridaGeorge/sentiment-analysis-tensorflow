The service was horrible! The food was just ok. The waitress order me an extra sushi dish cause she thought we would like it (which is nice)but then we had to pay extra for it!! THEN when paying for our meal the waitress thought she could just help herself to our change!! We were extremely offended!!! A tip is given, you dont just help yourself to someone elses money.... that's called STEALING!!!
