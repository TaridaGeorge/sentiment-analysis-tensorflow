Since we always come here for happy hour, I thought to stop by for lunch one day for sushi.  Um, yeah, there aren't very many sushi specials for lunch.  The only thing on the menu was 4 pcs sushi with soup for $10.  The menu was puzzling - had clam chowder, burgers, and non-existent sushi options.  Very disappointing.
