We sat at the outer "patio" and had to search for the waitstaff more than once. When I finally found the one of two servers and asked if there was a waitress for the outer "patio" I was told, "yes there is" and she promptly walked away. Horrible service. Eat TCBY instead. The management should clean house and get rid of these two worthless servers ASAP!
