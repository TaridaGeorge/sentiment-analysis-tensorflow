I don't understand the hype. Is it because it's in the same plaza as a gelato joint and zen 32? Oooh, and sweet potato fries served in a cutesy mini shopping cart?...no thanks. The burger was just so-so, but nothing I wanted to even continue eating after the first bite. On the plus side, better than IHOP or Denny's for a late night, after the bar meal.
