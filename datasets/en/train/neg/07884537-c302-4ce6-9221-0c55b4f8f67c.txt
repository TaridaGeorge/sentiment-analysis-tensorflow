It's an Arby's, food tastes like every other Arby's. 

However, the service is consistently good and that's important when you're trying to cram a quick lunch within a half hour break, so they get a few stars from me.

Edit: This outlet didn't honor their nationwide promotion of free curly fries after a Matt Kenseth NASCAR win. The cashier didn't even know who Matt Kenseth is, and made me feel like an idiot trying to collect on a dollar side item. What the crap?
