I can't quite figure out why, but I've just never liked this place. Gave it three tries, and just didn't click. The cover charge irritated me... $5 to get into an empty room? Really?... the crowd seemed to consist of groups of 4-5 people who didn't talk to anyone but the other 3-4 people in their group... and the drinks were expensive. Somehow left in a bad mood every time I went there, and walked up the street to Amsterdam. I was SO excited for another venue to open up, and was really thinking that I would love it... but... no... just not feelin' it at all. Too much attitude for the new kids on the block.
