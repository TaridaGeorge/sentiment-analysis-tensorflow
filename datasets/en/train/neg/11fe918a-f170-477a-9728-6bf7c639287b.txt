Yelp makes you enter a star. This place deserves zero. We tried to give them a chance, we really did. But every time we've been to Corbins, it's been a disaster from the food, to the manager. From the measley $13 burger that they couldn't get cooked right. They messed up every meal we've ever ordered there.  The end. As in we're never going there again nor would I recommend it to anyone.
