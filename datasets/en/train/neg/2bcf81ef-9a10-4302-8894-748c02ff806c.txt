I was not impressed with this place much.  It is nice that they offer tofu as an alternative to meat for add-on's in your noodles.  However, vegetarians beware: they cook on the same surfaces, and the tofu took 10 minutes longer to arrive than my other friends' chicken dishes.  The specials have decent prices, when you do a combo.  Otherwise, I think this place is over-priced and avoidable.
