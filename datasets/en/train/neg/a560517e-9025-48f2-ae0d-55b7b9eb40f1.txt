With all the hype around sprinkles I decided to drive around this weekend and check out the cupcake places around town.

What a disappointment. The store is tiny, NO NONE NADA organization to handle customers. It was an absolute mad house. People acting like drones standing in a huddled mass waiting for someone to get them a freakin over priced cupcake. It was an absolute joke.

I ended up leaving after waiting 10 minutes and still no one to get me a cupcake. 

Maybe the Hollywood cupcake madam should come and tend to her Scottsdale store.
