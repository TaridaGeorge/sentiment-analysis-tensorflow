OMG! I am mortified at this place and feel sorry for the people who think this is NY pizza. I am from Brooklyn, NY. I KNOW what NY pizza tastes like and this is NOT it! Does it look like NY pizza? Yes. Does it taste like NY pizza? HELL NO! I took one bite and couldn't even swallow it. Driving past their place makes my stomach turn. Seriously, I am so sick of people putting the NY name on so many establishments and it is NOT NY FOOD AT ALL! PLEASE AZ STOP doing this! Your bagels are NOT NY bagels. Your pastries are NOT NY pastries! Your pizza is NOT NY PIZZA! Please... Do NOT eat here. I am saddened if you think this really is NY food...
