Very disappointing. After reading the great reviews posted by others, I purchased a groupon for 5 visits. Needless to say, I will not be making a trip back. The idea is nice, but the construction of the little town is very poor and in need of a face lift and new carpeting. It was packed with kids, but there seemed to be very few toys in site. My daughter went to play in the little grocery store, but instead of baskets of fun fake food, there was nothing in there but a broken plastic cash register. Everything looked worn and dingy and we left after about fifteen minutes.
