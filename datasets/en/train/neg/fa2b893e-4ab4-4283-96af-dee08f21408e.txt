The service is always pretty lousy. You always have to ask for refills of water, soda, tea and no one is all that friendly... BUT last night was the WORST. We ordered, then waited 30 minutes for our food - when it came out - fajitas - there were no tortillas, condiments or salsa for another 5 minutes! When we got our tortillas, it was a total of 2 in one foil with a promise to bring more - which again, we had to ask for from the manager... 

This terrible services went on the whole time while the manager, assistant manager and the rest of the wait staff wandered around aimlessly. Not an un-bussed table in the house - but satisfied, cared for customers? I love their fajitas... but the service (this time) was enough for me to choose to stay away for ever...
