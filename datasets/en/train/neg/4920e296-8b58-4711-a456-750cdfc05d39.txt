Ok..so my gf  RAVED about this place, and we went for lunch.  I was excited! I had a big fry bread taco. The bread was thick, and good, but the stuff inside the taco lacked any real flavor or distinctive taste.  Bland --and nothing interesting.  

It basically was fried bread with lettuce, meat, beans and some shredded cheese slapped in it.  Very filling, and I got fed.  I really wanted it to taste good because my gf was all into it. 
 By the time we were done,  I really wondered if she needed taste bud implants.  I would try other things next time, but I know flavor --and The Fry bread house just didn't have it.
