I think this was my 3rd or maybe 4th visit to Takamatsu...and definitely my last. 

Want my review? See Anonymous X's review. There it is. 

Yeah, I actually had to get up and take our glasses over to re-fill them myself. They never came back and asked if everything was good. I seriously think they just didn't care. 

It was a really weird vibe, almost like they didn't want us there. Well, they got their wish because we won't be back.


Any recommendations for a good Korean place in the valley. I need my Bul Go Ki fix but I'll starve before I go back to the shithole known as Takamatsu.
