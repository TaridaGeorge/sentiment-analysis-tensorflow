WORST EXPERIENCE at the MVD ever (and that is saying something)! Talk about a "Can't Do" attitude - - - I've dealt with 4 people over 3 visits and spent all day chasing down people just to do their jobs. Each one gave conflicting info, which forced me to spend more time producing documents and I'm still not done. What should have taken an hour (registering a vehicle from another state) has turned into a 3 week hassle. Nothing complicated here - just a situation requiring someone to use common sense and unfortunately, here, there isn't any.
