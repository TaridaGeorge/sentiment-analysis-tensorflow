Can't believe there are many reviews after my first one years ago. To be honest, I don't go there any more for few reasons. 

1. The owner has changed
2. The foods quality has changed
3. Service is NOT as good as it used to be. 
4. The original chief seem to be long gone. 
5. Found a better places to have the best DIM SUM in Chandler AZ

Once very satisfied customer is no longer their customer. If you want real good Chinese foods and restaurant services, go somewhere else. I guess I will never know how good their foods now. Don't even want to try.
