Been here twice & both times were horrible. The front desk staff....especially the RECEPTIONIST is very rude & condescending. The doctor is not the greatest. The wait is extremely long & not worth the wait at all. They don't admit when they're wrong or apologize when they screwed up your order. BEWARE!
