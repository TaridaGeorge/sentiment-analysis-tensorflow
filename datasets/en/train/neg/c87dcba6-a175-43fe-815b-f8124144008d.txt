This is the absolute worst restaurant I have been to in years.  There was no toilet paper in the women's bathroom and it was very, very dirty. Some guy was installing lights in an area right by where we were eating with an electric drill.  The food here is much worse than Denny's . The menu is very limited, very greasy, and the offerings are just weird. Don't get the Indian taco. No sure where they got this recipe but it is an embarassment to Native Americans.  Avoid this place like the plague.
