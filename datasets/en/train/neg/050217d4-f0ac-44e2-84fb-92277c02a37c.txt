Beware of incorrect hours: I have been wanting to try White Sage for a while... I went out of my way this morning to stop at 6:40am.  They weren't open.  Open at 6 am huh?  Someone oversleep?  Get between me and coffee in the morning and I am an uphappy girl.

How do coffee shops make opening at 7am?  

Maybe I will come back during bankers hours.
