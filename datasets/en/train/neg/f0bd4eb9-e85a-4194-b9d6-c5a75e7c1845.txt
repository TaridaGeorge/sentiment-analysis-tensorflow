this place blows. the waitress was so horrible, and just stood there and talked to some douches at the bar while we were waiting for her to acknowledge us so we could get beer. i had a burger and it was so messy i actually had to eat it with a fork, and that's weird. it wasn't horrible tasting, i suppose, but still, this place is dumb.

they do have playmakers, though. so, 1 star. we probably won't ever go back.
