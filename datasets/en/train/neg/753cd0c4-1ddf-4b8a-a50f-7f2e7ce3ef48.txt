I hate to start the year off with a bad review, but come'on guys really?! So I invited my mom down from Glendale for a ladies day along with two good friends of mine. We decided to  go early so we don't miss out on all of the food. Well long story short, we never made it into the dirt lot. If this was a movie I'd call it: Gridlock traffic, starving women. The ending is sad. *hold me*

$10 entry tickets
$5 dirt lot parking
$rumor has it you had to purchase food tickets?!
13,000 people and fifteen food trucks (poor vendor's) 
= horrible event planning.

Any word on a refund?
