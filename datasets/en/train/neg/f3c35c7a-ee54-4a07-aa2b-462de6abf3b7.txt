I am a licensed Cosmetologist and I came here tonight to buy a blow dryer. This was a bad decision! I bought the Ceramix Xtreme Babyliss Pro blow dryer. I just got home and I opened the box to check out my cool new blow dryer and it's definitely not new! It's all scratched up with I don't know what all over it and there's paint missing on the blue button. Whatever the yucky stuff is, is also all over the cord. TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED. I am definitely going back tomorrow to hopefully get my money back. I uploaded pictures of the blow dryer.
