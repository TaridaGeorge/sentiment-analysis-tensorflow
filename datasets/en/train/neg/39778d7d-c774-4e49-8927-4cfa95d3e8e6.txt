I'd give them more stars because they are nice and all... BUT I just pulled my car out of the lot, with nothing done to my car, because they tried to charge me $75 for an oil change (no tire rotation, no alignment, nada). $75!!?? They said they didn't have my oil filter in stock so they had to charge me $7 for going to pick it up at another shop. "OK fine". THEN, since my car takes "fully synthetic" oil - it's about $5 more per quart ($25 extra for this type of super-awesome oil apparently). 

I was expecting to pay $25-30 for an oil change. I HIGHLY doubt that any other place would charge as much as they wanted. And to those who can pay that, more power to you. I'll stick to going to my car dealer.
