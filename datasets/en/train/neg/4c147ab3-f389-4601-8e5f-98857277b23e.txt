Why on Earth does their menu not list the ingredients of each item? You will have no idea what's in your burrito and when you call and ask they will act like you are taking up all of their time, when they could just simply include what comes in their food on the menu like just about every other restaurant.

Also, who the hell has a vegetarian burrito that isn't vegetarian?
