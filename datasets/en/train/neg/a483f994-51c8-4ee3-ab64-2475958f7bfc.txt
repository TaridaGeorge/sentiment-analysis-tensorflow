This is my first ever, negative yelp review and I'll keep it short and not sweet.

I experienced horrible customer service when I went to get lunch with a friend.  I've never had such an unwelcoming experience from any food service establishment.  And their food was meh.  I've definitely had better Chinese food in the valley, such as Little Shanghai, Mekong Plaza, and Szechwan Palace@COFCO.

Heck, even P.F. Chang's is better, and that's not really Chinese...

OK, I'm done.  :)
