You know when you crave for something and you expect nothing but the best and of course, what do you get....nothing but the worst of the worst! I'm telling you, even my boyfriend can cook better than this place...and he isn't the best cook in the world...this country...this city, well you catch my drift. Worst of all, they not only taste bad...they're mucho expensive! Like the old yelp cliche...if only I can rate zero star! If I had to pick Lo Cascio vs. Chef Boyardee....Chef Boyardee baaaaaby!
