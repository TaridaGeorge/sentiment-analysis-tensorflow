Over rated camping primitive site was a very rough dirt area charged 10.00
Stayed in a equally rough area with electric and water charged 25.00 for a site I would not recommend.  No attention to area was very rough, no table and pathetic fire area.  Not worth the 25.00 charged.  Would not stay again or recommend anyone else to stay.
