I hate giving bad reviews but I have been three times now and hated it every time. The pizza has been soggy and the toppings fall off the crust. Crust is not good. Ordered salad w/ pine nuts on it and we got a whole two (2), yes we counted carefully...Great beer selection but otherwise meh! Other reviews seem okay so go and check it out, you might love it. Just putting in my vote.
