I hear this place used to be wonderful, and wished I had visited it then. Last week when I went  I found everything oily & flavorless.

My Pad Thai was grotesque - it tasted like they substituted vegetables for lard. As it sat uneaten it congealed into into a solid block.  

I'm health conscious, so this is definitely off my list.
