I just want to let everyone know that they don't wash their strawberries before they dip them in the chocolate, and sometimes the strawberries are moldy. Also they claim to be so healthy but all their sauces are mayo based. That is why they don't have nutrition facts available. They don't want you to know how UN Healthy it is.
