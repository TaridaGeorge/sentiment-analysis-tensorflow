Probably some of the worst service I have ever had...and I can say this because I myself was a server for 4 years.  We had 4 different "servers" and half the time we would just go to the bar and get our drinks. And the food is definitely bar food, in fact I think it was mostly frozen food. Pretty sure I will never return.
