Their customer service is horrible when something goes wrong. I ordered from them the first time and things were fine. The second time around, 1.5 weeks went by and the shipment did not come. I sent an email and they said they would look into it. Never heard back. I called, they put me on hold, and then no one picked up the phone. I called again, web site was down, they promised they would call back. No one called back. Then I chatted with someone on their web site and finally they agreed to ship a replacement. But even then the attitude was bad. Their employees don't have a sense of accountability to ensure their customers are happy with their shopping experience. If you can find their products with another vendor, I'd recommend buying it elsewhere. These guys have a BAD attitude.
