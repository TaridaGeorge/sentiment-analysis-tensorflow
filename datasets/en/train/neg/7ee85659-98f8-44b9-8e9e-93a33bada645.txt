This place was a nightmare for me. I understand that there are people that love love love to do weird shit like hit the stores at 5am the day after Thanksgiving to do their x-mas shopping, punch other people in the face and threaten their lives for that "last fucking furby", and shop at Last Chance.... I'm just not one of them. 

I'm not saying I'm better than you....... oh, who am I kidding, yes I am.
