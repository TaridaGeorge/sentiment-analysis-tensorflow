I read the other reviews, I don't see how they earn a three star. Maybe their attitude change for the worest; maybe its the summer heat, In my book that owner lady is definately NOT FRIENDLY !!! she is a bitch !!, she brought out the wrong oder, we took a few bit before we realizing it was not what we ordered, she insisted we pay for it anyway - because we already eat it (three bits worth). The man is nicer, he came out and take care of our complain. 
The food is pretty much like other Americanized chinese restaurant. - Cheap and plenty.
As for me, I won't be back here again;  plenty Other good Chinese restaurant to choose from.
