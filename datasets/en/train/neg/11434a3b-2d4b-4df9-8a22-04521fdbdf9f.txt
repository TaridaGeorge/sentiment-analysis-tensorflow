This rating is on their new SELF CHECKOUT. I have been a shopper and avid Costco enthusiast since it's days as Price Club. I love the place! BUT... recently my Costco put in self check which is ridiculous! It takes you longer to scan each item. Longer to wait in the self check line and longer to get through the door audit! I have tried it several times because I thought maybe it was my fault but after doing everything right - it is still inconvenient and slow.
