Do not go here.  Staff agreed to a price for a service then the manager added $10 at the end.  When I complained he told me not to "fight" with him and to just pay what he wanted and never come back.  Also was charged an extra $15 for a design on my nails that just didn't turn out well. The lines are crooked.  I would've complained but I could tell the guy was just doing his best but wasn't experienced.   He had to have someone else finish.  If you want "lavish" designs on your nails you can have a better selection, better quality job, have it done quicker and pay less elsewhere.
