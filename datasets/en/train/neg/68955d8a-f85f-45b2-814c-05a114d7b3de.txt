Bruschetta Pizza, Greek Salad, Cannoli: The pizza was overwhelming with raw onions and garlic. Too many tomatoes piled on a soaked crust and box. When I picked it up to move it, it fell through the box and all over the carpet. Huge mess! The salad consisted of brown, wilted iceburg lettuce. Awful, horrible experience!! Very expensive, not including the professional carpet cleaning I had to pay for.
