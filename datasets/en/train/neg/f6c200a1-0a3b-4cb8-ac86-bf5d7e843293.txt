Bathrooms are filthy (please look at the inches of black dust blanketing the air vents...) and literally ten degrees (perhaps to give shelter to the countless homeless that flock in here during the heat waves?), the (new) cafe manager is obsessed with forcing her employees to ask customers not to let their flip flops hang off their feet (?!), the cafe insists on freezing their customers at around 40-50 degrees (really, I'm not exaggerating), many homeless people camp here the whole day and you have very few places you can sit without your olfactory senses being overwhelmed. Overall, very dirty and uncomfortable.
