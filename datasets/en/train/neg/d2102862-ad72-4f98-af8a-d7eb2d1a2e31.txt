I have been here 3 different times twice earlier in the day during happy hour and once later in the evening. Every single time I've gone the service has been awful. It takes them forever to get your drinks, orders, etc. and whenever i have gone i have had unfriendly and uncaring servers.
 I have also encountered the portions of food being noticeably smaller than the other restaurants. I remember ordering the tempura ice cream and was amazed at how small the servings were. I am use to those suckers being quite a decent size and I have had it enough times to notice that food portion is smaller than usual.

This is by far the worst RA I've been to and I do agree it does reek like wet rag. I'd recommend the RA in Ahwatukee or on Val Vista and the 60.
