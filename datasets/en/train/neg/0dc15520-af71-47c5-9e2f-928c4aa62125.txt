I reserved at table for 8 women for a luncheon 2 weeks ago ... we had TERRIBLE service, had to ask for silverware 3 times.  had to ask to have tea refilled and had to ask 4 times ( had to leave the table and ask the 4th time for our check).  THEN ... I ordered a chicken sandwich to bring home to my husband.  FINALLY got it home after waiting forever the check and it was totally RAW !!   Disgusting that is how people get SICK ~  We as a group we are trying to support local small business but I am sad to say that we will never return this is unacceptable in all arena's ~
