Been to other Five Guys and loved it...but this was an epic fail.  Should have known when the guy in the grey t-shirt kept questioning the guy in the red t-shirt about when he was going to drop the fries.  Can anyone say raw potatoes here?  Worst fries I have ever had.  And it was obvious by looking at them that they were not done...SO SAD!

Burger and dog were OK but ruined by my disappointment...and not great service to boot.  Will not be back.
