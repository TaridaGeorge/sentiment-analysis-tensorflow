This Bank Of America is the WORST of the worst. The customer service is terrible, they treat you like they own your money and how dare you ask for it back. Then charge you an arm and a leg to access your money. Not to mention they were complicit in the biggest financial scam this world has ever seen, contributing first-hand to the the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit default swaps that had a significant negative impact on the creditworthiness and net worth of almost every single American family. I'd trust my money to Bernie Madoff rather than this scum-sucking company.  BANK WITH A CREDIT UNION http://www.moveyourmoneyproject.org/
