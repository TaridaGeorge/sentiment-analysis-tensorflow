Rude management and office staff, very slow response times from maintenance team (if they came at all), and ridiculous charges at move-out. Thankfully I was able to talk them out of the extra charges, since they were based on nonsense. The complete lack of help from the office staff, leaky roof, frequently shut-off water, and bad termite problem made living here a total hassle. The only redeeming quality was the lovely Gainey neighborhood and close proximity to the Hayden Greenbelt. No thanks, never again, and I don't suggest you rent there either.
