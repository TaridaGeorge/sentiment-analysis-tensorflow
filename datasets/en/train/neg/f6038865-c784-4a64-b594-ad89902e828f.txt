I realize this is a restaurant run by students, but 2 1/2 hours for 5 menu items?  REALLY?!?  The food was just okay, bordering on bland and some of the items arrived cold.  The old saying "You get what you pay for" could not be more true.  I cannot, in good conscience, reccomend this to anyone other that friends and family of students at Le Cordon Bleu.
