So frustrated with my experience here. I went in for a new battery. It should have been a really simple, 20 minute transaction. It turned into 3-4 hours arguing over what the problem was. They kept trying to tell me it was my fuel line, etc., which I knew it wasn't. Essentially, they tried to pull the 'dumb female' game with me so I would pay for unnecessary repairs. Guess what, just like I told them when I walked in the place, it was my BATTERY. Never going back here again. I would  have left if the previous battery wasn't still under warranty.
