The name says it all, "Lucky", meaning Lucky to walk out alive.  The food is horrible, the place a has stench that I can't explain.  I know of a few people that have gotten sick from eating there, myself included.  The sushi was dry and seemed old.  The softshell crad roll, Spider Roll, was burnt.  When we got there, there was about 6 men sitting at a table eating, including the "chef".  Save yourself and don't go there.
