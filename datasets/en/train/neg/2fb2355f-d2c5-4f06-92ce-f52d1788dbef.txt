For god sakes DO NOT GO ON KARAOKE NIGHT. I don't normally consider myself a violent person but if I had to listen to a little kid sing the ABCs again I was going to break the microphone. Its been 4 months and I still cringed when I think about it.
The Fried chicken is pretty good and is the only saving grace.
