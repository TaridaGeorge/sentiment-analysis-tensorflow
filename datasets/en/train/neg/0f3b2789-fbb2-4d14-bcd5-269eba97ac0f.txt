I was in the store for 20 minutes and no one acknowledged I was there.  No "hello" when I came in, and no one asked if I needed help.  I was the only customer in the store and there were 4 employees!  The only thing any of them said to me was the total cost for my stuff and then "sign here."  Two of the employees were watching the game on TV and the other two were having a personal conversation while they were ringing up my stuff.  I was treated as if my shopping in the store was an inconvenience to them!  Stay away!  I'll stick to the play it again Greenway instead!
