I miss Cafe Portobello!! Not the Cafe Portobello with the horrible ownership, the ORIGINAL Portobello. The one with the Flat Iron Steak and Chipotle mashed potatoes...OH I MISS IT. It's tragic what has become of this location. They took a BEAUTIFUL layout with an open feel and nuetral decor and turned it into a dark, dreary place. The LAST thing we needed was ANOTHER sports bar. We have Zipps, Goldies and  Temple Bar. This location with it's amazing patio and breathtaking view desrves SO MUCH better. MMR deserves better. The staff is nice enough but the food and wine offerings completely random and dissapointing. Sorry but when we want to go to a "sports bar" this will be my last choice.
