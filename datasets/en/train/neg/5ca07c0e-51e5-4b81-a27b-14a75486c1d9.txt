As a child my uncle use to bring me a Whataburger in New Mexico. I remember them being so large and crammed with tons of fixins. Not anymore! In fact, I took one bite and might as well have bit into a salt rock. I gave the rest to the dog. It was so unbelievably aweful. All I wanted was a taste of my childhood and what I got was a mouth full of artificial sodium. Does that mean my childhood was salty (grrr!) or bloated (bloated - ugh!) ... I guess one might say not to place childhood emphasis on a burger.
