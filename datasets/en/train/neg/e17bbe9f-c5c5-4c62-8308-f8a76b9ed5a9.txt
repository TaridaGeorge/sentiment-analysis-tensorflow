Service so unspeakably bad, that I will Yelp about it instead.

Stopped for a drink before the Symphony.  It was a little busy, but nothing out of the ordinary.  There were a few empty tables...though most were dirty.  Waited for at least 10 minutes before a server passed by and said she would be back shortly.  Shortly turned into unacceptably long, so my husband went to the bar to order.  There the bartender walked by him several times, and again would not acknowledge him, much less take his order.  Keep in mind, he was not rushing to make drinks.  He was cleaning up.  I find it hard to believe we're invisible.  Maybe just undesirable?  Regardless, we left and went elsewhere.
