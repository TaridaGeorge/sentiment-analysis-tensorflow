Needs a new name - now.  

The Pischke's of old had such a sad ending.  I appreciated McGrath's effort to keep "Pischke's" alive.  But it is nothing, nothing, nothing like the Pischke's of old.  Call it "The Blue Ribbon Cafe" - take out the PIschke name - I can't imagine that Chris PIschke would have been honored to be remembered this way.  If his restaurant was a reflection of who he was as a person - Pischke's Blue Ribbon Cafe would be the exact opposite of who he was.  

The current restaurant is not a laid back, family friendly and yet a bar all at once restaurant that serves an unending array of crazy good sandwiches/salads/etc - the current decor is pretentious, and the food matches that.
