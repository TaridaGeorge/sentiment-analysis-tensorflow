Well... 

My mom was still in town when I gave it another chance. She doesn't live in the states and she was so looking forward to having the salad! Can't say no to mom, right? 

So mom picked up the salad to go and again... TINY. $15 for a side salad. (Please see picture of it next to a piece of paper and you'll see what I mean fellow Houston old timers.) 

The great news was that we were able to ADD our own mixed greens to the salad to make it enough for one person + a bite for another person here and there. 

But really? Who wants to add their own greens to a salad? Defeats one of the main reason for restaurants is that you don't have to do anything except eat and enjoy. 

Just not with Hillstone's Grilled Chicken Salad...
