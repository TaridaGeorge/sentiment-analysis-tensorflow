Talked to Juanita on the phone to schedule my "consultation". Sounded great! There were going to come give me a demonstration and evaluate my dogs. Juanita cautioned me to beware of training facilities that would not have a fee or charge for the consultation. Foolishly, I paid $150. Here is what I got for $150:
30 minute sales pitch and a $1750 offer for two 3 hour private sessions. Really?

So if you feel like paying for a sales pitch, go ahead and book your "consultation". If you like them for free, head to your local car lot.

I put a call in to Juanita to express my concern. She said someone would call me back. Still waiting.
