The only reason I go here is for their marinaded skirt steak. They do have a wide assortment of Mexican ingredients and products, but the staff here is so RUDE.

The first time I came in to visit the butcher, he took one look at me and told me that he was closed. Said he closed at 7. I walked out of the store empty handed (I only needed a pound of beef for pete sakes), and my watch said 6:50. I swear these people are racist.

Bad selection on the booze too. Just tequila. I guess serve what people drink. But really? Be nice to people that come into your store. The prices are outrageous enough.
