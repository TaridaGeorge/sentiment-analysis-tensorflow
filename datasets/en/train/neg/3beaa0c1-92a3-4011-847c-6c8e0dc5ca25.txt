Sometimes you just feel like getting up, grabbing a hat and going out to breakfast.   Meh.  I can make better eggs at home.  Scrambled eggs were dry.  Potatoes way too salty (could have used some onion).  Sausage was just OK.  $2 for two slices of toast.  I should have saved my $ and went to McDonalds.  I'm just saying ... This place didn't do it for me.  The place had lots of "regulars" in there ... older guys stopping in for their "regular dose of Joe's".  Ho hum.  I doubt if I will ever return.  So it's back in the saddle again heading to Matt's Big Breakfast.  When I want breakfast again, Matt, you're my man.
