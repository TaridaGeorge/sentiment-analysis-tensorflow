Ok.... Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. The only thing that was decent about this place was the waiter. Neither of us liked the food, and when we sent one of the dishes back, the owner comes out and to talk to us.She was very nice but clearly took offense to us sending the food back.  The decor is authentic and the atmosphere is great, however the food was not appealing to me or my partner who LOVES greek food. Lastly I would say that they are overpriced for the portions of food. (all of ours went to the dog....she wouldn't eat the stuff either!)
