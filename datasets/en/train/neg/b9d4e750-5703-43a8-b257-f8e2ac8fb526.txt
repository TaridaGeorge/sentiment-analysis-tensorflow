If your looking to hire AZ Elite to manage your property, take the money you would pay them and flush it down the toilet -- you'll get the same results.

In short, regarding my property they were "managing" for a year and a half:
- They were supposed to have the tenant sign a "no smoking" agreement -- they didn't.
- They were supposed to have the tenant disclose any pets -- they didn't.
- Apparently, they didn't have them sign a lease come renewal time, either -- just let it roll, baby!
- They seemingly let the tenant pay whatever they wanted for rent and would not respond to my inquiries about the matter.

But in all fairness, they weren't only neglecting me, their client -- they ignored the tenants, too, when they requested maintenance on the house.
