If I could go negative stars I would. No cold water for the showers (its 115 degrees outside); NO WIRELESS INTERNET (not even if you wanted to pay for it). A/C and toilets are both broken...I reported all to the front-desk and 12 hours later, still not fixed. .You couldn't pay me to step foot on this property again.
