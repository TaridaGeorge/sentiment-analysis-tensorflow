This place is a joke!! The rides are very old and dirty, and look like they are about to fall apart. You get better quality from a traveling circus. We had a party here, and the manager Teresa, was very rude and  unaccommodating. The parties are overpriced for the service that you get. We will not be returning, and strongly suggest not having a birthday party there, unless you want a disappointed child.
