I went here based on Yelp reccos. I ordered Chicken Saag, a favorite because I like to think it is healthier to eat spinach then to not eat spinach.

I cut open the first piece of chicken and it was uncooked. Now, we all like tuna, sushi style. Some people like their steak with a purpleinterior, but no one likes to eat raw chicken.

I asked for my check, paid it and left. I did write a note on the check but my best advice is stay away.
