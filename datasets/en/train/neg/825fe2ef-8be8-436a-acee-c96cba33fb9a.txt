this is crazy but why cant I use my UPS account in a UPS store...?  I can ship on my UPS account and off site locations all over town but not at the UPS Store...  WTF!

And the man that works in this location is pure evil..  Never go here and expect customer service..  it wont happen.

Again, you can only ship on your UPS account when you have already printed a label, they dont carry UPS shipping forms at the UPS Store. They do have them at Mail Plus in Tempe, these guys are the best!   If you pre-print a label then just schedule a pick up and you dont have to deal with these inconsiderate jerks..

SOOOOOOOO DUMB!!!
