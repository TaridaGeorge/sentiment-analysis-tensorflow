When this place first opened I was so excited to have an ice cream store close by and one that I could walk to.  They served Lapperts ice cream, which is delicious!  However, the last time I went I found that they had changed ice cream brands.  The flavors were not as good and the ice cream was definitely not as rich and creamy as Lapperts.  So needless to say I was disappointed and won't be returning.
