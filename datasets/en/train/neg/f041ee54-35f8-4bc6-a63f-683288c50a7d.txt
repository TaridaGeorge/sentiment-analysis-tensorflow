My wife and I went there on Friday afternoon for a late lunch. We were looking forward to trying a restaurant that was new to our neighborhood, with outdoor seating. When we sat down, there were only 4 tables being used. We thought this would mean we wouldn't have to wait long for lunch. We were WRONG! We waited for 15 minutes to get service. It took 25 minutes for them to deliever  2 hamburgers that we paid 12.00 a piece for. The hamburgers were good. They add an additonal 3.00 for a side that, we thought was part of the meal. They didn't tell us there was an extra charge for the side.The menu has a limited selection for entrees. The service was terrrible. It was our first and last experience
