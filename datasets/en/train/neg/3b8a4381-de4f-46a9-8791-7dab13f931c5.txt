The music was all bass and treble, no mid-range.  I'm no audiophile, but due to the earsplitting volume at which we were "enjoying" Journey, Lynyrd Skynyrd, etc., conversation with the person sitting next to me was out of the question.  The menu was pretty basic, so it didn't take long to read that, which left nothing to do but consider the sound quality for the thirty minutes that we waited for our drink order.  It was about 8:30pm on a Tuesday and not crowded; but to be fair, the wait staff did seem pretty busy doing shots with the bartender.  The BLT burgers and wings were forgettable...the poor service and unnecessary volume weren't.
