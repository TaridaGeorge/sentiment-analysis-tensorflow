WHOEVER RUNS THIS PLACE SHOULD BE FIRED!!!!

Went here for the Eric Church concert and there was literally a will-call/entry line for 2+  hours!  They are seriously understaffed/have just 2 will call windows, the guys checking IDs were soooooooo slow/drunk/chewing a wad of tobacco about the size of a baseball.  The beer lines were shameful.  No air conditioning!!!!! 

Can only use your credit card one time (?!?!?!?) so have to have a tab, etc.  

Overall an ugly black mark on the Scottsdale/Phoenix music scene.  I'd be ashamed to play here/own this place.
