The people and dogs are typicly friendly but this is a sad excuse for a dog park. The city of phoenix should be embarrassed. They can't even supply bags to clean up after the dogs or even benches. Not sure you can even call that grass. Not sure why you would plant trees in a city park that aren't evergreen so there is absolutely no shade considering this is one of the hottest places on the planet in the summer time. GREAT JOB CITY OF PHOENIX!
