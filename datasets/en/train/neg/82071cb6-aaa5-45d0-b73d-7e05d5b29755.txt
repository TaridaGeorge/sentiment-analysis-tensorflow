Opened up a checking account several weeks ago. The card I received had my name spelled wrong which was an error I probably wouldnt have noticed until they called me a day later. I went back to the branch where they offered me a gift card for my troubles in hope that the experience didnt leave a bad taste in my mouth. Well, I went to use the gift card (no activation required) and it declined saying there was no amount on the card. So I thought eh, I'll try it some other time. Well tried it again and still does not have a balance. I emailed customer service over a week ago and still havent heard back.
