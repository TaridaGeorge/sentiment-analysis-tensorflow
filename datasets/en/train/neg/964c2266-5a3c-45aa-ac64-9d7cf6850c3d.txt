I got a pedicure here recently and will never go back again.  It only lasted a few days and it was painful. After one day the polish started to discolor and within 3 days it started peeling off in huge flakes. I went in to tell them how unhappy I was and they said they cannot make any guarantees and would not redo my nails for free. I will not go back there again. Poor pedicure and very rude service.
