What a horrible experience: I placed a reservation on Thursday for the next day, and when I showed up on Friday night, the restaurant was closed!!! 
Did they not know the restaurant will be closed the next day when I placed my reservation? And if they didn't, was it too hard to give me a phone call? 
I am not setting my foot there again.
