I'm really surprised at the positive reviews for this place.  I wanted to like it, being a big fan of AZ88 and all.  Maybe I just don't understand the need to change a winning formula.  Sure, variety is nice but not in and of itself.  I found the wait staff both unhelpful and unpleasant, a very unfortunate combination.  The food was flavorless (the beet salad was right out of a can?) and the drinks small and pricey.  Five of us rang up a $200 bill with a bit more than usual drinking, all in a failed attempt to find the sizzle in this dud.  I'm all for downtown establishments but they have to meet a modicum of quality and value.  In my opinion Hanny's does not.
