Tried this place April 19th. Service was great. Portions not like typical sushi restrurants. Rice in sushi was very dry. Fish not fresh. Service good. Woke up the following morning with food poisioning. I ordered a rainbow roll and seaweed salad. Thinking it was the rainbow roll that caused my illness. It was all I ate all day. Avoid this place for sushi definately not fresh.
