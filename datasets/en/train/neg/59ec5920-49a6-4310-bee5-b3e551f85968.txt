WOW I just drank the grossest most vile beer of my life !!!!  I've seen Frat initiations that were less gruesome. OK, Take a beer feed it to a paying patron, Let the ass of it mold and dry out then use that old moldy glass to serve your next customer. When I showed the waitress she looked terrified and tried to make up some excuse that it came from the keg, when clearly we could see what took place here. Later the manager came over and apologized as he was shocked. I had already consumed most of the vile beer before looking into the infectious glass. Oregano's you should be ashamed. Feeding honest hard working people this sh*@ is disgraceful. And I hope this post helps another hard working family avoid such a dreadful experience!
