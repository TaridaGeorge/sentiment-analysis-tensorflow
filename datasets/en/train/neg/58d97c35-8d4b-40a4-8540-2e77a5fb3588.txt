I ordered the homemade turkey sandwich and I got lettuce tomatoes cheese and pulled turkey thrown in shabbily between two slices of bread. The messiest and most unappealing looking sandwich I ever ate. Tasteless too. Don't even bother eating here. I'm sure Walmart, which is at a walking distance from this place, can make a better sandwich.
