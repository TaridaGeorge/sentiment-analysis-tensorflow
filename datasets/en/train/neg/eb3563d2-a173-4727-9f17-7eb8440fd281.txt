I hate this store .. the salad bar is always cold and dry , the Workers are rude and not nice .. over  priced.. Called the corporate office talked with a Debbie , She was as RUDE as the workers , i can see why the workers act like they do ...

So many other places you can go to get GOOD healthy food for less the price and be treated alot better
