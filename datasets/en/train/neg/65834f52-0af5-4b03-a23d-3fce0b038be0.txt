This place was terrible!
Terrible service, old equipment, dirty uniforms and slow, slow service!!
We order a basic cheese hotdog, and they just reheat something that was already sitting on the grill, which makes me wonder if they're even following health regulations on temperatures and food handling.
Will never go back. Was just too gross.
