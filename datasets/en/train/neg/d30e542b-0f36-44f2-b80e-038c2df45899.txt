Worst customer service on multiple occasions - whether it be trying to demo a racquet or try out some shoes, you can be ignored in whole or in part for quite some time.  A lot of teens and early 20 something kids work here, and it shows.  Yet another place that bothers you with a stupid reward program that rarely yields a substantial benefit.

Location is in the SW part of the shopping area close to I-17, adjacent to where Circuit City used to be.
