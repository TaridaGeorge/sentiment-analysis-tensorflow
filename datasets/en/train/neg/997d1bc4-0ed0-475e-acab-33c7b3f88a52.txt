Confused by all the high reviews for their sushi. Usually yelp is right on. It is low-priced sushi without a doubt, so I wasn't expecting anything gourmet, but I gotta say...this sushi wasn't edible. The sushi you find in a Fry's grocery store or Whole Foods is better. I tried the Vegas Roll and their Alaskan Roll. The Alaskan roll was extremely fishy and couldn't eat more than one piece. The Vegas roll was funky. Can't quit put my finger on what it was...just didn't taste good...and definitely didn't taste like a Vegas Roll. Had a stomach ache after eating a couple pieces. Save your money and buy one roll at a better place. That one roll will fill you up more than two rolls that are inedible. 

Can't comment about their chinese food because I've never tried it...hope its better.
