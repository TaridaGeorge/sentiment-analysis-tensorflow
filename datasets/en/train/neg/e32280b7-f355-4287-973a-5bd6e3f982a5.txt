Firstly I would like to say that I love the food here, each time I have visited the food has been delish. However the food cannot make up for the horrid service and horrible managing. We spent well over 2 hours waiting on one pizza and one salad. The manager was not where in sight and the server was either very new or just not well trained. I do not recommend this place based solely on service.
