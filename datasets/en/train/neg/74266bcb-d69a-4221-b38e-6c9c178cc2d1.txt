Sorry folks, but this place needs a major renovation. It could be a cool '50s-type restaurant if they would spend a little money to clean it up. The food is greasy, and some of the waitresses are sporting tattoos and multiple piercings - a major turnoff for the food industry in my opinion. Try Big House Cafe down the street if you want a good breakfast at a good price in a clean environment. Pass this one by.
