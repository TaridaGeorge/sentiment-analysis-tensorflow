The good news is the chef or whoever pretends to do that can't screw up the beer. The food is another story. Lunch pulled pork sliders actually made me ill. Lukewarm congealed pulled pork (probably from a huge days old refrigerated batch) concoction on nondescript rolls with a strange onion? pile of something on the middle of plate. Not cheap either. I'd recommend you go down the street a block to Brio.
