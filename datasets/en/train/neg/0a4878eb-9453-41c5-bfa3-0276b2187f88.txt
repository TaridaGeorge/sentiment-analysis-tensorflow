I will not be going back to Party Nails - I went in for a fill and it turned out awful! I thought the staff was really rude and disrespectful and I was charged more than the actual price stated on their wall and I didn't ask for additional services. The inside was nice and I thought the experience would be as well but I was wrong. Would not recommend.
