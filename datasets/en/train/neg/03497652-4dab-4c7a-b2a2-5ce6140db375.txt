I wanted to try these cupcakes since my fellow Yelpers gave it such great reviews. So my bf's b-day is next week and I inquired about flavors and pricing since there is virtually no info on their website. 

Price: $36 PER DOZEN
Minimum order: 1 dozen.
Flavors: ONLY 1 Flavor per dozen. 
You also have to go to the Scottsdale Air Park to pick them up if you don't want to pay their hefty delivery fee.

I don't care how great they are. I am NOT paying $36 per dozen. The price is outrageous. Sorry guys, but you just lost a potential customer. Guess I'll keep looking on Yelp for some other tasty treats for my bf's b-day.
