I know it's a chain restaurant. I know it's in a mall. I know i shouldn't expect more but, I do. I have gone to BJ's many times in California and had consistently good results. Last friday I took a friend and my nephew to eat here and were very disappointed. The service was bad, the food mediocre at best and the prices were no value. I can understand if it was busy and the wait staff was swamped. But when people are standing around and you still have to flag them down for everything from water to the check, inexcusable. Also I am not opposed to paying for food that worth it but, this BJ's I could not justify anything.
