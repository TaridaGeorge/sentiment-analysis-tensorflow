I've been meaning to write this for weeks, but keep forgetting when I'm in front of a computer.  Cinemark was my favorite theater in Phoenix until recently.  The prices were better than Harkins and AMC, the arcade area has a few amusing options, and it never seemed to be full of screaming children.  I rarely made it that way since Mesa isn't my normal stomping grounds, but it was my mainstream east valley theater of choice.

$9,999 of donated money to Yes on Prop 8 by CEO Alan Stock (despite the willingness to show Milk at the theaters) and I'm done. Maybe I take things too seriously.  I'm not one for formal boycotts and can rarely keep a running list, but I can't support a place knowing they openly hate the homos.
