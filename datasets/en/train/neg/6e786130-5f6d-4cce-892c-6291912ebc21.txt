Went to the cinema for the first time in 2 years to watch Moonrise Kingdom. It was full so we had to pick an alternate and we made a bad choice, People Like Us, which was rubbish. At the beginning of the show during the previews there was no picture at all, and there was nobody there to ask for help. The picture finally came on at the beginning of the film. Diane stayed to the bitter end, I went to Yardhouse to reflect and promise myself never to go to the movies again!
