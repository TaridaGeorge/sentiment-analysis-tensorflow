Prices are not bad but selection could be better. I hate the fact that I have to look at the guys broken leg and exposed bandage on his calf though. Place seem to attract seedy types makes me feel like I live in belleview. Finally place has a scent that rivals Jeffery dahmers old apartment. They need to smile more and lighten up on there indifferent attitude or I go to blockbusters and take business with me. P.S. This place prays on you with bogus late fees and DVDs that have a fingerprint on them, they also up charge you on expired candies bought from the dollar store and over priced soft drinks that you can by at bashas for a lot less. And how do you not carry boogie nights on DVD I mean really?????!!!
