I no like.

I thought the atmosphere was awful.  Too bright and hospital like for my tastes.

I thought the staff was incredibly snotty, inept and downright rude.

I thought the wine selection left a lot to be desired.

It was cheap because it was happy hour.  

We got the cheese plate only to discover that the cheeses were from Trader Joes cheese section, and were rather... commercial and blah
It also came with sliced pepperoni.  Pepperoni?  Really?

I just didn't like it.
Which is truly a shame, because I was hoping it could become my new wine happy hour staple.   But alas, I'll keep searching....
