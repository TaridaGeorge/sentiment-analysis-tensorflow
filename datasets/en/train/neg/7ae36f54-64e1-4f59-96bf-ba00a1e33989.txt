If i could give China Chili less than one star, I would.

Friends keep dragging me there because it is walking distance from their offices.  If they keep insisting on China Chili, i might have to show up too late to get lunch. I have never had a good meal there. The worst was mushu that tasted like the vegetables in it were canned.
