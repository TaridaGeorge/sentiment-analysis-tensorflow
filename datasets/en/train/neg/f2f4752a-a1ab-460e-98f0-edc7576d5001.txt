supposedly CLOSED? I would agree as to why- 
My husband and I waited for over an hour for rice and salad...that was yucky mundane and worse than fast food- 
Service was horrible- the wait staff did nothing but throw food down and walk away without any refills, how is your food, nothing- we had to beg for our check- 

WE ARE GLAD they are gone...nothing to miss...if you disagree..then you eat plain rice....and guess what...I can make it cheaper and tastier at home- there are better "healthy" restaurants in town- Just because they were on 5th avenue....people clearly were not coming back for a reason- 

Bye....bye...will NOT be missed...
