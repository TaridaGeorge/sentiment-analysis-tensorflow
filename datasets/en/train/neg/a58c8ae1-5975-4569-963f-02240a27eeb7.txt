Can't even tell you how disappointed I was on Saturday morning when I stopped by to get a doughnut and coffee. HEY MANAGER you need time management!!! 
I ordered two doughnuts (not the ones I like) They were out of the UN GLAZED ????? But never the less I would gladly eat what I had ordered . HOWEVER what is a doughnut without COFFEE.. I ordered a large coffee and was told I would have to wait for . Now why would a coffee shop not be prepared .  The manager said 20 minutes to wait for coffee. 
WHAT!!!! I refused to buy the doughnuts and found myself at Tammie Coe's spending way too much money but got served immediately.  Tell you the truth, I am giving up on doughnuts and certainly this place needs new management for sure. Take the boys scout motto 
BE PREPARED...............
