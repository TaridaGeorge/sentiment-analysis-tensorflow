Have you ever wished there was a restuarant that served food that tasted just like the food you bought from your grocer's freezer?  Well, then Bistro Daniel is for you.  You get all that frozen mass produced taste without the hassle of reading the microwave directions or having to throw the carton away.  They even go the extra mile of serving fresh sliced white bread (yum!).
