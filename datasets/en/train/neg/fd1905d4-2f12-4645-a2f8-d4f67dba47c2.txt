Hipsters, Hipsters, Hipsters everywhere and not a drop of decent coffee.

The coffee was mediocre at best. One of the worst iced carmel/vanilla lattes I've ever had. It was in a 16oz cup that costed more then a venti at Starbucks. Was this because of superior quality? Hardly. Hipsters can't make decent cup of joe. Its too mainstream for them. I was in the area, and remember seeing it, so I wanted to give it a try.

The atmoshpere was crowded and cluttered. Overall just messy. I feel like I walked into a sweat shop. OH did I mention hipsters? The pastries looked good. But i'd never purchese anything from greasy hipsters without it being FDA approved. And these bitches were making cupcakes in plain view.

If I ever were to come back, it would be to simply take pictures of all the patrons and post them at LATFH.com
