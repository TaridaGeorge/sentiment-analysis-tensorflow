AVOID AT ALL COSTS. We went here for downtown pub crawl in search of the $1 drinks that had been prominently advertised. By $1 drinks, they actually meant $1 off overpriced glasses of shitty wine (with the "discount," Beringer White Zinfandel was only $7.50!). We made the mistake of asking Jason, the douchebag of a manager, to either honor the printed special or do *something* to make it worth our while to have gone there. Instead, Jason not only turned away our party of eight without offering any kind of special to make up for the false promise of $1 drinks, but also  gave us attitude for trying to take advantage of the pub crawl specials.  I don't think I've ever felt less welcome anywhere I've been.
