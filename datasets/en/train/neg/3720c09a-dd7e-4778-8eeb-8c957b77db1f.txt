Had the tofu soup and the ribeye bbq at the table cooktop. The tofu soup was nice. The "beef" couldn't be eaten by humans, unless you had a built-in chainsaw in your mouth. The pork was nice, but the beef should never have reached our table. Awful.
A smokey place (kinda fun there) that leaves you feeling like a Boy Scout just returning from a two week jamboree in the woods. Yeah, I remember that. Same thing. You might want to do laundry right after the dinner. I've been to a few Korean places in town and probably would not go back to this one. Yes, it's homey and mom and pop, but after that beef bbq attempt, uhhhhhh.....no. Not again.
