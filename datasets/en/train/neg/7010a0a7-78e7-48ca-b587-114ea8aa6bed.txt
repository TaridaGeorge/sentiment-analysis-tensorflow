After many years of AJ"s fine turkeys.. I got a tought bird. AsI prepared, inserted the meat therm...I thought I might be in trouble. It was like putting a nail in rubber. When it finished cooking in my Electrolux " perfect turkey" oven it was nothing but perfect. I have many pounds of white meat left. For the price I can't beleive they sold this quality... I go to this store every other day for various items. Not a Happy Girl.
