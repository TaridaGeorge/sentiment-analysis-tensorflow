it's my day to whine....DO NOT go to NextCare Urgent Care off Tatum Blvd. Took my 11 year old there Saturday morning at 9:00am. They wanted to take a blood sample to send off. Their 2 employees were inept...kept poking her and "couldn't find a vein". Had to leave there and take her to Sonora Quest by Scottsdale Shea. They were awesome and I think we were there for all of 5 minutes total - with check-in time! To cap it all off, NextCare hasn't even called me with results. Had to call them....and of course there's no direct line to reach them! ANNOYED!!!!!  My family and I simply will not be back.
