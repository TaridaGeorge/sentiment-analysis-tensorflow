Literally everything about our meal was awful. Service was awful ... I ended up re-filling my own soda, obtaining my own condiments, etc. after multiple requests to our server. The salad bar was disgusting, dirty and the fixins looked old, canned and low quality and tasted even worse. Desserts were in a spinning case like you would see at a greasy spoon in the middle of Nebraska and looked like a 5-year-old's cooking project. Chicken was dry, ribs were dry, everything was dry and tasteless. And, no alcohol. Not even beer! The bill was dirt cheap, so the damage was minimal, but still don't bother! There are plenty of other restaurants, including Taco Bell, that are far better in the vicinity.
