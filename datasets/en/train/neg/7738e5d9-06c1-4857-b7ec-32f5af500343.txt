Found this place due to Groupon.  Got brazilian area treated, and was seeing success, but my laser tech who is super friendly does the treatment so fast, she skips over huge areas, and that is very obvious at the end of my package.  Areas of hair loss are super patchy, and if my tech had been consistent with laser pulses, the treatment would have been a success.  If you are thinking about using them, I can't help but think that they give discount treatment to discount customers- especially in large areas where you can't see the treatment.  I have one treatment left, and I'm going to say something to her about it.  I had canceled an appointment over the phone (they require 24 hours notice) and they claimed they never got my message, and took away one of my pre-paid appointments.
