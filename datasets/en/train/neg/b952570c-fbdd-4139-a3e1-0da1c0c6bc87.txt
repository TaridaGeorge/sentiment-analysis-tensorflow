It looked good and o read good reviews on the place. We showed up at 1030 am on a thrs morning for breakfast. Unfortunately I can't tell you how the food was, other than the complimentary pickles that they brought with our water when we first sat down. 

We waited for over 15 min while several servers passed us by without speaking. We never got spoken to orthat served and afterleft 20 min wewhile finally we got up and left.
