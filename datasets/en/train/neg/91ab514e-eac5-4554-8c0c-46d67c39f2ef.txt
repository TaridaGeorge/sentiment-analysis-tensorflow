I was visiting AZ from California yesterday and a colleague recommended this sushi place.  It was terrible.  The service was slow. I even told our waiter we were in a hurry and we still waited 40 minutes for one of the rolls only to find out the chef dropped the roll and had to remake it.  Would not recommend.
