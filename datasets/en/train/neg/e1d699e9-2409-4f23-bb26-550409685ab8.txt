What a disaster.  For an organic restaurant the staff had no clue...couldn't even answer simple questions about the ingredients.  I have never rejected a bottle of wine untile the waitress tried to serve us a corked bottle of wine...she seemed suprised that we would not accept the bottle...

If you want to eat in a real locally sourced/organic restaurant try Quiessence.
