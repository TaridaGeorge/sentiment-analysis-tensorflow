First and last time to this Pizza place!  Decided to eat here because they offered a Groupon (first and last time for that too I think).  The service was terrible (run by teenage girls) and the food was worse.  We ordered the Santa Fe Pizza and a Pear and Gorgonzola salad with chicken.  The Pizza was so greasy we couldn't eat it and when they bought out the salad the chicken was FROZEN, it seems the cook forgot to microwave it prior to dumping it on top of the salad.  Just a complete disappointment all around.
