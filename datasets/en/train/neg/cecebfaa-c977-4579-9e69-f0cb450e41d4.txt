This place was recommended to me so I decided to try it out. BIG mistake. I tried their Jampong soup and it was the WORST Jampong and worst soup I have ever had. The noodles weren't fresh...infact they tasted like they had been frozen for 5yrs too long. Extremely mushy and not edible. The soup was bland and was not proper Jampong soup. I think they mixed a couple sauces together with water and called it Jampong. The seafood and beef were dismal and the shrimp that was in the soup wasn't cleaned properly. Please do us all a favor and take this so called Jampong soup off your menu.
