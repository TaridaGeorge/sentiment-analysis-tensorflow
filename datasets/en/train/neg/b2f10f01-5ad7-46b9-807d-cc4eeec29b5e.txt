I went this Starbucks last night.  The service was awful!!!  I ordered a venti carmel frap.  The guy who made my drink, Kyle was flirting with these 2 girls and took forever with my drink!  Fifteen minutes later after I stood up looking for my drink he was pouring it in a cup and forgot to put carmel on it that he had to take the lid off to do that.  When we got out to sip our drinks there was NO syrup in it.  Straight expresso with ice!  This was bad!!!  I'm glad I live in California I will never have to visit this Starbucks again!!!
