This place was hot, crowded, and gate changes were announced constantly. It seemed like everyone I saw was rushing off to some new gate other than the one they'd original been told. It made for a chaotic and cranky crowd. Given that I had a tight connection and a gate change myself, I can't say as I blamed them. The flight itself wasn't bad, but this gate has been terrible the last couple times I was there.
