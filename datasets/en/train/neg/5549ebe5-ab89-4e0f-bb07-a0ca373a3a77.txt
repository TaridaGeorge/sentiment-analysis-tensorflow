I have eaten in Thai restaurants all over the US due to my job.  This rates among the worst I have had.  Not sure where to start.  The vegetable soup tastes like it was made with bullion, the papaya salad was so salty we could not eat it and the pad thai was just weird and not at all flavored like anything I have ever had at a Thai restaurant.  Service -prompt at first but once the food was delivered we were forgotten.  The door was open at our table on a very "cold Phoenix day" and we closed it.  A server came along and opened it, I explained we closed it because it was cold and he continued to prop it open and not say a word. . . . there are much better Thai restaurants in Phoenix.
