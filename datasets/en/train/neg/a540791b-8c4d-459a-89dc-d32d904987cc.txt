Omg. MOLD, mold everywhere!!!! 

I bought two potato filled pastry's we get 3/4 through eating them and my boyfriend goes "Is that mold" we then pick the pastry shell apart and the entire thing is filled with thick black mold. This was hours after they were purchased! 

In about an hour we were both feeling sick, I threw up which was terrible. I'm posting a picture of the nasty moldy food we got. I'm shocked. I eat out everyday and have NEVER EVER had an experience like this. 

I ordered Borsch off the menu as well, and they were out so he just opened a can they had on the shelf and added tap water (for $8.95) I have to say one word...

HORRIFIED!
