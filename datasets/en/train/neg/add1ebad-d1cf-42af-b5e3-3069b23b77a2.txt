I've been in this salon several times over the past couple of years.  If it weren't for a good friend stylist who worked there I'd never have given it a chance. But over all the staff members there and the manager for that matter are as rude,  pretentious and second rate as they come. My stylist is worth every penny but  the Salon is way pricey for it's local.  If it's the Aveda products your after (You have good taste) you''d be doing yourself a favor by driving the extra two miles  to Salon Tru or Scottsdale Fashion  Square.
