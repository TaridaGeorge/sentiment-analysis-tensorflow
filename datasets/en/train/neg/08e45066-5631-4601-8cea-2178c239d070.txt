I could have massaged myself better with one hand. The decor is not inviting, really plain and clinical feeling, I prefer a plushy and comfy warm feeling atmosphere. The therapist did not use any pressure and did the same stroke up and down my entire body even though I requested Deep Tissue. Then they try and sell you a package which is bullshit. I would not waste my time at this place.
