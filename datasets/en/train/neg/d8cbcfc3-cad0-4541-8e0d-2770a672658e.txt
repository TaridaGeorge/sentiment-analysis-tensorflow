Last night my fella and I were in the area eatin' some YC's and picking up some household junk at Target.  Afterwards we decided to go next door to the GameStop.

This store is really horrible!  The moment we stepped in the door we were leeched onto by the two guys working there.  These dudes were trying so hard to make a sale and it got me annoyed quickly.   They kept following us around, recommending games they hadn't even tried for themselves... just pulling random crap from the shelves.

All Gamestop's new games are marked full retail price, and that makes them $5-10 more than games sold at Target or Best Buy (in the same plaza).  The moral of the story is, if you need a new game, don't go here.
