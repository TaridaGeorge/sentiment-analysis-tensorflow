First tried Mimi's when we first started coming to Scottsdale about 6 years ago.  It was always a "go to" place where we could get good food at a decent price.  Don't know what's happened but we've been to 3 different locations this trip and the food has really gone downhill.  Sauces are gummy and cooked to death with too much flour/cornstarch.  Had the crab cake appetizers most recently and neither crab or cake belong in the description.  The crab was nonexistent and they were the size of a  3 inch pancake.  The other annoying thing is that the servers now try to push whatever special is going in like the wine thing or the "add a soup or salad" thing.  So sorry we won't be going to any Mimi's anytime soon.
