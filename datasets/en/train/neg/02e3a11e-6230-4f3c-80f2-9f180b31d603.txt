I went there today with a group of friends.  I ordered the chicken breast panini combo that came with the mushroom portobello soup....the soup was very good! And so was the very first bite of my sandwich......that is until I found that there were not one....but two hairs in my sandwich!!!  Ok..so there's a hair...I go tell the guys ...they tell me they will make another...and it was good so ok I will wait...but after about 20min..still no sandwich...I go ask and he says I have to wait cus there are a ton of orders ahead of me...  I figured since there was a hair in my food they would want to make it up to me but noo..  So it was a bad experience for me!!!!!
