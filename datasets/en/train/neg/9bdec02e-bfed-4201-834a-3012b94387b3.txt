Attended a concert at GCU Arena in Dec 2011.  Terrible parking access - getting in was no problem, but getting out was an absolute mess.  Not nearly enough exits to empty the lot in a reasonable amount of time, nobody directing traffic either on campus or to exit onto the street.  Very annoying and dangerous.  Terrible seating - the seats are TINY TINY TINY.  I'm a little taller than average and couldn't fit in the seat with people seated around me - had to go find an empty seat near the back without anyone in the surrounding seats.  Once was enough, I won't be going back.
