Went here for breakfast early on a Saturday, about 1 hour after opening. The tables were dirty and sticky, and the bathrooms were out of toilet paper and littered with garbage, which makes me suspect no one cleaned the bathroom and wiped down tables the night before. Ordered a scramble, which came to us lukewarm. Substituted fresh fruit for potatoes. The fruit was wilted and bland, and the juice in the fruit bowl was a dirty brown. Ew... The bread was the best part of the meal, but it wasn't even toasted.  This was one of the worst breakfast experiences I've had in some time.  The only redeeming quality of the meal was the friendly service.
