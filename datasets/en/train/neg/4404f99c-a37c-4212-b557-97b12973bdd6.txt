where do i start well first off we had reservations and when we showed up the hostess wanted to make sure that we were out by 8 since they had live music and i guess they weren't much of a fan at the idea of kids being there. 
i decided to order the spaghetti with sweet italian sausage or so i thought. the sausage was so over cooked it looked almost like slim jim beef sticks in my pasta. the wine selection was very lacking i decided to get their most expensive bottle of wine which came in at 21 dollars and tasted watered down.
