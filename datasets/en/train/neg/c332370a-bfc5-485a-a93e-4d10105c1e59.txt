The decor is cool. I believe it's in the same location as The Gelato Spot. I say this since the main menu is focused on the sugary treat. But, that's not why I went in. I went in for iced coffee. YUCK. When I ordered an iced coffee, the cashier should have told me they didn't make 'em. Instead, he gave me hot coffee and a cup of ice. What? Uhm, that's not what I meant, bozo. Would I really want a hot coffee on an early June day? I don't think so, unless I'm just absolutely looney. I hear that's a possibility. In any case, the watered down coffee was gross. 

That in and of itself is enough reason for me to grumble and moan about this place. It's doesn't deserve a second chance.
