One pizza pp left all the twenty somethings in our group still hungry. Scant ingredients, mediocre crust.  Stingy with the cheese.  
Wedge salad was deplorable, runny dressing over a sagging chunk of iceberg, a few bacon bits.
Better pizza at Barros, Tommy's...even Costco. CPK pizza needs to be heavier/hartier, especially in light of the cost, around $13.
