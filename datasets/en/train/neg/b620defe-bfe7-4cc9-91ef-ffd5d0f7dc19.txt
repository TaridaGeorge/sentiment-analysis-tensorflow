Just recently had my car washed here.  I was very disappointed - the car wash was poor, car was water spotted, and still dirty. I went home and tried to wipe down the car to fix water spots, dirt spots etc - I was amazed at how much dirt was still on the car andf what a poor job was done. Worst I have ever seen. Really just a waste of time and money.
