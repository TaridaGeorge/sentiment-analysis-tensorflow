I do a lot of costume work on cars and boats and mainly shopped at this establishment because it was on the way home. Almost every time I purchased something on sale it never rang up correctly at the front desk. And the only reason I know this is because I would only buy something that was on sale. Their prices are extremely inflated! It was not surprising to pay 5x as much for an item. I have no clue how this place is still in business. Maybe there are enough people that don't care about value to keep this place going.
