Drove by this place several times and decided to finally stop by to check it out one afternoon.   It was by far the worst pho I've EVER had!  We couldn't even finish our lunch and went next door and grabbed some burritos.  The soup had no flavor and had about 2 pieces meat in my bowl.  So, most likely will not go back unless the owner is changed.
