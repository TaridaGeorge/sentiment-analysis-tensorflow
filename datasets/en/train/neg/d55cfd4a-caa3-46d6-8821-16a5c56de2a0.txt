I ate here for the first....... And last time tonight. I ordered the lasagna and it came out barely warm. There was nothing too it at all. For twelve bucks I was expecting more. The sauce tasted like chef boyardee. It didn't even come with garlic bread. Maybe their pizza is better.  I would save your money if I were you!
