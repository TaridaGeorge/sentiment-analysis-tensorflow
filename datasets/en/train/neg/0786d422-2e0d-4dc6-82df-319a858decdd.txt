I been waiting for this place to open for 4 months, and I am severely disappointed. The service was terrible, we waited 45 minutes and never got our food, but noticed people who ordered the same thing get theirs(sounds like the order process needs some work)
 
I asked for a refund and the manager didn't apologize and didn't say anything, but to add insult to injury the manager charged us for the drinks!!!!(sounds like the manager needs to learn some customer service 101)
 
On the way out I overheard people talking that they been waiting 15 minutes for 1/2 a sandwich and some people got the wrong order but didn't complain because they been waiting long as well and were just hungry. Please Mind you that this place wasn't that busy.
 
I will never eat here again.
