I agree with the the past review of this place. Went to pick up my shirts and they weren't all there. I was told the tags fell off my shirts and they couldn't find them.....for 3 days!. I called twice a day for 3 days and every time I called back they said they would have them for me later on in the day only for me to call back and not only not have them, but no one knew what the situation was and I had to explain it every time. Finally on the third day I spoke to a girl who seemed at least half way intelligent and said they had found my shirts and I could come pick them up. 

I never received an apology not once. Also they charged me for the cleaning after all this! Unbelievable! Do not take your clothes here!
