So I go into Basha's to grab a couple of coffees before my daughter's soccer game one Saturday morning. First of all, I think it is extremely tacky to be handed a cup and told to "walk over to the ice machine and fill the cup up with ice". Excuse me?? I didn't think ordering coffee was a team-building effort. So, after a brief pause of disbelief, I took the cup and walked over to the soda machine (which was filthy, by the way) and got ice. The woman put so much cream into the iced coffee that it was literally white. 

On to my cafe mocha. Not hot enough and it tasted like it was regurgitated. The credit card swiper that I used was also filthy. It had crumbs on the the sticky and stained screen. I left feeling pissed, unsatisfied & longing for Starbucks. Never again.
