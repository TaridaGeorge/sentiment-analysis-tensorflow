The organization is grand with a ton of selection but the employees could care less about costumer service. 

It is very amazing with the amount of unemployed people in the city they have to hire the most incompetent individuals.... 

I'm not going to be ignorant and say they are ALL bad, but a few in the bunch seem to make it difficult to be a repeat costumer. 

Try talking to a manager at this location and you will be routed around the store till you finally get some one that states "the manager is off till next week." 

i will stay a website purchaser until they change their policy at this location and hire individuals with a better standard
