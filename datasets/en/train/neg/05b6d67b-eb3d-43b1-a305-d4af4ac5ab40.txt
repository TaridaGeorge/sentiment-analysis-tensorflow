This comment is directed to the gentleman that works in your Phoenix Colonnade location in the Furniture section. (The really short 80's looking guy)..

Why in the world would be so condescending to customers and butt in on their conversation? Why did you feel the need to critisize their description of a chair they were looking at?

Because of your rude and flippant behavior, and obvious lack of customer service skills you lost an extremely large sale and any future business my wife and I would ever give you. That unfortunately includes the clothing side. we refuse to give business to people that treat customers so disrespectfully !
