ok, I will not go this place ever again, reason #1 The beans are very very very greasy, you can see all the oil they use on top of the beans it looks disgusting #2 very expensive, the chile relleno plate is $9.XX almost $10 really?? #3 my order was by phone and they told me ten minutes and when I got there I waited 15 more minutes. #4 the chile relleno was ok and again it was very greasy. I don't think I want to go to this place ever again, If you like very greasy food this is the place for you.
