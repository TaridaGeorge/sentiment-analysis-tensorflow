The only time this Walmart is acceptable is if it's late at night. Other than that, it's full of nothing but welfare moms with screaming brats complaining about what they can and can't use their food stamps on. Don't bother. Go to Target instead; it's cleaner and not so ghetto. On the upshot, most of the cashiers are really nice; it's the class of people that make it crappy.
