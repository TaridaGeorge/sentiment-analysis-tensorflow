My problem is not with the pet supplies or the quality food they carry, it was with the GROOMER.  My golden was brought in for a bath and brush and came home with CLIPPER BURN and OPEN SORES on his behind.  He was matted there from swimming in the pool and I consented to shaving his hindquarters shaved.  When I explained how I felt when I saw my dog and his obvious discomfort with the groomer there was no empathy, no apology and no culpability. She didn't even put anything on the affected areas to soothe his discomfort before she sent him home.  She will get no return business from me and no referrals EVER.   The owner did however refund my money when I asked for a refund.  She did apologize for the incident.
