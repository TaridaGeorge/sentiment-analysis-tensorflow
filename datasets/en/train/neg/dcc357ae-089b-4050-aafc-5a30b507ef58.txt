I joined but changed my mind the next day. The contract said I could cancel within 3 days if I mailed a certified, return receipt letter to the corporate offices. I did so. I also went by the club and gave them a letter stating I wanted to cancel. The initialed it and gave me a copy.  A month later I went to ask about my refund. They told me it would take "up to" 90 days. It's now been 90 days and I still haven't received it.

It's "buyer beware" on this one, folks.
