I'm updating my review from the last time, someone who give this place a 5 stars is crazy. There is a better buffet by Spectrum Mall on Bethany Home and 15th Ave called Mandarin Buffet. For the price you pay, Hibachi Grill and Supreme Buffet has an especially underwhelming selection of food. Not only that, the food is probably some of the worse I've had at a chinese buffet. It's not even worth wasting your daily caloric or sodium intake to try this food. Please do yourself a huge favor and don't waste your money on this place. I'm sorry to say that I did.
