I wish I had known this was closed as well. We camped out near here and thought would be a great photo opportunity- Alas, the gates were closed, the signs were hung- and the fence was BARBED.  First time I had seriously considered trespassing- it looked like such a great spot for old timey photos, was tough to resist!
