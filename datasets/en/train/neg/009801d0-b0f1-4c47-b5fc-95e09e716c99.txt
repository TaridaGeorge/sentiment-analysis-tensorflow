One word..."Ewww".... It seems typical that americans think garbage is authentic italian cuisine .... just sad.....Italian is truly amazing, when done right, and clearly at first bite, this place doesn't....Anyone who is "truly" italian, or has traveled there abroad, would Never recommend this place (let alone give it 4 stars).... bc it would be like recommending "Taco bell" as great or authentic mexican....However, the staff was extremely friendly, and the atmosphere was okay.... so i will give 1 star
