I found this company on Yelp and because of the high scores contacted them to get a bid on landscaping my back yard.  We had a meeting scheduled for 8 Monday morning and the owner, Dave never showed or called.  He finally called me back after I had left him several messages.  He met me the next day and said he'd send me a quote by the end of the week.  I called and left him a message, but have never heard back from him.  It's been almost 3 weeks.  Horrible customer service.  Be forwarned!!!
