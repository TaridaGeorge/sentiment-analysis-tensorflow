FYI, this place is membership only as I was so rudely told upon entering the store. 

I have driven past this store numerous times and today my husband and I attempted to check it out. 

We walked in and behind me I hear the yells of "hey, hey!" I turn around and the girl at the counter asks "do you have a membership?"
"No, I didn't know I needed one." I replied.
"This store is not open to the public, ok? Sorry." 

The better thing to say would have been to ask if I would like to open a membership and not be so rude and turn away business.

Here's a store I will not be giving my business to.
