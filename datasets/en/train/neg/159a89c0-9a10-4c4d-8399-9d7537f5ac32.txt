I am trying my best to support the Post office, but they make it difficult. I took the day off as I had several deliveries today requiring signatures. The FE delivery showed up as expected. I checked my mailbox at 1 PM and again at 3 PM. 
Sure enough the Postman leaves a 'Sorry We Missed You' card in my box. My doorbell worked for FE, I checked it again and I did NOT leave the house. 

I know they are buried, but this kind of service only gives them a worse reputation. I will choose other carriers if I can.

ADD: To his credit, a manager did find my package at the branch the same day and called me so I was able to pick it up that day and not wait until the next day. I still had to drive there, but at least I got it.
