Ugh, this place needs new management. There is no hostess, yet it's open seating. Nobody tells you that and you find yourself wandering around wondering what you are supposed to do. 

Service is slow. The manager was not very polite when we had a problem with our food. In fact, he kind of gave us an attitude. 

We saw people walking out left and right because they didn't get services, and this was in the middle of the week. It was supposed to be "kids eat free night". We didn't specifically go there for this, but thought it was a bonus. They didn't take the kids meals off our bill. We were there so long that we just paid and left without complaining. 

The food was nothing to cheer about. This is probably at the very bottom of our list of places to eat when the world ends.
