UA Theaters have had it! Why do they keep this place open? Its run down, out of date and well, architecturally ugly! Oh yeah, this is the place that looks just like Space Mountain at Disneyland.. though the only thrill you'll get from here is when they finally bulldoze it down! 

They really should put a Harkin's there where there outta be one!
