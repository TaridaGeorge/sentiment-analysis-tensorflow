If I could give this place zero stars I would.  Maintenance has no clue what they are doing.  If you can even get them to show up.  The manager doesn't care what happens and is a word I cannot say on here. If she actually has to leave her office she acts like it will kill her. Plan on having the cops there because they rent to anyone. Including but not limited to druggies, and alcoholics.  The apartment flooded, and they put new floors over the wet old ones.  Way to not know what your doing.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
