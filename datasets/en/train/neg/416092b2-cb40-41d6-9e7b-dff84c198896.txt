My husband and I went to try out this new establishment which just opened in our area.  We both ordered the steak burgers.  Although the atmosphere was nice and clean and the staff friendly, the food was not so great.   The meat was flavorless and had no substance.  

We paid over $25.00 for two burgers, one order of fries and two sodas ($2.50 each). 

Overall:  Overprices, wouldn't  recommend it and won't go back.
