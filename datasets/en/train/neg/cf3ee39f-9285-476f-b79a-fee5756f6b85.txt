Unfortunately there is nothing special about this place. My husband got the french dip and myself the mushroom panini. Mine was rather disappointing, the mushrooms were minced so tiny and the flavor was semi reminiscent of canned cream of mushroom soup....on a sandwich. I hate leaving bad reviews but it wouldn't help anyone if i lied, sorry.
