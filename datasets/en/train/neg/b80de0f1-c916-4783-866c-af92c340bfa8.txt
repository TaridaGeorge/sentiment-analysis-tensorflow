Have eaten here a couple of times and have been fairly pleased.  Ate here Saturday November 3rd.  Service okay, but food was cold.  Later, after no other food, stomach problems and out it came.  My impression is that they are so busy they cut corners, with the food and probably with the prep in the kitchen.
