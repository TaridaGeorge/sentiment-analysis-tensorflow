This was the 2nd time I was here because I wanted to give it another chance but it was so bad that I had to toss it out. Either the ice cream or the whipped cream on the OREO/Brownie Sundae was sour and I could not eat it and the brownie was hard and I did not get any Oreo's on it. When I called the manger to ask about it she got all pissed off because she said the brownies were fresh and said she would make me another one but I told her I was not wanting another one I wanted my money back and she told me to call the corporate office and get it from them...Really is this the kind of person they want as a manger.  Don't go it's no good
