Since they have a drive-thru and I was in a hurry, we went to this pharmacy again. The pharmacist screwed up on a prescription that could have done some serious damage and didn't even offer to counsel while I was at the window. I had to ask and then he just asked me to tell him what it said on the bag so he could tell me what to avoid etc. We did use 3 doses on our child before realizing the mistake. I will not be using this pharmacy again.
