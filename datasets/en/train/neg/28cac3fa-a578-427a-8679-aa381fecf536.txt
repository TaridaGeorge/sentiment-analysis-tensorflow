Used to eat at one of about 4 of this chain's restaurants in Houston all the time, but I can say hands down that this is the filthiest one I ever ate at.  I grabbed a spoon, happened to look down at it (oh, gawd..how I wish I hadn't) and it still had scum marks from food on it.  So, I checked out all the spoons (about 15 were there) and they all were that way...mmmmmm...doesn't that make you just want to dive in here?
It's filthy, the food isn't all that good and not worth even their cheap $6 as a Sr.
To hell with it!  I'm going to some place I know is clean like Cheesecake Factory next time.
Two words:  never again.  (I'll probably have nightmares tonight over dancing dirty spoons now, too...brrrrr...shudder!).
