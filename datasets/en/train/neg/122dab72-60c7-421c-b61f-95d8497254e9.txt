I decided to try Wonderful Wanda's after Keegan's redid their breakfast menu and changed it for the worse. My first impression was that the dining room was extremely small and crowded. I then faced an even more unpleasant surprise when I had to go to the bathroom and realized that I would have to walk through the middle of the kitchen to get to it. The bathroom was about the size of a closet and pretty dirty. The service and the food did not do anything to improve my opinion of the restaurant. The service was slow and disorganized-- I watched my food sit on the counter for a good five minutes before the waitress brought it over, and when she finally did, it was barely warm anymore. The food itself was pretty mediocre. I will not be back again.
