The owner Christian Clayton is three business days behind (5 total days) as of 6/14 and counting on paying the bulk of his employees. He owes me personally, close to 100 hours. We will be going downtown to the labor department to file a wage claim tomorrow. This post is to let the general public know what kind of business you will be supporting in September.  Please call his other business Sucker Punch Sally's Old School Chopper Spot at 480-778-9500 to voice any dismay or concern for average people who are being kicked out on the street.
