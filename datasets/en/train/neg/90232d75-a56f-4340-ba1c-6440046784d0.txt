I didn't make this reservation, wasn't expecting a luxury hotel, but definitely expected a lot more. Room was not ready upon arrival. After checking in and going to the room-someone was in the room! They gave me a key to someone's room!! Room number two wasn't made up or cleaned. Keys were disabled multiple times though they were kept separate from electronic devices or other cards. There were cigarette burns throughout the room. What an awful place. Avoid at all costs.
