Love to leave this place a better review since I dropped $70 here but I can't. It took 20 mins just to get out drinks!

This place seems like it's not managed at all and run by teenagers. The tables on both sides if us were complaining as well. 

The Sushi rolls were decent, the appetizers we ordered were way too greasy and arrived after our food was already finished. We were literally ready to leave.

Bad service will kill this place eventually.
