Is this full service or not? The entire little room of maybe ten tables are clearly viewable by the 3 ladies behind the counter, yet many of us are walking up to get our own refills and pay the check.  They must really be struggling because it must have been in the low 80's in the dining area, and they actually have handwritten lunch & happy hour menus that were xeroxed.

I dined well after the lunch hour and it looks like my 2 slice special was from whichever pie was made awhile ago.  Pizza was just ok, mainly for that reason.  

Only beer available on tap is Budweiser products.  No craft beer.  

Wow just noticed similarity of experience to my last visit a year ago.  Maybe I should give up trying.
