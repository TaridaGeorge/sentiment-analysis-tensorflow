Sushi Eye started out friendly where one could get to know the management and get a sense of family, however it has taken a severe downturn for the worst. I would not recommend this business for my friends, family, or even people I was not fond of. There are numerous other Sushi establishments where you can take your business and get the treatment you deserve with your hard earned money.

I have to say that I never thought I would give a restaurant one star unless I was so unimpressed or insulted by the eatery that I have to just alert others.
