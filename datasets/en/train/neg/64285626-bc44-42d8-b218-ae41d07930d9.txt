If you like extremely hot hotel rooms, bad customer service, and being charged twice for a stay, then this is the hotel for you. The room literally was 77 degrees when I arrived, and 82 degrees when I awoke. I had the AC set to 60...the room was so hot, I was supposed to stay two days, but checked out early because of how miserable my sleep was. Do you think they only charged me for one night, nope, still got charged for two. When I called to get this rectified, they told me it would take a while for somebody to get back to me in order to fix the situation and put me right into somebody's voice mail...the reality is, I shouldn't have even been charged for one night because I wasn't able to sleep in this nightmare hotel.
