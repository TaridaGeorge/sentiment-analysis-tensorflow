I am doing a favor to this place by giving them one star. Horrible service! You feel rushed the whole time. All the workers have an attitude problem. THEY DONT CARRY SPINACH, PEPPERJACK CHEESE OR AVOCADO! WTF!? And the jerks would not even put my bacon in the toaster to make it crispy yet it's ok to put my bacon in there if my whole sandwich is being toasted?? Screw this place... Avoid it at ALL costs.

They are marked expensive because their food sucks ass for one and their service puts the icing on the cake. They should pay me to walk in.
