Take your money elsewhere, unless you've got kids.  I really try to like this place.  A family member signed me up for the discount card, so I've been going more often, but I just don't love it.  It's simply ok, but the prices are outrageous.  And the sounds and animatronics are a huge distraction from the so-so food.  The cocktails are alright, but, again, the price is not right.  The ony thing fun about the place for an adult is the gift shop and the light-up cocktail glasses (which cost extra.)  I've seen a lot of happy families in here though, so I bet it's better if you have little ones to bring along.
