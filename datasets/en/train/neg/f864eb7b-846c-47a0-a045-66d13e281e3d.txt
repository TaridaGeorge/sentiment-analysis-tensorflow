Watch out for this place.. Very expensive products which can be purchased at places like Sears for half price or even less... Owner of the store likes to pile on multiple items and nothing is marked with prices.. By the time you pick up 2 or 3 items and get to the cash register, you've spent over $100.. Just ask him for prices before you buy... Common Sense.
