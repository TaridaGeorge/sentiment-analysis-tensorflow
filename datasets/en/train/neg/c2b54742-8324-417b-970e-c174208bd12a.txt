After reading the reviews we decided to take the family here. The mine tour was over priced and horribly boring and a waste of time. The mine is fake and the tour guide was awefull. The Saloon would have been decient if the bartender didnt talk to me, my wife and  my children 7 and 10 yrs old about politics and religion - how Muslims are bad - this was out of the blue. This place is horribly boring for anyone any age. You would think this fake place the people could get in character and play a part in the  atmosphere - cowboys..miners. Instead the people were sad and the place was sad. Do not go here unless you want to be bored out of your mind.
