So I have never written for yelp but I wanted to warn about the experience.  After spending over 500$ on dinner I cant think of a worse way to spend the money. 

The Atmosphere lovely but the service, wine pairing and farmers feast felt like a scam.  For 45/person for wine pairings I would have expected fabulous picks (not a rose/syrah blend that tasted at best like bad sangria... more like hawaiian punch) and more than a thimbleful in each flight.  The Beef shoulder was overcooked and the spinach greens tasted like canned greens but with salt.  I will spare you the rest of the details but I have eaten at more than a few "high end" restaurants in my day and this one take first place at the worst.
