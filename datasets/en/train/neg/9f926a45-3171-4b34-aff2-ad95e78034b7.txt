Took my 9 year old daughter there for lunch yesterday May 20, and the food was absolute garbage, I ordered half a chicken ceaser salad for 8 bucks, it was the size of a side salad, and had 6 pieces of thin sliced chicken in it each the size of a quarter.  My daughter and I jokingly put all of the chicken on a single fork.  This place sucks, and is a total ripoff the way they scam you out of normal portions now.  Too bad the old GM Sherri isn't still working there, she was cool and didn't go for this BS.  Applebees on Chandler, you can lick my butthole.
