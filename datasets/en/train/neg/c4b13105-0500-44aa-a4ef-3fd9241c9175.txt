Just the thought of this places makes nauseated. I would give no stars if I could. The tandoori chicken on the buffet tastes like the smell of feces. The chicken curry uses cheap cuts of meats. There was so much bone and cartlidge. For a good Indian buffet I would check out Indian Palace next to I17 and Bell.  That place is soooo much better.
