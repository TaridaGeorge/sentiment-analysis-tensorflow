The flight to was delayed at first for 40 minutes, then an hour and a half due to maintenance... whatever.  The return flight - was canceled, please wait in that line to find another flight.  This other line had one harried ticketing agent that obviously didn't have the right answers for the passengers because the line wasn't moving.  Meanwhile there were 4 baggage agents waiting to check in all the people who's flights were canceled - oh, next flight home was more than 6 hours later.  Oh, the cancellation was due to local weather - interesting that no other airline was canceling flights.   US Airways mission statement  "To provide best class poor service without care because in todays' economy everyone need to save a buck".

NEVER AGAIN!
