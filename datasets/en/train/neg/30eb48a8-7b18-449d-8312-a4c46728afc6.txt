I had high hopes for this place but my recent experience was terrible.  I brought in a pair of shoes for a cleaning and shine.  As an afterthought I asked to have them re-heeled as well.  I picked up the shoes and the heels were done but the shoes were filthy.  They had a black substance all over them that resembled haphazard polish.  The owner said he had buffed them but when I showed them the substance he went in back, rubbed it off, and then handed the filthy shoes back to me.  There are much better places to take your shoes if you care about the quality.
