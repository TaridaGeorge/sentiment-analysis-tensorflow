I am new to the area and wanted to schedule an appointment to interview the doctor as I'm pregant with our second child, and wished to have a pediatrician available should we need to schedule an impromptu appointment for my daughter...now that flu season is approaching.

The office lady could not understand why this was a valid request, and literally pushed back on my request 4 times. Each time I explained my case to her. She finally actually told me she could not understand why I needed to see the doctor and "waste an appointment" on an interview. Yuck. 

I've read how wonderful the doctors for this office were, but if you can't get past horrible office staff then it's not worth it.
