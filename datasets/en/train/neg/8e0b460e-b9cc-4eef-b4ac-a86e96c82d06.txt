Went to this joint for a cold Tihaar, was blown away by the jackwagons that hang out here. Never in my life have I seen a more wretched hive of scum and villainy (for real). 
Employees were pushy, patrons were either criminals or d-bags bragging about their whips (don't care how many parsecks you made the Kessel Run in, bro), and the band that was playing must have been smoking deathsticks because they just looped their same cover song over and over again. 
Save your credits. This place is whack.
