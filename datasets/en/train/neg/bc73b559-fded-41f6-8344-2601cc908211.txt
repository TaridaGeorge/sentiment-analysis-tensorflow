Okay, I am now climbing on the over-priced bandwagon and I think Teavana's white teas lack body, texture, creaminess??  As I have shifted to white tea, Teavana's pricing is much too high compared to Harney & Son's teas.  I was shocked that I paid 1/3rd of Teavana's 2 oz pricing to buy a hot tea in order to sample their Lavendar blend.  $5 bucks for a cup of tea?!??  Are you kidding me?  I could swallow 1/5th of the 2 oz price.

So I am done w/ Teavana.  I really like the Harney's mutan white peach and mutan white and am waiting for their Jasmine Pearls and White Earl Grey. I am getting away w/ using my Harney white tea satchets for 3 cup brews.  Not bad.  That drives their price even further down.
