Very unprofessional! I bought a deal off LivingSocial; wanting to get a cleaning service for awhile, I thought it would be a great way to find a cleaning service I liked... this is not the one I will be going with! The lady canceled on my several times and didn't show up for times she reschedule my cleaning service for. I finally had to call the company and leave a message complaining about the service I was, or rather, wasn't receiving. When the owner called me back he was full of excuses and was obviously in over his head. The cleaning people are nice, but unreliable and the owner doesn't seem to care. He is obviously over booking his staff and not taking responsibility to ensure costumer satisfaction.
