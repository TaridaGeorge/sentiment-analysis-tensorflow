I too got the heavy handed sales pitch for services that weren't needed, so blatant that I'd say that it bordered on fraud.  If I hadn't read my owner's manual - I might have fallen for their tactics.

But that's not the worst part - they didn't tighten something and I left a trail of oil everywhere I went.   Now my undercarriage & garage floor need to be cleaned.  All of this for more than the dealer would charge!
