The coffee is great but the service is TERRIBLE! Waited 25 minutes as 4th in line because the barista is chatting to his peeps and going slower than a slug in ice. The counter crew needs to lose the attitude and realize good service is what keeps customers. 
There are other great coffee shops like Lux and Drip in Phoenix. I will not go back to Cartel.
