Ordered a strawberry slush, watermelon slush, cherry slush, and coke slush. Sounds fairly simple, right? Instead, they forgot the watermelon slush and brought out a piña colada slush instead of the coke slush. The girl at the drive-thru was rude when we pointed out the obvious mistake with the piña colada slush and claimed my white colored slush was "definitely" coke. I don't think so. We pulled ahead to wait for the watermelon slush and received a cherry slush. Ugh. When I asked to have my coke slush corrected, the car hop ignored me and hurried away. What kind of customer service is this? Won't be going there again.
