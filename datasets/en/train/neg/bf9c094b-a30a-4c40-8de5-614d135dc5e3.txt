Poor experience over the course of 3 visits.  Staff is friendly however they do not seem to be focused exclusively on customer service, as their personal conversations amongst each other appear to take priority.  Orders take much too long to arrive, wings are soft and void of any crisp,and  food is  over priced and lacks a developed value.  On a positive note, the GM offered to make an attempt to remedy the situation which I have yet to take him up on.
