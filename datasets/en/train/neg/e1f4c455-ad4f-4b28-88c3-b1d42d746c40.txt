We scheduled them for an in-home measurement and their installer showed up on-time and was very friendly, and their prices were competitive.

So why the negative review?  I told the installer, as I told the sales rep when I scheduled the appointment, that we were taking multiple bids.  Not ten minutes after he left I got a call from one of their sales reps, telling me that's not how they do business, and to take their offer off the table.

Gladly.

If you have time to waste, by all means give these guys a shot.
