"Lowering Cane's expectations" should be the name.

They have just set the bar low on food quality and taste.  No seasoning at all in the breading of the chicken fingers and the fries seem like they came straight from your grocer's freezer.

Must not have thought much of their dog if this is their tribute to him.  Just drove away disappointed.  Want my junk food to taste good if I'm going to splurge with this type of caloric intake.

Only positive was stellar Drive-Thru service and the place seemed pretty clean.

Don't waste your time.
