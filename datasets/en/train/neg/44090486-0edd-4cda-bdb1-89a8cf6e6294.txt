We went here a few weeks ago and I was less than impressed.  I'm not a huge fan of sweets, but frozen yogurt is my weakness.  I tried EVERY flavor trying to find one that was to my liking and they ALL had an awful aftertaste.  I have never ever ever ever been in a froyo place where i couldn't find SOMETHING that i liked.  Also, the girl behind the counter didn't seem to want to be there.  I know it's not the greatest job in the world, but a smile would have been nice.
