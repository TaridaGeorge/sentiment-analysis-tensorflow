Just walked in here all excited to get some Irish Nachos and we stood at the blank hostess desk for five minutes while a few waitresses walked around the restaurant, one hiding behind the bar who kept looking at us and not coming over. After a few more minutes and me literally doing some SOS arm-waving action, she came over to us.  By that point we were done, and she didn't seem to care at all. Didn't apologize. Just blank stare and moved on to the next person in line.  I'm all fine with bars with skimpy dressed chicks, but no burger or beer is worth that crappy of service.
