So I think it's absurd to wait four hours and get treated like shit by a snotty, hipper-than-thou "hostess" for the sake of average pizza. So sue me. Even if their pizza was the second coming, I probably still wouldn't go in protest of their rude staff with pseudocelebrity attitudes. Unfortunately, they don't have to care -- thanks to dumbshit Oprah, the masses will continue to come. That's OK -- they can have my place in line.
