The food and the service at this "restaurant" are equally terrible.  The last time I was there, which will BE the last time I ever go there, we waited 10 minutes to order drinks.  We waited even longer to GET our drinks.  This didn't even include ordering food, much less GETTING it.  The waiters/waitresses were always hanging out by the bar, laughing it up and completely ignoring their customers.  
The food is very bland.  The crab legs tasted like they had been sitting in a freezer for a while.  Poor service, terrible food, don't waste your time or money going to this one!
