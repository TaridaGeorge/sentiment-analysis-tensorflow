Too high priced for all the hype.

Soggy fries? No thanks.
Lots of condiments? I like to taste my overpriced $7 "100% fresh beef". Not a bunch of peppers, pickles and mustard.
Fast food? Hardly.
Free Peanuts? Really? I'm pretty sure I paid for them at those prices. In fact, I think they still owe me a pound or two of 'em.

My wallet thanked me for saying, "I wont be back".
