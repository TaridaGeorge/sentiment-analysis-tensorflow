Wish there was a negative star I could rate this pathetic sorry excuse of a burger joint who i still 6 months later, should have given me my money back. I wish I could at least say the service was good, even fair. But sadly no. First they mess up my order by forgetting some toppings I paid extra for. Then I had to ask them for my fries. And that's after a 15 minute wait. And all without so much as an apology. I beg you to not WASTE your money or time in this highly disappointing burger spot
