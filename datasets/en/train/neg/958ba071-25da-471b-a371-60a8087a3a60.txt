Did this place change ownership? I have been here before and don't remember it sucking so bad. 

Like mentioned in other reviews, the salads were completely overdressed with lettuce looking way past its prime And who serves a salad that consists on only lettuce and two tiny bits of tomato? 
Chicken fried steak was completely flavorless as was the thick gravy on top. 

Nothing is worse than making a decision to go completely unhealthy with your meal selection and it tastes like shit. Stuff that is bad for you should at least taste good. I feel like I was robbed!!
