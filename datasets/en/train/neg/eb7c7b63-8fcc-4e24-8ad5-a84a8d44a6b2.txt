Extremely salty carne asada tacos! The meat was inedible it was so salty and I'm a fan of salty foods so that's telling you something. The horchata was bland and watery. Tables were dirty but that wasn't so much of a big deal I guess. Oh not to mention over priced! I spent $22 on a crappy burrito and 3 tacos. Come on! Would not recommend! I don't understand why this chain is so popular. It's NOT worth it.
