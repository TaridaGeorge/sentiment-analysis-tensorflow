Im surprised to see good reviews of this place.   I went here over by usual Thursday night at Sakana and right away I was swindled.  The name is called Crust but my pizza was void of anything resembling that.  It was more like whitebread with school pizza sauce.  I also ordered the spinich dip and that was just a large bowl of melted cheese.  There was a total of 6 tables filled and servce was still terrible.  And we sat at the bar!!  On a positive note the portion sizes were large and the interior was nice.
