So I came here in a rec from everyone, and yes, the food was pretty delicious. What wasn't delicious was the way I was feeling the next day - and most of the week. Yep, good old food poisoning, and this was the likely culprit (only other thing I had eaten to that point was pizza that other colleagues had joined in on). Had egg rolls, green curry with chicken, and a thai tea. 

Sorry, not much more to say than that. Might have been an "off" night for 'em, but I was reeling for the rest of my business trip. Yikes.
