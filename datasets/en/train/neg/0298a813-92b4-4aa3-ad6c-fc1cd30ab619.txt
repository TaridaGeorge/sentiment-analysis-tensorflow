My girlfried had heard from a friend that this place was great and that was exactly like New York pizza.  This pizza is not like any NY pizza that I've ever had and if it were, then NY pizza would not have the good reputation that it does.  The food was awful.  I literally had to force a second piece down my throat even though I was starving.  
The service was great, but no amount of waitstaff attention can make up for the crap coming out of the kitchen.  There are so many better pizza restaurants around that there is no need to upset your stomach at this place.
