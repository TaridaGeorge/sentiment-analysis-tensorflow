I think I'm way too Americanized for this place. 

It's stinky and filthy. There were unsanitary things every which way I looked. There were these buckets full of veggies soaking in a liquid, i really can't think of any other way to describe it. There were tongs just laying on top of this filthy rusty shelf and I guess you were supposed to grab the liquidy items and put them into a bag? (see pics) 

This white girl just couldn't handle it. 

There was some sort of ceiling issue bc there was a lot of drippage. all over their products. see pics. 

But you can get a crap ton of basil for $1.50.
