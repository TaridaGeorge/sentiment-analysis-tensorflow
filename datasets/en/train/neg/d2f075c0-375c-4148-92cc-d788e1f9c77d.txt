My wife is Japanese and I pass this store on my way to work so from time to time either myself or the both of us will stop by to see if by chance they have an item we need there. Let's just say stopping about 15 times to see if they have a specific Japanese item only once did they actually stock what we were looking for. Strangely enough that one time was also the only time that an employee even bothered to say hello or acknowledge our existence at all....
