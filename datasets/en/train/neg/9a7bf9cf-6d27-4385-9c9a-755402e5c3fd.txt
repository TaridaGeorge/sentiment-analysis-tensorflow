I attempted to get my air conditioning serviced here and was quoted 220 bucks just to find out what the problem was. Is it because I am female that this was my quote? Of course, I take my car out of there and go down the street where I was not hustled. The guy behind the counter was rude as well to me. How this guy is employed I do not know. I would avoid this location if you can. Huge disappointment...
