I didn't even end up going here -- cancelled my appt while I was filling out my paperwork that I printed from their website.  BEWARE of hidden fees!  One statement in paperwork says "A charge of $20 will be made for an end-of-year statement for tax purposes."  I've never heard of a dr's office doing this before.  What a ripoff!
