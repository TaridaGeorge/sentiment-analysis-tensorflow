Last summer my wife and I adopted a kitten from Arizona Humane Society.  Everything was fine, we took him for his shots and all looked good.
A couple months ago he started acting sick.  We took him to our normal vet and they put him on some anti-botics.  A few days later he was no better.  I returned to my vet and they x-rayed him and found his chest was filling up with fluid.  Our vet said he had one of the incurable cat diseases and that he had it from birth.  We had to put him to sleep.
I will not get another pet from this place or support them financially because they do a poor job of testing the animals they put up for adoption.  
It's sad enough to loose a pet, but one so young and who we had taken into our hearts still hurts.
