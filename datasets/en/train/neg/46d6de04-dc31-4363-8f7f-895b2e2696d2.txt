I was not impressed with this place at all. The chicken I found to be very greasy and was overcooked. The waffles lacked luster in taste....they were straight bland. The place was packed when I went on a Saturday morning and there was no order anywhere in the restaurant. It took over 30 minutes to get the check after we had finished eating. Then to pay there was a line a mile long at the register and one register was not working properly. Was a late morning mistake to come and try this place out. I would avoid eating here the chicken lacks flavor.
