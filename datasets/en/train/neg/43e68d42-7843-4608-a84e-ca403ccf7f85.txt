I completely agree w/ John D. I am from
Out of town, but I have eaten my fair share of pizza in the west valley over the past 5 yrs & this place "Sucks"!
Horrible food, horrible service. They messed up my ordered & did nothing to fix the problem. Sauce & toppings were not good. Avoid this place at all cost....
