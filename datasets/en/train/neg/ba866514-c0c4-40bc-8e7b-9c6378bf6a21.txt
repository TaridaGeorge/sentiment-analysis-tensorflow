Do NOT stay here.  This hotel was the worst experience I've had in a long time in a hotel.  Mold in the shower, a broken toilet lid, the place was filthy.  Both pillow cases looked like they hadn't been washed in weeks.  The sheet didn't fit the bed.  The place is not maintained well at all, and everything looks old and broken down.  For $149/night, I'd expect they could afford to have fitting sheets, clean and wash the place.  It was the low-light of our trip, and we were extremely disappointed.
