I have been with Progressive for almost 5 years.  I recently canceled a policy due to the selling of a vehicle, and they sent me a bill for $31 for canceling the policy.  They told me that it was a law by Arizona.  I also see several people complaining about them in regards to them not being responsive to claims that are filled.  Fortunately I haven't had to file a claim with them yet, but I may think about switching.  Although, I would get charged $60 to cancel my other two policies.  I asked the lady if that was their way of kicking a customer in the butt on the way out and she said "well, no".

What a joke!
