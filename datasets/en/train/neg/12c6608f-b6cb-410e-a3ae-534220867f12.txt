This place sucks ass.  Went there on Sunday night to watch game and eat sushi.  Place wasn't busy yet it took the hostess about 10 mins to acknowledge us.  I said we would like to sit at bar and watch game.  She pointed and said you have to go sit at outside bar.  Wtf?

We walk out, sit down and ignored again by staff.  After waiting for another 10 mins we walked across to pizza place and were actually treated like an appreciated customer.

Lost my business for good.
