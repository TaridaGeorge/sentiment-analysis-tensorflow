Whata... terrible burger place.
Sure, the soda was good, but the fries were the blandest I've tasted in years, the buns were dry, the burgers tasted like they'd been frozen more than once and were just mildly above air temperature (96 today.)
It was also quite a wait. The fries were very hot, so the combination suggests it was a fresh batch. Maybe somebody needs to learn how to time a meal: If fries take 6 minutes to fry, and a burger takes 3 minutes to microwave, don't start them at the same time.
