Their selection is pretty good, their staff are incompetent, lazy and inattentive.  A friend and I went on a Friday afternoon, the place was quiet, but it took five minutes for the bartender to take our order, another minutes for her to tell us that the tap was blown, another five to come take our new order and another ten, with the manager yelling at her to take our order, to give us the completely wrong beer.  We ordered imperial stouts- we were given IPAs.  The whole time we were waiting, three other staff were standing around in various states of total worthless idleness.  This place is pretty much the worst.  Go to Taste of Tops if you like craft beer and save yourself the trouble.
