Ok we had a run in with this place today. My buddy loves it and swears it is the best pizza around. I'd had it once and thought it was ok at best, definitely not the best in town like new times says. 

Tried to order today for football... they do not deliver until 3 on sundays?! WTF! They HAVE to be Mormons, with the limited Sunday hours. We ended up getting Domino's yuck.
