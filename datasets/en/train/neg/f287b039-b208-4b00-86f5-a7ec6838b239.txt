Sub par experience. My wife and I took our daughter for dinner at that place. I ordered seared Ahi Tuna which was over seared and my wife ordered another something else  the fish looked like it was in a Roman Colosseum and lost most of it's body.... Because my daughter asked me not to create a scene I let it slide and said nothing. I will never go there again. What I don't understand is what kind of servers they have there that were willing to serve their guests with such a mutilated fish. 

Not recommended.
