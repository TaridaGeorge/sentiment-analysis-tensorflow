I'm not even giving this place one star it's THAT bad. No matter how good a deal you think you are getting, RUN from this disgusting place. The room smells like cat pee and they don't bother to clean it up and just let the disgusting, unsanitary conditions persist. If you complain they shrug their shoulders at you. They lie about changing the sheets - so you sleep on dirty sheets. I'd rather stay at the Bates motel!
