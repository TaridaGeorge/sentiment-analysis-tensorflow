Ok...So here's the deal. You know a place is bad when I feel compelled to share my bad experience with the world.  I feel horrible doing this, but I mean come on! Not only was the food some of the worst I've ever had (and I have had really bad food).  But what got me more then the horrible food, was the service.  I sat outside for 15 minutes before I went in to get someone, Than It took another 10 for her to come out.  All the while I had a server that was sitting down talking to a table.  The food was cold, service was slow, and it was not worth the money.  I vow to never go there again! There are so many other great places at Tempe Market Place.
