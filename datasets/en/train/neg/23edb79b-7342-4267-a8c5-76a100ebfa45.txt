Unbelievable! How this place stays in business is anybody's guess. The cookies are flat as a pancake have no flavor. I've seen pancakes that were more dense than these cookies! Where is the pure vanilla extract? Where is the flavor? Where is the butter? The dough base reminds me of the cookie dough you buy from people at work to help send their kids on a field trip. You don't really want to but it but you do anyway. I bake cookies for nieces and nephews so I know what they should look and taste like. You would do well to change your recipe-and soon. College kids may not care what their cookies taste/look like, but I do. Never again! To their credit though, the ice cream sandwich idea is a unique one. Now just give us cookies worthy of all that creamy goodness!
