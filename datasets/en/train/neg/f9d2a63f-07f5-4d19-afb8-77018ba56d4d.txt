Come on now, let's call a turd a turd on this one.. Waterfront is a stretch, its a canal, a stinking fucking canal.. leave it to the Scottsdale developers and planners to put a Scottsdalian slant on the turd.. kudo's to them! However, with its chain stores and restaurants on one side and pretty lame so far on the other (Southbridge) this has become quite a giant and over priced turd. 

Those skinny Scottsdale bitches that hang out at Pink Taco, words of advice.. Fucking eat something!
