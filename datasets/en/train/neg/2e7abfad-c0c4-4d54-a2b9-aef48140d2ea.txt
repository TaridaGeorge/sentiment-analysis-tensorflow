Being a Dairy Queen fan for many years, I was surprised by the "less-than-pleasant" service received at this Dairy Queen, not once, but twice.  I was even more shocked to find out that the ill-mannered employee was that of the female owner.  She should pass her Dairy Queen crown down to someone who actually likes people!  This type of person should definitely NOT be in the service industry.  PLEASE PASS ON THIS DAIRY QUEEN!!
