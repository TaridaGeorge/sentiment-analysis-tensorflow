WOW.  So Im out with friends eating dinner right next to this place and we decided to stop in for yogurt.  As we pulled up to the place at 9:55 (they close at 10) The had the "Open" sign turned off.  So I said to my friend "They looked closed"  The girl at the store named Megan,  says very loudly "That's right a@*holes we're closed" and then she mumbles "Who pulls up to a yogurt shop right at closing time". As we stood there in disbelief her friends inside starting shooing us away.  We couldn't believe that just happened.  Especially seeing how we visit this place frequently because we live right across the street.  If I was the owner that girl would not work another day in that store.  Unbelievable.
