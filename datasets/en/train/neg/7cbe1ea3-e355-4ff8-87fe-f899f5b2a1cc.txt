I went in to see Dr. Kahn as an emergency appointment.  It felt like I had a stick in my eye.  When he came in, he spent 2 minutes looking in my eye and said I had pink eye.  I took the eye drops, but two weeks later, the feeling of the "stick" in my eye never went away.  I went back in and he informed me that I had something else (that was a scare on my eye) and that my vision might be affected and not fixable.  I'm not a happy person with him.  Why did he not see this the first time?  I would not go to him if you have an emergency.  If you just want to check your vision, then he's a nice guy.  I'm suffering with blurred vision in one of my eyes, and it is here to stay.
