I had heard so much about how wonderful Tobias is. Decided to switch from dealer service to Tobias. However, my first experience with customer service was such a disappointment! I called for an estimate on work to be done." Chuck" acted disinterested, but took my information. This is a very expensive job, by the way. "Chuck" promised to call me back as soon as he had an answer. Well, he never called back. Messages left were not returned. I won't even consider them now. Horrible first impression. I would suggest Andy Tobias have a talk with "Chuck." It doesn't matter how busy or popular you are now, to IGNORE a potential customer is just not right.
