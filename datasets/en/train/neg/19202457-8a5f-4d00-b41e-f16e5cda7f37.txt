If you are looking for a gym that is more concerned about their reputation then your kid - well sign up!   I had a boy and a girl on their team.  My daughter's confidence was destroyed and it took almost 6 months to rebuild her self-esteem (new coaches have worked hard to turn her around).  My son got burnt out with the intensity of the mens coach (he's 10).  Luckily, both kids are in good spots now.  Don't go here.  There are many other gyms in the valley and yes, the facilities are beautiful but not worth the toll on your kids' psyche.
