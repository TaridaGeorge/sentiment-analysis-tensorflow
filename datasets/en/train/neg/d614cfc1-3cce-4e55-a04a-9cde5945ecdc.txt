We decided to try this place because of the good rating overall on yelp.  When we went in, we realized that we probably should have kept looking for another restaurant.  When you don't see any Asians in a Chinese restaurant on Saturday night, it gives you a pretty good idea as to what kinda food they serve.  Don't get me wrong though. We usually do like Americanized Chinese food.  But this place is not for us.

*Appetizer = mu shu pork with tortilla....the mu shu looked like pile of vegetable and meat scraps
*Main dishes = oily.....too sweet....not a fan
*Atmosphere = full of kids
