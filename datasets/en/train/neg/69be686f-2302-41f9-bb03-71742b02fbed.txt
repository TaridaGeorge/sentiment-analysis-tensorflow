If you get really excited while watching football then I suggest not coming here to watch your favorite team. I came here one Sunday afternoon for some wings, a beer, and my favorite team and ended up getting in trouble for throwing an "fbomb". LAME. I was throwing obscenities within my own table.. but my bad, that's not allowed at a "family place". Note to parents: if you're bringing your child to a sports bar on a Sunday filled with grown men and alcohol, expect the worst. I went to a NNY in Anthem and loved it. People yell and scream (yeah even bad words =X) and no one gets in trouble. That's the way sports are meant to be watched! 

BTW, I know 2 people who got food poisoning from their greasy wings. Enough said.
