I went here on satuday the 19th I went to purchase a lap top and was ready to buy that day. As I was lookin at the different computer the employees we walkin around askin everyone if they needed help everyone but me that is. As all the customers we helped and left I was there for 20 minutes with out even being acknowlaged as the workers stood there having a personal conversation. This blatent dissregard of my presence caused me to leave with out anything. Best buy will no longer have me as a customer and I will buy my electronics else where
