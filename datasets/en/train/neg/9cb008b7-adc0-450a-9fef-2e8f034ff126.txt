I was very dissapointed with jimmy johns. They have a small menu. Then after you order you have to stand by the counter and wait for your order to be called out through the very loud ACDC music playing. I was given my sub without napkins and it was not cut in half. Lastly it was very difficult to eat due to the skinny sub roll and the over stuffing of fixings.
