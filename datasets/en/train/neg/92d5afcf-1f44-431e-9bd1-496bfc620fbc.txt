Came here for a double date once and it was awful. Both the date and the food. Service was slow and inattentive, the food was sub-par, and the sushi was luke-warmish which is just wrong when it comes to raw fish. The place was loud and obnoxious. Way too much like the other crap along Mill Avenue. I tried the neighboring location just up Scottsdale Road and it was definitely much better. If you hate yourself and want to get sick, go here. If not, keep walking.
