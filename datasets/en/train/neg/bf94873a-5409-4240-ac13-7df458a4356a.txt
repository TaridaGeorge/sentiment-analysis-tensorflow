I'm from Seattle and back there we have the Gorge. That place puts this place to shame.  This place has no view, awful layout and a roof?  We sat in seats and everytime we needed to go get a drink it was about a 15 minute wait to get back to our seats because of the line there.  Awful.  The acoustiscs suck to because the sound has no where to go between the roof and cement floors.  I suggest they build something similar to the Gorge up in the red rocks of Sedona or something like that.  Then you can camp out and it really makes the whole experience better.  I don't think I'll be back at this venue again unless it's something like Poison and Crue show where I just had to go.
