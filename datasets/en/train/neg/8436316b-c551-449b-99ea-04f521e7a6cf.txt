The service was slow and the waiter was forgetful though pleasant. But the worst part was that the food was terrible and all the smokers were out that evening. We went out for dinner with the kids and sat outside to get some fresh air. It was 5pm so we figured it was optimal time to go out with the kids. Little did we know we were all going to get asphyxiated from smoke inhalation. We just moved here from out of state and I didn't realize how backwards Arizona is, environmentally speaking. They allow people to smoke at restaurants, they spray pesticides everywhere! No one is concerned about what they are breathing. Anyway the food portion was so tiny and we paid 11.99 for it. I won't go back.
