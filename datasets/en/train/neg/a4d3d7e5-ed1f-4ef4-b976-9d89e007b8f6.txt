Sent my burger back but the second one was still tasteless and dry, devoid of any seasoning (probably frozen) and why do you need five different burgers that differ only based on condiments? 

The fries were inconsistent from lack of frier maintenance. The ice was all melted in the soda machine. The bathroom had a weird hall tree straight out of a bad cowboy movie. The furniture and flooring was seriously ghetto and the windows have so much advertising you couldn't see out, like you're in a hamburger prison.
