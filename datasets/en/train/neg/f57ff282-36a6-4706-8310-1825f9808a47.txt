This was our third time visiting this Smashburger, each time has been a wait, but its new so its to be expected.

Tonight, we waited for 55 minutes to get our meal amongst screaming children and loud teenagers.  When our burgers finally arrived they were cold and dry.

Never again will I eat here, in fact, if I could give this place less than 1 star I would.
