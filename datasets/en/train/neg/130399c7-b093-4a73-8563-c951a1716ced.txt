I would not go to them ever again. We have twin 18 month olds. they missed so many opportunities for candid pictures because they were so concerned with getting the one perfect picture. they also were way behind in appointments which made that window of opportunity with toddlers dwindle quickly because they under-staff and overbook. after an hour we were presented with 6 horrible shots. also their prices are insane. I highly recommend going to Pictureme studios instead. they are better priced and do an amazing job.
