They are horrible, Every month I get my bill I am over charged.  I was doing auto pay monthly but cancled it and last month the charged my credit card but I already sent in payment.  I called them to get my money back and was told that I had a credit balance on my account that would be applied to my next months balance, I told them I wanted my $$ back and they promised a refund check would go out in a week or so but it has been 3 months and no check.
