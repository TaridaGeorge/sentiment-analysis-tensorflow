Stopped in for Happy Hour after reading some positive reviews.

We were really not impressed with the food.   We ordered what the server recommended and it tasted like microwaved frozen food, reminding me of the sort of thing you might get  at a low-budget corporate event.

Excellent service and very pretty space but frankly, the worst food I've eaten at Fashion Square.

I've eaten at their other locations in Vegas and Beverly Hills and I don't remember them being this mediocre, so I'm not sure what the problem is.  It just doesn't make sense to eat here when you've got a half dozen much better options within walking distance.
