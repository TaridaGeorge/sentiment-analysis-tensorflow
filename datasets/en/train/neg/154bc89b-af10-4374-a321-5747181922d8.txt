Walked in first before two other couples came in the door. Apparently they were regulars because when the hostess arrived she knew them by name and greeted them. After telling her we came in first she ignored us anyway and sat the regulars. After we finally got sat we never saw a single soul. She sat us, went back over to the regulars to chat, then dissapeared. We watched as everyone else got their order taken. We were ignored and waited about 20 minutes before getting up and leaving. I'll never go back again because of that. Sorry Nee House. We wanted to like you!
