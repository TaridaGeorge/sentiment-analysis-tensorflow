Bad food and terrible service.  Went here during restaurant week with a large group of friends and everyone was disappointed.  The service was slow and disrespectful and I'm not sure I would have fed my rubber steak to the dog.  I'm not one to go out of my way to write a bad review unless the place really deserves it, and sadly this "steakhouse" certainly does due to the quality of food, price and service. Don't do it, try City Hall.
