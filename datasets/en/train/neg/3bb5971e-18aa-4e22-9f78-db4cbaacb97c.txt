Stay as far away from Desert Schools Federal Credit Union as possible.  When it comes to mortgages, their practices are deceptive and misleading.  The employees at the corporate offices are not helpful, and they refuse to answer questions.  My experience with Desert Schools has been absolutely horrible.
