I asked a tie-dye clad clerk if they carried trash bags and he blinked hard several times as if squeezing out brain nuggets, then looked around and pointed to a trash bin next to the dairy case. 

I shook my head and said, "No, I mean, like, to purchase... for your home, kitchen."

He looked again at the bin and then lifted his hand half way to point to another receptacle a few feet away, stopped then replied, "Well, we have some in the back, but I don't think they're for sale."
