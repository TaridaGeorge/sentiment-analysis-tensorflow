Surprise!  It sucks here!

We needed to get our nails done.  We came in and were seated in about five minutes.  They didn't start on us as soon as we were seated.

Before coming in here my hands were lovely.  I don't have out of control cuticles or even the slightest trace of dry skin.  Yet, the girl made me bleed.  That's pretty much where I stop being nice.  No tip for blood.

I can see the clear coat on top of the color.  It's like in globs and doesn't cover all of the nail.  You can't tell from a distance so it's all good.
