I can't believe that Harkins has their name on this theater. Maybe they forgot about it; it sure seems like they did. The floors are sticky, the chairs feel unstable, the sound is weak, and if you sit too close to the top you can hear the loud reel spinning throughout the entire movie which is really distracting. I do not recommend this theater at all!
