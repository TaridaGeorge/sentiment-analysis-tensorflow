ARRRGGHHHHHHH@#!@!! I have to say in life I try not to hate things. I think everyone will understand when I say I hate flying this airline.

Mixed messages, rude staff, broken seats are all par for the course. I will avoid saving that few bucks on Price line and pay hard coin to be treated line a paying customer instead something that the overworked humanoids behind the desk have to process and deal with during our sometimes long uncomfortable time together.

Ughh I need to take a shower after writing this I feel gross.
