NOooo! Do Not move in this apartment complex! Its Like living in HELL! you can hear the neighbors breathing,the walls r to thin.The manager gives personal info on u to other tenants. And when ever u complain about the excessive music,partying,drunk people trying to open your door. The manager is in denial. Even if 10 tenants complain,she says your the only one shes heard from.. And its like that every night!! The managers Insane! Also the spa is permanently broken. And that's the Good points.
