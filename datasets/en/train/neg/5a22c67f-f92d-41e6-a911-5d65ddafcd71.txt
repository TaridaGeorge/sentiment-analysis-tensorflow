We gave this place 2 chances and both times we had aweful customer service. The waitress was overwhelmed on both occasions, missing items that we ordered. The onion rings, fries, nacho chips were soggy, no crispy outside...the onion ring was so chewy that I couldn't eat it...the nacho chips were soaked in the dip toppings and also soggy.  The waiting time on both occassions was ridiculous...I'm not sure we will ever go back...don't order these items.....it looks like the other reviewers had a good experience but I will not be returning....best wishes...hope your servers will get some help, less tables, more service...
