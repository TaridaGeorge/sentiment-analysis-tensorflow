The resort it self is beautiful. We stayed there this past weekend. 

DOOOO NOTTTT EAT FROM THE MINI BAR!!! I ate a bag of chips late sat night, Sunday morning i felt really sick. I only ate the bag of chips so i went to go look at the experation date. It was almost a yr expired. I checked the other items in the minio bar half of them were expired. 

I called the front desk and they said "you can go to the er but i cant garenty that we will help in any way "
