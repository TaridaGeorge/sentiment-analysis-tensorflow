Is there really no great Thai in Scottsdale?  

After a disappointing visit to Malee's on Main last year, I decided to try Swaddee Thai on this visit to Scottsdale.  The restaurant is casual but clean and decorated nicely, but the service is unfriendly and the food is just OK.  

I ordered veggie spring rolls, which appeared to be raw on the menu but arrived deep fried.  For my entree I ordered a yellow curry chicken.  The curry sauce was thin and watery... not at all like the thicker sauce I'm used to.

It wasn't bad, I just wasn't impressed.
