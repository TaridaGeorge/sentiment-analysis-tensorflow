I have been to this subway a bunch of times, and it seems that they never have fresh veggies.  The lettuce always has some red on it, the tomatoes are slimy, and I'm never sure about the rest of it.  There are other subways in the area, the one on Waddell and Lichtfield being much better.  Whenever I go there, if something doesn't look fresh, they toss it.
