Looks like, at one time, it used to be a very scenic course. However, with greens keepers mowing the grass ( at 2pm ), it was loud & obnoxious. Couldn't tee off nor putt due to their presence on the holes. No beverage cart either. They didn't honor a discount card my boyfriend had purchased. The golf cart had a used score card & the ice chest had dirty melted ice.
