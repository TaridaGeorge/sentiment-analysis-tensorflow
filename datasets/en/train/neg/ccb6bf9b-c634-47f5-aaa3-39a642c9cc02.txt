Resort??? I don't think so. We spent over an hour getting moved from one room to the next, trying to find a halfway decent place to sleep. 

1st room: Strong mildew smell
2nd room: Cigarette Smell (later found out the building used to be a smoking building)
3rd room: Toilet was broken and made intermittent sounds
4th room: Lighter mildew smell

We were so tired by the 4th room that we gave up moving rooms and just decided to call it a night. Each time, they sent someone out with a new key (a 15+ minute process). Then we'd drive to the new room, only to find the next problem and start the wait all over again.

The rooms feel more like a motel than anything else. They have those old-fashioned, motel-style AC units that are ridiculously loud. Don't pay more than $40 for a night in this "resort".
