I went to 4 stadiums this year for spring training and this one was the worst.  Old, no food choices, bad beer selection, poor service they could not handle the crowd the Giants brought you could not buy food and they actually ran out of food.  Also there is no grass and most seats are in the hot sun as there is very little shade and they charge for parking.  Go to any of the other stadiums for a great venue, shade, food choices, good beer etc.  Passing on this one next time.
