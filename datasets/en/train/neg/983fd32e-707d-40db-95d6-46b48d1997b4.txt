Have you ever tried to find a home depot associate to help you? If you have, you know how bad these stores are at customer service. Imagine that, but 100 times more frustrating when dealing this this company over the phone. They do not install the products they sell and deliver, this is something they hide from you until their bad smelling delivery people show up with your products and then they say: "by the way, we don't install this." If Home Depot were upfront about this, there is little chance anyone would purchase from them which is why I imagine they hide this from the customer. Best to go somewhere else.
