Well, I was forced to return here to drop my bike off to be shipped to Ironman Wisconsin through Tribike Transport.  Good, I thought, maybe they'll make it back into my good graces.

Nope.

Sure, I dropped my bike off an hour before the deadline...my fault.  I asked if they could do a quick look over if they have time before it's picked up, and I got a straight up "No, we can't".  Oookkaaaaay.  And then, I got no "Good luck", even though it was obvious I was dropping it off to go to Wisconsin for an IRONMAN!  Geez....it's kinda a big deal, ya know?  Don't they have a triathlon team?  

Then, when I picked it up, I didn't even get a "How did your race go?".  Nothing.  I mean, can't a girl brag a little?

That was your last chance Landis.  Peace.
