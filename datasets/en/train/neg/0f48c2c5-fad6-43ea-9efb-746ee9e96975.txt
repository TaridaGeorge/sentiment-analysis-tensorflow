I had been meaning to try Burger Studio (despite most of the bad yelp reviews) for a while now. I walked in expecting the same level of d√©cor as Scramble or Il Posto next door, it looks nice from the outside. Looks can be very deceiving, and this joint really proves that statement. 

Burger Studio reminded me of the Rocky Point of burgers, faded menus, sticky counter tops, slow service, bathrooms out of order and condiments stacked on tables that looked like they had been sitting in the sun for years (see pics). 

If that wasn't bad enough my veggie burger had freezer burn, and if you advertise Boca burgers don't slip me some generic veggie burger thinking it is the same thing. 

the totts were so overdone they almost broke a tooth. Did I mention they don't sell bottled water? I've had more enjoyable experiences at Burger King.
