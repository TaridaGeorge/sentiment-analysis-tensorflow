I went in here to get my car fixed after it was running with only half the pistons and they couldnt find out what was wrong with it. Took it to a friend who worked on it for an hour and found three things that were contributing to the problem. After handing my car back to me, I found out they hadnt even put the intake back on the car. I dont think they were really interested in finding out what was wrong with my car to begin with. Will not be returning unless in dire straits.
