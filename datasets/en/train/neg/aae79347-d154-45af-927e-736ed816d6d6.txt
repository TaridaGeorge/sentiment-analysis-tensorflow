I left my iPhone here and one of the guys there stole it literally! I went there to collect and they denied it, i sat there from noon till 4pm till that person who served my table arrived and after too much struggle he accepted and gave me my phone. He was lucky I did not hand him to the cops. Never ever go there again, totally untrusted staff.
