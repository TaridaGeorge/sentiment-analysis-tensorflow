When a skeezy bartender tries to slip Cruzan coconut rum into your drink without telling you they don't serve Malibu, it's a big fail in my book. I saw him do it and he wasn't even going to tell me. WTF, dude?

The big ball of fried, breaded appetizer was something I probably made in home ec 20 years ago, and should have never been let out of the kitchen. But alas, serve it they did. 

I went for a mixer and the service was less than good. I guess when you tell a place you're bringing a buttload of people in, they don't prepare. The A/C was miserable, bartenders were overworked and empty drink glasses just don't cut it in my book. 

Will I return? Doubtful. Too many other places that don't try to slip fake Malibu to a guest.
