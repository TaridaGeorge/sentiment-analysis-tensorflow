I would not recommend Grandma's Kitchen to people with young children. It is supposed to be a kid friendly restaurant. I guess just not for children 3 and under. I admit my son's ages 2 and 3 were a little noisy. But I did not appreciate being told to keep my children quite. Grandma also telling my children to use there inside voices. I immediately responded by saying 2 year olds do not understand what an inside voice is and left the restaurant.
