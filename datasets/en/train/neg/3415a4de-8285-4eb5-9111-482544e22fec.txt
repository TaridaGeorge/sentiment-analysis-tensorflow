I never actually went into the spa or received services, but that was only because they jerked us around for two hours and screwed with our appointment due to other clients requesting a longer stay. We made reservations for 1:30 and went to the nearby Starbucks since we were early. 

They called and asked if we could push it to 2pm because of other clients wanting a longer massage, so we said fine- a half hour is okay. 

Then once 2pm was nearing they asked if we could push it back to 3pm because of the same people. Well we said no, because we have other plans for the day and we don't appreciate being jerked around like this and we said goodbye. They're losing money and new clients with this attitude and I will never consider going there ever again if this is how they treat new clients.
